1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,390
   

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,800
   

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,710
   

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,680
   

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,820
   

6
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,120
   

7
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,940
 What? What can you do with our amazing legal system? 

8
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,690
 Isn't the law supposed to catch criminals and protect the innocent? 

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,300
 - Are you ready?
 - Setting, complete. 

10
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,490
 Okay, let's get started. 

11
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,870
 We only get involved as much as we can handle. 

12
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,700
It fits right into our business principles.

13
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,150
If we're stealing, we might as well only steal what they can't report.

14
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,570
Hey, hey, look at this. There's no end to how much I could fill this bag.

15
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,610
Hey, don't just stand there! Come and pack this money. My shoulders are about to give.

16
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,260
 You guys are fearless. 

17
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,700
Seriously!

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,990
What's there to life but to just go for it, you know?

19
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,240
What the hell?

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,430
W-Who are you?

21
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,720
 Me? 

22
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,960
I'm a swindler.

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,890
Aigoo, have you been well?

24
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,500
Aigoo, good day.

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,690
 I have dry skin. 

26
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,010
Lying is my specialty.

27
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,730
I'm from the Prosecutor's Office.

28
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,390
I'm a cop, a cop.

29
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,910
There's no way I would screw it up.

30
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,170
Damn it!

31
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,080
There's no such thing as friends these days.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,280
Hey, Jin Woong, I trust you will handle this.

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,440
- Hey, you bastard! Seriously!
 - Money is your friend.

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,680
Who are you?

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,790
I came to scout someone with talent.

36
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,920
How about it? I'll rescue you from here, so come and work with me.

37
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,770
Bingo, I found it.

38
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,910
 He's rumored to have been scouted by the NIS when he was 20, 

39
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,150
 and he's revered as a genius in this field. 

40
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,160
That's it! I bypassed it all!

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,510
He can't do anything without me.

42
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,470
 My abilities are special. 

43
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,350
-  It's very special.  
- Stop, you bastards!

44
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,400
 That idiot! 

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,940
We should send in a player, too.

46
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,090
Who? Player who?

47
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,670
Gosh, look at how firm this is.

48
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,320
 Hey, you don't trust me? 

49
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,400
 He was a fighter well-known throughout the country. 

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,930
 Supposedly, he has never lost in a one-on-one. 

51
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,340
Bastard, why did you hit him so hard?

52
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,770
- You take care of it. Whatever. 
- What do you mean? You take care of it!

53
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,810
Wait, wait. Who's going to drive?

54
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,620
Hey!

55
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,140
- Hurry up and get in!
 - Hey, get in!

56
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,950
Hurry!

57
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,900
Hey, are you taking it out on me?

58
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,900
A fighter, a swindler, and a hunter have come together in one place.

59
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,220
What an interesting combination.

60
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,640
What is this?

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,310
The bastards you guys have to catch.

62
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,250
They receive all sorts of benefits in prison despite having committed crimes.

63
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,400
No matter how big a fortune they steal, they get released on bail or receive a special pardon

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,960
and live lavishly on that money.

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,330
Your job is to catch and put those shameless bastards behind bars.

66
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,400
In return, we'll keep whatever cash we steal from them, okay?

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,200
What is the name of the newly established team?

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,180
Our team name is...

69
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,730
 Why did you do that? Why did you take the blame for what I did? 

70
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,650
Without you, who will catch those bastards?

71
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,150
What?

72
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,880
Keep at it for a bit longer, Prosecutor Jang In Gyu.

73
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,100
Who says I'm dead, damn it!

74
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,460
Then we're starting over again, right?

75
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,410
All right! Let's get started again altogether.

76
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,490
- Okay?
 - All right! Let's go!

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,270


78
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,450
 Let's start the next round. 

79
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,190
   

80
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,330
 You all remember, right? The target is Joongnan Industries. 

81
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,600
 It's known as an EV company, but it's actually a foreign paper company 
   

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,950
 that is smuggling national treasures overseas. 
   

83
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,420
 Today, we will steal the national treasure they smuggled out, the brass Buddha statue. 

84
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,870
 While I lead away the security to the rooftop, Byeong Min will disarm the access security, 

85
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,550
 and Jin Woong will take the Buddha statue from the vault. 
   

86
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,480
 And Ah Ryeong, come on time. 

87
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,530
 All right, this is worth 30 billion won. 

88
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,310
 Let's do this. 

89
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,950
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

90
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,900
   

91
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,610
Ah Ryeong, when are you arriving?

92
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,370
Three minutes, plus or minus 30 seconds.

93
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,050
Move!

94
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,440
 Hey, buy me some time. I think it'll need a bit longer. 

95
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,010
Damn it.

96
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,680
If you're late, you're making breakfast starting tomorrow.

97
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,290
If I arrive on time, you're making breakfast and cleaning, okay?

98
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,060
Okay, sure.

99
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,630
Aigoo, you all are working so hard.

100
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,630
You guys came all the way up here just because of me.

101
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,790
I'm sorry it turned out like this.

102
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,110
Actually, I wanted to give you a gift. Surprise!

103
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,570
This crazy bastard.

104
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,980
One moment.

105
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,940
Don't move!

106
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,300
Relax. I told you it's a gift. A present! Okay?

107
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,130
Oh, I think this is about 3 billion won.

108
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,380
 You've got one minute left. 

109
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,940
Byeong Min, are you still not done?

110
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,500
There are just 10 seconds left.

111
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,830
That's 300 million won per person in cash.

112
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,600
It's an illegal slush fund from the paper company on the third floor, so they can't even report it.

113
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,230
Gosh, you'll be getting rich for free.

114
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,730
Don't try anything funny. Our men are all coming up here right now.

115
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,600
You're seriously going to turn this down?

116
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,320
 Success! 

117
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,890
I did it, Jin Woong!

118
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,600
Whoa, shit. The goods have been acquired.

119
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,280
 Guys, they got me. 

120
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,730
I knew it. If you're late, I'm leaving you behind.

121
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,920
- I'll show it to you.
 - Don't move.

122
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,520
Don't move, don't move!

123
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,960
See, see, see?

124
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
Isn't this money?

125
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,480
What is this? What is this?

126
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,800
- Money.
 - Money? That's right.

127
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,800
Hey! Get him!

128
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,350
Gosh, this was a new product!

129
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,740
Hey!

130
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,170
Gosh, seriously!

131
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,050
Thirty seconds from now!

132
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,520
This crazy bastard.

133
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,550
Geez, I'm busy enough as it is.

134
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,280
Be careful. Bye.

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,760
Hey, hey, catch me!

136
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,900
Hey, catch me!

137
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,630
What a crazy bastard!

138
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,850
Keep moving, keep moving. We're in the middle of filming.

139
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,830
   

140
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,920
Are you okay?

141
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,380
Oh, yes, yes. I'm all right.

142
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,990
Hey, get up!

143
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,630
Gosh, be gentle!

144
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,000
Where are the other two?

145
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,640
Hey, hurry up!

146
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,090
- Hurry, hurry! 
 - Hurry up!

147
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,140
Hurry! Hurry, hurry!

148
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,790
Go, go, go, go!

149
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,120
We lost them.

150
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,760
Oh, gosh, wait! My knees will go out like this!

151
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,960
Gosh!

152
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,830
Stop it now.

153
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,320
Ah! hey!

154
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,220
Damn it! Move!

155
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,470
 Move! 

156
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,400
Hey, are they gone?

157
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,380
Yeah, I think they're gone.

158
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,060
Gosh, move, move.
    

159
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,950
- Stop breathing into my ear! 
 - When did you wash your hair?

160
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,140
My neck and knees almost broke because of you!

161
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,370
Oh, really?

162
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,320
- Hey, how's knee cartilage soup for dinner? 
- I want tteokbokki.

163
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,860
Hey, I'm actually in pain.

164
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,250
- Should we get knee cartilage boiled or as a soup?
 - Boiled...

165
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,910
I want beef brisket tteokbokki. Let's get that.

166
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,050
Are you seriously talking about food right now?

167
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,750
The thing is, I can't eat knee cartilage (Seolleongtang).

168
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,710
- You can't eat knee cartilage soup?
 - Yeah, the texture is weird and mushy.

169
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,080
- What about beef intestines (Gopchang)?
 - Gopchang? Depends on my condition.

170
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,400
Gopchang, gopchang...

171
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,100
Ah Ryeong, say something to these guys.

172
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,640
Should we get some beef?

173
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,780
- Korean beef!
 - Korean beef.

174
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,500
- Okay.
 - I'm down for Korean beef, too.

175
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,730
Hey, Boss. I'm going to quit.

176
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,610
I'm going to quit, so pull the car out and pull over there.

177
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,420
Hey, pull the car out and pull over there. He says he's quitting.

178
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,100
 Seriously, I'm not joking. I'm quitting. Stop. 

179
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,710
 - Yeah, just quit. Let just us three do it. 
- Stop the car. Hey, I said, stop the car. 

180
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,880
 I'll study computers myself. 

181
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,830
Get out. Get out of the car.

182
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,050
- Hey, I can just do it.
 - I mean, that's not it. I'm not really quitting!

183
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,890
 Hey, wake them up! 

184
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,290
 Drag them away. 

185
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,500
You're awake.

186
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,380
You don't know how much I've suffered because of you.

187
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,340
You all are supposed to be dead,

188
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,980
but our boss has so much affection that he's letting you live.

189
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,010
You see over there?

190
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,790
You should be grateful.

191
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,790
So, listen to me carefully.

192
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,930
If you try to pull something to escape,

193
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:36,410
I'll kill one of your friends for every trick you pull.

194
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,450
But you know, my boss says not to kill all of you.

195
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,090
Letting you guys live...

196
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,860
Just one person! Just shoot one!

197
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,340
Then, nothing will happen to the remaining three.

198
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,380
You bastard!

199
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,420
Let him go.

200
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,590
All right. Take this.

201
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,090
Just kill the most useless one.

202
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,300
That is the most reasonable.

203
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,060
I'll give you 10 seconds.

204
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,700
If you don't decide within that time, you'll all die.

205
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,200
That's right.

206
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,050
Ten,

207
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,660
nine,

208
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,340
eight,

209
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,330
seven,

210
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,150
six,

211
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,970
five,

212
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,870
four,

213
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,840
three,

214
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,020
two,

215
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,840
one!

216
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,760
Boring.

217
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,230
I thought you would be different since you dared try to steal my stuff.

218
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,220
Why is this so hard?

219
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,770
What are you doing, you bastard?

220
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,630
Let go! Let go of me!

221
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,950
Let go! What are you doing, you bastard!

222
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,260
No!

223
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,240
I shouldn't have flipped out at Eonni.

224
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,830
Take this.

225
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,460
It was Ah Ryeong's share. Take it.

226
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,130
You think I came here for something like this?

227
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,150
I don't really care why you came here.

228
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,220
You're quite... exceptionally rude.

229
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,270
Yeah, I tend to be exceptional in most areas.

230
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,300
- Let me in, too. 
- On what?

231
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,920
What you guys are preparing for right now.

232
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,660
What we're preparing for? There's nothing like that.

233
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,200
All of our MBTIs happen to be P's, so we don't plan.

234
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,660
No, that's not even in our vocabulary.

235
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,950
   
   

236
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,120
Just go and live like everyone else.

237
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,060
As an ordinary person.

238
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,590
I knew you would be like this.

239
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,870
I'll see you again.

240
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,990
What do you mean? I don't want to see you again!

241
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,150
Hey, take this with you!

242
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,030
Oh. You're leaving?

243
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,780
Hey!

244
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,940
What did she say?

245
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,810
Well, you know.

246
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,380
Hey, don't you hear something?

247
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,730
Geez, the more I think about it, the more it's pissing me off.

248
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,650
- Yes?
  - I don't think you should just sit back like that. 

249
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,220
What?

250
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,870
Hey, Ha Ri.

251
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,700
What is that?

252
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,070
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

253
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,340
Hey, hey! Run, run!

254
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,010
Hey, hey, what are you doing!

255
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,760
- What is she doing?
 - This is our car!

256
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,780
- Give it back! You're stealing it!
 - Hey, move, move.

257
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,970
Isn't this your expertise?

258
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,990
And that's why you guys are still on the run.

259
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,700
Hey, forget that. Just get out.

260
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,830
- Hurry.
 - No, I don't want to.

261
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,090
Then let us in.

262
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,550
- If I let you in?
 - Then what?

263
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,090
- Then let me be on your team. 
 - No, never. Hurry up—

264
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,600
- We'll let you be on the team! Okay, okay! 
 - Hurry, hurry.

265
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,510
It's not okay!

266
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,880
What do you mean it's okay!

267
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,240
Hey, hey, hurry, hurry!

268
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,240
Hurry, hurry!

269
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,930
How did the police know we were here?

270
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,680
How did they know about this place?

271
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,360
- Because I reported you guys. 
 - Hey, you lunatic!

272
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,900
- You're crazy! 
 - Both the older and younger sister are just...

273
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,200
Hey, I'm sure you already know, but what we do isn't that easy.

274
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,480
There's nothing you can do on the team!

275
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,150
- Hey, stop, stop!
 - There's a grandma!

276
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,310
- She's pretty good at driving. 
- Oh, the grandma is okay.

277
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,830
 Be careful! 

278
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,360
 Please! 

279
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,490
Hey, what is that? Isn't that a car?

280
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,210
Turn around, turn around!

281
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,940
No, no! There's a car!

282
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,070
I said, stop the car! Shit! Stop!

283
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,900
Stop the car!

284
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,520
Ugh, so gross!

285
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,240
Driving skills must run in the family, too.

286
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,710
I won't say I look forward to working with you.

287
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,350
Let's each survive the best we can.

288
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,880
Please, let's go a bit slowly, a bit slowly.

289
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,410
 Everyone, hang tight! 

290
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,170
 The gang who scammed the suspects in the mysterious crime case 

291
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,700
 disappeared without a trace. 

292
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,820
 It appears to be a similar method as the one used in the past by Kang Ha Ri's gang 

293
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,000
 who fled while in transit after their trial. 

294
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,880
 They ransacked the scammers' base 

295
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,790
 and turned over the files to the police station. 

296
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,100
 It became the conclusive evidence for solving the case. 

297
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,650
 The violent incidents and thefts by this gang have been targeting criminals thus far. 

298
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:53,690
 There are many speculations as to what their goal is and why they are helping police investigations. 

299
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,550
 The police say, though they are helping police investigations, 

300
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,950
 they would not be able to avoid legal ramifications. 

301
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,960
 There are warrants for their arrest, and resources have been allocated to finding them. 

302
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,530
 Hello, everyone. The 20th president of the Republic of Korea, 

303
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,960
 Candidate Choi Sang Ho of the Hanguk Party was elected. 

304
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,220
 After two attempts, President-Elect Choi 

305
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,160
 caused a stir by taking advantage of the public's desire for a change of government. 

306
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,780
 Today, it's been exactly one year since President Choi Sang Ho assumed office. 

307
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:27,360
 The bell of hope is ringing to mark the new year of 2023. 
   

308
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,110
 President Choi Sang Ho also released a message to the nation on January 1st for the New Year. 
   

309
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,790
   

310
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:38,680
   

311
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,320
It's the same as an art transaction.

312
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,460
The original art for this character is an NFT, and people buy and sell them.

313
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,780
NFT.

314
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,620
Yeah, people seem to do that a lot these days.

315
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,820
You want to see something interesting?

316
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,760
Is that real money?

317
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,100
The NFT that I bought last time jumped this much in value.

318
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,310
I-I mean, how could that be?

319
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,280
Since I bought it when the value was rock bottom.

320
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,070
Quickly, when it was just starting out.

321
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,800
- Back then, it was also like this—
  - Hello. 

322
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,130
 I sincerely welcome you to our Rabbit Project. 

323
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,550
 I'm Kang Do Yeong, 

324
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,770
 the head of this project and the CEO of Meta Scarlet. 

325
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,330
 Everyone, what is the essence of investment? 

326
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,690
 It's value. 

327
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,810
 The innate value that something holds. 

328
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,820
 Those around the world who have become rich, 

329
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,780
 those investors didn't focus merely on what was immediately visible. 

330
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,490
 They always focused on the distant future. 

331
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:47,070
 That is the difference between becoming rich or poor. 

332
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:53,060
 I believe with all my heart that those of you who are here understand that difference. 

333
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,880
 For those of you who are new to NFTs, all of this may seem foreign and difficult. 

334
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,320
 But do not worry, since you have me. 

335
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,690
 I, Kang Do Yeong, will always be by your side 
   

336
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,790
 for your successful NFT investments. 

337
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,140
   

338
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,040
 This project will be best, larger than last time. 

339
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,760
You can see maximum profit with minimum investment.

340
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,440
 I'm excited. 

341
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,420
 I have very high expectations for this project. 

342
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,730
We can discuss this more at the party.

343
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,290
 Sounds good. 

344
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,420
 I'm putting all my faith in you, Mr. Kang. Only you, you know that, right? 

345
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,020
Yes, of course!

346
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,390
Anyway, I've got to go. See you soon.

347
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,890
 Okay. 

348
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,080
Hey, if there are any bastards who want to see me, just make some excuses

349
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,750
about how the CEO is very busy with things, okay?

350
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,610
Yes, sir.

351
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,090
Man, I'm so damn tired.

352
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,440
Hey. Maybe it's because of the time difference, right?

353
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,920
There's only about two hours in time difference, CEO.

354
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,370
- Hey.
 - Yes?

355
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,060
Only two hours? Only?

356
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:31,430
Only? Only? Only!

357
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,340
Hey, for poor bastards like you, it's only two hours.

358
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:41,640
Do you know how much money goes back and forth for me in two hours, you son of a bitch?

359
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,310
It's because bastards like you don't notice these minute differences

360
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:50,590
that you stay poor all your life, you son of a bitch!

361
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,970
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
 - This son of a bitch.

362
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,070
Be quiet.

363
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,470
Wipe off your blood with this.

364
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,200
Thank you.

365
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,890
Hey, hey, hey! Wake up!

366
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,260
Wake up, wake up! Drinking, drinking!

367
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,810
Hey, everyone, get up, get up!

368
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,600
   

369
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,980
   

370
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,700
Kang Do Yeong?

371
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,000
   

372
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,230
   

373
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,960
The person who was sitting over there told me to give you this.

374
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,710
   

375
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,430
   

376
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,420
   

377
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,460
Gosh! It's so nice!

378
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,860
Funny!

379
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,740
He's so much!

380
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,440
   

381
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,030
   

382
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,670
- Sorry.
 - I'm sorry.

383
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,170
Martini.

384
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,680
Okay.

385
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,470
From where did you follow me?

386
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,360
Was it obvious?

387
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,070
Very.

388
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,230
Then, I succeeded. I did that on purpose.

389
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,850
Are you always that confident?

390
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,500
Yes, because I've never failed.

391
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,300
I may be an exception, though.

392
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,620
Then, show me... why you're so special.

393
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,270
It's you, right?

394
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,080
The person who called me.

395
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,620
 Hey, Ha Ri, we're here! 

396
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,970
 Ha Ri! Ha Ri, we're here. 

397
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,770
- Gosh, I think he's in here. 
- Oppa?

398
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,410
 - Let's listen. Wait, wait, let's listen. 
 - Come on, that's a little much. 

399
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,830
 Hey, I think you're in there. 

400
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,620
I know you're in there!

401
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,160
- What is it?
 - What are you doing?

402
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,690
What? I mean, I'm not feeling that well.

403
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,630
What, are you sick? Did you take medicine?

404
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,330
Yeah, I took medicine. Let's talk tomorrow.

405
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,040
What do you mean talk tomorrow?

406
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,970
- Not feeling well, my foot!
 - Gosh, what, what, what?

407
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,680
Is anyone here?

408
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,870
- Hello?
 - Nobody's in the shoe closet?

409
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,460
Hey, check the sofa. The sofa.

410
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,110
Gosh, the bed here is really nice!

411
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,720
Is anyone here?

412
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,520
- What is this? 
 - What's that?

413
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,700
What? VVIP party invitation?

414
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,140
- Party?
 - Hey.

415
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,100
Did you not open the door for us so you can go to this alone?

416
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,410
What? When's the party? I want to go, too.

417
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,840
You managed to see. I was going to surprise you guys.

418
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,200
I was going to take you guys.

419
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,880
There's only one invite. How can we go with you?

420
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,980
- We can. 
- Are we all going to the party?

421
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,600
Of course!

422
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,910
Party! Woo hoo!

423
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,640
I'm not going to work out that day, then.

424
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,540
I should wear a suit. I brought my winter one. What to do...

425
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,910
Hey, let me check your closet.

426
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,350
Wow, it's nice in here.

427
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,560
 It's a party held at Kang Do Yeong's villa. 

428
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,770
 The estimated damages are about 230 billion won. 

429
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,120
 Why should I? How can I trust you? 

430
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,610
 Do you need to trust me? 

431
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,080
 It's accurate information. I'll see you at the party. 

432
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,590
Hey Beautiful! 
  (Speaking Thai) 

433
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,710
Wow, expensive. Tons of expensive stuff.

434
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,520
You came with your friends.

435
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,010
It wouldn't be polite not to come when I was invited.

436
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,120
Are you seeing anyone?

437
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,650
Are you interested in me?

438
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,580
Not really. You're not really my type.

439
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,650
But am I not handsome enough to overcome your type?

440
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,450
I do like your confidence.

441
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,700
It's not confidence. It's true.

442
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,480
People usually like me.

443
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,140
I'm not all that "usual."

444
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,480
That's good.

445
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,220
I guess there won't be any unnecessary emotions attached to our business.

446
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,800
But if you think you'll have a change of heart, let me know.

447
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,740
I'll give you a chance.

448
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,170
Sure, though, that will never happen.

449
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,020
Don't be so sure.

450
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,580
I think you're the one who seems so sure.

451
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,830
For me, it's all about statistics.

452
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,530
Then I guess I will be an error in your statistics.

453
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,580
Okay.

454
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,910
 All right, shall we get started? 

455
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,470
 Let's find out who this guy Kang Do Yeong is. 

456
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,520
Oh, so pretty.

457
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,440
- Very tall.
 - Yeah.

458
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,290
Oh, thank you, Sue.

459
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,990
You are so beautiful.

460
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,050
Thank you very much.

461
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,140
Thank you, everyone, for being here tonight!

462
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,760
Everyone is shining in this very moment,

463
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,400
and I, Kang Do Yeong, will also join to have a brighter future.

464
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,150
Enjoy tonight!

465
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,980
Cheers!

466
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,790
Have you looked into how you will catch him?

467
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,980
Let me ask you one thing.

468
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,370
It doesn't seem like you want money.

469
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,860
Before I met you, I thought you would be the victim.

470
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,200
So, I thought you were trying to get revenge.

471
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,040
But seeing you today, I don't think that's it.

472
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,480
Why do you think it's not?

473
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,730
Because there's no desire for revenge against Kang Do Yeong in your eyes.

474
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,470
You must also do physiognomy on the side while scamming people.

475
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,390
 Sorry. 

476
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,030
Stay away from here for a bit. I'll call you.

477
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,100
Hey!

478
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,940
That bastard!

479
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,620
What's going on!

480
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,630
Hurry up and stop him!

481
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,220
And you are full of vengeance.

482
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,400
- Who are you? 
- This incredible, Kang Do Yeong.

483
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,590
He has basically turned this neighborhood into Koreatown.

484
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,990
Hurry up and stop him!

485
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,340
Let go! Let go of me!

486
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,330
Was your goal to get caught like this?

487
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,330
- What bullshit are you spewing? 
 - It's not bullshit. I'm trying to save your life.

488
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:47,770
Listen carefully. Head to the night market and blend in with the crowd.

489
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:51,030
I'll let you go on a count of three. Don't hesitate and run immediately.

490
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,040
One, two, three!

491
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Hurry!

492
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,250
Follow him!

493
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,940
Hurry! Go and catch him!

494
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,220
Get him!

495
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,380
Over there. Hurry!

496
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,330
Catch him!

497
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,220
Run after him! Get him!

498
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,000
Stop him!

499
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,340
 Listen carefully. Head to the night market and blend in with the crowd. 

500
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,580
Go, go, go.

501
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,660
- Did you find him? 
 - No, not yet.

502
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,860
Make way. Move.

503
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,020
There! He's up there!

504
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,340
Go and get him!

505
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,170
Hurry!

506
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,550
- Move! 
 - Get him!

507
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,210
Stop him!

508
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,560
Hello.

509
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,580
Use your brain.

510
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,350
- Good work.
 - I knew this would happen.

511
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,450
Are you Conan? Are you Kim Jeon Il?

512
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,730
Why is there an incident wherever you go?

513
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,280
What are you going to do about this bomb?

514
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,040
We should keep it safe so it doesn't explode.

515
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,590
If it explodes, our mission also explodes with it.

516
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,190
Excuse me!

517
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,220
Hey, give me a minute. I'll call you back.

518
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,850
Oh, by chance, are you that guest...

519
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,480
Oh, you were that guest from earlier.

520
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,570
Oh, yes.

521
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:21,890
I was worried that I wouldn't be able to thank you.

522
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,310
Gosh, I was so grateful.

523
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,030
You saved my life.

524
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:30,120
Oh, no, it's all right.

525
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,480
Let me introduce myself. I am—

526
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,300
I know who you are.

527
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,100
You are CEO Kang Do Yeong, right?

528
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,520
- You know me? 
- Of course I do!

529
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,510
I'm Lee Sin Wu, the 18th class of Sewoon High School. A pleasure to meet you.

530
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,650
Wow, we probably went to school around the same time!

531
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,130
Yes, so I heard a lot about you while attending school.

532
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:56,090
You're also very famous for graduating early in 12th grade.

533
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,760
You even know that, too?

534
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,650
I'm a fan of yours, Seonbaenim.

535
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,420
Actually, what I do right now is also similar to what you do, Seonbaenim.

536
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,950
What do you do?

537
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,910
I'm running a scam through a small website.

538
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,380
It's nothing compared to you, Seonbaenim.

539
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,360
Gosh, no, no. That's how I got started at first, too.

540
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,290
Gosh, you're really my hoobaenim, I see.

541
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,720
Thank you.

542
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,240
But what brought you here to this faraway country?

543
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:33,200
I also happen to run a small laundering business in Korea.

544
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:35,860
Yes.

545
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,470
Oh, you're diligent.

546
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,170
It's nothing.

547
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:44,440
But I happened to connect with someone who's running a big laundromat here.

548
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,840
So I came out here, thinking I would do a big business with him.

549
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,970
Oh, someone like that was here, I see.

550
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:58,690
Yes. He happens to quietly handle only VIPs.

551
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:09,740
- Please take care.
 - Yes, yes. You should also get home safely, Hoobaenim.

552
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,470
- Okay.
 - Let's meet again soon.

553
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,880
Yes, Seonbaenim. I'll be going.

554
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,570
- All right.
 - Yes.

555
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,600
- Shall we hug? 
 - Pardon? Oh, yes.

556
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,610
- Sewoon High, fighting!
 - Sewoon High, fighting!

557
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,220
Then, good night. I'll be going.

558
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,470
- All right, good night. 
 - Sure.

559
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,250
Look into who he is.

560
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,120
Yes, understood.

561
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,950
 Da In, Daddy's here. 

562
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,090
 Da In, Daddy's here. 

563
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,050
 Oppa, you're home. 

564
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,360
 Da In. Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo. 

565
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,190
 You're hungry, right? Let's eat. 

566
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,320
 Da In, let's eat! Let's eat. 

567
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,520
 Let's eat! 

568
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,010
 This is your wife's will. 

569
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,170
 It appears your wife suffered losses from an NFT scam. 

570
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,250
 And she was recently diagnosed with depression. 

571
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:42,280
 We'll have to investigate further, 

572
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,130
 but it appears she suffered from immense guilt. 

573
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,990
 I wanted to reduce your load, 

574
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,180
 but I've become a burden instead. 

575
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,040
 I'm sorry, Honey. 

576
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,000
 I'm really sorry. 

577
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:06,650
 Let's work hard and buy a house like that later. 

578
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:10,380
 All right, I'll work even harder. 

579
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,330
Oh, is that food?

580
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,560
Hey, did you sleep well?

581
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,470
The bed was comfy, right?

582
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:03,850
You...

583
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:07,480
Oh man, the sofa was so hard.

584
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,830
- What happened? 
 - What do you mean, what happened?

585
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,150
I told you I would save you.

586
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,400
Let's eat breakfast first.

587
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,130
Gosh, you spread the jam weird!

588
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:21,950
Ha Ri, look, look at the celebrity news.

589
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,740
Hey, where is the meat I bought last time?

590
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,350
What meat? We ate it all already.

591
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,540
I told you I can't do without meat. I'll suffer muscle loss!

592
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,540
- I think you've suffered brain loss. 
- Gosh! Stop it!

593
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,180
What the hell do you guys want?

594
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,780
We're just trying to have a meal together.

595
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,190
What did you say?

596
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:43,900
Don't blow up and ruin your life over some scammer.

597
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,860
You don't even know me!

598
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,310
Your name is Sin Wu Yeong.

599
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:51,010
You were born on June 23rd, 1996, at 2:15 p.m.

600
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:53,700
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram. Hour of the Ram, right?

601
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,330
You joined the 1st Air Brigade in January 2015

602
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,310
and transferred to the 707th Special Missions Group in June.

603
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:02,060
Your military number is 15-530624. And skip, skip.

604
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:06,020
In early September of 2022, your wife Kang Ji Ae got a loan with her art academy as collateral

605
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,410
and invested in NFTs run by Kang Do Yeong.

606
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,510
After the investment fraud, she overdosed on medication and—

607
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:15,040
If you know so much about me, you must know why I'm doing this.

608
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,900
I'll be leaving.

609
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,200
I'm doing this because I know.

610
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,270
Whether you believe me or not is your choice.

611
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,050
But I'm doing this because I know it.

612
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:41,360
Smile with your child and eat good food.

613
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,220
 Go back to your ordinary everyday life like that. 

614
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,600
That's what you need to do.

615
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,820
After he gathers a bunch of investors regarding a new project he's starting,

616
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,910
he suddenly cancels the project for some ridiculous reason.

617
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,980
Of course, he doesn't return a single penny despite the project canceling.

618
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,880
This is a method in this field called rug-pull that Kang Do Yeong uses.

619
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,600
Rug-pull? 
    

620
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,240
So, to put this easily, it's basically a dine-and-dash. 
    

621
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,350
Eating and then running away, you moron.

622
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,950
People actually fall for this?

623
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,820
You wonder how many people would actually fall for something like this,

624
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,490
but over 1,200 victims fell for Kang Do Yeong this time.

625
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,840
 Oh, no. 

626
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,510
 Why... what happened? 

627
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,440
 What do we do! 

628
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,470
 - My money! 
 - What are you going to do! Do you know how I got that money? 

629
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,810
 I didn't know this would happen. 

630
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,500
 If you didn't know, you shouldn't have... 

631
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,080
And among them are victims who ended their lives like that guy's wife.

632
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,090
The total losses amount to about 230 billion won.

633
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:51,620
That's the money we will be stealing from Kang Do Yeong.

634
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:55,190
He keeps all that money in his electronic wallet as cryptocurrency.

635
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,510
That's why he's looking for a way to launder it.

636
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:58,980
 His name is Lee Sin Wu. 

637
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,080
According to our company's information team,

638
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,060
he's well known in the money laundering field.
    

639
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:10,390
And he's quite resourceful, and he has never been caught by the legal system.

640
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,570
So, he has done it without knowing the taste of prison.

641
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,120
Yes.

642
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,960
He's good.

643
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,490
What do you think? Do I look like a laundering expert?

644
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,050
You look like my neighborhood laundromat owner.

645
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,600
- Pretty witty.
 - Ah, my eyes.

646
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,420
- Watch your mouth. 
- Gosh, look at that face.

647
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,490
Hey, you definitely look like a scammer.

648
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:43,850
If you're jealous, just say so.

649
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,680
Talk about brutal.

650
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,480
- Should I put this on?
  - Geez! 

651
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,010
Be careful.

652
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,330
What?

653
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,340
Are you nervous?

654
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:18,040
No, why would I get nervous?

655
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,610
Let's go.

656
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,030
Smile.

657
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,580
Hello.

658
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:50,730
How are you?

659
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,110
I-It's hot, right?

660
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:21,050
Aigoo, aigoo. Aigoo, you would come to such a crappy place.

661
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,490
- Did you experience any discomfort coming here? 
 - Oh, no.

662
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,980
This is Nason Jang, as I mentioned.

663
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,570
I'm Nason Jang.

664
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:33,070
Maybe it's because you do such a clean business. You look quite neat.

665
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,060
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

666
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,830
Shall we sit down and talk?

667
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,730
Let's go.

668
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:41,730
Take the call.

669
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:45,040
- It's a video call. Is that okay with you?
 - Sure, a video call. It's fine.

670
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,820
Nason gets business day and night. Please do understand.

671
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,970
Aigoo, Chairman Kim Wu Seong.

672
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,390
What can I do for you at this hour?

673
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,930
Oh, Nason, the thing is...

674
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:06,770
 My grandson caused some trouble. 

675
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,520
 It looks like he'll need to stay abroad for some time. 

676
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:14,540
So, I need your help.

677
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:18,080
Then, should I send him through one cycle like last time?

678
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,980
 Yeah, I think that will be good. 

679
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,360
 Please do that for me. 

680
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,040
-  I'll pay you more than last time. 
 - Is that Chairman Kim Wu Seong of Sanhwa Group?

681
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,560
- Oh, no need for that.
 - Yes.

682
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:30,080
It is the Sanhwa Group that's ranked third in the financial world.

683
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,290
 I feel much better, thanks to you, Nason Jang. 

684
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,290
This is nothing.

685
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,530
 Chairman, don't worry about a thing and rest easy. 

686
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:41,050
All right, okay, okay. Goodbye.

687
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:43,650
All right, thank you, yes.

688
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,700
Geez.

689
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,030
- My apologies.
 - If you're done, come this way.

690
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:52,510
- Let's go.
 - Wow.

691
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:57,940
Gosh, Sanhwa Group, Sanhwa Group, Sanhwa Group.

692
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,360
Sanhwa Group! Wow!

693
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,210
Someone that even chaebols would use!

694
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:08,900
I should have recognized who you were sooner, Mr. Nason!

695
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,710
Thank you, CEO.

696
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,790
If you want, we can take you to the next step.

697
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:17,760
We can get you citizenship in St. Kitchens-Evies or Vanuatu,

698
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,570
so you can use the money you laundered right away.

699
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:26,120
For someone like you, time is money.

700
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:32,790
Seriously, I'm so touched that I'm about to cry!

701
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,900
Hoobae, I'll never forget what you've done for me.

702
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,140
Gosh, it's nothing.

703
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,890
Aigoo.

704
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,270
But CEO.

705
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,680
I'm thinking about wrapping up such minor jobs

706
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,280
and running a major NFT business like you, CEO Kang.

707
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,690
- Oh really?
 - Yes.

708
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:58,610
We've already started preparations for it.

709
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:02,350
And Mr. Nason happens to be an NFT minting expert.

710
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:06,030
Oh, you've got many talents, I see. 
    

711
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,620
Thank you.

712
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,380
Since we're on the topic, how about we show the CEO?

713
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,720
Since actual players in the field may have another level of discernment.

714
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,240
Oh, sounds good.

715
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,760
Then, let's take a look. Taking a look isn't anything difficult.

716
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:23,680
Then I'll connect directly to your e-wallet right now, CEO.

717
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,140
Please take a look for us since we lack discernment.

718
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,770
Okay, I sent it to you.

719
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:35,650
   

720
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,500
   

721
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,650
Whoa, this is nice.

722
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:48,400
With this quality, you can get people to fall for it if you just say the right things.

723
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,940
Whoa.

724
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,100
But you know how that's the difficult part.

725
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,000
That's why someone like you is amazing, CEO.

726
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,980
It almost sounds like you want me to do this together.

727
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,740
If you would do that, we would be so grateful! Isn't that right, Nason?

728
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,150
No doubt about it! Of course!

729
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,970
We'll give you half of our profit. Fifty percent!

730
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:12,990
Half?

731
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,920
Half, you say?

732
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,840
50/50.

733
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,750
Half?

734
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:35,440
Half!

735
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,150
Half!

736
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,420
Shit...

737
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,530
Hey, you sons of bitches!

738
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:51,260
Come over here, damn it.

739
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:56,400
Gosh, these sons of bitches are trying to scam a scammer.

740
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,430
CEO, i-is there some kind of problem—

741
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:02,640
- Shut up, you bastards. 
- On your knees. Come on.

742
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,070
Get down!

743
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:08,940
Don't you think I know you will try to steal my money if I rush to hop on board?

744
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:14,870
Gosh, I came to do some laundering, and I'm dealing with shit water instead.

745
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,690
Hey, CEO, I think there has been some kind of misunderstanding. Please calm down—

746
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,170
What misunderstanding!

747
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,930
Did I misunderstand?

748
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,810
No, there's no way.

749
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,540
What did I tell you?

750
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,880
I told you they're all scammers.

751
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,980
Right, Kang Ha Ri?

752
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:29,150
   

753
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:41,950


754
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,000
 Stay away from here for a bit. I'll call you. 

755
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:57,090
   

756
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,000
♫  Almost frantically. Going mad  ♫

757
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,720
♫  Shocked me again  ♫

758
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:09,930
♫  I stagger, I can kind of see it now. I tricked you, fell in again  ♫

759
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,330
♫  Respected like a giant  ♫

760
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:19,070
♫  Blood is flowing fast  ♫

761
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:24,600
♫  When you find the perfect next move. In that happy moment  ♫

762
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,740
 Who are you? 

763
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,940
 I came to rip you off. 

764
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:32,570
 Those punks are famous for backstabbing their business partners. 

765
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,220
 Was I just bait to you? 

766
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,960
 Be generous with the price. 

767
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,400
 Hey, what took you so long? Shit. 

768
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,830
 We've got a clear target now. We should start working. 

769
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:45,050
 Stop it! If you kill him like this, what will you have left? 

770
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:46,580
 Isn't what you want, revenge? 

771
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,270
 At least he'll go to hell after death. 

772
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:55,100
♫  I stagger, I can kind of see it now. I tricked you, fell in again  ♫

773
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,620
♫  I can't help but be surprised  ♫
