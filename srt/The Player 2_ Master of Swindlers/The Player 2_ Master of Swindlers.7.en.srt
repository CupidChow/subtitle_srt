1
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:46,822
I had a hunch someone important was here.

2
00:00:47,652 --> 00:00:49,422
But little did I know it'd be you, President.

3
00:00:49,752 --> 00:00:51,822
Why would you need someone like me?

4
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:52,862
To defeat evil,

5
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:54,892
you must use evil.

6
00:00:55,362 --> 00:00:57,392
That's why I'm asking you...

7
00:00:57,963 --> 00:01:00,903
to replace me and become a player on my behalf.

8
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:03,272
(Previously)

9
00:01:04,072 --> 00:01:05,272
The assailant, Min Won Jun,

10
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,303
is the firstborn son of WQ Group.

11
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:08,503
He got off on probation?

12
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:11,543
A fixer for the VVIPs of Korea.

13
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:12,712
That's Director Baek.

14
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:14,013
It's the work of Damien Lee,

15
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:16,183
a rising star that the whole world is watching.

16
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:18,113
We have 350,000 dollars. Sold.

17
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:19,553
Mr. Damien Lee?

18
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:21,183
I'll use this to infiltrate our enemy's camp.

19
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:23,022
Gosh. Just like the Trojan horse.

20
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:24,623
- Bingo. - File an insurance claim...

21
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:25,793
for an industrial accident.

22
00:01:25,893 --> 00:01:28,522
It's the ledger. The bribe ledger.

23
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,962
- I don't know anything about this. - Mission complete.

24
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:32,403
Gosh.

25
00:01:33,232 --> 00:01:34,263
I won.

26
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:35,903
Han who was also known as the Villa King...

27
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:38,073
for owning hundreds of villas such as low-rise apartments...

28
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:39,402
- was found dead. - The Villa Kings...

29
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:40,643
in different neighborhoods...

30
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:42,143
are mysteriously found dead one after another.

31
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,813
Mr. Myeong?

32
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:46,042
Mr. Myeong. Has anyone heard the name?

33
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:48,113
The invisible hand of the real estate world.

34
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:51,012
It's so dirty it's black. So it's invisible.

35
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:55,593
Mr. Myeong doesn't officially exist.

36
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:57,423
In order to find Mr. Myeong,

37
00:01:57,593 --> 00:01:59,693
we set something up here first.

38
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:01,093
Hey, Ms. Im.

39
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:02,292
Mr. Kim.

40
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:04,792
He wants to see what we're working on right now?

41
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,962
He insisted I see it for myself.

42
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,033
- All of you, stop! - We got caught.

43
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:13,072
Mr. Myeong said to send you off with your limbs intact.

44
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:15,173
Don't ever show your faces in this world again.

45
00:02:15,473 --> 00:02:17,343
If you don't want to trust someone, you're bound to doubt even more.

46
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:19,242
You end up trusting as much as you doubt.

47
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:22,313
Mr. Newbie. It's your turn to play your part.

48
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:23,953
Those little punks.

49
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:25,852
You're under arrest for leasing fraud.

50
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:27,983
Even prosecutors come to arrest these guys in person.

51
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:30,253
I guess we've found an opponent who's worthy of our attention.

52
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:33,423
Thanks to you, he'll think we're trustworthy.

53
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:34,992
I'm sure he'll contact us again soon.

54
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:38,462
Mr. Choi. Make another appointment with Mr. Kim.

55
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:40,733
Does Mr. Myeong want to see me now?

56
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:45,673
I think this is the moment I must make a business decision.

57
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:47,573
Should I...

58
00:02:49,742 --> 00:02:50,972
play along with your story...

59
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:52,983
or not?

60
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,113
Mr. Myeong.

61
00:02:57,282 --> 00:02:58,383
We should greet each other.

62
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:04,592
Nice to meet you.

Mr. Jang.

65
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:19,402
Out of the punks who are on the ground here,

66
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,972
none of them will be walking around as usual.

67
00:03:22,742 --> 00:03:25,613
All right. This one will take eight weeks to heal.

68
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:27,712
And...

69
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:31,282
This one will take ten weeks to heal.

70
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:32,722
As for this one...

71
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:35,692
One month! Two months!

72
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:37,252
Three months!

73
00:03:37,722 --> 00:03:39,722
Yes! Come on!

74
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:42,263
Hey, come here.

75
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,133
Come here, darn it.

76
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:46,002
Attention.

77
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:47,363
- Pardon? - Attention.

78
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:49,233
At ease.

79
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:51,402
Attention. Give me that.

80
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:53,772
Give it here, you punk.

81
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:56,613
So, this is called a tranquilizer gun...

82
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:57,643
- Right. - It's...

83
00:03:58,013 --> 00:03:59,883
But how do you shoot this...

84
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:05,983
I was going to explain...

85
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:08,953
- Hey, I'm sorry. Darn it. - I was going to...

Hey, Ha Ri.

88
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:20,432
Don't you think it's time to explain now?

89
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,002
From now on, I'll talk directly to Mr. Myeong.

90
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,383
You're a worrying type, aren't you?

91
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:38,083
That's how you were able to remain unidentified up until now.

92
00:04:39,553 --> 00:04:40,682
But this time,

93
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:43,252
your tendency to worry got the best of you.

94
00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:47,622
You indeed saw us getting arrested.

95
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,092
But you hadn't seen the real tenant.

96
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:52,432
Of course, you were worried.

97
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:54,363
Utterly worried.

98
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:59,502

109
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:37,512
the tail in your hand will come with sticky paint...

110
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:39,843
you won't be able to get rid of.

111

Will you buy off the players?

When you clean out the security deposits from an area,

00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:02,342
There's no need to develop another city in Suseong.

170
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:04,942
I checked it out myself. Gosh.

171
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,513
So Ms. Seon has been feeding you intel. Right?

172
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:13,123
She probably figured out by now.

173
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:15,623
(Ms. Seon)

174
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:20,192
Hey.

175
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:22,763
Mr. Choi. The rumor about Dongseong City was the decoy.

176
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:24,362
This plan is actually going down in Suseong City.

177
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,633
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

178
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:33,102
Keep talking.

179
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:37,243
It seems you don't believe what I'm telling you.

180
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:40,082
We could have talked about this in the office if this was all.

181
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,812
What a wasted trip this is.

182
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,112
I'll show you something interesting.

183
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:11,942
It's 20 million dollars.

184
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:15,812
Why are you showing me the money?

185
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,212
I'm on my way to an auction.

186
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,023
There's a good number of old low-rise apartments...

187
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:22,793
where the new city will be developed.

188
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,623
Those apartments will be auctioned off.

189
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:31,133
All of them together would cost about 50 million dollars.

190
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:35,232
I don't have much time left until the auction.

191
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:38,702
The broker and the rest of the bidders...

192
00:11:38,702 --> 00:11:40,442
are on the same page.

193
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:44,112
So once we hand off the money to the broker, it's over?

194
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:45,942
Yes.

195
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:48,143
I promised 50 million dollars to the broker.

196
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:50,182
I have 20 million dollars.

197
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:53,682
So you're short 30 million dollars.

198
00:11:53,952 --> 00:11:55,182
You'll get a call soon.

199
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:57,692
You just do what he says.

200
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:01,293
You can keep all of the money, of course.

201
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:04,062
How?

202
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:07,232
I know exactly where Mr. Kim is headed.

203
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:09,732
Here's my plan. If my car were to have a flat tire,

204
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:11,403
and I were to be stuck on the road,

205
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:13,842
the broker would be so angry and go berserk, right?

206
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:15,743
Because I broke the promise.

207
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:17,342
That's when...

208
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:19,842
you show up with 50 million dollars.

209
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:30,852
What's going on?

210
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:32,822
What?

211
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:35,023
You're Mr. Kim's right-hand woman.

212
00:12:36,062 --> 00:12:38,432
Just like you said, let's say I'm his right-hand woman.

213
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:41,663
Then how much do you think I'll get as my cut from this con?

214
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,803
After deducting fees here and there,

215
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:45,373
I might get only one percent of the profit.

216
00:12:57,553 --> 00:12:59,153
With 50 million dollars,

217
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:01,883
You can make hundreds of millions of dollars!

218
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:06,263
I only want ten percent. That's all.

219
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:08,192
The broker must be expecting Mr. Kim.

220
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:10,062
What if the broker says no? What's your plan?

221
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:11,993
Is there a name tag on the money?

222
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:14,602
Who cares whose money it is?

223
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:16,102
Bringing the money is the only requirement.

224
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:24,972
Great.

225
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:28,612
Then should we get going?

226
00:13:30,682 --> 00:13:31,682
Not yet.

227
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:41,822
(Mr. Myeong)

228
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:44,962
Yes, Mr. Myeong.

229
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:48,003
Yes.

230
00:13:52,273 --> 00:13:53,472
I got it.

231
00:13:57,842 --> 00:14:00,543
We have to make a stop. I must bring something for him.

232
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:07,883
Okay. Sure.

233
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:19,263
Really?

234
00:14:20,202 --> 00:14:21,663
Ha Ri really did that?

235
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:24,903
I'm sure he had a good reason for it.

236
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,842
He ruined my life.

237
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:31,643
Are you saying...

238
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:33,712
I deserved that?

239
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:38,053
Kang Ha Ri.

240
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:40,822
You really crossed the line this time.

241
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:48,663
Yes, Prosecutor Kwak.

242
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:51,932
Many of the victims of Kang Ha Ri's real estate fraud...

243
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,602
officially requested an investigation.

244
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:56,903
- Many? - Yes, 30 victims.

245
00:14:57,232 --> 00:14:58,503
The total amount they lost is over ten million dollars.

246
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:21,103
Hiding money in trash.

247
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,743
What a classic idea.

248
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:26,243
Give me a hand.

249
00:15:27,172 --> 00:15:28,312
There's a lot to move.

250
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,583
Okay.

251
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:37,882
Stop right there.

252
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:43,323
Slowly raise your hands behind your head.

253
00:15:57,503 --> 00:15:59,843
- What are you doing? - Get on your knees.

254
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,243
- Mr. Choi. - Get on your knees right now.

255
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,113
Gosh.

256
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,733
That was a really good plan.

257
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,243
Mr. Myeong?

258
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,642
You're younger than I thought.

259
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:42,683
How did you figure it out?

260
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,522
How should I put it?

261
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:49,963
Because I would've done...

262
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:52,262
the same as you.

263
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:56,133
A player's first basic principle.

264
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,102
Everything happens for a reason.

265
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:03,072
If you suddenly get lucky,

266
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:04,973
it's one of two things.

267
00:17:05,503 --> 00:17:07,312
A con or a lie.

268
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,643
I don't know if this gives you consolation,

269
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:11,213
but I almost believed you.

270
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:15,953
If you were careful with one thing, I really would've believed you.

271
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:17,782
Really?

272
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:23,062
Okay. What is the thing I should've been careful with?

273
00:17:24,522 --> 00:17:26,362
Your conditions were too good.

274
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:28,262
I see.

275
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:32,903
If you had been more careful with that detail,

276
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:35,372
tens of millions of my money would be gone by now.

277
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,203
Fine.

278
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:39,772
You took 20 million dollars.

279
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:42,112
Think of it as a lesson fee and let us go.

280
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:46,243
A lesson fee... I don't know.

281
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,153
I thought about it,

282
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,522
but you're not the kind of person who would work under me.

283
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:56,292
You will put a knife to my neck someday.

284
00:17:57,592 --> 00:17:58,963
No, not at all.

285
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:00,832
A player's second basic principle.

286
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:02,792
The most important thing is money.

287
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,062
I really hate wasting time...

288
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,903
on something emotional like revenge.

289
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:08,572
Okay.

290
00:18:09,032 --> 00:18:10,643
A player's third basic principle.

291
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:15,143
There are no such things as basic principles.

292
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:17,713
It's a scam.

293
00:18:23,723 --> 00:18:25,082
Do you want to know something funny?

294
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:27,753
I already knew...

295
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:29,552
that Kim Soo Chan was real.

296
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,792
I was curious...

297
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:36,503
what would happen if I were to put a gun...

298
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:38,862
in Kim Soo Chan's hand.

299
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,572
If things had gone to plan,

300
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:45,602
we would've seen a very fun ending befitting you.

301
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:50,183
A hunter being eaten by his prey.

302
00:18:53,683 --> 00:18:54,713
It's too bad,

303
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:56,753
but what can we do?

304
00:18:57,683 --> 00:19:00,223
Your people were hiding in the indoor fishery.

305
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:04,092
Kim Soo Chan was an idiot who couldn't even play his part.

306
00:19:04,562 --> 00:19:07,362
This is kind of a natural disaster.

307
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:08,792
Something I can't control.

308
00:19:13,272 --> 00:19:14,503
You understand, right?

309
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:16,602
Mr. Myeong.

310
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:18,572
It's not too late.

311
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:20,173
The villa auction is all real.

312
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:21,312
If you go to the auction now...

313
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:23,112
Let's stop there.

314
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:24,743
Take care of him.

315
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:28,052
If you don't go to the auction now, we'll both die.

316
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:30,782
If you just go like this,

317
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:32,822
it'll be the start of a real nightmare. You know that?

318
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:36,923
It takes effort to lie.

319
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:39,693
Mr. Myeong.

320
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:46,703
Let's go, sir.

321
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:53,473
Hey!

322
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:54,473
Arrest them.

323
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:01,312
This will take four weeks to heal!

324
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:07,723
Gosh.

325
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:11,223
Wait, please.

326
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:15,062
You will take...

327
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:18,262
six weeks to heal!

328
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:24,243
Are you okay?

329
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:32,812
Kang Ha Ri!

330
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:36,213
We need to hurry up and catch him...

331
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:43,493
Real people got hurt because of your fake scam.

332
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:44,963
What?

333
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:48,163
The real estate fraud wasn't fake.

334
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:50,703
What do you mean...

335
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:53,772
Kang Ha Ri stole real money from the victims.

336
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:57,203
I'm a victim.

337
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:01,943
I was scammed by that con artist.

338
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,683
Prosecutor Kwak.

339
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:11,223
If you arrest me here...

340
00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:13,122
Did you really scam people as he said?

341
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:16,592
It's not just Mr. Kim Soo Chan.

342
00:21:17,322 --> 00:21:18,663
There are 30 victims,

343
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:20,193
and they lost over ten million dollars.

344
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:22,832
Ha Ri. It's not true, right?

345
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,403
There's a reason for this, right?

346
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:26,802
You bastard.

347
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:29,832
Ha Ri. We don't go after just anyone.

348
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:31,943
Wasn't it our rule...

349
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:33,612
not to mess with innocent people?

350
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:37,243
I'll explain everything later, okay?

351
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:39,213
We can talk later.

352
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:41,483
Choose.

353
00:21:41,913 --> 00:21:43,112
If you arrest me now,

354
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:45,423
you'll never catch Mr. Myeong.

355
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:47,552
Choose.

356
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,233
Okay.

357
00:21:56,062 --> 00:21:57,133
I'll choose.

358
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:00,003
Kang Ha Ri.

359
00:22:00,372 --> 00:22:02,003
You're under arrest for real estate fraud.

360
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:04,003
Take him away.

361
00:22:15,312 --> 00:22:16,383
Hey.

362
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:19,423
- What are you doing? - Hey, Ha Ri.

363
00:22:19,582 --> 00:22:21,122
- Ha Ri. - Don't come close.

364
00:22:21,622 --> 00:22:23,963
This is wrong, Ha Ri!

365
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:26,423
Ha Ri. I don't know what you're thinking, but let's stop here.

366
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:28,133
Don't come near me.

367
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:32,663
Kang Ha Ri.

368
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,302
Kang Ha Ri!

369
00:22:54,092 --> 00:22:56,092
Kang Ha Ri is fleeing on a motorcycle. Go after him.

370
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:02,493
Arrest them all.

371
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:47,072
Prosecutor Kwak.

372
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:49,743
We really had no idea. I swear.

373
00:23:50,213 --> 00:23:52,582
I won't let you guys off this time.

374
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:54,582
Load them up.

375
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:57,022
Jung Soo Min.

376
00:24:04,262 --> 00:24:05,463
I warned you.

377
00:24:06,423 --> 00:24:08,262
I told you Kang Ha Ri was a conman.

378
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:11,163
You trusted him blindly...

379
00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:12,532
and you must pay for it.

380
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:16,072
In front of actual victims who lost their future.

381
00:24:23,943 --> 00:24:25,012
How did it go?

382
00:24:25,243 --> 00:24:26,383
We lost him, sir.

383
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:37,592
Mr. Myeong has fled...

384
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:39,663
and Kang Ha Ri has vanished too.

385
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:48,933
Kang Ha Ri.

386
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:59,743
It's time to put things in order for sure.

387
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,052
Can I take it?

388
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:14,633
You should take it.

389
00:25:18,003 --> 00:25:19,102

390
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:22,532
Who is this?

391
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:24,443
Hello, Prosecutor Kwak.

392
00:25:24,872 --> 00:25:26,572
This is President Choi Sang Ho.

393
00:25:30,683 --> 00:25:32,983
Can you spare me some time?

394
00:25:34,112 --> 00:25:36,012
Yes, Mr. President.

395
00:25:37,383 --> 00:25:40,552
You must be quite flustered and perplexed.

396
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:43,022
Yes. No.

397
00:25:44,592 --> 00:25:45,622
Yes, a bit.

398
00:25:45,822 --> 00:25:48,693
You have a great weight on your shoulders...

399
00:25:48,762 --> 00:25:51,262
and I would like to lessen it.

400
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:54,703
That's why I called knowing you'd be busy.

401
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,473
No, sir. That's fine.

402
00:25:59,102 --> 00:26:02,012
Secretary Jung Soo Min and Kang Ha Ri...

403

How much of this does Mr. President know?

411
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:30,473
He only gave us the task.

412
00:26:30,842 --> 00:26:33,772
The plan and details were all Ha Ri.

413
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:37,542
Are you sacrificing Ha Ri to free yourselves?

414
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:41,352
Mr. Prosecutor.

415
00:26:42,012 --> 00:26:44,282
Would we have mentioned the President if that were the case?

416
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:46,923
You'd never have known if we hadn't told you.

417
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:50,723
Do you think we're still ganging up on you...

418
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:52,262
to dupe you?

419
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:55,693
You've been tagging along for a while.

420
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:56,862
Mr. Prosecutor.

421
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,032
No one's more flustered or angry than us right now.

422
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:02,802
I never thought Ha Ri would dupe us too.

423
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:05,102
To me now,

424
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:07,842
all of you are just the same as Kang Ha Ri.

425

(At villa auction...)

427
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:16,913
So,

428
00:27:17,522 --> 00:27:19,223
is the villa auction for real?

429
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:21,122
Yes.

430
00:27:21,352 --> 00:27:23,092
We set up the con to coincide with it.

431
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:24,822

I think I can spare...

435
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:32,532
Darn it.

436
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,332
What is this for?

437
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,903
- The broker. - Darn it.

From now on,

listen carefully to what I say.

Everything that happens here...

454
00:29:18,743 --> 00:29:20,272
is all true,

Yes.

472

We know next to nothing about them.

473
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:38,723
What's unusual is that unlike other yakuza,

474
00:30:38,723 --> 00:30:40,383
these members wear masks.

475
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:43,963
According to a prosecutor who handled a few of their cases,

476
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:47,792
no one has seen the face of any of the members.

477
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:51,532

If you know next to nothing about them,

481
00:30:58,572 --> 00:31:00,572
where did you get the name "Lee Dong Gil?"

482
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,673
Four years ago, they went head-to-head...

Yes. This is Lee Dong Gil.

Now do you see what happens when you try to...

487
00:31:51,522 --> 00:31:52,923
take what is mine?

488
00:31:54,532 --> 00:31:57,302
One day, the head of that local gang...

489
00:31:57,302 --> 00:31:59,663
and all his minions were murdered.

490
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:02,903
You didn't let someone that dangerous...

491
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:04,842
get away, did you?

492
00:32:05,372 --> 00:32:06,372
We tried to get him,

493
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:08,512
but for some reason the investigation stalled.

494
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:09,673
All we know...

495
00:32:10,443 --> 00:32:13,512
is that Lee Dong Gil has a burn scar on the back of his right hand.

496
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:17,582
Ha Ri. Why on earth did you do this?

497
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:22,622
Because he wouldn't fall for it if he didn't?

498
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:24,993
- What? - Mr. Myeong.

499
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,362
He was suspicious to the end.

500
00:32:28,332 --> 00:32:30,133
He even turned against us.

501
00:32:32,302 --> 00:32:35,802
If we'd sent in actors instead of setting this up in earnest,

502
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:39,542
we'd never have seen Mr. Myeong's face.

503
00:32:40,503 --> 00:32:42,272
We allowed him to watch us,

504
00:32:42,772 --> 00:32:44,713
but he'd been watching us...

505
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,213
for much longer.

506
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:50,852
Ha Ri thought...

507
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:53,352
Mr. Myeong was just like himself.

508
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:56,852
So he set up a con that even he would fall for.

509
00:32:57,963 --> 00:32:59,493
Where he's the only actor...

510
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:02,193
and everything else is real.

511
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:03,792
Oh, gosh.

512
00:33:05,032 --> 00:33:06,433
Even so.

513
00:33:07,473 --> 00:33:09,133
How could he dupe us too?

514
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:14,272
What's this?

515
00:33:18,282 --> 00:33:20,112
There's someone outside the restaurant.

516
00:33:25,282 --> 00:33:26,883
I can't reach either Mr. Jang...

517
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:29,122
or Ms. Seon.

518
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:35,032
(Restricted call)

519
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:43,533
(Restricted call)

520
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:47,073
Yes, hello?

521
00:33:47,772 --> 00:33:50,272
I hear you live off of real estate.

522
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:55,053
Then, you must've heard of the name Lee Dong Gil.

523
00:33:57,722 --> 00:33:59,753
Come to the address I sent you by 9pm.

524
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,492
Let's talk about business.

525
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:08,062
Sir...

526
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:09,693
Who was it?

527
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,503
He says he's Lee Dong Gil.

528
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,272
Lee Dong Gil...

529
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:20,972
Then, shouldn't you return the money?

530
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:24,182
Sir, I can't reach anyone right now.

531
00:34:24,582 --> 00:34:26,242
The victims who were conned were real too.

532
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:29,582
Yesterday, the prosecutors came to arrest them, not save them.

533
00:34:55,312 --> 00:34:56,542
- Let's go inside. - Yes, sir.

534
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:34,682
Mr. Lee Dong Gil?

535
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:36,182
The money?

536
00:35:38,153 --> 00:35:39,323
Mr. Kim's 20 million dollars...

537
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:41,492
and my 30 million dollars are all inside the car.

538
00:35:47,093 --> 00:35:48,162
Who are you, punk?

539
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:50,062
Hey! Who are you, punk?

540
00:35:50,363 --> 00:35:53,062
Who are you? Who do you think you are, punk?

541
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,033
What? You punks.

542
00:35:58,272 --> 00:36:01,372
Because of you, I missed an important auction.

543
00:36:02,142 --> 00:36:03,142
Well...

544
00:36:03,943 --> 00:36:05,412
I'm sure there's a way for you to make it up.

545
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:07,883
There are plenty of ways if you just look for them.

546
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:09,182
However,

547
00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:13,883
that's if you keep your promise.

548
00:36:16,222 --> 00:36:19,022
All right, then. Shall we talk about business?

549
00:36:19,622 --> 00:36:21,133
Yes, let's do that.

550
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:25,562
The leasing fraud that had the whole world in an uproar.

551
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:27,733
I hear that was your doing.

552
00:36:29,073 --> 00:36:31,742
Compared to you, sir, I'm just a small fry.

553
00:36:33,343 --> 00:36:35,513
Right. How about your profit?

554
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:38,082
Tens of millions?

555
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:40,242
I see.

556
00:36:41,513 --> 00:36:42,582
By the way...

557
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:45,153
Your confession has been nicely recorded.

558
00:36:50,522 --> 00:36:53,062
This time, you will never be able to get away with it, Mr. Myeong.

559
00:37:04,673 --> 00:37:05,803
What is this?

560
00:37:06,772 --> 00:37:07,772
Hey.

561
00:37:08,372 --> 00:37:10,372
You committed the same fraud as me.

562
00:37:10,372 --> 00:37:11,613
The losses were ten million dollars!

563
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:14,682
So why are you doing this?

564
00:37:16,352 --> 00:37:17,383
You're right.

565
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:25,662
All of those people were really conned.

566
00:37:26,323 --> 00:37:27,562
And twice, at that.

567
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:31,332
- What? - They were the people...

568
00:37:31,803 --> 00:37:33,702
who were conned by you first, Mr. Myeong.

569
00:37:34,803 --> 00:37:38,142
Conned for real by you once, and fake conned by us another time.

570
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:42,472
Why are you here, Mr. Kim Soo Chan?

571
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:45,283
I have something to tell you.

572
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:59,222
Mr. Kang Ha Ri came to see me.

573
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:03,562
Hey, Soo Chan.

574
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:09,133
I'm here, Min Jung.

575
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:17,542
Mother, you should go and rest.

576
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:18,783
I'll watch her.

577
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:21,283
Then, I'll go and get changed at home.

578
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:22,283
Okay.

579
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:26,682
You should go and rest before coming back.

580
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:28,452
You should think of your own health too.

581
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:49,472
Mr. Kim Soo Chan?

582
00:38:58,122 --> 00:38:59,122
Who are you?

583
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:05,662
All of you...

584
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:09,792
are family members, relatives,

585
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:11,633
and friends...

586
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:13,432
of leasing fraud victims.

587
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:16,633
You are the ones who carried the weight...

588
00:39:17,403 --> 00:39:19,403
of the victims' pain from the closest distance.

589
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:23,113
However, if you help us,

590
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:26,682
I can end that pain.

591
00:39:27,343 --> 00:39:28,553
How do you mean?

592
00:39:32,722 --> 00:39:34,622
By becoming my victims of leasing fraud.

593
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:37,522
Right now.

594
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:39,323
Here you go.

596
00:39:40,392 --> 00:39:41,432

(Kim Soo Chan)

600
00:39:56,613 --> 00:39:59,283
These people became real victims of leasing fraud by Ha Ri...

601
00:39:59,843 --> 00:40:03,682
for their friends, family members, and relatives.

602
00:40:05,622 --> 00:40:06,622
Mr. Myeong.

603
00:40:07,992 --> 00:40:11,463
Why do you think you brought 30 million with your own hands?

604
00:40:13,022 --> 00:40:14,633
No matter how much digging you did on me,

605
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:17,062
everything you saw was real.

Kim Soo Chan.

608
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:24,742
Come to the address I sent you by 9pm.

609
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,142
So, you had no choice but to believe in...

610
00:40:28,272 --> 00:40:29,412
the existence of Lee Dong Gil.

611
00:40:30,412 --> 00:40:31,943
And your 30 million dollars...

612
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:34,013
- will go back to the victims. - Gosh.

613
00:40:34,013 --> 00:40:36,013
What did I tell you?

614
00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:47,093
Did you get rid of Ms. Seon and Mr. Jang too?

615
00:41:01,812 --> 00:41:03,013
There's no need to worry.

616
00:41:03,843 --> 00:41:05,213
The nation will protect you.

617
00:41:06,312 --> 00:41:07,742
This time, it's a package deal.

618
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:13,883
So, do you want to just leave or have some fun first?

619
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:16,392
Sweetie, so...

620
00:41:17,323 --> 00:41:18,923
Aim for the weak spots.

621
00:41:19,863 --> 00:41:21,233
Dodge and punch to the stomach.

622
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:22,463
Do you have health insurance?

623
00:41:23,392 --> 00:41:24,432
- You can do it. - You can do it.

624
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:38,912
Hey, wait up. I'm done having fun.

625
00:41:47,553 --> 00:41:48,693
Everyone, freeze.

626
00:42:00,263 --> 00:42:01,303
Hands in the air!

627
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:13,742
Myeong Ji Ho.

628
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:16,383
You're under arrest for leasing fraud.

629
00:42:17,113 --> 00:42:18,323
You have the right to remain silent...

630
00:42:19,582 --> 00:42:20,622
Just do that.

631
00:42:21,492 --> 00:42:23,392
No matter what you say, it probably won't help you.

632
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:25,062
Take him away.

633
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:46,642
- Thank you. - Thank you.

634
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:48,113
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

635
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:50,153
- Gosh. - Thank you.

636
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:52,383
- Thank you for your hard work. - You worked so hard too.

637
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:54,283
- Thank you. - Thank you.

638
00:42:54,383 --> 00:42:55,392
- Thank you. - Thank you.

(Restricted call)

641
00:43:17,872 --> 00:43:18,883
Yes?

642
00:43:19,283 --> 00:43:21,412
I heard you were in quite a tough situation.

643
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:25,323
I see.

644
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:29,423
You don't have to worry.

645
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:42,772
Gosh.

646
00:43:44,073 --> 00:43:45,242
I can't seem to shake off...

647
00:43:46,503 --> 00:43:47,843
this cold.

648
00:44:54,972 --> 00:44:56,943
Prosecutor Kwak just contacted me.

649
00:45:00,483 --> 00:45:01,582
Mr. Myeong...

650
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:04,213
died while being transported to the prosecutors' office.

651
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:14,022
Prosecutor Kwak must have been quite surprised.

652
00:45:15,693 --> 00:45:17,492
Don't tell me that's all you want to say.

653
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:22,403
If I say he had it coming, does that make me sound evil?

654
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,772
Isn't it more important to find out...

655
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:26,602
who was behind this punishment?

656
00:46:13,122 --> 00:46:14,122
Min Jung.

657
00:46:15,053 --> 00:46:16,522
Min Jung.

658
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:17,553
Ma'am.

659
00:46:17,823 --> 00:46:20,122
Min Jung... She's...

660
00:46:20,522 --> 00:46:22,832
I'll get the doctor!

661
00:46:22,832 --> 00:46:24,233
- Min Jung. - Doctor!

662
00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:26,263
- Min Jung! - Doctor!

663
00:46:26,263 --> 00:46:28,303
Min Jung. It's Mom. Are you awake?

664
00:46:28,503 --> 00:46:30,003
Words are like food.

665
00:46:30,803 --> 00:46:32,872
If they're too fast, they get hot and burn easily.

666
00:46:34,173 --> 00:46:36,372
If they're too slow, they get cold and lose their value.

667
00:46:37,573 --> 00:46:40,213
Isn't it one of your principles or something?

668
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:42,682
Principle number 19? Or 20?

669
00:46:44,852 --> 00:46:46,153
Let me give you a piece of advice.

670
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,352
Don't trust anyone.

671
00:46:49,593 --> 00:46:52,292
Not even me, Mr. Hwang,

672
00:46:55,963 --> 00:46:57,033
or the President.

673
00:46:58,162 --> 00:47:00,133
(Activity Report)

674
00:47:00,363 --> 00:47:01,733
(Worked out for 2 hours without any outside contact)

675
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:03,033
(Had a simple breakfast at the hotel alone)

676
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:04,573
(Talked to the other players with bread)

677
00:47:06,372 --> 00:47:07,642
(Activity Report, Kang Ha Ri)

678
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:10,142
To get what you want,

679
00:47:10,142 --> 00:47:13,082
you will take whatever it takes. So I'm not sure if I should...

680
00:47:14,642 --> 00:47:16,452
accept this advice from a player like you.

681
00:47:19,082 --> 00:47:21,122
But as for your advice about not trusting you,

682
00:47:22,153 --> 00:47:23,423
I will keep that in mind.

683
00:47:26,122 --> 00:47:27,122
(Hideout: Fell asleep on the sofa)

684
00:48:07,315 --> 00:48:09,755
"Get behind me, Satan."

685
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,995
"For you have in mind not the things of the Almighty,"

686
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:15,995
"but the things of men."

687
00:48:16,665 --> 00:48:17,795
Leader Im...

688
00:48:20,435 --> 00:48:21,534
He's a total cult leader.

689
00:48:22,404 --> 00:48:23,864
I was one of the candidates who was...

690
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:25,674
considered for a position in Junneungsun Jinrigyo.

691
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:28,545
After finding out the truth about the church,

692
00:48:28,545 --> 00:48:30,174
it felt like someone smacked my head with a hammer.

693
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,975
A miracle?

694
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:33,614
- Everything was a scam. - How is that possible?

695
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:35,745
How could a blind man regain vision?

696
00:48:35,745 --> 00:48:37,844
How can a man who is paralyzed from the waist down stand up?

697
00:48:38,714 --> 00:48:40,455
I will expose the truth...

698
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:42,725
behind Junneungsun Jinrigyo.

699
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:44,554
Our eternal guidance...

700
00:48:45,054 --> 00:48:47,125
is Junneungsun Jinrigyo. But a man who disgraced our religion...

701
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,225
is here now.

702
00:48:49,395 --> 00:48:51,125
- Get out of here! - Get out!

703
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:52,734
- How dare you? - Leave!

704
00:48:52,734 --> 00:48:54,194
- Go away, you traitor! - Get out of here!

705
00:48:54,194 --> 00:48:56,304
- How dare you disgrace us? - Look at him!

706
00:48:56,304 --> 00:48:58,475
- Leave right now! - How dare you?

707
00:48:58,804 --> 00:49:00,574
- Get out of here. - Go away!

708
00:49:06,315 --> 00:49:07,315
That's right.

709
00:49:08,074 --> 00:49:09,685
He was tricked by the evil force.

710
00:49:09,844 --> 00:49:12,355
This man lied to the entire country.

711
00:49:13,855 --> 00:49:15,525
But he was in a car accident.

712
00:49:15,525 --> 00:49:17,324
So he can't walk anymore.

713
00:49:17,424 --> 00:49:20,225
This is the divine punishment...

714
00:49:20,225 --> 00:49:21,864
for the man who distorted the truth.

715
00:49:21,864 --> 00:49:24,194
- Lord. - Father.

716
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,895
- Father. - Father.

717
00:49:25,895 --> 00:49:26,964
Please.

718
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:30,264
This sinner has come back to me.

719
00:49:30,264 --> 00:49:32,634
And he pleaded with me so desperately...

720
00:49:34,234 --> 00:49:35,645
for forgiveness.

721
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:39,514
I can hear His voice.

722
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:42,384
If a sinner repents of his sins,

723
00:49:42,614 --> 00:49:45,514
it will bring great joy to the messengers of the Almighty.

724
00:49:46,355 --> 00:49:48,984
So He's telling me to forgive the sinner on His behalf.

725
00:49:52,395 --> 00:49:54,455
On behalf of the Almighty,

726
00:49:55,194 --> 00:49:57,464
I will now take back his punishment here.

727
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:11,645
" For this, my son, was dead, and is alive again."

728
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:15,214
"He was lost, and is found."

729
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,114
Your sin will be forgiven now.

730
00:50:20,355 --> 00:50:22,185
Stand up on your feet right now.

731
00:50:25,194 --> 00:50:26,955
I command you under my divine name.

732
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:29,324
Get up on your two feet now...

733
00:50:29,324 --> 00:50:30,525
and dance.

734
00:50:30,964 --> 00:50:32,995
- Amen. - Amen.

735
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:35,605
- Get up now. - Do it.

736
00:50:39,074 --> 00:50:40,105
Stand up.

737
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,245
- Look! He's doing it. - Gosh.

738
00:50:46,245 --> 00:50:48,014
- Can he really stand up? - Did you see that?

739
00:50:48,014 --> 00:50:49,045
Stand up!

740
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:31,384
(Vitamin C)

741
00:51:39,565 --> 00:51:40,594
I can take...

742
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:42,964
all of this money?

743
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:51,275
Of course.

744
00:51:51,505 --> 00:51:54,145
You even danced in front of my followers.

745
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,844
We must settle the payment clearly.

746
00:51:58,344 --> 00:52:00,284
I had no idea that you wanted to look out for me.

747
00:52:01,755 --> 00:52:04,284
- I'm so sorry. - Gosh, don't say that.

748
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:08,455
Remember what I said in front of my followers earlier?

749
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,995
I've forgiven you for everything.

750
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:14,694
The day you came back to me,

751
00:52:15,304 --> 00:52:16,335
you were forgiven...

752
00:52:17,565 --> 00:52:18,734
for everything.

753
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:21,705
From now on,

754
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:22,844
I'll even give up my life...

755
00:52:22,844 --> 00:52:24,245
to do whatever you ask.

756
00:52:24,245 --> 00:52:26,014
Thank you so much.

757
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:32,154
Your reaction was so impressive.

758
00:52:32,955 --> 00:52:35,824
Did you used to act?

759
00:52:36,855 --> 00:52:39,255
Getting up shakily from the wheelchair...

760
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,594
and bursting into tears...

761
00:52:42,795 --> 00:52:43,924
I was so touched.

762
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:45,995
What do you think...

763
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:49,464
about going to make rounds in the countryside?

764
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,605
I'll go anywhere with you,

765
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,775
even to the end of the Earth.

766
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:01,674
Thank you.

767
00:53:02,284 --> 00:53:03,645
I'll be in touch again.

768
00:53:09,054 --> 00:53:11,185
Thank you, sir!

769
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:21,565
(Standard)

770
00:53:37,685 --> 00:53:38,815
Name, Im Sang Sik.

771
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:41,415
He's the head of Junneungsun Jinrigyo.

772
00:53:41,784 --> 00:53:43,784
I've seen him a few times on the news.

773
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:45,395
He's the leader of a cult.

774
00:53:46,194 --> 00:53:48,324
They have over 200,000 followers in Korea alone.

775
00:53:48,594 --> 00:53:50,295
And they've been around for over 20 years.

776
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:52,594
So 200,000 followers over 20 years...

777
00:53:52,835 --> 00:53:54,594
Wait. If they take ten dollars a week from each person,

778
00:53:54,594 --> 00:53:55,734
how much would that be?

779
00:53:56,935 --> 00:53:57,964
Leader Im.

780
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,775
Striking charisma, eloquent speech,

781
00:54:01,134 --> 00:54:03,105
and a mysterious power to read people's feelings.

782
00:54:03,944 --> 00:54:06,375
He started Junneungsun Jinrigyo before he turned 30,

783
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:07,875
and he's come all this way.

784
00:54:08,784 --> 00:54:10,145
Look at that face.

785
00:54:10,284 --> 00:54:11,884
Why do people follow him?

786
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:13,284
What family does he have?

787
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:14,855
He grew up without a father.

788
00:54:14,855 --> 00:54:17,185
Apparently, his mother was a pretty famous shaman.

789
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:20,225
I guess he's using what he learned from his mother.

790
00:54:20,355 --> 00:54:23,424
Before he became a cult leader, he was a successful fighter.

791
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,734
Who are those guys wearing masks?

792
00:54:26,234 --> 00:54:27,565
They're people in the youth group.

793
00:54:27,895 --> 00:54:30,264
In Jinrigyo, they call each other "brothers."

794
00:54:30,464 --> 00:54:32,335
They're Leader Im's closest people.

795
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,775
I saw in news articles...

796
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:35,645
that most of these punks used to be criminals...

797
00:54:35,645 --> 00:54:37,875
and that Leader Im inspired them to repent.

798
00:54:38,444 --> 00:54:40,775
Their resumes are something else.

799
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,585
Robbery, assault,

800
00:54:42,585 --> 00:54:44,645
fraud, arson, etc.

801
00:54:45,214 --> 00:54:47,355
- Gosh. - They're basically a group...

802
00:54:47,614 --> 00:54:49,755
who will do anything for Leader Im.

803
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,395
I get that they're a cult...

804
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:56,364
that entices people with the idea of heaven...

805
00:54:56,364 --> 00:54:57,824
but actually leads people to the fiery pit.

806
00:54:57,824 --> 00:55:00,795
But there are many cults like that in Korea.

807
00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:01,795
Right?

808
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,565
What is so special about this cult...

809
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:05,134
that warrants the President's orders?

810
00:55:06,005 --> 00:55:07,705
They have very strong connections.

811
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:09,804
Connections?

812
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:11,705
Leader Im gave so much money...

813
00:55:11,705 --> 00:55:13,775
to people in the political and legal world.

814
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:19,054
So that gives him a strong shield.

815
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:21,585
Do you know how many times prosecutors searched his premises?

816
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,585
But they couldn't find anything.

817
00:55:24,025 --> 00:55:25,955
As if he knew already and got ready ahead of time.

818
00:55:27,054 --> 00:55:28,995
Nobody can mess with him in a legal way?

819
00:55:33,134 --> 00:55:35,295
I can understand why the President is invested in this.

820
00:55:37,105 --> 00:55:38,105
Byung Min.

821
00:55:41,835 --> 00:55:44,005
This is a website that people who left Jinrigyo...

822
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:46,875
after realizing it was a cult made themselves.

823
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:48,375
Hold on.

824
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,284
Can't we gather testimony...

825
00:55:50,284 --> 00:55:52,214
from the people who made this website?

826
00:55:52,654 --> 00:55:54,915
All followers who testified about the truth behind Leader Im...

827
00:55:54,915 --> 00:55:55,984
all went missing.

828
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,324
This is scary.

829
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:02,964
They're not the only followers who went missing from Jinrigyo.

830
00:56:03,495 --> 00:56:05,165
They were mostly people with bad credit...

831
00:56:05,165 --> 00:56:06,634
or teenagers who had run away from home.

832
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:09,034
Wait. Even minors?

833
00:56:10,364 --> 00:56:11,464
What a crazy bastard.

834
00:56:12,404 --> 00:56:13,404
Do you think...

835
00:56:14,105 --> 00:56:16,574
he's involved in organ trafficking?

836
00:56:16,804 --> 00:56:18,674
They have found no evidence,

837
00:56:19,074 --> 00:56:20,415
but there is a possibility.

838
00:56:21,315 --> 00:56:23,844
Unbelievable. What is the police doing?

839
00:56:26,154 --> 00:56:28,955
There is even information that Leader Im picks young women...

840
00:56:28,955 --> 00:56:30,654
from his followers, calls them "Sky Brides,"

841
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:33,424
and uses them as his sex slaves.

842
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,924
What a piece of trash.

843
00:56:36,065 --> 00:56:37,324
Missing followers.

844
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:39,495
Evidence that the prosecutors couldn't find.

845
00:56:39,995 --> 00:56:42,205
And the slush fund he made by exploiting his followers.

846
00:56:42,634 --> 00:56:44,304
He definitely has everything hidden somewhere.

847
00:56:47,275 --> 00:56:49,574
A hunt for the treasure Leader Im has hidden.

848
00:56:49,645 --> 00:56:50,875
(A religion that serves the sky and follows the word of the sky)

849
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,344
(Junneungsun Jinrigyo Donation Report)

850
00:56:52,545 --> 00:56:54,315
Leader Im personally appoints...

851
00:56:54,315 --> 00:56:56,114
the envoys of Junneungsun Jinrigyo.

852
00:56:56,585 --> 00:56:58,114
They're supposed to be people...

853
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,955
that the sky chose and communicated to Leader Im.

854
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:01,984
But in reality,

855
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:05,355
they're people who are loyal to Leader Im and make big donations.

856
00:57:08,995 --> 00:57:09,995
Okay.

857
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:13,565
Leader Im is doing dirty things by selling the idea of heaven.

858
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:15,464
Let's show him what a real fiery pit is like.

859
00:57:26,045 --> 00:57:27,245
Ha Ri. Can you hear me?

860
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:30,685
Kim Han Jun from Brincetin Theological Seminary.

861
00:57:31,085 --> 00:57:32,784
Kim Han Jun.

862
00:57:33,315 --> 00:57:35,255
- Everything is set... - Everything is set,

863
00:57:35,484 --> 00:57:36,725
so just follow the plan.

864
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:39,324
Yes, what she said.

865
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:44,594
Okay. Let's get started.

866
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:53,275
(Epilogue)

867
00:57:58,545 --> 00:57:59,574
Mr. Kim.

868
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:01,174
Nice to meet you.

869
00:58:02,714 --> 00:58:04,614
You seem like a real yakuza member.

870
00:58:05,484 --> 00:58:07,614
- Is that so? - Yes.

871
00:58:08,924 --> 00:58:11,455
Then I'll show you something even scarier.

872
00:58:11,824 --> 00:58:12,824
What?

873
00:58:19,234 --> 00:58:20,264
What...

874
00:58:21,234 --> 00:58:23,665
Blood.

875
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:25,005
Gosh.

876
00:58:32,645 --> 00:58:33,875
Are you all ready?

877
00:58:35,784 --> 00:58:37,045
Thanks to you,

878
00:58:38,344 --> 00:58:39,685
everything is perfect now.

879
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:45,554
Let's get started.

880
00:58:52,464 --> 00:58:53,534
Ready.

881
00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:00,234
Action.

882
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:10,645
(The Player 2: Master of Swindlers)

883
00:59:11,045 --> 00:59:12,384
(Special thanks to Lee Soo Hyuk, Yun Ji On,)

884
00:59:12,384 --> 00:59:13,714
(Heo Sung Tae, and Park Sung Hyun for appearing.)

885
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:39,944
You're as bold as I've heard.

886
00:59:39,944 --> 00:59:40,944
- Leader Im! - Leader Im!

887
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:42,315
I'm a fan of yours.

888
00:59:43,145 --> 00:59:44,614
I will be a loyal servant,

889
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,085
- Leader Im. - What an interesting person.

890
00:59:46,415 --> 00:59:48,154
This is Ms. Lee Sun Ja. She turned 80 this year.

891
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:49,554
She has over 50 million dollars.

892
00:59:49,654 --> 00:59:51,455
She is persuaded easily.

893
00:59:52,324 --> 00:59:53,995
When I received a nice gift,

894
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:56,364
I should've been more suspicious.

895
00:59:57,565 --> 00:59:59,065
That piece of trash.

896
00:59:59,264 --> 01:00:00,335
Ha Ri...

897
01:00:00,795 --> 01:00:01,895
will be okay, right?

898
01:00:12,005 --> 01:00:13,975
I applied because I wanted to catch a mouse.

899
01:00:14,174 --> 01:00:15,415
(To catch a mouse nibbling away at the company)

900
01:00:15,415 --> 01:00:16,645
Do you know who I am?

901
01:00:16,645 --> 01:00:18,245
We're doing this audit because there was corruption.

902
01:00:18,984 --> 01:00:20,085
(The king of audit is here!)

903
01:00:20,085 --> 01:00:21,085
You're fired.

904
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:23,125
I'll do my best to show you how big of a crime...

905
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:24,784
abusing someone's trust is.

906
01:00:24,784 --> 01:00:26,995
