1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,801
Allow me to introduce to you.

2
00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:07,549
He's the deputy chief editor
transferred from our New York branch.

3
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:09,084
It's a pleasure to meet you.

4
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:12,751
As of today, I'm your deputy chief editor,
Ji Sungjoon.

5
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:18,042
-Did you land in Seoul?
-Yes. I just got off the plane.

6
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:20,543
Remember you only have three months.

7
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:23,793
And don't forget.
You only get three shots at it.

8
00:00:23,876 --> 00:00:24,959
I know that.

9
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:27,917
Are you here from overseas?

10
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:30,459
Yes.

11
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:33,793
It's been about 15 years
since my last stay in Korea.

12
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,376
That's quite a long time.

13
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,959
What brings you back to Korea?

14
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:40,668
I have some things to do...

15
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,793
...and some things I need to find.

16
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:45,876
Either one of you should get off.

17
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:48,959
I thought I got on first...

18
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:53,709
-Are you busy right now?
-No, I'm not busy at all.

19
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:57,751
If you're not busy,
why don't you show some decency?

20
00:00:58,542 --> 00:00:59,542
What?

21
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,376
What is he saying?

22
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:07,334
Excuse me!

23
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:09,334
Get in.

24
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:16,917
That's a relief!

25
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,835
Find something?

26
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:21,626
Find what?

27
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:23,000
An umbrella.

28
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,668
I'm back for my umbrella.

29
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:34,917
Hey, Kim Hyejin.

30
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:36,292
What's wrong with you?

31
00:01:37,418 --> 00:01:41,126
I was glad I had such
a great friend like you, Hyejin...

32
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:46,959
Great friend. Great friend.

33
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:49,793
Great, great. Great, great friend.

34
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:52,167
Look at him smile!

35
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:53,251
Windfall.

36
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:55,793
That rude guy from the elevator
is our deputy chief editor?

37
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,167
Goodness.

38
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:58,835
I'm Cha Jooyoung, the fashion director.

39
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:00,167
Pleased to meet you.

40
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:02,126
And I'm Kim Poongho,
the features director.

41
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:05,046
-I look forward to working with you.
-Joo Ahreum from the beauty team.

42
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,000
Pleasure.

43
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,218
Kim Shinhyuk, I'm features editor.

44
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:10,751
I'm not sure but people
here call me the Ace...

45
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:13,084
He's a natural lunatic.

46
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,250
Then I look forward to working with you.

47
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:18,626
I'm the beauty assistant, Han Seol.

48
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,584
And I'm the youngest here,
fashion assistant Joonwoo.

49
00:02:21,668 --> 00:02:22,709
Kim Joonwoo.

50
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:24,126
-Nice to meet you.
-Yes.

51
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,837
I'm also an editing assistant,
Jung Seonmin.

52
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:28,084
-I'm Park Yikyung.
-I'm Lee Eunyoung.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,084
I'll observe the office today,
and formally begin tomorrow.

54
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:36,084
Tomorrow morning,
we'll have a staff meeting.

55
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:38,668
Please make sure everyone is present.

56
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:39,917
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,917
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,167
I look forward to working with you.

59
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:50,209
Ouch! It's not a dream because that hurt.

60
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:56,084
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?

61
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:01,126
Calm down and figure this out.

62
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:05,522
So this is...

63
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:07,251
This...

64
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:09,709
This is...

65
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,155
How am I going to figure this out?

66
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:20,501
Yes, Hari.

67
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:22,459
Why did you hang up on me?

68
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:25,000
What?

69
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:26,167
Who appeared as what?

70
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:28,251
I thought you joined a fashion magazine?

71
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,501
So what is Ji Sungjoon doing there?

72
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,668
I'm involved in art directing.

73
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,959
Oh... so this is what he meant?

74
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:43,959
Does this mean you'll have to
face Ji Sungjoon every day?

75
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:45,626
On the same team?

76
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:47,251
As his subordinate?

77
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:51,334
Yes. By pointing out the obvious,
you're making me feel worse.

78
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:54,543
Hey, what if he recognizes me?

79
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,751
I know I've changed,

80
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,835
but I'm sure I have some
resemblance to my younger self!

81
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,459
Hey, don't worry.

82
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:00,962
You used to be a doll
when you were young,

83
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,709
but there's absolutely
no trace of it left!

84
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,251
I'm not saying
that you're hideous or anything.

85
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,626
Anyway, he won't notice, so don't worry.

86
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:10,879
I'm so nervous!

87
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,334
What if he finds out what my name is?

88
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:15,251
Hey, I think he'll figure it out!

89
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:17,709
Hari, should I change my name?

90
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:19,543
Rename yourself?

91
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,167
Hey, the world is full
of other Kim Hyejins.

92
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:24,751
There are three in our hotel alone.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,376
And think about this carefully.

94
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:28,916
He believes that his first love is me.

95
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:30,584
-Am I right or wrong?
-What?

96
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:31,793
You're right.

97
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:34,793
On top of that, he believes that
I've gone overseas to study.

98
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:35,959
Am I right or am I wrong?

99
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:37,959
You're right.

100
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:41,876
So why would he suspect you just
because you've got the same name?

101
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:44,126
He'll think you as someone
who has the same name.

102
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,876
But I've got a bad feeling about this!

103
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,418
I got weak in the knees when I saw him,

104
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:51,835
so how do you expect me
to face him every day?

105
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,793
With your personality,
you're bound to act suspicious.

106
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,917
Hey, there's a way.

107
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,917
A way?

108
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:05,334
What kind of way?

109
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:06,584
Hang on.

110
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,917
To what?

111
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:10,042
To his trousers.

112
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,084
Please!

113
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:17,418
Mr Boo, please take me
off the magazine staff!

114
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:19,959
You're pulling my trousers down!

115
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:23,376
I want to remain here
at Management Support!

116
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,916
I'll be loyal forever! Please?

117
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:29,626
If you don't,
I'll lie down here in protest!

118
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:35,584
I don't care if you lie down
or drag me down with you...

119
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:39,251
...because I can't do anything about it.

120
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:40,209
Didn't I tell you already?

121
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:42,876
Nobody messes with The Most Editing Team!

122
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,917
Do you know why?

123
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:55,251
Did you meet the chief editor
that dresses ridiculously loud?

124
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:58,916
Buongiorno!

125
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:02,835
Ciao!

126
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:06,376
That amazingly weird lady?

127
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:08,167
Chief Editor, Kim Rara.

128
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:13,959
Yes, the chief editor's name
is Rara or something.

129
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,334
This is supposed to be a company secret.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,835
Supposedly, she's our chairman's sister!

131
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,459
The chairman's younger sister?

132
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:32,084
Yes!

133
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,209
So...

134
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:37,292
She came from Italy a year ago
after getting a divorce,

135
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:39,000
and she landed the chief editor position.

136
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:43,251
She's incompetent, always
shopping and partying.

137
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:46,959
But she's got the chairman's support,

138
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,376
and I don't want to get on his bad side!

139
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,459
My youngest hasn't
even gone to college yet.

140
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:55,334
Chief! Mr Boo, no!

141
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,209
I can't work in that team!

142
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,501
All right, I understand.

143
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:03,334
I don't know what this is about,
but get up.

144
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,709
Are you going to pull me
out of that team?

145
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:13,000
Tender your resignation.

146
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:17,501
Sir?

147
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:20,793
My resignation?

148
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:28,251
Is he there?

149
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:30,668
Or not?

150
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,292
-What are you looking at?
-Oh, my!

151
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,042
You startled me!
I almost had a miscarriage!

152
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:44,917
What are you looking at?
I want to take a look, too.

153
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:46,042
What?

154
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,584
I wasn't looking at anything!

155
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,959
Oh, is your tooth all right?

156
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,501
-Sir?
-Anyway, welcome to the Editing Team.

157
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:57,251
You're here, partly because of me,
so you owe me an expensive lunch.

158
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:03,251
What's he talking about?

159
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:06,959
Wait.

160
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,292
He just said!

161
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:10,793
Excuse me.

162
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:12,876
Excuse me?

163
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:17,418
You just welcomed me here...

164
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:20,292
...and mentioned that
you were somehow responsible?

165
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,668
-Kim Shinhyuk.
-What?

166
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,376
I've got a name, and it's Kim Shinhyuk.

167
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:26,626
Who knows?

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,584
If Jackson ever calls for me,
I may become Jackson's flower.

169
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,709
What does Jackson have
anything to do with it?

170
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:40,292
Excuse me.

171
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:42,584
If I'm really in this team
because of you...

172
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:43,751
Or you can call me Mr Kim.

173
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:44,836
If it's because of you, Mr Kim...

174
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,348
To insinuate that something happened...

175
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:49,084
...because of someone
isn't really positive.

176
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,046
Do you know what the core division
of a magazine company is?

177
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:52,042
Management Support Team.

178
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:53,418
The editing staff, correct.

179
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:56,334
Jinsung Magazine's flagship department...

180
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:59,084
The Most editing staff,
needed an assistant.

181
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:00,959
But instead of hiring someone,

182
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,126
I suggested that we
transfer someone over...

183
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,418
...from Management Support Team,

184
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:07,793
since you've already helped us and all.

185
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:09,709
And everyone agreed.

186
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,418
I know. You're so thankful.

187
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:12,751
No!

188
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:15,084
So instead of saying that
it's "because of" me...

189
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:17,751
...it'd be more appropriate
to say it was "thanks to" me.

190
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:20,543
You want one?

191
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:21,668
It's free.

192
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,126
Forget that.

193
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:25,959
Mr Kim, please tell them to send me back!

194
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,167
Hyejin, you're here?

195
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:28,709
Can you come and see me?

196
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:29,793
Right now?

197
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:31,796
Should we wait until next year?

198
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:32,751
Oh, yes.

199
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:40,418
She's got the Michael Jackson
thing going on again today.

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,584
Wow, Michael Jackson!

201
00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:49,751
Where did you learn how to proofread?

202
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:51,459
I can tell that you're experienced.

203
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:53,793
Ma'am?

204
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,668
Oh, my father used to run a copy store,

205
00:09:57,793 --> 00:09:59,917
and I used to help him out.

206
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,376
-But, you see...
-That's great.

207
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,494
We'll be releasing the 20-year
anniversary edition in three months,

208
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:06,700
and it's like a battlefield around here.

209
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:09,959
I was going to hire an assistant,
but you can translate, proofread,

210
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,376
and I'm sure you'll be
good with computer.

211
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:14,251
You're the perfect person.

212
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:17,167
I need you to support us
for the next three months.

213
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:18,209
No.

214
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,837
Wouldn't it be better if you
hired someone as planned?

215
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,709
I'd be thankful if you send me back
to Management Support Team.

216
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,876
Interns, at the very least,
won't run away.

217
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,835
Assistants tend to quit often,
so I get paranoid.

218
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,327
I'm not going to
give you anything difficult.

219
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:36,084
Just handle the simple
translations that I give you.

220
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,751
No. I've never touched
a fashion magazine in my life!

221
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,668
I don't know anything about the industry.

222
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:43,876
Simply put, I'm a complete idiot.

223
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:45,584
Targeting women in their 20s and 30s,

224
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:47,751
we focus on fashion and lifestyle.

225
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,459
It's translated into 30 languages
with the all rights reserved.

226
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,793
What?

227
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:56,668
30 to 40 percent are translated
articles from New York head office.

228
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:59,626
Then we add additional
articles based on the theme.

229
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,917
It's divided into fashion, beauty,
and features sections.

230
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:05,212
The fashion section covers
fashion trends, shows, pictorials,

231
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,418
and as the name suggests,
anything that has to do with fashion.

232
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:12,835
Beauty consists of cosmetics,
make-up, diet, health, and etcetera.

233
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:16,126
The features section consists of
anything that isn't fashion or beauty.

234
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,376
Movies, exhibits of art and culture,
social issues,

235
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,084
celebrity interview, and lifestyles.

236
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:22,584
You get the idea.

237
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,793
Now you know at least half of it,

238
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:26,296
so I trust there will be
no more problems?

239
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,376
No, there's still a huge problem.

240
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:34,543
What are you doing, Hyejin?

241
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:35,626
What?

242
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:41,042
I thought you dropped something,
but I was wrong.

243
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:43,876
Miss Cha?

244
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:45,042
Yes?

245
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:46,463
I heard about the photoshoot later today,

246
00:11:46,543 --> 00:11:49,042
and I was hoping
to meet the photographers.

247
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,917
If you need me to, I can arrange
for them to meet with you.

248
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,876
No.

249
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:55,793
I'll go and see them personally.

250
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:57,167
Yes, I understand.

251
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,626
She's running off again?

252
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:03,959
Maybe she got the runs?

253
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:12,713
Did you see the new deputy chief editor?

254
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:14,126
He's so dreamy.

255
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:15,916
Did you see how tall he is?

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,251
I thought he was a model.

257
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:21,042
When he's standing still,
he oozes of charisma.

258
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:24,376
And when he smiles! He's such a cutie!

259
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:27,584
How did he become a deputy chief
editor at his age already?

260
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:28,959
I know, right?

261
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:30,879
He graduated top of the class at Parsons,

262
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,126
and they say he's a big shot in New York!

263
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:36,668
Then he should've stayed in New York!
Why come back here?

264
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:38,793
Ji Sungjoon.

265
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:42,126
Even his name has a ring to it!

266
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:44,209
We don't get paid much
and we always work late.

267
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:47,209
I thought I was going
to grow old at this job,

268
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:49,543
but things are finally looking up!

269
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:56,167
It must be nice to laugh about it.

270
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,376
Operation Trouser-Tug was a failure.

271
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,751
I'm sitting on the toilet,
hiding from Ji Sungjoon.

272
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:10,334
She's driving me crazy.

273
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:17,167
Get up this instant!

274
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:19,303
I promise that he won't recognize you!

275
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:21,663
Are you going to sit on
the toilet like some idiot?

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,584
How long are you going to avoid him?

277
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:29,251
No, I'm not going to
avoid him any longer!

278
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,584
He won't recognize you!

279
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:31,959
Do not run from him!

280
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:51,751
What's he doing here?

281
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:53,251
Then what was that other guy?

282
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,917
I'm starting to see him everywhere now!

283
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:58,501
I'm losing my mind.

284
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:00,292
Hurry up and get off!

285
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:01,501
I have to get off!

286
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,042
Did you stop?

287
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:09,251
You can't stop!

288
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,167
Excuse me!

289
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,292
Someone is trapped in here!

290
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:20,084
Please open this door!

291
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,626
Please save me! Someone save me!

292
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,459
Someone save me!

293
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:35,709
Kim Hyejin?

294
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:41,751
If you want to live...

295
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:44,626
...wouldn't it be safer
if you left the door alone?

296
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:46,376
Kim Hyejin?

297
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:57,543
The elevator has stopped here.

298
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:58,959
Is anyone there?

299
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:00,251
Are you trapped?

300
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:01,543
Which floor are you on?

301
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:03,209
The 18th floor! 18th!

302
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:05,668
Please open the door quickly!
The 18th floor, the 18th floor!

303
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:06,751
Please wait for a moment.

304
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:08,042
I'll open it for you.

305
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:38,501
Well...

306
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,126
Your forehead.

307
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:43,376
Tissue.

308
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:50,626
Wait. Are you forgetting
to breathe right now?

309
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:52,501
You're not breathing!

310
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:53,751
Breathe, Kim Hyejin!

311
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,501
I forgot how to breathe!

312
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:58,459
You're going to die, so breathe!

313
00:15:58,751 --> 00:15:59,876
Is something wrong?

314
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,000
Hurry up and breathe!

315
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:03,376
What's the matter?

316
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:04,709
You have claustrophobia.

317
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,916
The lights are out now.

318
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,494
Are you claustrophobic by any chance?

319
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:52,584
I'm hoping this would help you.

320
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:57,835
Someone once let me hear this song,

321
00:16:58,292 --> 00:16:59,793
and it helped me to calm down.

322
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,126
Are you okay?

323
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:48,584
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day.

324
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:52,126
Hyunwoo, did you request
repair for room 701?

325
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,126
Yes, Manager.

326
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:54,917
It will happen this afternoon.

327
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:56,668
Okay, keep at it.

328
00:17:58,084 --> 00:17:59,917
She's not still on the toilet, is she?

329
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,376
"That woman"

330
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:23,709
I knew you wouldn't pick up...

331
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:27,709
...but it feels worse since
I saw you ignore my call.

332
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:31,126
From now on, get my calls.

333
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:34,167
I wouldn't call you
if I didn't have a good reason.

334
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:35,959
Please state your business.

335
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:39,418
Tell me why you had to contact me.

336
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:41,376
Abrasive as always, are we?

337
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,543
My unchanging nature
is a strength of mine.

338
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:52,126
Do you know that it's
your father's birthday next week?

339
00:18:52,835 --> 00:18:54,959
Don't you think you should stop by?

340
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:58,876
You're his daughter after all.

341
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:03,543
Did I say something funny?

342
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,709
I wasn't trying to be.

343
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:09,334
Oh my, it's been a long time.

344
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:10,501
Are you coming from the spa?

345
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,292
Yes. You too, Madam Kim?

346
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:13,376
Yes.

347
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,334
Please excuse me.

348
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:25,418
Wasn't that your daughter?

349
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,876
Nothing's missing, right?

350
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:31,084
No.

351
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,209
You have to make sure.

352
00:19:33,418 --> 00:19:34,376
I understand.

353
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,251
Hyejin.

354
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:40,501
Why did you leave in
the middle of our discussion?

355
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:41,835
We're going to the studio.

356
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,501
Pick up that box and follow me.

357
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,209
Well, right now?

358
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:49,042
Keep in mind that
I hate repeating myself.

359
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:50,751
Yes.

360
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,209
-Box!
-Right.

361
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:03,084
She's too often absent-minded.

362
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:11,959
Mr Ji, you'll need to tour the studio.

363
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:16,000
I was going to attend the shoot
later this afternoon.

364
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:26,167
Your style is simple, yet elegant.

365
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:27,543
Bravo!

366
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:30,751
You're the perfect portrayal of The Most.

367
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:35,668
But Mr Ji, your skin's a little dry.

368
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,418
Do you want to use some of this?

369
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:38,751
Try it!

370
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,626
My skin isn't dry.

371
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:45,668
Why don't you try my moisturizer?

372
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:47,584
Did you want to tell me something?

373
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:49,959
Yes, right...

374
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,000
You probably already know.

375
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:58,917
As the deputy chief editor, you'll
take on the chief editor's role too.

376
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:03,709
You see, the chairman pulled a few
strings to get me this job.

377
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:10,917
I'm aware of that.

378
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:14,835
Well...

379
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:17,501
...I was hoping to share a laugh with you.

380
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,042
Anyway, I'll leave The Most Editing
Team in your capable hands.

381
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,916
Yes.

382
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:32,167
But I'll need something
for the next three months.

383
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:33,709
A condition?

384
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,167
What is it?

385
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:37,167
You'll have to promise me first.

386
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:42,709
The other team members must not
find out what I'm about to tell you.

387
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:12,626
Okay. Let's get you changed
into this outfit.

388
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,751
How do you feel about
the photographs so far?

389
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:19,251
Carry on.

390
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:28,668
Please bring our models some water!

391
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:32,584
Water for the models. Is there any water?

392
00:22:33,543 --> 00:22:35,501
Please get our models some water!

393
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:37,626
Oh, yes.

394
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:40,543
Water, yes.

395
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,084
Here's water.

396
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:46,126
Isn't it hot?

397
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,251
Get out of the way!

398
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:53,917
Who told you to wear shoes on the set?

399
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,209
-Oh, no.
-Oh my goodness.

400
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:01,584
Oh, no.

401
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:07,917
I'm so sorry. I wasn't aware...

402
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,459
Come out from there!

403
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:14,668
"Kim Hyejin"

404
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:17,459
You from the elevator?

405
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:38,751
I should've informed her,
so it's my fault.

406
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,588
She's new, so she doesn't
know her way around yet.

407
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:42,501
I don't think I was introduced
to this woman.

408
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:43,751
Is she a part of our team?

409
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:45,501
She's not a formal member.

410
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:47,087
She's an intern for
the next three months...

411
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:48,501
That's a relief to hear.

412
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,584
She doesn't sound like anyone important.

413
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,835
You can't be making mistakes like this.

414
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:00,659
It's your first day, so we'll let this go.

415
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,126
I'm so sorry.

416
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,959
Hyejin, don't worry about it.

417
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:09,751
Keep your chin up!

418
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:38,334
-Hello, everyone!
-Hello.

419
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:41,084
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi!

420
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,959
-Thank you.
-Some moisture...

421
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,584
Here's your coffee, ma'am!

422
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:54,668
-Thank you. Adorable Joonwoo.
-Thank you.

423
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:57,626
Concept is good!

424
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:59,209
Very Most-esque!

425
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:02,459
But I think we should get rid of that.

426
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,000
That?

427
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:07,042
No, next to it.

428
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:09,584
Oh, that there?

429
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,916
No, no. Next to that.

430
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,837
The girl who's wiping the floor?

431
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:16,167
Yes, that.

432
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,501
Hyejin, Hyejin.

433
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:21,251
Me?

434
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:24,959
You, come here.

435
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:33,751
Who might you be?

436
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:37,959
-I'm...
-Oh, I haven't introduced her yet.

437
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:40,584
She was sent from Management
Support to help us...

438
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:42,459
...until the release of
our anniversary issue.

439
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,876
Say hello, Hyejin.

440
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,126
She's our chief editor.

441
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,543
How do you do?

442
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:49,584
I'm Kim Hyejin from
Management Support Team.

443
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,251
Mamma Mia!

444
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:52,751
That hair!

445
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:57,000
It's making me woozy.

446
00:25:57,917 --> 00:25:58,837
Sorry?

447
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:03,251
It's so un-Most,
that I'm starting to get sick!

448
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:05,209
That hair!

449
00:26:06,376 --> 00:26:11,084
I was born with frizzy hair...

450
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:12,876
Oh my.

451
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:18,000
Is that lint on your blouse?

452
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:21,835
This is an old blouse.

453
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,167
Mamma Mia!

454
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,751
Frizzy hair and linty blouse?

455
00:26:29,668 --> 00:26:30,917
My goodness.

456
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:33,793
I can't believe I'm within two meters...

457
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:36,626
...of a fashion-challenged
person like you!

458
00:26:36,709 --> 00:26:39,959
I'm extremely disturbed right now.

459
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:47,418
Look, I like things
that shimmer and shine.

460
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:50,959
Clothes, shoes, gems, and also people.

461
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:54,167
Whether it's three months or three hours,

462
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:58,084
if you were to become more Most-esque...

463
00:26:58,251 --> 00:27:01,167
...nothing would make me happier.

464
00:27:01,543 --> 00:27:02,959
Can you do that for me?

465
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:04,876
Yes.

466
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:09,501
But I don't know what
you mean by Most-esque...

467
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:10,668
I'll look forward to it.

468
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,084
Hyejin, go on.

469
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:17,501
Oh, yes.

470
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:22,917
Why don't we shower
the models with flower petals?

471
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:25,209
I think that would be quite Most-esque!

472
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:38,626
Imagine that a great storm is waging!

473
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,584
That would be more Most-esque!

474
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,543
Start over.

475
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,084
Simplicity is much better.

476
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,959
Okay, that's a wrap! Good work everyone!

477
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,543
Good work!

478
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:01,042
Good work!

479
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,418
Convert these as soon as possible.

480
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:05,916
-Yes, sir.
-Good work today.

481
00:29:03,418 --> 00:29:04,334
Hyejin.

482
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:06,126
Hari.

483
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:08,126
I was worried about you.

484
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:09,501
Is everything all right?

485
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,042
What's wrong? Did something happen?

486
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:17,459
Why the long face?

487
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:23,668
Let's go.

488
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:35,084
With your luck, you should
have bought a lottery ticket.

489
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:38,000
How can he show up
at your company like that?

490
00:29:39,418 --> 00:29:41,751
So the next three months
are going to be like this?

491
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:45,376
Hari, if I die, bury me in a sunny place.

492
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,668
I don't think I'm going to make it.

493
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,128
Bury what?

494
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:51,793
He doesn't know anything,
so stop worrying about him!

495
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,584
Hey, what are you doing?

496
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:01,917
When I'm near him,
I can't breathe like this.

497
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:04,671
I can't breathe at the mere
thought of him.

498
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:05,709
Open the window.

499
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:07,251
Hurry up!

500
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:16,251
What did he do in America to
come back as the deputy chief editor?

501
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:38,916
Thanks for walking home with me.

502
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:41,543
You, your hair!

503
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:42,835
Hair?

504
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:44,959
My hair!

505
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:50,917
The only trait I got from
my dad is his frizzy hair.

506
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:52,837
I straighten my hair once a month here.

507
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,334
But they ran out of
the straightening cream I use.

508
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:58,876
So I've been straight-ironing my hair,
but rain makes it blow up.

509
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,709
Hey, why aren't you coming?

510
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,584
Well...

511
00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:10,418
What's the matter?
I told you it looks good!

512
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:12,376
But I don't like it.

513
00:32:12,543 --> 00:32:13,626
It looks nice.

514
00:32:14,626 --> 00:32:18,543
Anyway, that's why
the thing I hate the most is rain.

515
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:23,751
Hey, don't tell the other kids
about my hair, okay?

516
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,959
Got it?

517
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:26,334
All right.

518
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:44,917
It's still raining.

519
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:52,292
Hey, are you still lying there?

520
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:55,084
Hari, I'm...

521
00:32:56,959 --> 00:33:01,000
...going to take the management
chief's advice and quit.

522
00:33:06,793 --> 00:33:08,543
Did you give your sanity away somewhere?

523
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:11,543
Don't you remember what
it took to land this job?

524
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:13,584
I've already told him a mountain of lies,

525
00:33:13,668 --> 00:33:16,543
and if he discovers who I really am...

526
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:19,668
This won't do.
I'm looking for another job.

527
00:33:19,835 --> 00:33:22,167
You're making me want to
pound some drinks.

528
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,543
You wait right here.

529
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:30,334
Why?

530
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,042
Ji Sungjoon sent me an email!

531
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,084
Really?

532
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,292
What did he say?

533
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:42,668
Hyejin, are you doing well?

534
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:45,626
You haven't called me since.

535
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:48,584
I wonder if you're adjusting well.

536
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:51,626
It's raining here today.

537
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:53,793
How's London?

538
00:33:54,418 --> 00:33:57,084
You hate rain,
but it rains a lot over there...

539
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,543
...so are you getting frustrated?

540
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:02,668
I'm just curious.

541
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,876
Let me know how you're doing.

542
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,793
-I'll be waiting.
-"I'll be waiting".

543
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,501
-I miss you, Hyejin.
-"I miss you, Hyejin".

544
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:13,084
What should I do?

545
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,543
How should I respond?

546
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:16,084
Should I ignore him?

547
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,879
Leave it to me.

548
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:20,376
Why, what are you going to do?

549
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:22,084
Give me a sec...

550
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:26,876
Okay, found it.

551
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:31,209
Sungjoon, it's Hyejin.

552
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:34,376
I should've responded sooner. I'm sorry.

553
00:34:34,876 --> 00:34:37,126
I'm busy getting adjusted.

554
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:40,584
But I think I was born for London.

555
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:42,917
I love it here!

556
00:34:43,543 --> 00:34:44,501
What do you think?

557
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,167
Don't I look like I'm having fun?

558
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:48,501
Yes.

559
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:50,418
You sure look happy.

560
00:34:52,543 --> 00:34:54,959
Did you really send that?

561
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:59,000
Who knew that my European trip
would be this useful?

562
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:00,042
Hey!

563
00:35:00,418 --> 00:35:04,501
Now the only Kim Hyejin that's
on his mind is the one in London!

564
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:07,126
He wouldn't care any other Kim Hyejins.

565
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:09,959
No more suspicion. Game over.

566
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:13,251
So stop worrying about Ji Sungjoon, okay?

567
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:14,334
No...

568
00:35:14,418 --> 00:35:16,709
Don't ever threaten to quit again!

569
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:28,000
Yes, there's no need to be afraid.

570
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,376
You'll never get caught!

571
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:48,459
You're an intern from
Management Support Team?

572
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:56,126
When I found out Santa wasn't real,
I was less shocked than this...

573
00:35:57,835 --> 00:36:00,084
How long did you want to hide it from me?

574
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:04,000
Kim Hyejin.

575
00:36:05,668 --> 00:36:08,501
Did you think you could
hide this from me forever?

576
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:11,251
You, how did you?

577
00:36:12,876 --> 00:36:13,793
Hyejin.

578
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:21,459
If you're going to show up
looking like this...

579
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:23,584
...you should've stayed away.

580
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:27,019
You should've remained hidden.

581
00:36:29,428 --> 00:36:30,654
You've got no manners.

582
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:01,126
I wonder if this girl is awake.

583
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:04,751
Dear wife, are you awake?

584
00:37:05,668 --> 00:37:09,668
The sun is high in the sky

585
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:11,418
"Resignation"

586
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,000
Why, you!

587
00:37:13,876 --> 00:37:14,916
Have you lost it?

588
00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:16,084
Give it back.

589
00:37:16,543 --> 00:37:17,626
Hey, you bonehead!

590
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:20,209
You got rejected from a hundred places
before you landed this job.

591
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:21,751
I thought this was your dream?

592
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,167
Didn't you say you wanted to work late
until your nose bleeds?

593
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,209
I thought you're prepared
to give your all!

594
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:28,835
So why are you resigning
because of that Ji Sungjoon?

595
00:37:29,126 --> 00:37:31,709
He's not just any person to me, Hari.

596
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,459
Sungjoon was...

597
00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:37,804
...a precious friend, like you are to me.

598
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:41,144
I don't know how to explain it,

599
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:47,668
but we have something special between us.

600
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:49,668
I don't want to ruin that,

601
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:52,376
and I don't want to worry
everyday about it.

602
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:54,251
I can't believe you're serious.

603
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:58,292
The past is only fragments of memories.

604
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:00,418
It's not even important at all...

605
00:38:00,501 --> 00:38:03,251
...and you just remember
it as a beautiful memory.

606
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:04,418
You idiot!

607
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:09,916
You'll go back to your
old team in three months.

608
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:11,379
So why do you have to do
this because of him?

609
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:13,501
It's not because of him,
it's because of me!

610
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:17,376
You wouldn't understand.

611
00:38:17,668 --> 00:38:19,042
Of course you wouldn't.

612
00:38:19,626 --> 00:38:22,042
I know that I seem like an idiot loser.

613
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:23,668
I know, but when I'm in front of him,

614
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,709
I feel like a sock with a hole in it.

615
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:28,418
You from the elevator?

616
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:35,876
I'm worried when he'll discover the truth.

617
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:38,376
It's embarrassing and pathetic,
and I cower away.

618
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:40,418
I keep trying to hide from him.

619
00:38:41,668 --> 00:38:42,916
Like a sock with a hole in it.

620
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:49,959
I don't want to be that sock anymore.

621
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:01,626
Hi, Seolbi.

622
00:39:02,835 --> 00:39:04,167
Is the management chief in?

623
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:09,070
He said he'll be back at around 2:00 PM.

624
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,167
Really?

625
00:39:14,584 --> 00:39:16,042
I'm sorry, Chief.

626
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:19,418
I'll tell the Editing Team
at the end of the day.

627
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:23,459
I'm sorry I didn't make you
proud of hiring me.

628
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:26,668
I'm truly thankful.

629
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,709
I have a knack for waking people up!

630
00:39:40,584 --> 00:39:41,793
If it wasn't for this guy...

631
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:44,126
If only this guy didn't recommend
me to the Editing Team!

632
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:45,879
-Sausage?
-I don't want it!

633
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,167
I was asking you to open it for me.

634
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:49,626
-What?
-You thought I was giving this to you?

635
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,917
Dream on.
You don't know how much I love this.

636
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:57,084
Wait.

637
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:00,459
Why are you talking down to me?

638
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:03,084
Once you meet a person
for the third time,

639
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,418
it's the first step to friendship.

640
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:10,167
It's not your first time hearing
that quote, is it?

641
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,251
Schopenhauer said that.

642
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:17,000
How can you not know that?

643
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,042
Little kids know that quote.

644
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:24,209
I know it, I know! I remember now.

645
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:26,837
Right. I think I was confused.

646
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:29,626
It wasn't Schopenhauer,
it was the other guy...

647
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:31,334
-Who?
-Me.

648
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:34,126
I said it just now.

649
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:36,709
-What?
-I'm sorry.

650
00:40:36,793 --> 00:40:38,501
I'm sorry.

651
00:40:39,626 --> 00:40:40,584
Have one.

652
00:40:40,668 --> 00:40:43,584
When you don't have the energy,
this is better than sausages.

653
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:47,668
It's only one day past the expiration
date so it'll still be edible.

654
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,501
Go for it.

655
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,000
Why, that...

656
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:56,959
Stop.

657
00:40:58,126 --> 00:40:59,292
That's food.

658
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,379
If you're going to toss it,
give it to me.

659
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:03,793
But it's past the expiration date.

660
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:05,000
It's past the expiration date?

661
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:07,042
Then it would taste better.

662
00:41:08,459 --> 00:41:09,626
This expires two days later.

663
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:10,668
What?

664
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,709
What's going on?

665
00:41:14,835 --> 00:41:16,084
Hi, Han Seol.

666
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:18,000
You're both wearing the same thing.

667
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:20,837
Really?

668
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:22,959
You got this at the Dongdaemun Market,
didn't you? 10 dollars!

669
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:25,167
Oh my goodness.

670
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:26,543
10 dollars?

671
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,126
Of course not!

672
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:30,838
Where, tell me! How is it the same?

673
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,079
This is 100 percent cashmere!

674
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:35,079
Her blouse is obviously
acrylic stitched together!

675
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:37,287
It must be the similar color then.

676
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,788
The color?

677
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,366
How is the color similar?

678
00:41:42,447 --> 00:41:46,324
Mine is an elegant red,
and her blouse isn't even really red!

679
00:41:46,405 --> 00:41:48,572
You don't know what you're talking about.

680
00:41:49,012 --> 00:41:51,639
I like it. It's breezy.

681
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:52,847
It looks like it.

682
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:54,180
Forget it then.

683
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:56,634
Don't ever compare me to her again.

684
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,180
Why don't you wash your hair
if you have the time?

685
00:41:59,722 --> 00:42:01,722
I should go and buy a new outfit.

686
00:42:02,138 --> 00:42:03,096
Good morning.

687
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:05,180
Good morning.

688
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:07,972
As I mentioned yesterday,
we're having a meeting in 10 minutes.

689
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:11,138
It's our first formal meeting,
so I want everyone to be there.

690
00:42:11,222 --> 00:42:12,430
Yes.

691
00:42:16,012 --> 00:42:18,388
-He's so charismatic!
-He looks so nice.

692
00:42:23,472 --> 00:42:26,347
Hyejin, I want you to write
the minutes from now on.

693
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:28,222
Pardon?

694
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:32,012
Do you want me to attend the meeting?

695
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:33,305
Didn't you hear him?

696
00:42:33,388 --> 00:42:34,805
He wants everyone to be there.

697
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:38,555
Miss Cha, to be honest...

698
00:42:42,347 --> 00:42:43,305
Never mind.

699
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:44,388
I understand.

700
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:50,222
Yes, I'll tell them that
I'm quitting later.

701
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:52,555
I'll just have to make it through today.

702
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:54,931
This will be our very first meeting.

703
00:42:55,222 --> 00:42:58,305
I'd like to hear what we've prepared
for our 20th anniversary issue.

704
00:42:58,555 --> 00:43:02,222
I want you to explain your
sections in three minutes or less.

705
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,722
I make it a rule to never have
a meeting longer than 30 minutes.

706
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:08,597
American style!

707
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:09,889
Very practical, Boss.

708
00:43:11,805 --> 00:43:13,430
Then shall we begin?

709
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:18,805
First, the beauty team?

710
00:43:22,012 --> 00:43:25,347
Didn't I just call on the beauty team?

711
00:43:26,764 --> 00:43:27,722
Oh, yes.

712
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:32,013
Why don't we feature
the homes of 20 celebrities?

713
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,597
Naturally, we'd cover beauty,
fashion, and lifestyle.

714
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:40,931
It's hard enough to get an interview.
But featuring their homes?

715
00:43:41,012 --> 00:43:42,263
And 20 celebrities, at that?

716
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:44,680
I'm sure that's realistic...

717
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,055
Out.

718
00:43:47,347 --> 00:43:49,639
I hope I hear better ideas today.

719
00:43:50,012 --> 00:43:51,263
Next, the fashion team?

720
00:43:52,347 --> 00:43:56,555
We're planning to feature the colours
for the upcoming F-W season.

721
00:43:56,972 --> 00:43:57,889
Out.

722
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:02,347
I would like to feature an expose
on plagiarism in Korean literature!

723
00:44:03,096 --> 00:44:04,012
Out.

724
00:44:04,347 --> 00:44:05,933
-London, Milan, Paris...
-Out.

725
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:07,472
Camping is the thing right now.

726
00:44:07,555 --> 00:44:08,639
-Out.
-That's an out...

727
00:44:08,722 --> 00:44:10,347
How about the new
eye-shadow that's in style?

728
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,305
Out.

729
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:12,847
-A feature on fashion people...
-Out.

730
00:44:12,931 --> 00:44:14,138
-Well, I...
-Out.

731
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:16,472
How about the type of lip balm
aromas that men prefer?

732
00:44:16,555 --> 00:44:17,972
Why don't you keep that one to yourself?

733
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,096
Out!

734
00:44:25,305 --> 00:44:27,055
I'm reminded of that word...

735
00:44:28,597 --> 00:44:32,356
Om-Ni-sham-bles.

736
00:44:38,096 --> 00:44:39,096
Next.

737
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:40,764
You, there at the end.

738
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:54,639
Were you asleep?

739
00:44:55,305 --> 00:44:56,305
I wasn't asleep.

740
00:44:56,805 --> 00:44:58,847
Then why don't you go ahead
and tell us your idea?

741
00:44:58,931 --> 00:45:00,012
We don't have much time.

742
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,972
I don't have an idea...

743
00:45:07,847 --> 00:45:09,414
Am I the only one having
difficulty hearing her?

744
00:45:11,138 --> 00:45:12,680
She's an intern from the Management Team.

745
00:45:12,764 --> 00:45:14,180
She's here to record the minutes...

746
00:45:14,263 --> 00:45:15,472
Look here, Management.

747
00:45:16,222 --> 00:45:17,222
Yes, sir?

748
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,514
Don't you know how to speak?

749
00:45:18,972 --> 00:45:20,680
Or are you a kindergartener?

750
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:23,889
Or maybe you have a low IQ?

751
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,430
What?

752
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,555
I'm wondering why you always
have someone else speak for you?

753
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:30,972
No, I...

754
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:33,555
That's not it...

755
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,680
Okay, if that's not it.

756
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:39,722
If you're not going to contribute
to the meeting, step outside.

757
00:45:40,096 --> 00:45:41,931
You're wasting the oxygen in here.

758
00:45:43,263 --> 00:45:44,472
Hey, come on.

759
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,263
There's plenty of air for everyone.

760
00:45:46,347 --> 00:45:48,931
We even have a great
air filter in here, right?

761
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:53,514
Why are you still here?

762
00:46:11,722 --> 00:46:15,305
Did he just kick me out?

763
00:46:17,972 --> 00:46:21,180
All of these articles would show up
on the internet in a few keystrokes.

764
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:26,472
They're long and they're boring.

765
00:46:30,722 --> 00:46:32,430
Articles regurgitated from two years ago.

766
00:46:34,514 --> 00:46:35,388
Gosh.

767
00:46:36,305 --> 00:46:38,889
Pretentious articles without substance.

768
00:46:42,055 --> 00:46:43,931
The acceptable portion of the magazine.

769
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:47,805
About this much?

770
00:46:50,972 --> 00:46:52,847
Subscription rate,
sales records, demographic...

771
00:46:52,931 --> 00:46:54,764
leading trends, advertisement revenue.

772
00:46:55,096 --> 00:46:58,055
Everywhere else in the world,
The Most is the top fashion magazine.

773
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:01,305
Only in Korea did we concede
the top position.

774
00:47:02,013 --> 00:47:04,764
And now I see the reason why.

775
00:47:07,055 --> 00:47:12,138
They gave away coupons
and reader gifts...

776
00:47:12,222 --> 00:47:15,472
...with the great expense supported
by their head office in New York.

777
00:47:15,764 --> 00:47:20,055
If the magazine isn't worth reading
and defeated by coupons and gifts...

778
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,764
...it must mean there's a problem.

779
00:47:24,263 --> 00:47:25,722
Give me your thoughts.

780
00:47:25,805 --> 00:47:28,597
I'm willing to listen to
your qualms and excuses.

781
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:32,138
Mr. Ji.

782
00:47:33,012 --> 00:47:35,180
I don't know how
it was in New York for you.

783
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,847
But in Korea, it's more difficult
to engage our demographic...

784
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:42,639
So you gave our demographic
what they wanted...

785
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,012
but there's nothing to show for it?

786
00:47:50,889 --> 00:47:52,847
We're having another meeting tomorrow.

787
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:55,639
I want you to ponder why The Most
lost its top position in Korea,

788
00:47:56,012 --> 00:47:58,055
and what we must do
in order to change that.

789
00:47:58,388 --> 00:47:59,847
I want each of you to
think of a solution.

790
00:48:05,972 --> 00:48:08,430
We're busy enough with
the anniversary edition!

791
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,388
When am I going to prepare
for my wedding?

792
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:12,680
He was nice until just yesterday.

793
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,138
I don't like how he talks to us!

794
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,972
But he didn't say anything
that was untrue, right?

795
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:19,388
I think it's going to be fun.

796
00:48:19,472 --> 00:48:20,889
Yes, loads of fun...

797
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:31,972
Did he treat me like an idiot earlier?

798
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:33,559
Don't you know how to speak?

799
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:35,305
Or are you a kindergartener?

800
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:38,096
Or maybe you have a low IQ?

801
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,597
Yes, I understand.
We'll proceed as planned.

802
00:48:48,096 --> 00:48:49,138
He did.

803
00:49:18,012 --> 00:49:19,263
Five dollars!

804
00:49:20,138 --> 00:49:21,263
Five dollars!

805
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,180
Shinhyuk is next,
the lucky guy, Shinhyuk!

806
00:49:24,263 --> 00:49:26,388
Get caught! Get caught!

807
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:28,180
I'm not getting caught!

808
00:49:28,805 --> 00:49:32,138
Poongho is next, and we've
got 50 dollars riding on this.

809
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:33,514
50 dollars, Poongho.

810
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:34,555
It's going to be me...

811
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:35,514
Here we go.

812
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:37,388
30 dollars!

813
00:49:37,472 --> 00:49:39,472
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

814
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:48,555
Han Seol's turn.

815
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:50,972
One, two, three, four...

816
00:49:52,931 --> 00:49:54,096
What a sham...

817
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,347
Yikyung, Yikyung.

818
00:49:57,347 --> 00:49:58,388
Yes!

819
00:49:58,472 --> 00:50:01,013
So naturally, Ahreum is bound to...

820
00:50:01,263 --> 00:50:06,388
...step in poo. You've stepped in poo!

821
00:50:06,597 --> 00:50:09,096
Let's do it again, guys...

822
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,222
Take this and go out to lunch.

823
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,013
Wow, are you buying us lunch?

824
00:50:20,722 --> 00:50:22,889
Everyone was silent during the meeting,

825
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:26,012
but you're lively when it comes
to ridiculous games like this.

826
00:50:26,805 --> 00:50:29,388
Stop wasting time, go have lunch,

827
00:50:29,555 --> 00:50:31,889
and come back ready to work.

828
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,805
I don't care.
I still want to eat what he buys for us.

829
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:41,096
But you owe the pot 30 dollars.

830
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:43,180
-What?
-Come on.

831
00:50:43,263 --> 00:50:45,347
-Cough up 30 dollars!
-Bye.

832
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:46,472
Come on!

833
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:48,347
Good morning!

834
00:50:50,597 --> 00:50:51,514
Have you arrived?

835
00:50:51,597 --> 00:50:52,764
Very beautiful!

836
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,722
Hello!

837
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:57,597
Oh, my sun!

838
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,555
Should we have dinner together?

839
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:03,847
Why not? Why do I need a reason?

840
00:51:03,931 --> 00:51:06,096
Auntie wants to buy her nephew dinner.

841
00:51:06,972 --> 00:51:08,975
Who cares if we're on the same team?

842
00:51:09,055 --> 00:51:11,931
We act like we don't know
each other in the company anyway.

843
00:51:13,096 --> 00:51:14,222
What?

844
00:51:16,764 --> 00:51:17,680
All right.

845
00:51:18,764 --> 00:51:19,847
I said, all right!

846
00:51:20,305 --> 00:51:21,263
Yes, okay...

847
00:51:25,472 --> 00:51:27,263
What a rude boy!

848
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:31,889
He's my one and only nephew,
and he acts like I don't exist!

849
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,305
So frustrating!

850
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:38,722
Our new arrivals are over there.

851
00:51:38,847 --> 00:51:39,931
Really?

852
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,931
I want to see all of them!

853
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,931
Here's what you wore earlier.

854
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:49,388
I'm not wearing that. Throw it away.

855
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:52,430
A son of the Jinsung Group
is in our team?

856
00:51:57,889 --> 00:52:02,013
"She Was Pretty"

857
00:52:02,263 --> 00:52:03,555
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

858
00:52:06,263 --> 00:52:08,639
-Yes, Miss Cha.
-I need the delivery right away.

859
00:52:08,764 --> 00:52:09,931
Yes, I understand.

860
00:52:17,847 --> 00:52:18,805
Thank you...

861
00:52:22,388 --> 00:52:25,305
I thought you were incapable,
but I see that you're blind too.

862
00:52:35,388 --> 00:52:37,972
Was he talking down to me again?

863
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:42,096
Why is he trying to get on
my nerves since earlier today?

864
00:52:42,722 --> 00:52:44,514
Does he take me for a fool?

865
00:52:45,055 --> 00:52:46,472
Excuse me, Mr Ji!

866
00:52:55,931 --> 00:52:57,013
What was that?

867
00:52:58,096 --> 00:52:59,055
Excuse me.

868
00:52:59,347 --> 00:53:00,430
Mr Ji.

869
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:03,012
Mr Ji. Mr Ji!

870
00:53:06,847 --> 00:53:07,889
Blood...

871
00:53:11,764 --> 00:53:12,889
Do you have something to say?

872
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,096
What?

873
00:53:15,222 --> 00:53:16,263
Oh, yes.

874
00:53:16,514 --> 00:53:18,138
I have lots to say.

875
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,722
First off, I apologize for the mistake
I made at the set yesterday.

876
00:53:24,764 --> 00:53:27,722
But, I'm not here because
I want to be here.

877
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:31,597
I was requested directly by your team,
which is why I'm here now.

878
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,014
Therefore, I didn't even have the time
to realize what my role is here,

879
00:53:34,096 --> 00:53:36,722
and how I'm supposed to contribute
in the meetings.

880
00:53:36,805 --> 00:53:39,305
But not knowing half of it,
you continue to criticize me...

881
00:53:39,472 --> 00:53:42,222
...by talking about wasted oxygen,
or my poor eyesight,

882
00:53:42,305 --> 00:53:46,305
me being a kindergartener,
and I find it offensive!

883
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:48,013
What did you want to tell me?

884
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:54,639
Forget it then.

885
00:53:56,722 --> 00:53:57,639
Mr Ji!

886
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:00,055
Mr Ji!

887
00:54:01,263 --> 00:54:04,013
So, I...

888
00:54:04,597 --> 00:54:08,597
Oh, I'm sorry about the studio yesterday.

889
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:10,555
But...

890
00:54:11,013 --> 00:54:13,013
I don't want you to think I'm an idiot.

891
00:54:15,764 --> 00:54:17,138
It feels a little unfair.

892
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,055
You see, I'm from the Management Team...

893
00:54:21,138 --> 00:54:22,222
Are you from overseas?

894
00:54:22,722 --> 00:54:23,889
What?

895
00:54:24,138 --> 00:54:25,013
No.

896
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:29,430
Then why do you stutter?

897
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,096
Do you have a speech impairment?

898
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:37,931
Why don't you gather your thoughts
and summarize it within three minutes?

899
00:54:38,388 --> 00:54:41,012
I hate people who waste my time.

900
00:54:42,222 --> 00:54:45,933
I understand that you're upset
because of my mistake yesterday.

901
00:54:46,013 --> 00:54:46,931
It's good that you know.

902
00:54:47,222 --> 00:54:48,096
What?

903
00:54:49,597 --> 00:54:50,597
No...

904
00:54:51,138 --> 00:54:54,388
Why are you so mean to me?

905
00:54:55,012 --> 00:54:58,096
You're not very capable, unprofessional,

906
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,138
and your name is Kim Hyejin!

907
00:55:01,096 --> 00:55:03,055
That name is too good for you!

908
00:55:03,424 --> 00:55:06,055
Wherever you're from,
this is your team now.

909
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,722
They don't want you there, and you
can quit if you don't like it here.

910
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,764
Please! I'll fire you if you want me to.

911
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:22,055
Do you have a speech impairment?

912
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,933
I thought you were incapable,
but I see that you're blind too.

913
00:55:25,013 --> 00:55:26,013
Leave, now.

914
00:55:26,138 --> 00:55:28,013
You're wasting the oxygen in here.

915
00:55:31,805 --> 00:55:34,597
He's no longer the sweet
Sungjoon that I used to know!

916
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:35,764
Forget those memories!

917
00:55:35,847 --> 00:55:36,972
It doesn't get you paid!

918
00:55:37,096 --> 00:55:38,347
First love, my foot!

919
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,972
You're just a stranger to me now!

920
00:55:43,972 --> 00:55:45,272
You can quit if you don't like it here.

921
00:55:45,388 --> 00:55:46,931
I'll fire you if you want me to.

922
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:49,222
I'll fire you.

923
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:50,472
Fire me?

924
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,555
You, fire me?

925
00:55:52,388 --> 00:55:54,096
I will never leave this company!

926
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,180
I won't let someone like you fire me!

927
00:55:58,764 --> 00:56:02,138
He said he'll be back at around 2:00 PM.

928
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:08,805
Wait a minute.

929
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:10,889
Move, move!

930
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:13,012
What the...

931
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,055
What's this?

932
00:56:17,722 --> 00:56:20,096
Chief, stop!

933
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:23,096
Stop, stop, stop!

934
00:56:44,722 --> 00:56:45,847
Did you have a nice lunch?

935
00:56:46,222 --> 00:56:48,722
I'm sure that you did.
I'll see you again in three months!

936
00:56:56,263 --> 00:57:00,012
Her new team must be stressful.

937
00:57:03,514 --> 00:57:05,972
Chief Kim Rara is
the chairman's sister...

938
00:57:06,305 --> 00:57:09,680
...so the son of Chairman
Kim Taesup is in our team.

939
00:57:10,096 --> 00:57:14,305
They own construction, finance,
and even a baseball team!

940
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,388
And he's here, right in my office?

941
00:57:18,347 --> 00:57:20,555
It's not Kim Poongho, is it?

942
00:57:20,889 --> 00:57:22,347
Disgusting.

943
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,472
No, it cannot be him!

944
00:57:26,012 --> 00:57:26,889
Kim Joonwoo?

945
00:57:27,305 --> 00:57:28,555
Is it really him?

946
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:32,639
Yes, he always wears expensive
clothes and he looks rich.

947
00:57:34,555 --> 00:57:36,805
Besides those two, who else...

948
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:40,933
So you bought another outfit
in the middle of the day?

949
00:57:41,013 --> 00:57:42,514
Don't tell me it's Kim Shinhyuk?

950
00:57:42,597 --> 00:57:43,847
You're amazing, seriously.

951
00:57:44,388 --> 00:57:45,388
Bravo.

952
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:48,972
He doesn't look wealthy at all.

953
00:57:49,722 --> 00:57:50,764
Who is it?

954
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,555
I need to snag him before
the word gets out...

955
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:54,263
...and some other girl goes after him!

956
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,222
Ciao!

957
00:57:58,055 --> 00:57:59,722
Hey, my cutie Joonwoo?

958
00:57:59,805 --> 00:58:00,680
Yes!

959
00:58:00,764 --> 00:58:01,889
My babies...

960
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:03,597
Grazie.

961
00:58:04,305 --> 00:58:06,430
That blew off some steam...

962
00:58:08,305 --> 00:58:09,388
My dear?

963
00:58:10,013 --> 00:58:13,055
Oh right, everyone open up
their evening schedule tonight.

964
00:58:13,347 --> 00:58:16,305
We will have a company dinner
to welcome Mr Ji here.

965
00:58:16,597 --> 00:58:18,305
A very Most-esque party!

966
00:58:18,514 --> 00:58:19,597
I don't have time tonight.

967
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,680
I'm busy.

968
00:58:21,013 --> 00:58:22,472
Really? Then tomorrow...

969
00:58:22,555 --> 00:58:24,722
Not tomorrow either, I have plans.

970
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:26,222
Really? The day after then?

971
00:58:26,347 --> 00:58:28,347
Not for the time being.

972
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:30,096
Really? Then when?

973
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,263
Why don't you set aside some time?

974
00:58:34,347 --> 00:58:37,096
It's my welcome,
so I think it's my decision.

975
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,013
If you'd excuse me, I have a meeting.

976
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,597
Mr Ji, Mr Ji!

977
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,055
He must be real busy...

978
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:48,012
There's always another day!

979
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:49,430
We'll do it next time.

980
00:58:49,805 --> 00:58:51,639
Very Most-esque.

981
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:08,933
See, did you see that?

982
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:11,847
Did you see how he
treated the chief editor?

983
00:59:12,055 --> 00:59:14,055
He's so rude, that Ji Sungjoon.

984
00:59:14,138 --> 00:59:16,012
You got that right. Really rude.

985
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,847
He acts like he was born a hotshot.

986
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,138
And everyone says he's all that,

987
00:59:21,222 --> 00:59:25,764
but if you look at him closely,
he's not much.

988
00:59:26,555 --> 00:59:30,680
And his personality is weird too!
A complete weirdo!

989
00:59:31,597 --> 00:59:35,472
Is he some kind of chicken breast
or scone? Why is he so stuffed?

990
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,263
And does he think he's actor Choi Minsoo?

991
00:59:37,347 --> 00:59:39,012
What was that crazy hourglass all about?

992
00:59:43,222 --> 00:59:44,514
My stomach, my stomach hurts...

993
00:59:44,597 --> 00:59:45,555
Hello?

994
00:59:46,055 --> 00:59:47,012
Yes, yes.

995
00:59:47,347 --> 00:59:49,597
Well, let me explain...

996
00:59:50,764 --> 00:59:51,639
...Mr Ji.

997
00:59:52,012 --> 00:59:52,889
So...

998
01:00:14,012 --> 01:00:17,931
Why did Kim Hyejin go crazy earlier?

999
01:00:27,931 --> 01:00:29,555
You must promise me in advance.

1000
01:00:30,305 --> 01:00:34,972
The team members must not
find out what I'm about to say.

1001
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:42,764
In three months, The Most Korea
will be shut down.

1002
01:00:44,847 --> 01:00:47,096
What? Shut down? What do you mean?

1003
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,555
The main branch in New York
has already made their decision.

1004
01:00:50,138 --> 01:00:53,347
The Most will not be circulated
in Korea after three months,

1005
01:00:53,722 --> 01:00:56,847
and the team will be relegated
to other departments.

1006
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,263
That's...

1007
01:01:00,472 --> 01:01:01,514
What are you saying?

1008
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,305
But there is a way.

1009
01:01:04,055 --> 01:01:06,680
If we can become number one
again within three months...

1010
01:01:07,013 --> 01:01:08,347
...we will continue this branch.

1011
01:01:08,805 --> 01:01:10,180
And that's why I'm here.

1012
01:01:11,388 --> 01:01:14,180
I've researched our reporters
before I arrived here.

1013
01:01:14,847 --> 01:01:17,012
They are all very distinct
and capable editors...

1014
01:01:17,096 --> 01:01:21,514
...so we have the talent here to succeed.

1015
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,931
I'm going to bring out
the best from them.

1016
01:01:25,388 --> 01:01:29,222
In order to do so, you'll have to
leave everything in my hands.

1017
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:33,138
If a magazine with a history
of 20 years is canceled...

1018
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:37,555
...our team will have a hard time
being accepted anywhere else.

1019
01:01:38,555 --> 01:01:40,764
And I won't have anywhere
to return either.

1020
01:01:41,096 --> 01:01:44,555
Then proceed as we discussed,
and I'll report back to New York.

1021
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:46,555
Yes, we'll do that.

1022
01:01:46,931 --> 01:01:48,722
Did she really resign?

1023
01:01:49,347 --> 01:01:50,555
Manager Min?

1024
01:01:54,013 --> 01:01:56,222
The guest in 701
was thankful for the repairs...

1025
01:01:56,305 --> 01:01:58,263
...and they sent us some snacks.

1026
01:01:58,555 --> 01:01:59,722
Okay, thanks.

1027
01:02:07,847 --> 01:02:10,180
I asked you for this earlier...

1028
01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:29,012
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

1029
01:02:29,597 --> 01:02:30,847
-Hello.
-Hello.

1030
01:02:31,138 --> 01:02:32,263
Kim Hyejin!

1031
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:56,931
"She Was Pretty"

1032
01:02:57,722 --> 01:03:01,597
I wonder what I'm doing here!

1033
01:03:02,514 --> 01:03:05,305
He was about to find out,
and my heart dropped!

1034
01:03:05,388 --> 01:03:07,013
He must never find out!

1035
01:03:07,222 --> 01:03:08,388
Why are you so excited?

1036
01:03:08,472 --> 01:03:11,347
I normally get everything I want.

1037
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:14,639
What's this? Why are you driving?

1038
01:03:14,931 --> 01:03:15,805
What do you do here?

1039
01:03:15,889 --> 01:03:17,305
Can't you do anything right?

1040
01:03:17,388 --> 01:03:19,388
How can you make
such a ridiculous mistake?

1041
01:03:22,388 --> 01:03:23,514
Yes!

1042
01:03:24,764 --> 01:03:25,639
We're even.

1043
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:29,514
How do you think it would have been
if you'd just met him that night?

1044
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,013
About Ji Sungjoon...

1045
01:03:31,805 --> 01:03:33,388
Don't worry about me.

1046
01:03:33,972 --> 01:03:35,305
You go and apologize...

1047
01:03:35,805 --> 01:03:36,764
I'll give you three minutes.

1048
01:03:37,138 --> 01:03:38,847
Aunt!

1049
01:03:38,931 --> 01:03:42,639
Why do you talk like you've
known him all your life?

1050
01:03:43,597 --> 01:03:45,012
It's a secret!

1051
01:03:45,263 --> 01:03:46,472
Do you know who I am?

1052
01:03:46,555 --> 01:03:48,931
You'd probably be surprised!

1053
01:03:49,012 --> 01:03:50,263
What? Say that again!

1054
01:03:50,805 --> 01:03:51,722
What did you just tell me?

1055
01:03:51,805 --> 01:03:55,972
I'm the one and only Kim Hyejin!
Kim Hyejin!

1056
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,055
"She Was Pretty"

1057
01:04:01,263 --> 01:04:05,305
"She Was Pretty"
