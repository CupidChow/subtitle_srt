1
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,221
I feel so bad.

2
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,373
You've lost so much weight.

3
00:00:50,536 --> 00:00:52,875
Why did you have to overwork yourself?

4
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:54,741
No.

5
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,542
I'm really okay.

6
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:06,498
Isn't this mine?

7
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:09,300
I saw that Princess had it.

8
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:14,054
When did you come by?

9
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:16,065
I was there last night...

10
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:20,002
...because I wanted to see you.

11
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:22,812
It was too late, so I held back.

12
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:26,857
But not anymore.

13
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,783
When it comes to good things...

14
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:34,015
...things I want to see and hold...

15
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:38,534
...I'm not holding back any longer.

16
00:01:57,655 --> 00:01:58,748
This is nice.

17
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:08,745
Mamma Mia!

18
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:11,425
It's the chief editor!

19
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:14,367
Deputy chief editor Ji?

20
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:18,253
Oh, my dear!

21
00:02:18,775 --> 00:02:20,004
My goodness!

22
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:21,596
You're here?

23
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:23,588
Mamma Mia!

24
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,680
My poor Mr Ji!

25
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,639
Oh, my goodness!

26
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:30,657
Look at what's happened
to your perfect complexion!

27
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:33,059
You've lost your glow!

28
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:35,256
You look like a dried up orange peel.

29
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:39,625
Your face looks miserable!

30
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:41,244
I'm fine.

31
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,511
It's not okay at all!

32
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:48,735
Seeing you like this breaks my heart.

33
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:53,091
What's that?

34
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:54,934
I heard something.

35
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:56,507
It's coming from there.

36
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:59,285
Does a fairy live in there?

37
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:01,726
Is it a fairy?

38
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:04,855
I made that sound.

39
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,070
I do this whenever I'm cold...

40
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,020
Oh, my! You're feeling cold?

41
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,202
I'm a human heater.

42
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:13,826
Come to me. Here...

43
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,201
I'm fine now.

44
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:17,062
I'm actually feeling hot now.

45
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:19,015
I'm not in the best condition right now.

46
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:20,893
You're hot?

47
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:23,108
-Then you should...
-I'm fine now.

48
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,248
You'll need to cool off.

49
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:26,192
-No, I'm okay now.
-My goodness.

50
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:28,402
You're a complete mess right now.

51
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:32,477
I have no doubt that you'll take
The Most...

52
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:34,799
...to the number one rank.

53
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:36,892
So, don't overexert yourself.

54
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,422
I'll be here as support for you, too.

55
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:42,655
I don't want to brag...

56
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:45,893
...but I have a lot of connections.

57
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:48,195
When it comes to people...

58
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:52,319
They cower in my presence.

59
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:59,575
Thank you, Chief Editor.

60
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:01,328
Of course.

61
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:05,888
I want to stay with you all night
because I have healing hands.

62
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,005
But I have a previous engagement.

63
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:10,096
You should get some rest, too.

64
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:13,231
Okay, then.

65
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,584
Get some rest.

66
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:17,690
Goodbye.

67
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,540
Oh, but my dear...

68
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:28,987
...I have to admit that you in
the hospital gown isn't very Most-esque.

69
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:31,995
Get well soon and come back to me.

70
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,981
Most-esque, like before.

71
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,975
Okay?

72
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,576
My goodness.

73
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,575
Did she leave?

74
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:02,956
Yes.

75
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:06,787
Kim Hyejin, you're a closet maniac.

76
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:08,873
Last time, you were hiding in my closet.

77
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,095
My dear...

78
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:13,339
I was so nervous!

79
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:35,107
What are you doing?

80
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:38,378
What's wrong with your eyes and your lips?

81
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:41,048
What?

82
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:46,592
I was going to ask you
to hold this for me.

83
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:55,121
Don't tell me that you thought
I was going to kiss you again?

84
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,128
No, of course not!

85
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:01,711
Kim Hyejin, I thought you
just liked closets

86
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:03,458
but it seems you're
a kissing maniac, too.

87
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:05,177
No, I'm not!

88
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:08,341
The reason I was closing my eyes...

89
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:31,872
Goodness.

90
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:33,536
A bird pooped on me.

91
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:40,745
I'm going to be late!

92
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,666
Hari, join us for dinner
at the copy store later, okay?

93
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:45,377
It's our family's most special day today.

94
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:48,999
-Your parents' anniversary?
-Yes.

95
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:52,575
But I'm supposed to go
to my friends' farewell party.

96
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:54,055
I guess you can't make it, then.

97
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:55,088
See you!

98
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,744
-I'll call you if I postpone it.
-Okay!

99
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,009
Jackson, good morning.

100
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:10,620
Are you doing well?

101
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,711
Yes.

102
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:24,895
Your stomach is not feeling well?

103
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:26,003
What?

104
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:27,878
It wasn't me.

105
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:30,144
What are you doing?

106
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:37,403
-What's that?
-What the...

107
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:40,880
You don't feel well, do you?

108
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,265
-No...
-My goodness.

109
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:43,647
Mr Kim!

110
00:07:44,455 --> 00:07:45,726
It's not me!

111
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:47,295
I said it isn't me!

112
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,124
It's not me!

113
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,976
What was that about, Mr Kim?

114
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:56,858
People thought it was me!

115
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,598
Why would you play a joke like that?

116
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:02,252
-Yes, there's the Jackson I know.
-What?

117
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:04,135
Let's continue to be
comfortable with one another.

118
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:07,110
I don't want things
to be awkward between us.

119
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,655
Let's not do that.

120
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:09,897
It's so uncool.

121
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:14,244
Mr Kim.

122
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:19,279
I'm just happy that I met
a great little sister like you.

123
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:21,872
So, be comfortable.

124
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:23,483
And relax...

125
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:24,698
Okay?

126
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:26,481
Okay?

127
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:30,193
Okay.

128
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,010
Comfortably.

129
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:37,050
What did Mr Ji do to deserve
a great girl like you?

130
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:43,147
If you have any problems with him,
just let me know.

131
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:45,696
I'll teach him a lesson.

132
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,305
Got it?

133
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:06,903
I fell down.

134
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:26,553
Oh, it's so bright.

135
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,301
-How are you?
-Have you arrived?

136
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:32,020
Good morning everyone.

137
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,151
Are you okay?

138
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:34,507
You should get more rest.

139
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,166
I'm feeling great.

140
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:40,880
Let's have another great day
and make something happen.

141
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:42,111
Good day, everyone!

142
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,695
Am I the only one who heard that?

143
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,987
Was he whistling just now?

144
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:50,692
What's the matter with him?

145
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:55,703
Earlier, I saw him hit his head
on the glass really hard.

146
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:01,222
Something smells fishy here.

147
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,695
Those are tell-tale signs
of someone who's in love.

148
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:09,633
I wonder what kind of women
he's attracted to.

149
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:10,936
I know, right?

150
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:13,148
I wonder who he's seeing.

151
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:14,626
I'm so curious.

152
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,129
I'll get that for you.

153
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:36,181
You're smiling again!

154
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:42,346
Here's your mail.

155
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:45,603
Please stop making it so obvious, Mr Ji.

156
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:48,310
What are you talking about?

157
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:49,655
What's so obvious?

158
00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:52,335
You keep smiling like someone
who's lost his mind.

159
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,680
And you're whistling like you don't care.

160
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,407
People are wondering
if you have a girlfriend

161
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:59,279
and what kind of women
you're interested in.

162
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:02,645
So, you don't want anyone
to know about this?

163
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,629
If they know, it'll get really awkward.

164
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:07,243
Please act like usual,
like everything is normal.

165
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:10,152
How do I usually act?

166
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:11,686
You know!

167
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:14,851
You flip this ridiculous
hourglass all the time.

168
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:16,295
And you make everyone angry
with your spiteful remarks.

169
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,105
Like an insolent, horrible lunatic!

170
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:22,312
Right.

171
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:28,055
I guess I've always been
an insolent, horrible lunatic.

172
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,255
No...

173
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:32,815
I'm not saying that
you're always like that.

174
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:35,175
Anyways, act normal, okay?

175
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,979
Besides that, have you
completely recovered now?

176
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:41,536
As you can see.

177
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,620
Think about your health,
and watch your coffee intake.

178
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,810
From now on...

179
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:47,647
...you're limited to three cups a day.

180
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,285
Excuse me now.

181
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:52,994
Don't make it obvious.

182
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:56,012
Cut down on coffee.

183
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:00,246
And don't open the blind, ever!
You'll make it obvious!

184
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:10,122
She's adorable.

185
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:23,556
I have one cup left.

186
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,476
I think we should do
an article on ateliers

187
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:32,479
of designers based on
the Seoul collection.

188
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,158
-What are your thoughts?
-I think it's a great idea.

189
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:37,326
Then, I'll separate by designers

190
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:39,827
and look for some more
interesting concepts.

191
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:43,034
Ms Cha, I'll put you in charge
of the arrangements.

192
00:12:43,134 --> 00:12:44,055
Yes, sir.

193
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:47,971
How did such an introverted kid
grow up to be like him?

194
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,895
It never ceases to amaze me.

195
00:12:57,335 --> 00:12:58,645
Next, the Features Department.

196
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,029
What was that just now?

197
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:09,084
Were you giggling over there?

198
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:13,604
Oh, I'm sorry.

199
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:16,957
I ask that you focus during the meeting.

200
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:18,557
You're throwing us all off.

201
00:13:19,895 --> 00:13:21,713
That'll conclude our meeting for today.

202
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:24,483
Good work everyone!

203
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:29,364
Hyejin, are you dating someone?

204
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:30,673
What?

205
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:32,692
I know, right? Are you really in love?

206
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,602
-It's so obvious.
-What?

207
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:37,720
-What are you talking about?
-Come on. You're acting suspicious.

208
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:41,743
My goodness.

209
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,880
You're hopeless, Jackson.

210
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,606
Goodness!

211
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:13,426
It's so obvious
that you're seeing someone.

212
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:14,844
You look so happy right now.

213
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:16,005
While I'm miserable.

214
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:18,676
No, I think you're wrong.

215
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,805
No, I think I'm right.

216
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:29,971
And she told me not to make it so obvious.

217
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:41,799
Hey, I like how you acted back there.

218
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:43,486
Act?

219
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:46,495
What do you mean?

220
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:52,066
You scolded me in order
not to make it so obvious.

221
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,393
That wasn't an act.

222
00:14:54,706 --> 00:14:56,183
I was correcting you during the meeting.

223
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,273
So, you were really scolding me?

224
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,024
Were you disappointed?

225
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:08,531
I'm always serious during work.

226
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,586
No, of course not!

227
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,938
Work is work!

228
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,888
Still, a little...

229
00:15:16,946 --> 00:15:18,098
Never mind.

230
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:21,478
Is that supposed to be
American style, or what?

231
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,359
She's adorable!

232
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:36,095
This "Ten" is a complete monster!

233
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:38,915
This is more than simply enjoyable!

234
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:41,786
Poongho, can I borrow it after you?

235
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:43,266
Me, too. I want to read it.

236
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:44,426
After I'm done.

237
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:49,066
Joonwoo, you said that "Ten"
is a Korean woman in her 40s?

238
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:50,386
Yes.

239
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:51,918
I think you may be right.

240
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,946
I'm positive!

241
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,146
The backdrop of this story is Korea.

242
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:58,106
Really?

243
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:00,498
Then does that make the director
of the "Avengers" Korean,

244
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:01,995
just because they filmed in Korea?

245
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:07,346
If she wasn't Korean,
you couldn't come up with this stuff!

246
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,176
Get my drift?

247
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:14,212
But why does she call herself "Ten"?

248
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:17,248
I know, I wonder why her name's "Ten"?

249
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:22,789
Maybe because she plans
to retire after 10 novels.

250
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:28,674
No, no, no!

251
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:33,007
Why do you think it has
to do with the number 10?

252
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:34,626
Ten!

253
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:36,266
Ten, ten, ten...

254
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:38,832
Ten has many different meanings.

255
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:43,679
For example,
it can mean "here" in Spanish.

256
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:49,957
"Here it is!"
What do you suppose that means?

257
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:56,269
What do you think it signifies?

258
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:02,469
Forget it.

259
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:10,932
"Here it is".

260
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:16,660
Do you think the chief editor
knows something?

261
00:17:25,306 --> 00:17:27,427
Yes, it's your auntie.

262
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,724
Nephew, are you going
to meet me at 5 PM today?

263
00:17:29,986 --> 00:17:31,328
Don't be late.

264
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:35,146
Oh, my!

265
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:38,199
I can find out who the nephew is at 5 PM?

266
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:40,752
Oh, my! I'm so excited!

267
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,472
Oh, she's here!

268
00:17:48,572 --> 00:17:50,346
Oh, my! Oh, my!

269
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:52,175
Oh, my!

270
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,403
Wait, where's her nephew?

271
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,407
Seriously.

272
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,789
-Hey, Han Seol!
-Yes.

273
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:09,927
Gosh.

274
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:13,410
I told you to arrange the makeup,
not loaf around!

275
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,719
I got a little thirsty...

276
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:17,266
Hurry up.

277
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,203
Mr Ji will be reviewing
our work later today.

278
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:22,346
Then, please, let me stay here
for five more minutes.

279
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:24,288
-Just five more minutes.
-Don't be ridiculous.

280
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:25,291
Follow me now!

281
00:18:29,012 --> 00:18:30,020
Right here!

282
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,217
Nephew!

283
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:44,251
Why are you always
at least 10 minutes late?

284
00:18:47,186 --> 00:18:48,119
Let's eat.

285
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:53,468
Oh, I heard from my brother
that you'll be accepting the VP position.

286
00:18:53,906 --> 00:18:56,452
Are you finally coming back home?

287
00:18:58,226 --> 00:18:59,377
Bravo.

288
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:08,570
I'm headed home for the day, Mr Ji.

289
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:10,611
Why? Let's have dinner together.

290
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,789
I have to go to the print shop today.

291
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:14,340
Oh, right.

292
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:17,745
Wait, if you leave now,
I won't see you later today?

293
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:24,155
Nonsense.

294
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:26,502
My goodness.

295
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,826
Then, I'll see you tomorrow, Mr Ji.

296
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:30,820
-Let's go, I'll take you there.
-What?

297
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,980
It's okay, I know that you're busy.

298
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,306
I want to be with you a bit longer.

299
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:37,026
I get to get some fresh air, too.

300
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:39,208
-Let's go.
-Okay.

301
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,233
Go on inside.

302
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:48,636
You go first.

303
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,249
So, I won't see you again today?

304
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:56,504
That's nonsense.

305
00:19:57,786 --> 00:19:59,875
Why do you keep saying that?

306
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:02,426
I thought you only needed
to see me for 10 seconds at a time.

307
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:05,796
I was holding back that
time against my will.

308
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:09,506
What? The two of you are holding hands!

309
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:11,283
They're going out!
The two of them are going out!

310
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:13,906
-Kim Hyerin!
-Dad, they're going out!

311
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:15,186
Look, Dad!

312
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:17,058
Hey, Kim Hyerin!

313
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:28,039
If I knew about the occasion,
I wouldn't have come empty-handed.

314
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:29,971
-No!
-No!

315
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,266
We don't need gifts
between family members!

316
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:34,530
Of course not! Since we're family!

317
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,979
What are you talking about?
Why did you bring him in here?

318
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,706
Thanks for coming.
Since you're here, have dinner with us.

319
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:43,331
You need to have dinner,
even if you're busy.

320
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:46,259
No! He's really busy!

321
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,762
Yes, I'd love that.

322
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:54,684
Try this, too.

323
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:56,372
Try some of this, too.

324
00:20:56,472 --> 00:21:00,160
I didn't make it myself,
so it's really good.

325
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:01,586
-Thank you very much.
-Sungjoon.

326
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,845
Try some of the ribs, too!
It's really good!

327
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:05,829
And some of this.

328
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,973
Make sure you chew completely.

329
00:21:08,073 --> 00:21:10,847
Will you give him some space?

330
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:12,492
-Why?
-What's your problem?

331
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:13,757
Why are you jealous?

332
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,552
Here, try some of this meat.

333
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,748
A man needs meat for his strength.

334
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:21,873
And some of this, too.

335
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:26,066
Dig in...

336
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:27,706
Doesn't this look good, too?

337
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:29,516
I hope you like it.

338
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:31,646
Is it any good?

339
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:33,962
One more, open wide.

340
00:21:38,623 --> 00:21:39,560
Oh, right.

341
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:41,237
We didn't take any pictures.

342
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:44,737
We always take a picture
on my parents' anniversary.

343
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:47,666
Here, I'll take the picture.

344
00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:49,386
What are you saying, Sungjoon?

345
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:50,469
You have to be in the picture, too.

346
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:53,142
-Come here.
-Of course! We're not leaving you out.

347
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:56,634
Stop badgering him, will you?

348
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:58,116
There.

349
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,466
Hurry up and join us.

350
00:21:59,546 --> 00:22:01,185
Brother-in-law!
Let's take a picture together.

351
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:03,593
-All together.
-Come, come.

352
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:22,922
Sorry we wasted so much of your time.

353
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:25,173
Why was everyone overreacting?

354
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:26,287
Why?

355
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,782
I would've regretted it
if I didn't come along today.

356
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:31,916
Go back inside.

357
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:34,049
You need to be there
for their special occasion.

358
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:35,118
Okay.

359
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,389
Don't work too hard.

360
00:22:38,746 --> 00:22:39,751
See you tomorrow.

361
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:43,146
Hyejin.

362
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:44,189
Yes?

363
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:51,140
I'll call you.

364
00:22:51,426 --> 00:22:52,386
Okay.

365
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:53,711
Drive safely.

366
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,712
-Bye.
-Bye!

367
00:23:17,226 --> 00:23:20,076
Were you here with Hyejin?

368
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:21,944
Yes.

369
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:25,755
Go on inside.

370
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:28,362
Okay.

371
00:23:33,786 --> 00:23:35,015
-Well...
-Well...

372
00:23:38,746 --> 00:23:39,906
Can we talk for a moment?

373
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:45,447
That's what I was about to say.

374
00:23:49,786 --> 00:23:53,887
I'm sorry about that day at the hotel.

375
00:23:55,306 --> 00:24:00,524
And even more so before that day.

376
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,817
I wanted to personally
tell you that I'm sorry.

377
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:09,466
I'm sorry...

378
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:12,796
...for lying to you.

379
00:24:15,426 --> 00:24:18,095
I'm sorry that I didn't let you explain.

380
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:25,851
It was wrong for me not
to let you explain your position.

381
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:29,753
No, not at all.

382
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:33,493
I know that you thought I was Hyejin...

383
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:39,207
...but you helped me
through some hard times.

384
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,811
Thanks.

385
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:46,917
And again...

386
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:49,993
...I'm really sorry.

387
00:24:57,586 --> 00:24:59,348
I'm sure you're here to congratulate them.

388
00:25:00,026 --> 00:25:00,932
So, go on inside.

389
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:02,615
Yes, I should.

390
00:25:11,906 --> 00:25:12,968
See you.

391
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:20,830
Okay.

392
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:28,160
If I met you as Hyejin's friend...

393
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:34,098
...we may have become good friends, too.

394
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:41,089
Thanks for saying that.

395
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:49,575
I'm really going now.

396
00:26:01,946 --> 00:26:03,658
I thought you were
having a farewell party.

397
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:05,256
I postponed it until tomorrow.

398
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,870
I met Ji Sungjoon
in front of the house earlier.

399
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,064
You did?

400
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:14,313
I was able to talk to him.

401
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:18,306
I'd missed my chance
to tell him the truth...

402
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:22,579
...but I'm glad that I was able
to apologize to him.

403
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:45,724
Yes, Sungjoon.

404
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,506
I'm sorry,
but I'll have to call you back.

405
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:50,841
I'm brushing my teeth.

406
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:52,553
No, go on ahead. I'll wait.

407
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:55,858
I should brush my teeth, too.

408
00:26:57,146 --> 00:26:59,906
Oh, right.
I heard that you had a talk with Hari.

409
00:27:00,226 --> 00:27:01,426
I'm happy you did.

410
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:03,546
Yes. Is she still over there?

411
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,306
She's unemployed
and has a lot of free time,

412
00:27:05,386 --> 00:27:07,215
so, she decided to stay at
my parents' house for a few days.

413
00:27:07,315 --> 00:27:09,216
Gosh, she's like their daughter than me.

414
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:20,992
Oh, so until you left for college
you lived with your dad and your aunt?

415
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:26,544
Then you must be
really close with your aunt.

416
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:29,653
Yes. She was like a mom to me.

417
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,215
Wow! Red-bean waffles...

418
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:41,954
Hey, this is so funny!

419
00:27:42,054 --> 00:27:43,451
The spelling is all wrong!

420
00:27:45,986 --> 00:27:48,226
"Hyejin, I hope you get better."

421
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:50,703
But you wrote "better"
with one "T" instead of two.

422
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:54,697
What? I think Hari just came home.

423
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:56,094
Give me a second.

424
00:27:56,746 --> 00:27:59,391
I thought you were going
to spend the night there.

425
00:28:01,506 --> 00:28:02,462
Hello.

426
00:28:03,346 --> 00:28:06,729
What's this? We were just on the phone...

427
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:07,750
Wait.

428
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:10,055
I haven't seen this face in a while.

429
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:12,711
You're so cute.

430
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:17,718
Why did you come here?

431
00:28:18,986 --> 00:28:19,976
This.

432
00:28:21,306 --> 00:28:22,312
What's this?

433
00:28:22,922 --> 00:28:26,629
You were talking about
red-bean waffles earlier.

434
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:28,039
Weren't you craving it?

435
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:31,830
See you.

436
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:34,868
Wait...

437
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:40,231
To be honest, I was craving it, too.

438
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:44,784
It's so much better
when you share it with someone.

439
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:46,894
What's your blood type again?

440
00:28:47,786 --> 00:28:48,754
Type AB.

441
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:55,066
Oh, that must be why you go
from being an A to a B all the time.

442
00:28:55,146 --> 00:28:57,858
I don't go back and forth like that!

443
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,706
You do, when you're at work...

444
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:02,626
We finished it.

445
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:03,843
Good job.

446
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,901
This is a picture of me when I was 15.

447
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:56,245
-Sungjoon.
-Yes?

448
00:29:58,146 --> 00:29:59,238
What's this?

449
00:29:59,746 --> 00:30:01,014
Were we out here all night?

450
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:03,209
When did we fall asleep?

451
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:05,135
We need to get to work!

452
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:08,030
-See you later!
-Okay, see you later!

453
00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:20,073
Good morning.

454
00:30:20,173 --> 00:30:21,386
-Hello.
-Hi!

455
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:22,506
Hello.

456
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:23,515
How are you?

457
00:30:29,551 --> 00:30:31,226
-Good morning, Mr Ji.
-Good morning.

458
00:30:31,306 --> 00:30:32,563
Good morning.

459
00:30:48,153 --> 00:30:49,075
Mr Boo!

460
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:50,330
Oh, Hyejin...

461
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,466
Hyejin!

462
00:30:51,546 --> 00:30:53,546
Wow, you're so cool!

463
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:55,890
Hyejin, is this really you?

464
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,055
Yes it is!

465
00:30:57,386 --> 00:30:59,818
Yes, so Hyejin, what brings you here?

466
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:01,879
I'm here for the goods that we requested.

467
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:04,501
And I wanted to say hello
to the Management Support staff!

468
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:06,506
Thanks for coming!

469
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:09,607
Are you coming back to us in three weeks?

470
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:11,417
Excuse me?

471
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:16,538
There's only three weeks left?

472
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:17,755
Only three weeks?

473
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:19,679
It's a whole three weeks!

474
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:23,296
See, I've marked the calendar

475
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:25,960
and I'm counting down the days
until your return.

476
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,386
I can't wait until you come back to us!

477
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:35,520
Oh, there's only three weeks left...

478
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:38,700
What?

479
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,861
Look! I was right!

480
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:44,092
Ten really is Korean!

481
00:31:44,192 --> 00:31:46,386
-What?
-Really?

482
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:48,854
-Really!
-He's right.

483
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:51,774
It's trending at the top
of the search ranks right now!

484
00:31:51,874 --> 00:31:55,626
Someone asked Ten through
social media if she's Korean...

485
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:58,257
...and she responded that
she's Korean in the comments.

486
00:31:58,357 --> 00:32:00,768
Ten replied personally.

487
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:01,852
Really?

488
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:04,595
-My goodness.
-How patriotic.

489
00:32:05,386 --> 00:32:06,419
A patriot.

490
00:32:11,706 --> 00:32:12,666
Hi.

491
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:15,117
High five.

492
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:17,257
High five?

493
00:32:18,175 --> 00:32:19,118
Thank you.

494
00:32:19,386 --> 00:32:21,266
Excuse me. How can I help you?

495
00:32:21,346 --> 00:32:24,612
I'd like to see
the copy reader, Ji Sungjoon.

496
00:32:33,866 --> 00:32:38,085
If the 20 years of "The Most" Korea
vanishes for good...

497
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:41,116
...you will be remembered as a failure.

498
00:32:42,346 --> 00:32:44,066
You and your whole crew.

499
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:48,063
Then nobody will know
what is going to happen.

500
00:32:53,226 --> 00:32:56,146
Yes, I'll contact you
by tomorrow at the latest.

501
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:57,682
Yes.

502
00:32:58,426 --> 00:33:00,968
-What's happening?
-He's back, he's back.

503
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:02,636
Well, Mr Ji.

504
00:33:02,736 --> 00:33:04,974
What's going on?

505
00:33:05,426 --> 00:33:07,966
We've never had a visit
from headquarters before.

506
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,517
He's someone I've worked under.

507
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:14,146
It was simply an informal visit.

508
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,346
Don't let it concern you.

509
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,520
Well, Mr Ji.

510
00:33:17,226 --> 00:33:19,946
Kim Shinae wants to schedule
an interview with us

511
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:21,173
so what should I tell her?

512
00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:24,586
Since we're not sure about Leonard Kim,
we should forget about him...

513
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:26,043
That interview will not...

514
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:31,996
We cannot overtake
"New Look" with that interview.

515
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:34,226
Try to buy some time

516
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,877
and I'll personally speak
with Leonard Kim.

517
00:33:57,186 --> 00:33:58,760
Did he threaten to shut us down?

518
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,142
Oh, no...

519
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:02,880
It's fine.

520
00:34:03,306 --> 00:34:04,499
We'll just have to succeed.

521
00:34:22,466 --> 00:34:24,426
This is a 10-minute film
that Leonard Kim made

522
00:34:24,506 --> 00:34:25,784
while he was still in school.

523
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:28,017
After you review it,
let's discuss it together.

524
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:30,614
This is one of his unknown works

525
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:32,910
and it'll help us
to understand him better.

526
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:35,038
Hopefully, it'll make it easier
for you to approach him.

527
00:34:38,365 --> 00:34:39,395
Thank you.

528
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:45,609
But what will you do
if he refuses to work with us?

529
00:34:46,146 --> 00:34:47,659
This is our final opportunity.

530
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,663
We need to do everything
we can to raise our scores...

531
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:55,248
I mean, I'm risking everything
on this game.

532
00:34:56,786 --> 00:35:00,971
All right, we'll play this game
in order to win.

533
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:14,619
All you have to do is respond
with a fist bump of your own.

534
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:16,479
Mr Kim.

535
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:22,666
Thank you.

536
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:35,092
-Ms Cha!
-Yes?

537
00:35:35,192 --> 00:35:37,117
This is an article from
our foreign correspondents.

538
00:35:37,746 --> 00:35:38,729
Thank you.

539
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:41,054
Is there anything useful?

540
00:35:41,154 --> 00:35:42,415
Yes, there are several.

541
00:35:43,426 --> 00:35:44,637
But Ms Cha...

542
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:47,447
...have you heard the odd rumors
coming from headquarters?

543
00:35:48,186 --> 00:35:50,266
If we don't become the number one magazine
by the next issue

544
00:35:50,346 --> 00:35:53,968
"The Most" Korean branch
is to be shut down.

545
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:55,666
What?

546
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:56,930
What are you talking about?

547
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,463
Our foreign correspondents
were asking about our situation.

548
00:36:01,563 --> 00:36:02,819
Oh, my!

549
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:05,146
Is that why they came here
from the headquarters?

550
00:36:05,506 --> 00:36:08,141
Nonsense, why would
they shut down our office?

551
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:11,623
Shut down? Stop being ridiculous!

552
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:23,101
Okay, see you at 10.

553
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:29,011
Mr Ji, what's going on here?

554
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:31,186
Is it true that if we're not number one,

555
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:34,187
"The Most's" Korean branch
is to be shut down?

556
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:43,946
Yes, it's true.

557
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,228
Then why didn't you...

558
00:36:50,746 --> 00:36:53,095
How can you keep
something like this from us?

559
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:57,224
I made the judgment call
that it'd be best if you didn't know.

560
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:02,215
You've been here
for three months now, am I right?

561
00:37:03,146 --> 00:37:05,655
I've been working for
"The Most" for 13 years!

562
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:07,997
I've sacrificed my youth
for this publication

563
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:09,497
and now we may be shut down.

564
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:11,355
How do you think that makes me feel...

565
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:14,242
...to just be hearing about this now?

566
00:37:16,264 --> 00:37:17,226
Ms Cha...

567
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:21,778
If you respected me as a colleague,
you wouldn't have acted like this!

568
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:23,967
I've considered the positions
of all of the employees.

569
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:25,585
-However...
-No.

570
00:37:26,066 --> 00:37:27,857
You don't care about us.

571
00:37:28,306 --> 00:37:31,286
We weren't given any opportunities

572
00:37:31,386 --> 00:37:33,478
and we weren't even given
the choice to fight!

573
00:37:40,306 --> 00:37:44,021
Your judgment call was
an extremely selfish one.

574
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:50,444
Come out, all of you.

575
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,400
Ms Cha!

576
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,288
How can he let us down like this?

577
00:38:00,586 --> 00:38:03,825
He should've told us
so we can take precautions.

578
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:06,566
That's why he was being so strict.

579
00:38:07,346 --> 00:38:11,023
Still, thanks to the chief,
our sales have spiked.

580
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,916
All we need to do is
hit number one in sales.

581
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:15,509
Why don't we give it a shot?

582
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:18,299
He's so talented, so I'm sure
he can do it by himself.

583
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:21,060
All we have to do
is finish our articles, right?

584
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:22,453
Let's go, guys.

585
00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:25,415
Yes.

586
00:38:31,026 --> 00:38:32,018
Eunyoung, let's go.

587
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:36,081
Mr Kim...

588
00:38:49,644 --> 00:38:52,874
"Deputy Chief Editor
Ji Sungjoon"

589
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,373
Are you okay?

590
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:18,161
Yes, Hyejin.

591
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:24,511
Everyone is just shocked
at the situation right now.

592
00:39:25,384 --> 00:39:26,426
They'll be back...

593
00:39:26,506 --> 00:39:27,461
Well, Hyejin.

594
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:33,350
I'm sorry, but...

595
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:41,722
...can I be alone tonight?

596
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:47,001
I'm really sorry.

597
00:39:47,506 --> 00:39:49,166
Yes, okay. I understand.

598
00:39:50,946 --> 00:39:53,117
I'll get going then.

599
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:55,318
Yes, sorry again.

600
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:25,166
"She Was Pretty"

601
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:27,852
The concept of the magazine
will be like this.

602
00:40:29,586 --> 00:40:33,238
Specific directions will be discussed
with Leonard Kim.

603
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,746
As you can see, this proposal tells you

604
00:40:43,826 --> 00:40:46,458
how much we've been preparing
for this project.

605
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:49,133
Yes, we can coordinate
the interview however you like.

606
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:53,307
No, we can work around your schedule.

607
00:40:55,946 --> 00:40:58,719
Yes, I'll be waiting for your response.

608
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:03,952
Hi, this is Reporter Kim Shinhyuk
from "The Most" Korea.

609
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:04,985
Yes.

610
00:41:08,026 --> 00:41:09,290
Yes, I'll be waiting for your call.

611
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:14,866
You asked me for complete control...

612
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,082
...in order to run the team like this?

613
00:41:17,506 --> 00:41:18,986
Oh, dear.

614
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:23,186
This is far from being Most-esque.

615
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:24,696
Stupid.

616
00:41:25,906 --> 00:41:30,676
There are no right answers
in protecting something.

617
00:41:31,426 --> 00:41:33,661
I can understand that
there's a misunderstanding...

618
00:41:33,986 --> 00:41:36,226
...and I know you meant well.

619
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:40,672
But a little bit more
you should've trusted your teammates.

620
00:41:40,772 --> 00:41:43,678
No, if you had depended
on your team a little more,

621
00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:47,433
you could've avoided
all of this, my dear.

622
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,805
You don't care about us.

623
00:41:58,106 --> 00:42:01,910
Your judgment call was
an extremely selfish one.

624
00:42:02,546 --> 00:42:05,066
He's so talented, so I'm sure
he can do it by himself.

625
00:42:05,746 --> 00:42:09,107
I can't believe you did this to us.

626
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:12,002
You asked me for complete control...

627
00:42:12,786 --> 00:42:14,364
...in order to run the team like this?

628
00:42:28,355 --> 00:42:29,989
Allow me to escort you home.

629
00:42:31,146 --> 00:42:32,346
You're still here?

630
00:42:34,477 --> 00:42:35,869
Get some shut-eye on the way home.

631
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:38,097
I'll drive. You seem really tired.

632
00:42:40,986 --> 00:42:42,740
No, I'm okay.

633
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:50,143
I'm afraid you'll collapse again.

634
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:55,126
I won't leave you alone any more.

635
00:42:57,946 --> 00:43:00,980
You never had anyone to depend on.

636
00:43:02,466 --> 00:43:04,817
No one's able to solve
your problems for you...

637
00:43:05,226 --> 00:43:08,617
...and you were probably
afraid of being alone.

638
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:15,244
If something bothers you
from now on, tell me about it.

639
00:43:15,866 --> 00:43:18,565
If you decide to suffer,
we'll suffer together.

640
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:22,404
Stop trying to handle everything alone.

641
00:43:23,243 --> 00:43:25,933
Let's do this together, okay?

642
00:43:27,546 --> 00:43:28,978
Together, Sungjoon.

643
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:08,553
It's okay.

644
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,101
It's okay.

645
00:44:12,306 --> 00:44:14,169
Everything is going to be okay.

646
00:44:37,586 --> 00:44:38,907
Hello, Jackson.

647
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:40,537
Hello.

648
00:44:48,226 --> 00:44:50,293
-Yes.
-I understand.

649
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:03,635
Ms Cha, I missed you so much!

650
00:45:04,986 --> 00:45:07,858
What did I tell you
about me and sentimentality?

651
00:45:08,146 --> 00:45:09,429
Oh, yes.

652
00:45:10,266 --> 00:45:12,546
What made you return?

653
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,021
I didn't want to regret it later.

654
00:45:14,786 --> 00:45:18,225
Even if we get shut down,
I wanted to go down on my terms.

655
00:45:18,325 --> 00:45:19,269
I concur.

656
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:22,072
Mr Ji can't do anything
without me around.

657
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:23,616
So, I'm back.

658
00:45:31,172 --> 00:45:32,294
Good morning.

659
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:33,656
Good morning, Mr Ji.

660
00:45:34,986 --> 00:45:36,700
We're having a meeting in 20 minutes.

661
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,050
-Understood.
-Yes, sir.

662
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,181
Yes, sir.

663
00:45:41,226 --> 00:45:43,396
But everyone is back.

664
00:45:50,946 --> 00:45:51,892
Hello?

665
00:45:57,786 --> 00:45:59,277
Okay. Bye.

666
00:46:00,866 --> 00:46:01,911
Who was that?

667
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,162
Leonard Kim has called me back, and...

668
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:10,684
...he has agreed to do the interview.

669
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,261
-Really?
-This is great!

670
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:29,992
I thought of a feature concept
while I was away.

671
00:46:30,092 --> 00:46:33,346
As for me, I have
a thousand interview questions!

672
00:46:33,426 --> 00:46:35,053
That's nonsense! A thousand questions?

673
00:46:35,153 --> 00:46:36,509
I can tell no lie.

674
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:39,146
There are laws that govern fortune.

675
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:43,889
There's just as much good fortune
as there is misfortune.

676
00:46:44,506 --> 00:46:47,629
A brighter day follows the storm

677
00:46:47,729 --> 00:46:51,452
and we're reminded to stay strong
and push forward.

678
00:46:53,986 --> 00:46:55,466
Have your fill, Little Sister!

679
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,599
It's free!

680
00:46:58,201 --> 00:46:59,827
That wasn't the original intention.

681
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:01,890
Then what's the intention?

682
00:47:05,586 --> 00:47:06,506
Wait.

683
00:47:06,586 --> 00:47:10,099
Our website posted
a preview of Leonard Kim's interview!

684
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:12,570
-Let me see!
-Here, here.

685
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:17,768
Look at the number of views!

686
00:47:18,066 --> 00:47:19,836
He rarely holds interviews,

687
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:21,807
so people are already
looking forward to it.

688
00:47:22,226 --> 00:47:23,999
We're closing the distance with "New Look"

689
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:27,490
and now that we've secured Leonard Kim,
we're guaranteed the top spot!

690
00:47:28,066 --> 00:47:33,268
Honestly, I thought booking
Leonard Kim would be impossible.

691
00:47:33,616 --> 00:47:36,254
But Mr Ji really pulled it off.

692
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:39,081
But is everyone in on this?

693
00:47:39,181 --> 00:47:41,626
How did everyone return
in unison like this?

694
00:47:43,226 --> 00:47:46,748
Well, I don't know
if I should mention this.

695
00:47:47,026 --> 00:47:51,682
But my situation is a bit different.

696
00:47:52,146 --> 00:47:53,994
What do you mean?

697
00:47:54,527 --> 00:47:59,337
Mr Ji came looking for me,
and convinced me to stay.

698
00:47:59,437 --> 00:48:01,012
He was crying me a river.

699
00:48:01,306 --> 00:48:07,659
It practically flooded my neighbourhood
and people had to travel on boats.

700
00:48:09,546 --> 00:48:10,978
He came looking for me, too.

701
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:12,642
My neighbourhood, too.

702
00:48:12,742 --> 00:48:13,676
Mine, too.

703
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:16,760
Mr Ji visited each and every one of you?

704
00:48:18,306 --> 00:48:20,176
And I thought I was special.

705
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:22,415
Well, that's that.

706
00:48:22,515 --> 00:48:27,578
Now, that we're together again,
let's shoot for the number one spot.

707
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,410
Yes!

708
00:48:30,306 --> 00:48:34,159
Shall we toast to that?

709
00:48:35,605 --> 00:48:38,203
Let's salute instead, to be Most-esque.

710
00:48:38,466 --> 00:48:41,986
Yes, salute everyone, salute!

711
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:45,144
-Salute!
-Salute!

712
00:49:03,346 --> 00:49:04,626
I knew it.

713
00:49:04,706 --> 00:49:06,337
You're working over the weekend again?

714
00:49:06,866 --> 00:49:08,574
Don't starve yourself while working.

715
00:49:09,106 --> 00:49:12,259
And this is Leonard Kim's style
during his modeling days.

716
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:15,126
I wrote down some of my thoughts,
hoping it will be a bit helpful,

717
00:49:15,226 --> 00:49:18,376
upon watching his latest movies.

718
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:29,162
"Strength"

719
00:49:29,262 --> 00:49:30,277
Strength!

720
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:32,750
Wait.

721
00:49:33,026 --> 00:49:34,229
It's still warm.

722
00:49:42,706 --> 00:49:43,804
Hyejin.

723
00:49:47,273 --> 00:49:48,614
Why did you come outside?

724
00:49:48,714 --> 00:49:50,567
Go back to the office. Go back!

725
00:49:51,226 --> 00:49:52,628
Stay right there for a moment.

726
00:49:52,728 --> 00:49:53,673
What?

727
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:57,102
You'll enjoy it?

728
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:00,351
Yes, I hope you do!

729
00:50:01,026 --> 00:50:05,880
No, I'm telling you to stay right there.

730
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,550
You want me to stay here?

731
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:17,185
Why did you bring that out here?

732
00:50:17,285 --> 00:50:19,239
I don't eat as much as I did in the past.

733
00:50:19,706 --> 00:50:20,720
Let's eat together.

734
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,366
I made sure that you
had enough for dinner, too.

735
00:50:23,466 --> 00:50:24,466
Go back to work.

736
00:50:24,546 --> 00:50:25,956
I don't want to interfere your work.

737
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,474
Come on, let's eat together.

738
00:50:29,386 --> 00:50:30,266
Let's go.

739
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:32,487
Wait, where are we going?

740
00:50:33,186 --> 00:50:34,551
On a picnic!

741
00:50:35,506 --> 00:50:36,622
Hey!

742
00:50:44,066 --> 00:50:45,530
Wow!

743
00:50:49,386 --> 00:50:51,339
The air is nice.

744
00:50:52,506 --> 00:50:54,369
I shouldn't have come by.

745
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:55,878
I'm only bothering you.

746
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:58,624
Let's play hooky for just two hours.

747
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:00,780
Shall I try this?

748
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:02,923
It looks good.

749
00:51:09,786 --> 00:51:10,706
Why?

750
00:51:10,786 --> 00:51:12,066
It's that bad?

751
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:13,533
Gosh.

752
00:51:15,546 --> 00:51:17,050
How did you make this so tasty?

753
00:51:17,746 --> 00:51:19,746
-What?
-You're a closet maniac.

754
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,417
A kissing maniac.

755
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,950
And a cooking maniac as well?

756
00:51:24,346 --> 00:51:26,013
This is really good.

757
00:51:29,226 --> 00:51:30,373
Try this, too.

758
00:51:32,026 --> 00:51:32,986
This, too.

759
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:34,457
The pumpkin patties are really good.

760
00:51:35,506 --> 00:51:36,791
And after that, try some of this.

761
00:51:37,786 --> 00:51:39,220
I brought you some soup, too.

762
00:51:41,986 --> 00:51:43,106
What kind of soup?

763
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:44,484
Seaweed soup.

764
00:51:45,732 --> 00:51:47,033
It's like my birthday.

765
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:48,918
Here.

766
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:52,938
That was really good.

767
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:11,816
Wow! This is nice!

768
00:52:13,026 --> 00:52:14,179
Hello!

769
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:21,301
We're late, hurry up.

770
00:52:22,186 --> 00:52:23,289
Excuse me.

771
00:52:24,546 --> 00:52:26,209
You dropped this.

772
00:52:27,354 --> 00:52:28,698
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

773
00:52:47,234 --> 00:52:48,624
Where did she go?

774
00:52:52,195 --> 00:52:53,772
I left my phone behind.

775
00:53:06,626 --> 00:53:07,683
Boo!

776
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,239
Didn't I surprise you?

777
00:53:16,746 --> 00:53:17,632
What's the matter?

778
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:21,586
Did I startle you that much?

779
00:53:22,186 --> 00:53:23,785
I thought you disappeared.

780
00:53:24,106 --> 00:53:24,985
What?

781
00:53:26,506 --> 00:53:28,746
Why would I disappear?

782
00:53:32,266 --> 00:53:34,343
I found a really pretty place over there.

783
00:53:34,443 --> 00:53:36,151
Let's go. Hurry up.

784
00:54:09,026 --> 00:54:10,506
Look at the sparkling lake.

785
00:54:10,586 --> 00:54:11,741
Isn't it beautiful?

786
00:54:14,226 --> 00:54:17,591
The lake is making me feel calm.

787
00:54:37,706 --> 00:54:38,687
Sungjoon.

788
00:54:39,826 --> 00:54:41,873
We're almost there...

789
00:54:42,986 --> 00:54:44,931
...so you can stop sprinting now.

790
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:51,466
Stay calm, like this lake here...

791
00:54:55,786 --> 00:54:58,131
It's really chilly here.
Why is it so cold?

792
00:55:15,506 --> 00:55:16,619
Is this better?

793
00:55:17,186 --> 00:55:18,142
Yes.

794
00:55:20,826 --> 00:55:21,769
Hyejin.

795
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:22,935
Yes?

796
00:55:24,386 --> 00:55:28,548
I'm going to tell you something now.

797
00:55:30,906 --> 00:55:32,365
Tell me what?

798
00:55:34,266 --> 00:55:38,281
You may think I'm rushing it a bit.

799
00:55:39,866 --> 00:55:41,889
You might even think I'm crazy.

800
00:55:43,266 --> 00:55:45,266
Hey, you're starting to scare me...

801
00:55:45,826 --> 00:55:47,210
What's this about?

802
00:55:50,626 --> 00:55:55,973
After we're successful
with the 20th anniversary issue...

803
00:55:57,546 --> 00:55:59,254
...I'm going to propose to you.

804
00:56:08,346 --> 00:56:10,330
I'll do whatever it takes to succeed...

805
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:12,668
...and then I'm going to do it.

806
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:21,480
There are laws that govern fortune.

807
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:26,927
There's just as much good fortune
as there is misfortune.

808
00:56:27,027 --> 00:56:28,226
"Leonard Kim"

809
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:29,450
Are you cold?

810
00:56:33,626 --> 00:56:34,713
Try this.

811
00:56:41,226 --> 00:56:43,111
I hope we really succeed.

812
00:56:46,706 --> 00:56:48,290
Like you said...

813
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:53,615
...I really hope you successfully...

814
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,801
...save "The Most" magazine.

815
00:56:59,986 --> 00:57:01,047
I really do.
