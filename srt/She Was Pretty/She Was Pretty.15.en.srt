1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,100
"Episode 15"

2
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:02,065
It's all in there.

3
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:04,482
Who I am and the story of my life.

4
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:08,622
Write the article and publish it
in the 20th anniversary issue.

5
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,746
So you're the famous author, Ten.

6
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:18,595
And you'll reveal your identity through
an interview with The Most?

7
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:20,366
Bingo!

8
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,497
Oh, do you find it hard to believe?

9
00:01:27,342 --> 00:01:28,800
Does this look familiar?

10
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,593
Same handwriting, same pen.

11
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,580
Do you need more proof?

12
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,163
What else can I show you?

13
00:01:42,497 --> 00:01:45,538
You told the printers to halt production?

14
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:50,247
The recording should be enough
to write the article.

15
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:54,580
Take pictures.

16
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:57,745
You'll need a few shots for impact.

17
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,330
-Mr Kim.
-Make sure I look good.

18
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,829
I shaved just for this.

19
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:06,247
Smile.

20
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,600
Why are you revealing yourself?

21
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:12,788
To save the magazine?

22
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:15,745
Come on, take my picture.

23
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:17,121
Gosh!

24
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:20,166
I'll take selfies then.

25
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:33,038
Oh my, I look better in person.

26
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:35,767
Touch up the pictures, make me Most-esque.

27
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:40,205
You must have your reasons
for all this anonymity.

28
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:46,955
No secret lasts forever.

29
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:48,809
I might as well reveal mine...

30
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:51,163
...in the most Most-esque way possible.

31
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:55,538
What better timing than this?

32
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,580
You don't have to do this.

33
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:04,497
I thought you were a professional.

34
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:08,996
Don't make me doubt my decision
to come to you.

35
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:13,163
At first, I was going to ask Jackson.

36
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,538
Which reminds me,
you might not like the recording.

37
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:20,372
I thought I was giving it to Jackson,
so I was really informal.

38
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:23,205
I don't like being talked
about by strangers,

39
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,038
but I thought if it was Hyejin,
then it would be okay.

40
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:31,829
But you know what a softy she is.

41
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:35,745
She wouldn't have the heart to do it,

42
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:38,038
so I contacted you instead.

43
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:41,871
-Mr Kim...
-Write the article.

44
00:03:43,538 --> 00:03:44,788
Reach first place.

45
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:47,163
Save The Most.

46
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:49,330
That way...

47
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:55,746
Nobody won't cry.

48
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:01,580
What happens to you
if I write the article?

49
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:06,038
Won't this completely change your life?

50
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:12,038
It'll be chaotic for a while,
but it'll pass like all things do.

51
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,580
Doesn't matter. I'm okay.

52
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:19,955
But this is...

53
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:21,622
Please do this.

54
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:24,664
I want The Most to be the first...

55
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:27,746
...to publish an article about me.

56
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:30,497
Please.

57
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:35,038
Mr Kim.

58
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:45,746
Crazy!

59
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:49,580
How does this make any sense?

60
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:51,580
What on earth is going on?

61
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:53,915
How can I not be sorry at all?

62
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:55,372
Senior Poongho is our VP?

63
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:57,332
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

64
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:58,288
Unbelievable.

65
00:04:58,372 --> 00:04:59,913
I thought I was seeing a ghost.

66
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:01,829
Me, too. None of it makes any sense.

67
00:05:01,913 --> 00:05:03,996
-How is this possible?
-Ciao!

68
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:11,580
You... You!

69
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:15,455
I mean, Vice-president, how...

70
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:17,871
-What's going on, Senior?
-How could you do this to us?

71
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:19,705
This is so crazy.

72
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:20,788
This is a betrayal.

73
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:22,622
Attention!

74
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:26,622
My dears, I'm sure
you have many questions.

75
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:28,205
Oh Sole mio!

76
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:29,705
Yes, Aunt.

77
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,622
Go ahead with the formal introductions.

78
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:35,664
Thank you.

79
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:39,705
Hello, I'm Jinsung Magazine's
new Vice-president, Kim Poongho.

80
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:41,538
Hey, Kim Poongho.

81
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:44,205
How could you keep this from us?

82
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:46,746
-Yes, you should have told us.
-How could you?

83
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:49,913
Did you ask? No one asked me.

84
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:53,247
Wasn't it obvious?
I reek of privilege from head to toe.

85
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,580
Privilege? I don't see it.

86
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,372
Come on, where's the respect for your VP?

87
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:02,372
Anyway, can you ask your father
to save our department?

88
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,538
-Yes.
-Save our team.

89
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:05,538
Yes, right.

90
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:07,664
He says his hands are tied.

91
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:11,038
Headquarters already made the decision.

92
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,996
Why did you work here as a reporter?

93
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:17,497
I wanted to know
the inner workings of the company.

94
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:19,121
I have to run the business.

95
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:23,497
See, my heart is
in the right place, you know?

96
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:26,372
-Do you want to die?
-Miss Cha, calm down.

97
00:06:42,163 --> 00:06:43,288
Hey, Hyejin.

98
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:44,745
Where are you?

99
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:48,746
I had a meeting.

100
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:50,580
With whom?

101
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,705
Just someone.

102
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,121
Did you know our team
is in an uproar right now?

103
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:59,163
Brace yourself.
The new Vice-president is...

104
00:07:00,622 --> 00:07:03,163
Poongho! He's the chairman's son!

105
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:04,829
How is this possible?

106
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:07,288
The world is full of surprises, isn't it?

107
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,413
Yes, full of surprises.

108
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:17,288
Let's talk later.

109
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:36,413
Hi Jackson, listen well.
I'm going to tell you about myself.

110
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,497
My Korean name is Kim Shinhyuk,
and my penname is Ten.

111
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:43,288
But you already know this.

112
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:07,163
Hello?

113
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,288
Yes, about adding a new article
to the issue...

114
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:12,205
...it has been canceled.

115
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:15,038
Please proceed with the original draft.

116
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,038
Yes.

117
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:27,745
No!

118
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,788
What? What? What's wrong? What happened?

119
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:32,538
This is unbelievable!

120
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:33,913
What?

121
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,205
You know that aptitude test I took?

122
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:37,913
I got the results.

123
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:39,121
And?

124
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,497
What?

125
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:45,788
I quit that job because I was ashamed.

126
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:48,288
So why does everything lead me
back to being an hotelier?

127
00:08:50,788 --> 00:08:54,372
What was the point of me quitting then?

128
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:58,746
You were ashamed that
your dad got you the job.

129
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,788
It's not like you hated working there.

130
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:04,288
In fact, I'd say
that you rather liked it.

131
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:09,497
Well, I guess I didn't hate it.

132
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:12,330
Doesn't that mean you really like it?

133
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,372
I mean, you hate everything.

134
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,163
-You think?
-I do.

135
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,038
-Really?
-For sure.

136
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:30,121
Oh, good morning, sir.

137
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,746
"Exclusive Interview
with the author 'Ten'"

138
00:09:57,788 --> 00:10:00,580
This is...

139
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:04,163
Sir, I told you I wanted
the original draft.

140
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:06,413
How do you explain this print?

141
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:09,245
How many copies have been
distributed already?

142
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,538
Wow, The Most has a new interview.

143
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:15,622
Hey, it's an interview of Ten.

144
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:17,871
Wow, they must have
actually interviewed him.

145
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:20,038
Oh, it's Ten.

146
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:23,622
Mr Kim came by with the new article.

147
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:26,788
I tried to check with you,
but he said that you knew...

148
00:10:27,038 --> 00:10:28,829
...and that he'd take full responsibility.

149
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:41,038
Oh, the fruit of our labor
is finally here.

150
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,538
What? What's this?

151
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:47,205
Ten's exclusive interview?

152
00:10:47,288 --> 00:10:48,913
-What? Whose interview?
-Did you say Ten?

153
00:10:52,705 --> 00:10:54,205
Wait! Isn't this Shinhyuk?

154
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:56,455
What on earth?

155
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:57,955
Oh, my gosh.

156
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,829
Unbelievable.

157
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:01,413
What's going on?

158
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:03,121
Shinhyuk is Ten?

159
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,996
What did you say?

160
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:13,288
But Mr Kim isn't...

161
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:16,913
Today is a special day.

162
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:18,829
Why is today special?

163
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:23,205
You'll find out tomorrow.

164
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:27,639
Could it be?

165
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:30,330
Hello, this is the Ara Hotel.

166
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,913
Please connect me to room 2024.

167
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:35,413
That room is empty.

168
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,038
What? Isn't Kim Shinhyuk staying there?

169
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,497
He checked out of the room this morning.

170
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:52,163
Are you okay?

171
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:53,745
Were you shocked?

172
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,205
Sorry.

173
00:11:55,996 --> 00:12:00,664
You should've done it
so I didn't have to do it myself!

174
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:03,913
Don't come running to the hotel.

175
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,705
I won't be there.

176
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,413
See you.

177
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:08,745
Bye.

178
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,705
Oh mamma...

179
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:16,622
The pen was more than enough.

180
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:22,664
You didn't have to give me
such a huge gift, Shinhyuk.

181
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:28,288
He's a lunatic to the core.

182
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:37,788
Gosh, I'm bored.

183
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:40,538
"Popular searches: Ten's identity"

184
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:42,247
What is this?

185
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:44,655
"Famous author Ten"

186
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:45,785
What?

187
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:49,705
But room 2024...

188
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:54,080
-Are we absolutely sure?
-It's definitely Kim Shinhyuk.

189
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:58,330
I've been reading his writing?
This is shocking.

190
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:07,829
"Reporter Lunatic"

191
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:15,996
Hey, Hari. I'm a little busy right now.

192
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,829
Hey, what's up with Reporter Lunatic?

193
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,413
How do you know him?

194
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:24,913
He's the one I mentioned.

195
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:27,538
The one who lives in the suite.

196
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:31,788
He asked me not to say anything
to you for personal reasons.

197
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:36,745
I think he really cared about you.

198
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:47,955
-Hyejin.
-Oh, Sungjoon.

199
00:13:48,163 --> 00:13:49,580
Mr Kim is...

200
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,455
I know.

201
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,205
The issue is already on the stands, right?

202
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:57,829
What do we do now?

203
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,038
I have to meet with him.

204
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:01,580
He's staying at Hari's hotel...

205
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:02,996
He's already gone.

206
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:04,705
I checked.

207
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,955
Even so, I feel like I have to go.

208
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:15,871
What... is this?

209
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:19,372
A message that he left for you.

210
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:42,247
Hi Jackson, listen well.
I'm going to tell you about myself.

211
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:46,247
My Korean name is Kim Shinhyuk,
and my penname is Ten.

212
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:49,121
But you already know this.

213
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:51,745
What you don't know is
that I have another name.

214
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:53,247
David Joseph.

215
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,330
It's my English name.

216
00:14:56,788 --> 00:14:59,288
I was adopted when I was 12.

217
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:06,455
Please, keep your pity to yourself,
thank you very much.

218
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:10,080
As you can tell
by my great personality...

219
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,372
...I met great parents and grew up
in a loving household.

220
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,163
I was happier than
I can describe in words.

221
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:21,247
Oh my gosh. Hey, Mum.
You look even greater than before.

222
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:24,372
Really? Well, you look so handsome.

223
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,288
Yes, too sexy.

224
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:29,372
Dad, are you okay?
What happened to you these days?

225
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:32,080
You better gain some weight.

226
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,829
Well, David, I'll put on some weight...

227
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,080
...if you slow down
and stop drinking so much soju.

228
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:41,121
How have you been, Son?

229
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:42,788
I'm good. Everything's okay here.

230
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:44,497
-We love you.
-We miss you.

231
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,746
I miss you all.

232
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,924
I became an author by accident.

233
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:53,608
I posted some of my work online
when I was in high school.

234
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:56,024
And a publisher contacted me.

235
00:15:56,941 --> 00:16:00,733
They offered to publish it,
and I thought, why not?

236
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:05,316
But soon enough,
their focus fell on something else.

237
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:12,899
My background and age became
the main selling point for them.

238
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:16,316
All I wanted was to enjoy
doing what I loved.

239
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,899
But more and more people
wanted to control my writing.

240
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:27,149
After a while, I started to feel like
I wasn't myself anymore.

241
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,775
I realised I could continue
doing what I loved, if I hid myself.

242
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:34,898
My gender, my age, and my background.

243
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:37,858
So I started using
the mysterious name Ten.

244
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:45,441
I wanted my writing to
stand on its own, without prejudice.

245
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:49,566
Ironically, that meant
I had to hide myself.

246
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:52,149
That's why I chose
this life of anonymity.

247
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:55,982
I wanted to do what I loved most.

248
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,066
Jackson, you know my life's motto.

249
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,775
Do what's fun right now.

250
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,525
I started working for The Most
because I thought it would be fun.

251
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:11,108
Is that enough information
to write an article?

252
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:14,233
Okay, then I'll stop.

253
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:17,650
I leave the article to you, Jackson.

254
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:24,691
Thought I was done?

255
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:29,066
I feel like singing a song for you.

256
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,566
Testing. One, two, one, two.

257
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:36,483
Just kidding

258
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:39,024
Fell for it again? Of course you did.

259
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:46,982
How could he leave
without saying good-bye?

260
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:51,817
"Don't touch." What's this?

261
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,733
Come on, I even posted a note...

262
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:57,084
-Kim Shinhyuk.
-Saying "don't touch".

263
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:58,858
-Who was it?
-It's Shinhyuk.

264
00:17:58,982 --> 00:18:00,650
My money is on Joonwoo.

265
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:03,024
-Is it Shinhyuk?
-I thought everyone would be upset...

266
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:05,358
-It's Shinhyuk.
-If I didn't say good-bye.

267
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:08,441
And I'm a gentleman, as you know.

268
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:12,608
Miss Cha, I'm wasting
my breath saying this.

269
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,066
But you're the best.

270
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:16,691
Absolutely the best.

271
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:20,898
Ahreum, congrats on getting married.

272
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:23,650
He's one lucky guy.

273
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:25,483
Check beneath your chair.

274
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:32,858
Poongho.

275
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:35,941
You're dirty.

276
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:37,982
You smell, so please clean yourself.

277
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:40,108
-He's our new vice-president.
-Throw away the back scratcher.

278
00:18:40,191 --> 00:18:41,149
I'll pass on your message.

279
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:42,650
And to Joonwoo and Han Seol.

280
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:46,441
Stop being so obvious that you're dating.

281
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:50,108
It's way, too obvious. And cheesy.

282
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:53,066
And to our three lovely assistants.

283
00:18:54,191 --> 00:18:57,400
Hang in there
and join the ranks of the elite.

284
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:01,650
-Stay strong!
-Stay strong!

285
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:04,525
Dear Mr Ji who lives in apartment 502.

286
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:07,941
Did I surprise you?

287
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:09,899
Sorry.

288
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,608
Don't you regret not giving me
a few more undies?

289
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:15,608
Undies? What's he talking about?

290
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:17,941
I'm wearing it even now.
It's so silky smooth.

291
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,441
Undies.

292
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:22,982
Okay!

293
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:25,233
I should get going.

294
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,650
Everyone, take care.

295
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:30,691
Stay healthy.

296
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:32,733
And keep up the good work!

297
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:39,149
He didn't mention Hyejin.

298
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:45,858
Oh, right! I forgot someone.

299
00:19:46,358 --> 00:19:47,525
I almost made a huge mistake.

300
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:48,775
I knew it.

301
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:54,149
Chief Editor.

302
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:56,941
Did you like my final gift?

303
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:00,066
Please protect The Most...

304
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:05,316
...in your Most-esque way.

305
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,899
Okay.

306
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,274
I'm leaving for real this time.

307
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:14,525
Take care and be happy, okay?

308
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,608
-Okay.
-Okay.

309
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:19,733
Bye.

310
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:21,316
God bless.

311
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:26,233
But why didn't he leave
a message for Hyejin?

312
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:41,650
"She Was Pretty"

313
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,400
"Congratulations!
Most Korea Sales, a Record High!"

314
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:54,358
I'm not happy at all
that we placed first.

315
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:56,274
I know, right?

316
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:59,066
Did Shinhyuk leave Korea for good?

317
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,566
He disconnected his number.

318
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,898
Kim Shinhyuk...

319
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:05,108
He's so mean.

320
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:08,898
Hyejin, are you going back
to the management team?

321
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:12,858
Yes, tomorrow.

322
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,733
Why is everyone leaving us?
It'll be so empty.

323
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:19,899
It's so sad.

324
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,233
Then how about throwing a farewell party?

325
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,066
-Yes.
-A farewell party.

326
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:27,608
-Yes, let's do it.
-Farewell party.

327
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:29,400
What?

328
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,898
When did you come, Poongho?

329
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:37,400
I mean, Vice-president.

330
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:41,566
That office is so stifling,
like a prison cell.

331
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:44,691
So I'm going to start working here again.

332
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:47,899
What kind of VP are you?
How will you lead the company?

333
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:50,066
Shush before I whack your head.

334
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:52,024
-Go! Leave!
-Yes, leave now!

335
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:53,024
Just go!

336
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:55,941
But I'm ready
for Hyejin's farewell party...

337
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,982
...with my credit card.

338
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,358
Yes! It's a gold card!

339
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:03,566
-Buffet? Buffet?
-What are you craving?

340
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,858
Let's have a full-course meal.

341
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,817
-Yes, a full-course meal.
-A full course meal?

342
00:22:08,191 --> 00:22:09,400
Lobster? King Crab?

343
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:12,550
What's wrong with your hair, Poongho?

344
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:17,072
Back to number one. Really good work.
You can expect a reward.

345
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:21,380
-Now get ready to return.
-Okay, I got it.

346
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:30,391
"December's Sales Chart:
The Most, Rank Number One"

347
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:37,947
Are you okay?

348
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:39,989
You didn't refuse any drinks.

349
00:22:40,803 --> 00:22:43,511
How could I when it's my farewell party?

350
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:48,406
This is a secret, but I'm such a drinker!

351
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:50,156
Good for you.

352
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,331
Let's go talk.

353
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,748
Go ahead. I'll grab us some drinks.

354
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:56,831
Okay.

355
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:03,373
Where did she go?

356
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:08,373
What the...

357
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,039
The moon is bright tonight.

358
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:18,039
Mr Ji?

359
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:22,331
The moon is bright tonight.

360
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:28,831
Doesn't this situation
seem awfully familiar?

361
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:32,164
Let's go, Mr Slide.

362
00:23:43,414 --> 00:23:44,748
It's cold.

363
00:23:57,206 --> 00:24:00,581
Headquarters wants me to return.

364
00:24:01,997 --> 00:24:05,997
They've offered me
a better position than before.

365
00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:11,490
Really? That's my boyfriend!

366
00:24:11,623 --> 00:24:13,532
You're on your way up.

367
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,331
It's a reward for The Most placing first.

368
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:20,498
But it wasn't...

369
00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:23,748
...me that did all the work.

370
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:25,872
Without Mr Kim, it couldn't happen.

371
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:29,081
That's why...

372
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:32,871
...I'm going to turn down the position.

373
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:34,726
What?

374
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:38,706
I was going to propose to you
when The Most placed first.

375
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:43,206
I wanted it to be
when I could show you my best.

376
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:48,581
But it turns out that
this isn't that moment.

377
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:53,748
I'm going to go back.

378
00:24:55,122 --> 00:25:01,122
I might end up starting
from square one, all over again.

379
00:25:03,164 --> 00:25:08,498
The moment I'm waiting
for might not come for a while.

380
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:11,623
But Hyejin...

381
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:15,247
Will you still...

382
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:21,373
...stay with me?

383
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:24,539
Please...

384
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,581
...come with me.

385
00:25:34,456 --> 00:25:35,581
Okay.

386
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:38,664
I'll go with you.

387
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,872
Let's be together.

388
00:25:58,872 --> 00:25:59,831
Right.

389
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:03,206
Don't misunderstand.
This is not what you think.

390
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:07,122
-What?
-This is not my official proposal.

391
00:26:08,164 --> 00:26:10,164
The real one is going to be awesome.

392
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:13,039
Oh!

393
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:14,456
I'm looking forward to it.

394
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,039
But...

395
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:21,081
Isn't the moon bright tonight?

396
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,539
Stop making fun of me.

397
00:26:24,122 --> 00:26:25,914
Let's go down the slide.

398
00:26:27,122 --> 00:26:28,039
Let go!

399
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:33,664
-That's my slide.
-It's mine.

400
00:26:34,122 --> 00:26:35,581
Mine!

401
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:46,664
Thank you for everything.

402
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,834
Are you really leaving?

403
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:50,331
I'm so sad.

404
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:51,872
Please don't go.

405
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:53,623
Do you really have to go?

406
00:26:53,831 --> 00:26:55,872
-You really have to go?
-Hyejin.

407
00:26:59,122 --> 00:27:00,122
Good luck.

408
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:01,122
Thanks.

409
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:05,955
You should get going, Kim Hyejin.

410
00:27:07,331 --> 00:27:08,331
You did well.

411
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:10,706
Thank you. I'll visit often.

412
00:27:26,373 --> 00:27:27,664
You did well, Hyejin.

413
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:29,790
Miss Cha.

414
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:34,871
You seem completely different
from when you first arrived.

415
00:27:35,331 --> 00:27:36,331
You look good.

416
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,955
Thank you very much.

417
00:27:39,955 --> 00:27:43,706
I've learned so much from you.

418
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,373
Why do I feel so upset?

419
00:27:47,122 --> 00:27:48,955
Like I'm sending away my child.

420
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,331
Miss Cha.

421
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:53,247
Okay, that was sentimental.

422
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:54,623
Cancel that.

423
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,081
Take care.

424
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,289
Hello, Mr Park.

425
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:08,706
I'm back.

426
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,748
Oh, Hyejin!

427
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:12,373
-It's Hyejin.
-You came.

428
00:28:12,914 --> 00:28:15,997
I've been waiting for this day.

429
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:19,373
Welcome back. Let's all give her a hand.

430
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:21,539
-I'm glad you're back.
-Welcome back.

431
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:22,581
Thank you.

432
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:34,871
Here we go.

433
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:43,623
I'm back.

434
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:53,331
Mr Boo, what do you need me to do?

435
00:28:53,414 --> 00:28:55,871
Nothing. It's 6:00 and time to go home.

436
00:29:04,706 --> 00:29:06,997
It feels weird to be off work so early.

437
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:13,373
Mr Kim?

438
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,081
Mr Kim!

439
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:18,748
Mr Kim!

440
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:23,081
Oh, sorry.

441
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:30,997
I could've sworn it was him.

442
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:34,039
It looked like him.

443
00:29:41,872 --> 00:29:43,122
Did I see wrong?

444
00:29:58,748 --> 00:29:59,872
Hi, Jackson.

445
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:01,247
How have you been?

446
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:02,955
Mr Kim.

447
00:30:06,081 --> 00:30:07,748
What's going on?

448
00:30:07,914 --> 00:30:10,664
How could you disappear
without saying goodbye?

449
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:12,581
How could you do this!

450
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:15,373
And why...

451
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:18,664
Why didn't you leave me a message?

452
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:21,834
That's why I came in person.

453
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:23,871
Do you know how worried everyone is?

454
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:25,581
Where are you staying?

455
00:30:25,664 --> 00:30:26,872
Have you been eating?

456
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:28,706
Are you really okay?

457
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:31,456
You shouldn't have done this to yourself.

458
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:23,872
Morning, Jackson.

459
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:25,289
Want a bite?

460
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:27,373
What?

461
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:29,456
My front teeth...

462
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:33,039
I knocked them out.

463
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:37,081
My front teeth, I knocked them out.

464
00:31:48,664 --> 00:31:51,081
Oh, yes! That was perfect!

465
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,247
What are you doing, Jackson?

466
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:05,247
Let me find a job.

467
00:32:07,748 --> 00:32:08,748
Hey!

468
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,081
Jackson.

469
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,955
Oh, my, who used all my money?

470
00:32:57,664 --> 00:32:59,456
What are you calculating?

471
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:00,871
Eat.

472
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:07,456
I have so many expenses, but no funds.

473
00:33:08,414 --> 00:33:10,456
I have nothing left to sell.

474
00:33:12,414 --> 00:33:14,456
Sell that one. Over there.

475
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:22,289
No way, I bought this
with my hard-earned money.

476
00:33:22,623 --> 00:33:24,414
Is that so?

477
00:33:27,997 --> 00:33:32,373
But it feels nice to
spend the weekend together.

478
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:35,831
You had to work weekends when
you were working at the magazine.

479
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,331
But now, no more late nights.

480
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:40,790
Isn't it great?

481
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:43,289
Yes, I love it.

482
00:33:46,623 --> 00:33:51,414
How do I apply to get a student loan?

483
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,831
For what?

484
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:57,871
I'm going to graduate school
for hotel management.

485
00:33:58,289 --> 00:33:59,289
Really?

486
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:00,373
Yes.

487
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,247
I thought about what you said...

488
00:34:04,206 --> 00:34:06,289
...and I really do like the work.

489
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:09,872
So this time, I'm going to
learn it the right way.

490
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:13,997
I'm so proud of you.

491
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:15,790
That's great.

492
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:19,871
Don't worry, I'm an expert
on student loans.

493
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:26,706
Hello, Author Lee.

494
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:28,581
Have you been well?

495
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,581
Yes, thank you. And you?

496
00:34:32,414 --> 00:34:36,664
I called to say thank you for
writing that lovely article, Miss Kim.

497
00:34:37,331 --> 00:34:39,790
Oh, I'm no reporter.

498
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:42,122
I was a temporary transfer,

499
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,331
and I'm heading back to my original job.

500
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:46,039
Oh, is that so?

501
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:50,122
Come by for some
fresh air when you're free.

502
00:34:50,664 --> 00:34:52,122
I'll do that.

503
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:54,331
Good-bye.

504
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:55,790
Oh, Hyejin.

505
00:34:56,122 --> 00:34:57,039
Yes?

506
00:34:58,164 --> 00:34:59,414
Where are you? Home?

507
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:03,164
I'm at Heyri to meet the author
I interviewed last time.

508
00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:07,289
Oh? I could've driven you
there if you had told me.

509
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,289
That's not necessary.

510
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,292
Are you free to have dinner later?

511
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:15,790
Yes, see you later.

512
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:21,706
Is this the place?

513
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:27,790
Should a tiger appear
about now and give a little roar?

514
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:29,373
Roar!

515
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,414
That's a good idea.

516
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:35,997
Something like the old folktales...

517
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:38,748
Welcome, Hyejin.

518
00:35:38,872 --> 00:35:40,122
Hello.

519
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:43,955
I didn't want to disrupt them.

520
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,914
It's fine, come on in.

521
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:48,164
-It's okay.
-Come on.

522
00:35:50,872 --> 00:35:52,456
-Something cute...
-Bears aren't cute.

523
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:53,831
Attention, please.

524
00:35:54,831 --> 00:35:55,748
Say hello.

525
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:58,748
These are the authors I'm working with.

526
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,206
Hello.

527
00:36:01,498 --> 00:36:04,081
Hello, nice to meet you.

528
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:08,289
Oh, the reporter who interviewed you?

529
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:11,871
Oh, I'm not a reporter.

530
00:36:15,955 --> 00:36:17,955
Your workroom is lovely.

531
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:20,456
Do you always work with so many authors?

532
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:22,289
No, we became a group recently.

533
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:26,164
We're working
on a group project together.

534
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:30,623
Everyone is stuck here for the next year.

535
00:36:30,706 --> 00:36:32,790
Wow, that sounds fun!

536
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:35,871
Everyone looks so professional.

537
00:36:36,206 --> 00:36:39,414
If you're interested, why not join us?

538
00:36:39,871 --> 00:36:40,748
Pardon?

539
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:44,083
Your dream was to
write children's books, right?

540
00:36:44,164 --> 00:36:48,456
To be honest, it was upsetting to
hear that you're not writing anymore.

541
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:51,748
I'm just going back to where I belong.

542
00:36:51,997 --> 00:36:53,414
Where you belong...

543
00:36:53,498 --> 00:36:56,748
Isn't that forcing yourself into a mold?

544
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:01,871
Where you want to be is where you belong.

545
00:37:03,373 --> 00:37:04,664
Speaking of which...

546
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:08,081
...we're looking
for a final author to join our team.

547
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:10,914
Are you interested?

548
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:12,748
Me?

549
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:18,955
I like the way that you write, Hyejin.

550
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,706
Oh, I'm no writer.

551
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:25,498
I'm actually going to America soon.

552
00:37:25,997 --> 00:37:26,997
And...

553
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:31,039
...I might be getting married.

554
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:33,664
Oh? Congratulations!

555
00:37:33,748 --> 00:37:34,955
Thank you.

556
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:37,748
And the workroom was so lovely.

557
00:37:37,871 --> 00:37:39,792
Full of cute things.

558
00:37:39,872 --> 00:37:43,373
Just being there was enough
to make me feel at home.

559
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:44,955
You know what I mean?

560
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:45,997
Yes.

561
00:37:46,748 --> 00:37:50,872
And all the authors looked like
sweet and awesome people.

562
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:52,247
-And...
-Hold up, slow down.

563
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:53,792
Drink some water.

564
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,872
You should catch your breath.

565
00:37:57,331 --> 00:38:02,331
They were sitting around a huge table
and discussing ideas for the book.

566
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:07,414
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

567
00:38:14,498 --> 00:38:15,831
Yummy.

568
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:19,997
Oh, the main author's dream...

569
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:24,122
...is to work together
with other like-minded authors.

570
00:38:24,206 --> 00:38:27,081
Which is why she created
this children's story village.

571
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:28,498
Isn't that cool?

572
00:38:31,581 --> 00:38:32,914
Do you want to join them?

573
00:38:33,955 --> 00:38:37,122
-What?
-You look really excited right now.

574
00:38:37,997 --> 00:38:40,039
Your dream used to be
a children's book writer.

575
00:38:40,997 --> 00:38:43,871
No, I'll be leaving with you soon.

576
00:38:44,331 --> 00:38:47,206
Oh, right, you wanted
to discuss language schools?

577
00:38:47,498 --> 00:38:48,706
What do I need to do?

578
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:52,997
Right...

579
00:38:56,623 --> 00:38:59,664
Look at these and choose a school.

580
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:00,790
Okay.

581
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,039
Think I'll be fluent in English
a year from now?

582
00:39:05,331 --> 00:39:07,247
So cool.

583
00:39:11,623 --> 00:39:13,706
Which school?

584
00:39:20,623 --> 00:39:22,164
It's too hard to choose.

585
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,039
It's Sunday. Why are you up already?

586
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,247
Oh.

587
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,871
Well, every day is like Sunday for me.

588
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:39,247
Oh!

589
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:42,456
These are sample for school
interview questions.

590
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,955
Test me.

591
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:45,581
-Interview questions?
-Yes.

592
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:48,997
Let's see. What is four P?

593
00:39:49,081 --> 00:39:51,456
The four things needed
for effective marketing.

594
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:54,790
Product, price, place, promotion!

595
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:56,122
Awesome!

596
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:58,081
And what is promotion?

597
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:01,206
Ways of communicating with customers
such as advertising...

598
00:40:01,623 --> 00:40:03,581
...PR, direct marketing,
and sales promotion.

599
00:40:03,664 --> 00:40:06,081
Oh, you studied hard, didn't you?

600
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:09,914
I'm too good, aren't I?

601
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:13,872
I never knew how fun it is to study.

602
00:40:18,122 --> 00:40:22,748
Product, service, design quality...

603
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:27,039
Hari, you look really pretty right now.

604
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:29,748
Tell me something I don't know.

605
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:32,955
I'm always pretty.

606
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:35,914
I meant your expression, not your face.

607
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,039
You look really excited.

608
00:40:38,997 --> 00:40:39,872
Really?

609
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:44,122
Then again,
I am pretty excited these days.

610
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:51,289
How to differentiate your product...

611
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:11,748
Not pretty at all.

612
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:16,664
Not an ounce of excitement.

613
00:41:17,955 --> 00:41:20,834
Which is why she created
this children's story village.

614
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:22,331
Isn't that cool?

615
00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:26,581
Do you want to join them?

616
00:41:27,748 --> 00:41:30,872
-What?
-You look really excited right now.

617
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:56,498
"I hope you keep on dreaming. Lee Mieun"

618
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:02,456
Where you want to be is where you belong.

619
00:42:09,706 --> 00:42:11,871
You want to have dinner at my place?

620
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,081
Hey.

621
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:42,498
Come on in.

622
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:44,664
Let's get married, Sungjoon.

623
00:42:44,748 --> 00:42:46,206
What? What?

624
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:48,623
What I mean is...

625
00:42:48,706 --> 00:42:50,498
We should get married.

626
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:54,039
I fully intend to marry you someday.

627
00:42:54,206 --> 00:42:55,872
I mean, of course it has to be with you.

628
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,247
Of course, but...

629
00:42:58,331 --> 00:42:59,414
Oh...

630
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,289
I even prepared our rings.

631
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,122
This one is mine.

632
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:06,289
Give me your hand.

633
00:43:07,414 --> 00:43:09,790
This one is yours.

634
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:12,539
I'm proposing to you right now.

635
00:43:13,456 --> 00:43:17,373
But instead of right now...

636
00:43:17,456 --> 00:43:19,456
You want a year to yourself, right?

637
00:43:20,706 --> 00:43:21,872
How did you know?

638
00:43:23,122 --> 00:43:26,706
The reason I need a year is...

639
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:29,872
You want to write
the children's book, right?

640
00:43:31,623 --> 00:43:33,039
How did you know?

641
00:43:34,997 --> 00:43:37,872
Thanks for being honest with me.

642
00:43:39,164 --> 00:43:42,498
I could see that
you wanted to take the job.

643
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:47,081
And I was worried that you
rejected it because of me.

644
00:43:48,122 --> 00:43:50,039
It was that obvious?

645
00:43:51,373 --> 00:43:54,289
If you were to come
to America with me now...

646
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,456
...you'd be left with regret.

647
00:43:56,871 --> 00:43:58,623
And you'd keep it to yourself.

648
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:01,081
I would be oblivious.

649
00:44:01,831 --> 00:44:05,623
And when I found out,
I would be so apologetic.

650
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:09,331
You're being honest with me
because you trust me, right?

651
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:17,414
I want to be pretty,
most of all to myself.

652
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:27,664
A person looks the prettiest
when they're doing what they love.

653
00:44:29,206 --> 00:44:31,914
I want to do what I love,

654
00:44:33,122 --> 00:44:34,623
and I want to be pretty.

655
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:37,955
Not for anyone else's sake.

656
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:41,871
Just for me.

657
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:48,164
That's the right decision.

658
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:50,955
Thanks.

659
00:44:51,706 --> 00:44:52,790
And I'm sorry.

660
00:44:53,831 --> 00:44:56,623
But I do feel a little cheated.

661
00:44:56,706 --> 00:44:59,289
I was going to do a grand proposal.

662
00:44:59,748 --> 00:45:00,872
Really?

663
00:45:01,872 --> 00:45:03,414
What were you planning?

664
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:07,206
What's the point in telling you now?

665
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,706
Hey, want to put together our puzzle?

666
00:45:12,748 --> 00:45:14,955
Come on, what were you planning?

667
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:16,122
Tell me.

668
00:45:16,623 --> 00:45:17,871
Hush.

669
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:29,955
So what were you planning to do?

670
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:32,831
Just give me a hint.
What were you planning?

671
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:36,247
It's too late now. I'm not telling.

672
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:40,539
Next time, bring the hidden girl.
We'll return her to her rightful place.

673
00:45:42,831 --> 00:45:44,122
Where did this one piece go?

674
00:45:44,247 --> 00:45:45,834
Can't you please tell me?

675
00:45:45,914 --> 00:45:47,664
I'm dying of curiosity.

676
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,081
How were you going to propose?

677
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:55,664
Oh, there it is. Will you grab that?

678
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:07,871
Oh?

679
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:18,623
This is how I was going to propose.

680
00:46:23,955 --> 00:46:24,955
I also...

681
00:46:26,706 --> 00:46:30,289
...prepared a few words.

682
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,373
Before I met you...

683
00:46:39,955 --> 00:46:44,456
...I didn't know such happiness existed.

684
00:46:46,122 --> 00:46:49,164
I want to return the favor...

685
00:46:50,247 --> 00:46:53,373
...and make you happy
for the rest of your life.

686
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:56,456
Hyejin,

687
00:46:58,122 --> 00:46:59,039
will you...

688
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:07,164
Will you marry me after one year?

689
00:47:15,414 --> 00:47:16,706
Give me your hand.

690
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:28,122
We have two rings.

691
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:32,748
I like it.

692
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:51,955
Bye.

693
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,914
What?

694
00:47:57,997 --> 00:48:00,081
Do you... have to go?

695
00:48:00,748 --> 00:48:01,871
What?

696
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,997
Well... it's late.

697
00:48:07,581 --> 00:48:10,331
And I haven't folded my laundry.

698
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:11,748
And recycling!

699
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:13,997
I have to organize the recyclables.

700
00:48:15,456 --> 00:48:18,039
Really? Then I'll drop you off.

701
00:48:30,331 --> 00:48:33,790
Oh, my car keys.
I must've left them inside.

702
00:48:33,871 --> 00:48:35,164
Wait here, I'll go grab them.

703
00:48:35,748 --> 00:48:37,748
It's fine. I can take this cab.

704
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,581
No, wait. I'll drop you off.

705
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:41,039
It's only 10 minutes away.

706
00:48:41,122 --> 00:48:42,790
Bye. I'll call you when I get home.

707
00:48:42,871 --> 00:48:44,122
Bye!

708
00:49:10,623 --> 00:49:11,623
Who is it?

709
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:17,206
Hyejin.

710
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,997
I thought about it...

711
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:25,456
...and I don't need to
fold the laundry today.

712
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,955
And the recyclable can wait
until tomorrow...

713
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,790
Do you really have to live there?

714
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:06,456
Can't you go back and forth from here?

715
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,164
Everyone is working together.

716
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:12,414
All the authors are moving in
until the book is complete.

717
00:50:12,498 --> 00:50:13,955
I have to join them.

718
00:50:14,872 --> 00:50:17,623
It didn't really hit me
that you were leaving.

719
00:50:18,456 --> 00:50:19,872
But it feels real now that...

720
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:22,706
...I'm seeing you pack.

721
00:50:23,247 --> 00:50:24,456
Yes.

722
00:50:25,748 --> 00:50:32,581
We've never been apart since
I came back from Japan, right?

723
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:36,790
Yes.

724
00:50:52,498 --> 00:50:53,706
Are you crying?

725
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:57,790
Of course not.

726
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:00,081
Why are you crying?

727
00:51:00,498 --> 00:51:04,706
I'm just getting teary
because you're about to cry.

728
00:51:04,871 --> 00:51:08,748
I could've gone to America.
Heyri is much closer.

729
00:51:08,872 --> 00:51:11,122
All it would take is two hours
to come see you.

730
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:14,581
But we were together
every day for 10 years.

731
00:51:15,664 --> 00:51:17,914
Now we have to make the effort to meet!

732
00:51:19,623 --> 00:51:23,914
Why are you saying that?
You're making me cry.

733
00:51:35,664 --> 00:51:41,039
Who's going to cry and blow noses with me?

734
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:45,206
If you ever cry, I'll come over
to blow your nose for you.

735
00:51:46,122 --> 00:51:49,706
You'll really come all the way over here?

736
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,081
Of course!

737
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:56,331
-Hyejin.
-Hari.

738
00:52:07,456 --> 00:52:08,997
For Kim Hyejin's new start!

739
00:52:09,081 --> 00:52:11,414
For Min Hari's acceptance
into graduate school!

740
00:52:11,623 --> 00:52:12,871
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

741
00:52:13,373 --> 00:52:14,790
Love shot.

742
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:36,247
Remember the day we first moved in here?

743
00:52:37,122 --> 00:52:39,498
The boiler was broken.

744
00:52:41,247 --> 00:52:43,790
And when we woke up the next day,
we were almost frozen.

745
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:46,748
Hey, remember that day?

746
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:50,456
When the water shut off
while you were washing your hair.

747
00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:52,164
Of course I remember.

748
00:52:52,247 --> 00:52:55,623
My hair was full of suds
when the water just shut off!

749
00:52:57,081 --> 00:53:00,373
So cold, so cold! It was unbelievable!

750
00:53:01,706 --> 00:53:03,289
Don't go, Hyejin.

751
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:07,122
-Nope, I'm going.
-Don't leave me.

752
00:53:07,206 --> 00:53:09,498
-You never clean.
-Don't go.

753
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:12,373
-I won't let you.
-No! That tickles!

754
00:53:12,664 --> 00:53:13,706
Come here.

755
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,331
You want to die, Min Hari?

756
00:53:18,872 --> 00:53:20,247
That's the workroom.

757
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:23,247
It's nice here.

758
00:53:24,748 --> 00:53:27,871
Maybe I should move here
instead of New York.

759
00:53:29,872 --> 00:53:31,748
What time should I meet you
at the airport tomorrow?

760
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:32,997
What time is your flight?

761
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,872
Hyejin.

762
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:43,748
Let's not weep and cry at the airport.

763
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:45,164
Why?

764
00:53:45,373 --> 00:53:47,206
I want to see you off.

765
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:50,914
We might not see each other again
for a whole year.

766
00:53:51,706 --> 00:53:53,871
I don't think I'll be able to handle it.

767
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,872
I tried to be all cool
and said you could stay.

768
00:53:56,955 --> 00:54:02,581
But when I see you tomorrow,
I might beg you to come.

769
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,039
I'm afraid I'm going to want to take you.

770
00:54:05,414 --> 00:54:07,206
Then we have to say goodbye here?

771
00:54:09,456 --> 00:54:10,748
Don't let your guard down.

772
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,831
I might show up out of the blue.

773
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:24,872
I'll call you 10 times a day.

774
00:54:25,831 --> 00:54:28,414
I'll email every single day.

775
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:34,164
Let's write letters like we did as kids.

776
00:54:36,498 --> 00:54:38,373
Yes, let's do that.

777
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,331
Go in.

778
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,539
Leave first.

779
00:54:54,623 --> 00:54:56,164
I want to see you go.

780
00:54:59,706 --> 00:55:00,914
Okay.

781
00:55:02,331 --> 00:55:03,748
Bye.

782
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:05,081
Bye.

783
00:55:57,247 --> 00:55:58,247
I love you.

784
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:02,872
I love you, Hyejin.

785
00:56:04,914 --> 00:56:06,164
Me, too.

786
00:56:07,955 --> 00:56:09,206
I love you, too.

787
00:56:50,955 --> 00:56:52,373
Hyejin, where are you going?

788
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:54,373
I have a visitor.

789
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:56,456
I'll be back!

790
00:57:05,914 --> 00:57:07,164
Hello!
