1
00:00:01,706 --> 00:00:05,426
Yes, my meeting ended early,
so I was going to leave now.

2
00:00:06,146 --> 00:00:07,058
Where are you?

3
00:00:07,626 --> 00:00:09,706
I had to take care of something.

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,402
I'll see you there on time.

5
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:15,633
Yes, see you then.

6
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:17,912
Okay, I'll see you later.

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,266
"Outstanding Hotelier Min Hari"

8
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:33,826
"Outstanding Hotelier Min Hari"

9
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:40,026
"Employee of the Month"

10
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:43,266
-Miss Min Hari.
-Yes?

11
00:00:48,595 --> 00:00:49,835
Sungjoon.

12
00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:57,382
Min Hari.

13
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:00,746
Who are you?

14
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:04,420
Why...

15
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,706
...are you acting like you're Kim Hyejin?

16
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:12,986
What have you been doing?

17
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:15,281
Who are you?

18
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:17,826
Explain yourself!

19
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:21,346
I'll tell you everything, Sungjoon.

20
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:24,506
Let me explain...

21
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:29,066
Answer me.

22
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:31,370
Who are you?

23
00:01:33,746 --> 00:01:34,826
A friend.

24
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:41,386
Hyejin's friend.

25
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,714
I was supposed to meet you
for one day instead of her.

26
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:50,786
But then I ran into you at the hotel,
and then things got complicated.

27
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:55,626
I was going to explain everything
tonight, and apologise to you.

28
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:57,309
Then the real Kim Hyejin...

29
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:00,482
Is it her?

30
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:04,003
Is it whom I think it is?

31
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:13,938
Yes.

32
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:17,426
It's her.

33
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,786
Sungjoon, I'm sorry I deceived you.

34
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:25,090
I wasn't going to drag it out
for this long...

35
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:47,146
I have naturally curly hair.

36
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:49,186
Hey, your hair!

37
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:50,386
My hair?

38
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,227
Oh, my hair!

39
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:56,466
I'm that Kim Hyejin!

40
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:58,186
Kim Hyejin!

41
00:02:58,426 --> 00:02:59,986
Oh, it's go time!

42
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,584
Oh? It's go time!

43
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:36,826
What's so funny?

44
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:39,186
You reminded me of someone.

45
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:43,514
She's hidden,
so it's kind of like a picture puzzle.

46
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:45,986
You couldn't find her
unless you were really searching for her.

47
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:47,506
Like a picture puzzle.

48
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:54,506
I guess I'll use...

49
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:58,244
...my final wish.

50
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:02,386
My final wish is...

51
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:05,576
...this.

52
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:18,245
If you find it hard to leave,
just stay with me.

53
00:04:24,746 --> 00:04:27,906
Can you give me an opportunity?

54
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:32,370
I...

55
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,786
Well, Mr Kim...

56
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:37,146
But I...

57
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,906
Get it.

58
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:57,026
Yes, Mr Ji.

59
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:00,702
It's been a long time...

60
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:04,506
...Kim Hyejin.

61
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:06,186
Excuse me?

62
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:09,346
We saw each other
at the museum earlier today.

63
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:12,207
It's been a while...

64
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:17,419
...Hyejin.

65
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:25,803
I missed you...

66
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:28,490
Kim Hyejin.

67
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:35,466
Sungjoon.

68
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:41,546
Where are you right now?

69
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:44,306
I want to see you.

70
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:47,946
Don't go.

71
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:50,426
Don't leave, Jackson.

72
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:56,467
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,930
I'm really sorry, Mr Kim.

74
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:01,354
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:22,026
Hyejin, where are you right now?

76
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:24,866
I'm at the zebra crossing
in front of the company.

77
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,539
What about you?

78
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:30,826
Then you're on the other side?

79
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,586
I'm crossing the street now.

80
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:02,626
I found you.

81
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:11,237
I've finally found you...

82
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:14,472
...Kim Hyejin.

83
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:24,466
Why did you have to hide from me?

84
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:27,346
Why didn't you tell me?
I missed you so...

85
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,446
Never mind.

86
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,570
It doesn't matter, Hyejin.

87
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:39,866
It's my fault
for failing to recognise you.

88
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:43,026
I should've found you much sooner.

89
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,186
Sorry for being late.

90
00:07:48,146 --> 00:07:49,195
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:53,706
It must've been difficult all along.

92
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:03,546
You were so close,
yet I couldn't recognise you.

93
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:07,124
Let me see you.

94
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:15,437
It's all so obvious now.

95
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,546
It is you.

96
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:25,186
My friend, Kim Hyejin.

97
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:52,386
Oh, it's go time.

98
00:08:53,026 --> 00:08:55,466
Yes, you're right. It's go time.

99
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,026
I was actually there that day.

100
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:11,626
And?

101
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,490
When you didn't recognise me
and passed me by,

102
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:18,586
I suddenly felt really small.

103
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:20,864
I was unemployed at the time...

104
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:25,362
...and I felt that I was no longer
the girl you remember.

105
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,258
I didn't feel confident enough
to face you.

106
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:35,306
So it was my mistake after all.

107
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,546
If only I recognised you.

108
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,546
No, it's not your fault.

109
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:43,426
I'm the one who ran away like a coward.

110
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,459
That's so pretty!

111
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:49,866
Let's go.

112
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:03,641
I can't imagine
what it was like for you...

113
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,458
...knowing the truth
while seeing me every day.

114
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:11,626
But the little white lie
started to snowball...

115
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:15,567
...until it became too big to manage.

116
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:19,022
That's why it was so hard
to tell you the truth.

117
00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:20,322
Wait.

118
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:23,186
I think I should be disappointed.

119
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:25,826
About what?

120
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:29,466
If I was down and out on my luck...

121
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:32,586
...would you have judged me?

122
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:37,866
I thought our relationship
was above all of that.

123
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:41,386
Was I fooling myself?

124
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:56,701
It wouldn't have mattered
how much you've changed...

125
00:10:57,746 --> 00:10:59,746
...or whatever your situation may be.

126
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:01,555
At all.

127
00:11:02,906 --> 00:11:07,109
If I hadn't hidden
from you back then...

128
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:11,786
...things would've been much, much better.

129
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,266
I regret it.

130
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:19,346
Let's not regret.

131
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,466
Don't even look back.

132
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:26,026
From now on, let's live in the moment.

133
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:37,866
Well, but I assume Hari
already told you everything.

134
00:11:38,386 --> 00:11:39,329
No.

135
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:42,054
I'm hearing all of this
for the first time.

136
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:46,338
I had my assumptions on my way here
but that's it.

137
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,706
What do you mean?

138
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,986
Didn't Hari tell you the whole story?

139
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:58,066
Hey, why are you already here?

140
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,073
Didn't you meet with Ji Sungjoon?

141
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,850
What happened to you? Are you okay?

142
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,602
I heard that you didn't have a chance
to explain.

143
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:08,023
Well...

144
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:11,186
What have I done to you?

145
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,290
I must've lost my mind.

146
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:18,666
I should've told you much sooner.

147
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:22,243
I'm sorry, Hyejin.

148
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:27,280
You wanted to fix this on your own...

149
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:30,038
...and you asked me for more time.

150
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,119
Right.

151
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,852
He was going to find out tonight, anyway.

152
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:36,719
He just found out about an hour earlier.

153
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:43,626
Hey, someone's waiting outside
for me right now.

154
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:44,969
I should get going.

155
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:47,404
I'm going to be late,
so don't wait up for me.

156
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:50,706
Hari, Hari.

157
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,647
-Hello?
-Hey, Min Hari!

158
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:10,673
Why haven't you been taking my calls?

159
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:13,866
Well, I'm Hari's friend.

160
00:13:13,946 --> 00:13:15,706
She left her phone here at home.

161
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,006
I was wondering why she picked up.

162
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,690
When she returns,
tell her to call me back.

163
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:23,589
Okay.

164
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:57,268
"Where should I begin?"

165
00:13:58,026 --> 00:14:01,866
"It's difficult to explain,
so I'm writing you a letter instead."

166
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:05,506
"First of all, I'm sorry, Sungjoon."

167
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:07,546
"The only thing I can say..."

168
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,735
"...is I'm sorry."

169
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:19,146
For some reason,
you were there for me...

170
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,059
...whenever I was going through
some difficult times.

171
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:24,786
I felt comforted by your support
and your actions...

172
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:29,586
...and momentarily,
I felt that we were similar.

173
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:34,746
I know that you thought
I was Hyejin all along...

174
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,306
...but I ended up fooling myself.

175
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:43,554
And for a moment, I acted selfishly.

176
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:46,026
Thank you for everything.

177
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:49,546
And I'm really...

178
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:51,801
...sorry.

179
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,053
I know that I can't ever make up for it...

180
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,167
...but I'm sorry.

181
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:02,914
Even when you thought I was Hyejin...

182
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:08,266
...she was the only Hyejin you loved.

183
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,426
I know that now.

184
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:17,298
I'm sorry that I got involved
and gave you the run around.

185
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:20,946
Hyejin and you...

186
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:27,691
...I'm sincerely rooting
for the two of you.

187
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:33,121
From Hyejin's friend, Hari.

188
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,266
You haven't left for work yet?

189
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:18,386
I thought you came home late last night.

190
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,506
You've already exercised this morning?

191
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:21,546
Oh...

192
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:26,622
Well, I drank so much
with my friend last night.

193
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,142
I was hung over this morning.

194
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:31,755
My friend could really drink all night.

195
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:39,481
I'm thirsty.
I'm going to get some water.

196
00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:42,306
I thought you were getting water.

197
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:45,379
-What?
-If you want water...

198
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:46,946
...why are you going to your room?

199
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,210
Right.

200
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,570
Oh, my, what am I doing?

201
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:57,826
Something is wrong with me.

202
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:14,754
Hyejin.

203
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:17,426
Hi.

204
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,918
This is no fun.

205
00:17:58,346 --> 00:17:59,426
Good morning.

206
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,106
Hey, Hyejin.

207
00:18:02,306 --> 00:18:04,786
You really should stop
reading in the streets, Mr Ji.

208
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:08,626
That's why you're always running
into things like an idiot.

209
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:11,466
Yes, I understand.

210
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,786
Oh, it's go time!

211
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:22,986
Why am I so stiff this morning?
Maybe I didn't get enough sleep.

212
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:30,506
Let's have dinner together later.

213
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,986
Why don't we visit
our old neighbourhood?

214
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:35,347
I wonder if that bakery is still there.

215
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:36,946
Remember on World Left-hander's Day...

216
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:39,617
...you bought me a cake,
thinking it's my birthday.

217
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,867
Do you remember that?

218
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:43,346
Did that really happen?

219
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:48,173
My memory isn't what it used to be,
so everything's a bit hazy.

220
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:57,426
How should I address you now?

221
00:18:57,986 --> 00:18:59,266
"My friend, the deputy chief editor"?

222
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,746
Or "Mr Colleague"?

223
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:03,026
Oh, "My friend Mr Ji".

224
00:19:03,746 --> 00:19:05,746
No, it's a little weird.

225
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:09,786
Got any ideas?

226
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,066
-Kim Hyejin.
-Hey.

227
00:19:12,426 --> 00:19:14,946
What have you been doing in America?

228
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:16,786
How did you become
a totally different person?

229
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:20,146
Ji Sungjoon, you've come up!

230
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:25,026
Oh, right. You told me that
you looked me up in the alumni records.

231
00:19:25,534 --> 00:19:27,913
I wonder how everyone else is doing.

232
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:30,066
Maybe we should arrange for a reunion?

233
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:35,917
Wait.

234
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:47,823
What are you doing?

235
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:49,186
Me?

236
00:19:49,594 --> 00:19:51,194
What are you talking about?

237
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:53,636
You've changed overnight.

238
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:57,626
Oh, I thought I should separate
my personal life...

239
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:00,515
...from my professional one.

240
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:02,386
You know what I mean?

241
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,425
I don't want to take advantage
of the fact that we used to be friends.

242
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:07,706
Your personal life
from your professional one?

243
00:20:09,328 --> 00:20:10,385
Friends?

244
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:15,226
Were we nothing more than friends?

245
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:17,666
What else would you call it?

246
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,130
Yesterday, you came to me.

247
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:24,618
And now we're no more than just friends?

248
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:27,346
Why are you behaving like this?

249
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,170
Hari has feelings for you.

250
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:40,470
Hey, you're not hung up on first loves
and childhood friendships, are you?

251
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:42,026
That's silly.

252
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:49,306
You certainly know
how to make a guy feel empty.

253
00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:51,586
Do you know how long I've...

254
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:55,682
Why are you acting like this?

255
00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:58,566
I don't understand
why you're being like this.

256
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:00,601
What is your reason?

257
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:04,651
There is no reason.

258
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,953
Hey, why are you being so serious?

259
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:15,426
I thought we had something special.

260
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:21,466
I must've been the only one
who wanted this.

261
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:27,274
Because to you, I'm nothing
more than just another friend.

262
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,522
I'm going to ask you one last time.

263
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:36,546
Are you sure there isn't a reason
why you're acting like this?

264
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,463
Hari likes you a lot.

265
00:21:48,026 --> 00:21:49,506
Yes, okay.

266
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:06,177
Mr Kim.

267
00:22:07,986 --> 00:22:09,026
That day, did you get home...

268
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:10,706
Yes, I got home happily and willingly.

269
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:11,866
Mr Kim!

270
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:16,186
Please take this.

271
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:31,346
I don't know what this is all about.

272
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:34,626
Your arm, you were injured because of me.

273
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:36,866
I wanted to pay for your hospital bill.

274
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:47,019
Forget it.

275
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,146
No wait, Mr Kim.

276
00:22:51,418 --> 00:22:52,978
Hey, Lunatic!

277
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:54,786
Why the long face?

278
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:55,986
Is something wrong?

279
00:22:57,347 --> 00:22:58,630
Nothing in particular.

280
00:22:58,866 --> 00:23:00,546
I'm not having fun anymore.

281
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:04,258
I'm going home early
after my interview.

282
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:09,604
What's going on?

283
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:12,146
Good morning.

284
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:13,586
Hello.

285
00:23:15,202 --> 00:23:18,122
The two of them used to hang out
like Dumb and Dumber.

286
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,826
I wonder what happened.

287
00:23:20,506 --> 00:23:22,946
I smell something fishy.

288
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:28,546
Hyejin, is there something
between you and the lunatic?

289
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:30,546
-Pardon?
-Yes.

290
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:35,115
It's normal to love and to have arguments.

291
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:40,026
I knew the two of you
had gotten awfully close.

292
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:42,201
It's nothing like that!

293
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:44,586
I already know.

294
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:46,866
But how far have you gone with him?

295
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:51,294
Okay, okay. My goodness.

296
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:56,386
It's the season of love,
the season of love.

297
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:59,351
But it's always winter for me.
I'm dying out in the cold.

298
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:00,906
Yes, Dad?

299
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:04,826
Gosh, really?

300
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:06,906
Congratulations, Chairman Kim.

301
00:24:07,026 --> 00:24:07,906
Chairman?

302
00:24:07,986 --> 00:24:09,586
Yes, I'll talk to you at home.

303
00:24:10,106 --> 00:24:11,205
Yes.

304
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:14,571
-Is your father a chairman?
-Oh, Han Seol.

305
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:19,066
My dad wanted to become the chairman
of his local soccer club...

306
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,866
...and he finally made it.

307
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:23,147
Chairman of the soccer club?

308
00:24:23,266 --> 00:24:24,386
No, no, wait...

309
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:26,919
That doesn't mean that his dad isn't
the chairman of a big company as well.

310
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:30,386
Your dad actually finds time for that?

311
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,386
Yes. He's really busy.

312
00:24:33,746 --> 00:24:36,266
He's always doing laundry
and ironing clothes all day long.

313
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:37,866
So he needs the exercise.

314
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,261
Laundry? Ironing?

315
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:43,499
Why would your father iron clothes?

316
00:24:43,706 --> 00:24:44,946
Oh, didn't I tell you?

317
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:48,426
My father runs a big dry cleaner
in Gangnam.

318
00:24:49,658 --> 00:24:52,458
He's really good,
so he's well known in the area.

319
00:24:53,466 --> 00:24:56,611
Oh, my father made this for me, too.

320
00:24:57,346 --> 00:25:01,666
Didn't you go to school overseas?
You're fluent in English.

321
00:25:01,826 --> 00:25:03,026
Of course I am.

322
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:06,706
My dad ran a dry cleaner in LA
for six or seven years.

323
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,706
He's really good
with women's clothes, too.

324
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:15,466
Han Seol, do you need anything fixed?

325
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,078
Han Seol?

326
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:35,506
Then I'll be in touch.

327
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:39,426
That's not necessary.

328
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,290
I like her.

329
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,552
I have feelings for Kim Hyejin.

330
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:03,066
It's the meeting log.

331
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:05,666
Send me a file from now on.

332
00:26:06,282 --> 00:26:08,202
You don't have to keep bringing it to me.

333
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:10,528
Yes, I understand.

334
00:26:11,282 --> 00:26:12,419
Oh, and this.

335
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:19,786
-Take it.
-Ten dollars?

336
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:21,026
Why are you giving me 10 dollars?

337
00:26:21,106 --> 00:26:22,695
I heard that you paid for it.

338
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:24,226
Oh, the courier?

339
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:26,304
It's fine.
You don't have to give this to me.

340
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,510
It's related to work,
so why would you pay for it?

341
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:36,419
You made it clear
that you want to be professional.

342
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:48,866
I can't do this, Hyejin.

343
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:55,007
I can't do this anymore.

344
00:26:56,026 --> 00:26:58,013
I don't want to be
just a colleague to you.

345
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,835
And I can't separate my feelings
from work.

346
00:27:01,026 --> 00:27:03,146
No, I won't.

347
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:06,386
I don't understand why I have to do this!

348
00:27:17,522 --> 00:27:18,942
Mr Ji, this article...

349
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,146
Please give me your confirmation.

350
00:27:28,986 --> 00:27:30,089
Yes, give it to me.

351
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:09,946
Thank you
for the interview today, Director.

352
00:28:10,226 --> 00:28:13,586
The movie's been getting great reviews
and I'm sure it'll be a success.

353
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:17,466
But Mr Kim,
I'm a bit disappointed in you.

354
00:28:17,546 --> 00:28:18,466
Pardon?

355
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:19,906
Did I do something wrong?

356
00:28:19,986 --> 00:28:21,826
You're no fun anymore.

357
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:23,226
What? Me?

358
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:25,986
Yes. You're no fun at all right now.

359
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:27,949
People are begging me for interviews...

360
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,066
...but I'm here with you
because you used to be fun.

361
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:35,186
You used to remind me of myself.

362
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:39,103
But today's interview was no fun at all.

363
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:40,171
Is that so?

364
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,497
What should I do?

365
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:47,146
Then why don't I start over now?

366
00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:52,606
Now that's the Mr Kim I know!

367
00:28:52,706 --> 00:28:53,586
Right?

368
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:56,346
I'll write you a killer article,
so don't you worry.

369
00:28:56,426 --> 00:28:57,386
Okay.

370
00:29:10,026 --> 00:29:11,466
Oh, yes.

371
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:16,875
I'll be there soon. I think so.

372
00:29:17,954 --> 00:29:22,194
I know. I miss you too.

373
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:25,706
Stay in touch, okay?

374
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:28,106
Okay, bye.

375
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:34,746
Maybe it's time for me to leave.

376
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:42,786
You're here?

377
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:44,762
Where should we go?

378
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:46,746
Where should we go?

379
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:48,267
Hari.

380
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:50,626
Hyejin.

381
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:54,706
Who's this?

382
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,570
Hey, Kim Jaehoon.

383
00:29:57,978 --> 00:30:00,538
I need to talk to my friend,
so wait for me in the car.

384
00:30:00,906 --> 00:30:03,506
Hey, it's Park Jaehoon.

385
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:05,266
You're a Park?

386
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:07,746
Anyway, wait in the car.

387
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:14,466
Who is that man?

388
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,666
Oh...

389
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,306
He's just someone I know.

390
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:20,986
Why are you with him
if you don't even know his name?

391
00:30:21,706 --> 00:30:23,666
Why are you being so serious?

392
00:30:24,426 --> 00:30:26,586
You know how I am already.

393
00:30:27,386 --> 00:30:28,546
Come inside, we need to talk.

394
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:32,146
No, if you need to talk,
we can talk right here.

395
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:34,426
I need to leave with him.

396
00:30:34,506 --> 00:30:35,466
Come inside.

397
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:36,706
Right now!

398
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:38,066
What's wrong with you?

399
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:40,786
What do you think you're doing?

400
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:42,346
I could ask you the same thing!

401
00:30:42,706 --> 00:30:44,146
If something's bothering you...

402
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:46,506
...and you're having a hard time,
then say so!

403
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,226
Stop acting like you're doing fine!

404
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:50,063
Why are you yelling at me?

405
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:53,165
There's nothing that's bothering me!

406
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:56,418
You were crying.

407
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:01,724
I saw you crying in the street.
Are you still going to deny it?

408
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:08,186
Hari, how long are you going to deny it?

409
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:11,786
Why do you have to act like you're okay?

410
00:31:13,346 --> 00:31:14,834
Don't suffer like this alone.

411
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,473
Aren't you the one...

412
00:31:19,426 --> 00:31:20,560
...who's acting like you're okay?

413
00:31:22,826 --> 00:31:24,269
"And you call yourself a friend?"

414
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:25,906
"How could you do this to me?"

415
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,890
"I don't ever want to see you again!"

416
00:31:29,226 --> 00:31:31,592
Just vent your anger out on me!

417
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:38,346
Yes, okay. I'm angry at you!

418
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:43,388
But I'm not mad
about you and Sungjoon.

419
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:48,506
To be honest, I understand
why you couldn't tell him.

420
00:31:48,746 --> 00:31:51,041
I'm the one who pulled you into this...

421
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:52,826
...and I know that I'm responsible
for everything.

422
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:57,017
But what's making me angry
is your attitude right now!

423
00:31:57,946 --> 00:32:01,466
Stop avoiding the issue,
give me an excuse even!

424
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:04,466
How long will you run away like a child?

425
00:32:06,515 --> 00:32:07,635
Well...

426
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:14,666
...this is who I am.

427
00:32:16,906 --> 00:32:18,266
So what do you want me to do?

428
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:21,986
Hey, Min Hari.

429
00:32:25,826 --> 00:32:26,927
I'm tired.

430
00:32:28,186 --> 00:32:29,266
Let's just...

431
00:32:31,146 --> 00:32:32,546
...put an end to it.

432
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:35,632
I'll just...

433
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,421
...disappear for you.

434
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:48,362
No, I'll be the one who disappears.

435
00:32:50,026 --> 00:32:51,985
I'm living in your place, anyway.

436
00:33:10,306 --> 00:33:11,626
She's so mean!

437
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:25,066
Father, I'm home.

438
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,146
Hey, daughter.

439
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:28,906
What brings you here?

440
00:33:28,986 --> 00:33:31,066
Nothing, I just wanted to spend the night.

441
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:32,786
-Then what about Hari?
-I don't know.

442
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:34,557
Hey, daughter!

443
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:35,954
Why are you here tonight?

444
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,371
She's spending the night.

445
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:38,527
Then what about Hari?

446
00:33:39,146 --> 00:33:40,346
I don't know.

447
00:33:46,922 --> 00:33:48,802
Hey, why are you here all of a sudden?

448
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:50,266
I'm going to spend the night.

449
00:33:50,826 --> 00:33:51,786
Then what about Hari?

450
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:53,826
Why does everyone ask me about Hari?

451
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,986
If you're so curious about her,
ask her yourself!

452
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:57,338
Where are you going?

453
00:33:57,466 --> 00:33:59,066
I need some fresh air!

454
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:03,386
She gets angrier the older she becomes.

455
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,806
Kim Hyerin,
you must not turn out like her!

456
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:18,946
Let's not regret.

457
00:34:19,706 --> 00:34:21,192
Don't even look back.

458
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,786
From now on, let's live in the moment.

459
00:34:35,426 --> 00:34:37,066
"My Umbrella"

460
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,786
Let's meet, I'm going to your house.

461
00:34:43,946 --> 00:34:45,466
Hey, mister?

462
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:50,866
You've changed so much!

463
00:34:50,946 --> 00:34:53,106
Wow, unbelievable!

464
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:54,346
What's all the commotion?

465
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:58,986
Are you really the chubby little kid
that used to live next door?

466
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,026
I've changed, haven't I?

467
00:35:01,586 --> 00:35:03,306
How have you been?
Have you been well, sir?

468
00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:05,002
Of course.

469
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:08,106
I never would've recognised you.

470
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:09,506
What are you doing here?

471
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:11,746
He called, so I invited him over.

472
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:13,306
He wanted to talk to you.

473
00:35:13,386 --> 00:35:15,346
What? How do you two know each other?

474
00:35:15,426 --> 00:35:17,986
But were you really chubby
when you were younger?

475
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:19,666
I was.

476
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:23,738
I remember that I used to come over
to eat all the time.

477
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:27,082
I was practically living here.

478
00:35:27,306 --> 00:35:28,226
That's right!

479
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:29,906
When your father
went away on business...

480
00:35:29,986 --> 00:35:31,786
...you used to spend the night
all the time.

481
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:36,257
Yes, so do you have a girlfriend?

482
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:40,103
Wait, why are you asking him that?
We're not like that!

483
00:35:40,186 --> 00:35:43,271
No, we definitely have potential.

484
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,570
Shall we crack open the quince liquor?

485
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:54,346
Oh, right. We still have that.

486
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:55,706
Let me go and get it.

487
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:58,146
There's no need for that.
He can't even drink.

488
00:35:58,226 --> 00:36:00,106
I would like to try your quince liquor.

489
00:36:00,379 --> 00:36:02,179
Oh, it's really good.

490
00:36:10,226 --> 00:36:11,746
Here, try some.

491
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:13,146
Son.

492
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,426
Son? Don't call him that!

493
00:36:15,746 --> 00:36:16,826
Thank you very much.

494
00:36:20,186 --> 00:36:21,226
Cheers!

495
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:24,746
He can't even handle a single drink.

496
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:30,946
It's really good.

497
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:32,626
I can really smell the aroma...

498
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:34,343
He's fine.

499
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,546
Everyone in the world
can handle a single drink.

500
00:36:40,106 --> 00:36:41,266
Gosh.

501
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:43,706
Except him.

502
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:49,171
Hari.

503
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:57,492
Have you been well?

504
00:37:04,786 --> 00:37:09,586
Didn't you miss your mum?

505
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:16,660
Let's live together now, Hari.

506
00:37:18,482 --> 00:37:20,613
Come back to me now.

507
00:37:57,347 --> 00:37:59,270
He really grew up.

508
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:03,186
When did that child
become a man like this?

509
00:38:03,706 --> 00:38:07,426
He's got thick brows and a strong chin.

510
00:38:07,946 --> 00:38:10,746
I think he's got feelings for Hyejin,
don't you think so?

511
00:38:12,146 --> 00:38:13,694
If he didn't,
he wouldn't have come here.

512
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:19,339
What are you doing over there?

513
00:38:19,746 --> 00:38:21,506
Go away, this instant!

514
00:38:21,586 --> 00:38:22,786
-Okay.
-Okay.

515
00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:24,706
Have a great time.

516
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:27,266
What are you talking about?

517
00:38:27,386 --> 00:38:28,386
Go for it!

518
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,346
What am I doing here?

519
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:02,306
Oh, the quince liquor...

520
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:04,826
Are you okay?

521
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,986
I'm not okay, because of you.

522
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:13,666
Let's talk outside.

523
00:39:13,802 --> 00:39:15,042
We have to talk.

524
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:21,626
Are you sure you're
not going to tell me?

525
00:39:25,434 --> 00:39:29,434
If you don't tell me,
it'll only make me feel worse.

526
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:34,986
I thought that it might be
about Mr Kim...

527
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:38,826
...but I'm confident in your feelings
for me.

528
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,250
I don't want to make assumptions, Hyejin.

529
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,386
Sungjoon...

530
00:39:52,746 --> 00:39:59,119
...maybe you think I'm special
because I was your first love.

531
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:04,106
That's how first loves are.

532
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:10,546
Little things seem prettier,
everything seems brighter...

533
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,235
...and the memories are sweeter.

534
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:18,186
But those are only childhood memories.

535
00:40:19,106 --> 00:40:20,226
So I think you should...

536
00:40:20,306 --> 00:40:24,586
Back then, you were there for me
when my mother wasn't...

537
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:26,786
...and you were my only true friend.

538
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:28,346
That's why it was so special.

539
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:31,946
But I don't care about any of that.

540
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:35,106
You're the woman
I have feelings for now.

541
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:40,106
Even if you weren't
the Kim Hyejin I used to know...

542
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:43,346
...and even if we met again
as strangers...

543
00:40:43,627 --> 00:40:45,987
...I still would've fallen for you.

544
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:50,466
I would've been drawn to you,
and I would've had feelings for you.

545
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:53,134
Hyejin...

546
00:40:55,306 --> 00:40:59,586
...can't you just tell me what's going on?

547
00:41:12,402 --> 00:41:13,722
Hari, she...

548
00:41:18,138 --> 00:41:19,271
She...

549
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:22,346
...likes you a lot.

550
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,786
She liked you enough to suffer alone...

551
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,895
...and continue to act like me...

552
00:41:33,426 --> 00:41:34,912
...just to see you all along.

553
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:40,867
Hari is more than just a friend to me.

554
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:44,946
She's precious to me
like my family and you.

555
00:41:45,306 --> 00:41:47,410
But if I go to you now...

556
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:51,386
...Hari will get hurt.

557
00:41:51,786 --> 00:41:53,226
And I'll be uncomfortable, too.

558
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,508
I can't simply abandon her.

559
00:41:56,866 --> 00:42:00,666
I don't want to hurt her in the process.

560
00:42:11,632 --> 00:42:14,832
Kim Hyejin, look at me.

561
00:42:20,786 --> 00:42:21,826
Will you?

562
00:42:22,346 --> 00:42:23,746
Look at me.

563
00:42:27,802 --> 00:42:31,122
The person I like is you.

564
00:42:32,978 --> 00:42:37,378
It was you in the past,
and it was you before I realised it.

565
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:40,346
It's you now,
and it will always be you.

566
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:45,946
I won't pressure you.

567
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:49,066
I don't expect anything from you.

568
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:53,313
Just don't run away from me.

569
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,194
That's the only thing.

570
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:10,546
My goodness, Kim Hyejin.

571
00:43:11,306 --> 00:43:13,066
You were a nice person
a long time ago...

572
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:15,106
...but I think you've become even kinder.

573
00:43:18,955 --> 00:43:21,515
I like the fact that you haven't changed.

574
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:33,946
Oh, sorry.

575
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:35,458
It stopped.

576
00:43:35,634 --> 00:43:36,553
It did.

577
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:39,706
Good morning.

578
00:43:40,106 --> 00:43:41,906
Yes, good morning.

579
00:43:43,018 --> 00:43:45,018
It should start to rotate soon.

580
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:50,878
Let's go.

581
00:43:54,546 --> 00:43:55,546
Really?

582
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,386
Yes, okay.

583
00:43:58,538 --> 00:44:00,258
What's with Kim Shinhyuk?

584
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:01,786
Why, what about the lunatic?

585
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:03,826
I just spoke
with a friend at New Look...

586
00:44:03,906 --> 00:44:05,266
...and she tells me
that he's transferring to New Look!

587
00:44:05,346 --> 00:44:06,506
-Nonsense!
-Is that true?

588
00:44:06,586 --> 00:44:07,626
What?

589
00:44:08,778 --> 00:44:10,298
What are you talking about?

590
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:12,106
He's gotten countless offers elsewhere...

591
00:44:12,226 --> 00:44:13,946
...but he rejected
each and every one of them.

592
00:44:14,306 --> 00:44:15,666
He doesn't even meet with them.

593
00:44:15,922 --> 00:44:18,362
But he's met with someone
from New Look already.

594
00:44:18,946 --> 00:44:19,866
What?

595
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:21,786
Then is he really leaving this time?

596
00:44:21,946 --> 00:44:23,063
To another company?

597
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:25,904
Then that means he's not the son
of the Jinsung Group.

598
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:27,659
Could Kim Poongho
be the heir to the group?

599
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:32,146
No, New Look might not be aware
that he's the chairman's son.

600
00:44:32,346 --> 00:44:34,586
This is confusing!

601
00:44:36,594 --> 00:44:37,608
It's Shinhyuk!

602
00:44:37,746 --> 00:44:39,125
Shinhyuk!

603
00:44:39,586 --> 00:44:40,986
-Hey, have a seat.
-Hurry up and sit down.

604
00:44:41,066 --> 00:44:42,706
-Is it true?
-Are you going to New Look?

605
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:44,595
Are you really going to New Look?

606
00:44:44,746 --> 00:44:46,595
-Is it true?
-Are you going?

607
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:49,412
Why do rumours travel so quickly?

608
00:44:49,493 --> 00:44:50,586
What, it must be true!

609
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:54,024
-Don't go!
-You can't do this.

610
00:44:54,306 --> 00:44:56,866
Hey, Lunatic!
Is that why you've been complaining...

611
00:44:56,946 --> 00:44:58,626
...about how everything is boring lately?

612
00:44:58,706 --> 00:44:59,818
That's right.

613
00:44:59,994 --> 00:45:01,400
-Really?
-Yes.

614
00:45:01,922 --> 00:45:04,362
Am I supposed to stay here forever?

615
00:45:08,426 --> 00:45:09,466
He's really leaving!

616
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:12,136
Hey, was I too hard on him?

617
00:45:12,217 --> 00:45:14,137
-Of course not.
-I think he's really trying to leave.

618
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,026
Call back and double check.

619
00:45:17,106 --> 00:45:18,214
Mr Kim.

620
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:23,012
Are you really going to New Look?

621
00:45:23,642 --> 00:45:25,327
No, I'm not going to New Look.

622
00:45:25,426 --> 00:45:26,626
That's a relief.

623
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:31,866
Wait, are you planning
to go someplace else?

624
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,810
Who knows? I don't know yet, either.

625
00:45:45,282 --> 00:45:46,287
Attention.

626
00:45:48,786 --> 00:45:51,462
Our latest issue...

627
00:45:53,466 --> 00:45:54,946
...is flying off of the shelves.

628
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:56,282
We've increased advertising revenue
as well.

629
00:45:56,363 --> 00:45:58,261
The Management Department
informed me just now.

630
00:45:58,986 --> 00:46:00,550
Yes, yes!

631
00:46:01,546 --> 00:46:02,746
That's great!

632
00:46:05,426 --> 00:46:08,099
The Most is ranked number one now?

633
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,410
No, first place is still New Look.

634
00:46:11,642 --> 00:46:14,602
Oh, we're still second place.

635
00:46:14,746 --> 00:46:17,006
But still, Mr Ji
has really turned things around.

636
00:46:17,186 --> 00:46:19,146
We're only getting better.

637
00:46:19,387 --> 00:46:21,446
-Shouldn't we celebrate?
-Hey.

638
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:23,466
Let's have a celebration dinner!

639
00:46:23,546 --> 00:46:28,426
-Dinner, dinner!
-Dinner! Dinner!

640
00:46:28,506 --> 00:46:29,706
Bravo, bravo!

641
00:46:30,186 --> 00:46:31,906
Beautiful! Wonderful!

642
00:46:31,986 --> 00:46:33,306
Excellent!

643
00:46:33,386 --> 00:46:34,546
Delicious!

644
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:35,823
Okay.

645
00:46:35,906 --> 00:46:38,426
We should definitely celebrate.

646
00:46:38,506 --> 00:46:41,746
I can't go
because I have a date tonight...

647
00:46:41,826 --> 00:46:46,506
...but you can take my gold card
and have a great time!

648
00:46:46,626 --> 00:46:49,186
Have a Most-esque party!

649
00:46:50,306 --> 00:46:55,066
Kim Rara, Kim Rara!

650
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:58,586
Okay, okay. You're making me blush.

651
00:46:58,786 --> 00:47:02,913
Next issue,
I expect it to be number one!

652
00:47:07,386 --> 00:47:09,433
Did I hear that correctly?

653
00:47:09,706 --> 00:47:12,906
Isn't our chief editor
acting like Mr Ji now?

654
00:47:13,226 --> 00:47:14,167
I know, right?

655
00:47:14,307 --> 00:47:18,467
She's never talked about rankings before.

656
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,888
I think she's changed.

657
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:27,946
Ta-da.

658
00:47:28,026 --> 00:47:29,277
My goodness.

659
00:47:30,186 --> 00:47:31,786
You made all of this?

660
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:34,602
I don't mean to brag,
but they sell quite well in Japan.

661
00:47:35,146 --> 00:47:37,327
Oh, Cha Hyejung!

662
00:47:37,426 --> 00:47:38,946
That's wonderful!

663
00:47:40,786 --> 00:47:42,467
These are pretty!

664
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,730
I should've gone out on my own earlier.

665
00:47:48,026 --> 00:47:53,226
I couldn't stand losing the man I love...

666
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:56,122
...so I simply ran away.

667
00:47:57,122 --> 00:47:59,562
But I think Hari was badly hurt
because of it.

668
00:48:00,562 --> 00:48:04,308
I had lost all of my confidence...

669
00:48:05,306 --> 00:48:08,432
...but I pressed on
because I wanted my daughter back.

670
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,426
And I'm independent now.

671
00:48:15,122 --> 00:48:18,162
Are you really taking Hari with you?

672
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:22,266
I want to be with her now.

673
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:25,146
I want to make up
for all the time lost.

674
00:48:26,266 --> 00:48:30,346
But she's not listening to me.

675
00:48:52,706 --> 00:48:53,826
"Mum"

676
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:57,706
I'm leaving in a few days.

677
00:48:59,066 --> 00:49:01,648
Are you sure you don't want to see me
before I go?

678
00:49:24,705 --> 00:49:25,924
Can you still make...

679
00:49:28,426 --> 00:49:29,787
...your crabmeat porridge?

680
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,847
I heard that we're second place again.

681
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,186
Why don't you tell
all of the members...

682
00:50:26,386 --> 00:50:30,386
...instead of trying to handle this alone?

683
00:50:30,746 --> 00:50:31,946
It'll only disturb them.

684
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:35,318
And they'll probably try to leave.

685
00:50:36,546 --> 00:50:40,426
But you're suffering alone.

686
00:50:48,026 --> 00:50:51,247
If you gave me a hug, I'd feel better.

687
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,491
Am I asking for too much?

688
00:51:00,546 --> 00:51:01,666
I'm joking.

689
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:17,706
"Search: Kim Shinhyuk"

690
00:51:19,306 --> 00:51:21,306
"Curriculum Vitae"

691
00:51:23,152 --> 00:51:25,036
"Unit 2024, 58-2,
Sinsa-dong, Gangnam-gu"

692
00:51:36,266 --> 00:51:37,899
-Hello.
-Yes?

693
00:51:38,066 --> 00:51:39,346
I'd like to ask you a question.

694
00:51:39,426 --> 00:51:40,346
Sure.

695
00:51:40,426 --> 00:51:43,146
Is there a Kim Shinhyuk
living in room 2024?

696
00:51:43,722 --> 00:51:45,442
I'm sorry.

697
00:51:45,826 --> 00:51:48,946
We're not allowed
to release private information.

698
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:51,562
I understand.

699
00:52:08,986 --> 00:52:09,986
Mr Kim.

700
00:52:17,138 --> 00:52:18,538
Is that where you live?

701
00:52:19,706 --> 00:52:20,946
I guess so.

702
00:52:22,746 --> 00:52:24,066
Why do you live in a hotel?

703
00:52:25,706 --> 00:52:28,826
Well, they feed me,
and they do my laundry...

704
00:52:28,906 --> 00:52:30,026
...so it's convenient.

705
00:52:30,402 --> 00:52:34,078
Rumour is that you've accepted an offer
from New Look.

706
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,980
Are you leaving?

707
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:40,666
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

708
00:52:41,786 --> 00:52:46,626
I've been getting bored lately,
so I've been considering it.

709
00:52:51,786 --> 00:52:53,066
I'll get right to the point.

710
00:52:53,786 --> 00:52:55,706
I'm here to convince you to stay.

711
00:52:57,539 --> 00:52:59,779
Will you please stay with the team?

712
00:53:00,354 --> 00:53:02,434
I thought you didn't like me.

713
00:53:07,026 --> 00:53:08,586
Well, personally, I don't like you.

714
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:10,906
No, I didn't like you.

715
00:53:12,586 --> 00:53:17,386
But I need your abilities.

716
00:53:17,946 --> 00:53:19,826
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

717
00:53:20,306 --> 00:53:23,066
If we don't hit number one in sales
for our anniversary issue...

718
00:53:23,706 --> 00:53:25,426
...The Most Korea will be disbanded.

719
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,050
What do you mean by disbanded?

720
00:53:29,146 --> 00:53:30,419
It's what it sounds like.

721
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,666
Headquarters has already
made their decision...

722
00:53:33,026 --> 00:53:34,469
...so I need you now.

723
00:53:35,986 --> 00:53:37,342
We can't do this...

724
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,140
...without you.

725
00:53:41,506 --> 00:53:42,851
That's rather shocking.

726
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:48,186
But I'm not that easy to convince.

727
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,971
The 20th anniversary issue
is our last chance.

728
00:53:51,586 --> 00:53:52,666
After one more...

729
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:58,777
I mean, please reconsider.

730
00:54:05,266 --> 00:54:07,613
I'll check and call you right back.

731
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:11,266
What's this?

732
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,306
Shinhyuk is not here today, either?

733
00:54:14,586 --> 00:54:16,266
Has it been two days already?

734
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:19,035
Did he really quit on us?

735
00:54:19,786 --> 00:54:20,990
He's so selfish.

736
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:23,486
He didn't even finish
his last assignment.

737
00:54:23,746 --> 00:54:27,494
Actually, he sent over
the completed article by email.

738
00:54:28,186 --> 00:54:30,106
His heart is no longer with this place.

739
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:33,770
I guess he's heading over to New Look.

740
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:37,506
I'm disappointed in him.

741
00:54:53,346 --> 00:54:55,306
Mr Kim? Where are you?

742
00:54:55,386 --> 00:54:56,986
You're not really leaving, are you?

743
00:54:57,346 --> 00:55:00,426
Well, I'm sorry,
but is this Kim Hyejin's number?

744
00:55:02,226 --> 00:55:04,386
Yes, you're speaking to her.

745
00:55:05,026 --> 00:55:06,026
How are you?

746
00:55:06,106 --> 00:55:08,666
I work with Miss Min
and my name is Jung Hyunwoo.

747
00:55:10,026 --> 00:55:12,015
I can't get a hold of her...

748
00:55:12,306 --> 00:55:14,506
...and you were listed
as our emergency contact.

749
00:55:20,306 --> 00:55:23,586
The number you have dialled
is no longer in service...

750
00:55:25,106 --> 00:55:26,899
She has tendered her resignation...

751
00:55:27,266 --> 00:55:30,186
...but the general manager would like
to personally speak with her.

752
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:36,426
Hari.

753
00:55:41,106 --> 00:55:43,630
Hyejung wanted to take Hari with her.

754
00:55:54,386 --> 00:55:55,306
"Things I Need to Arrange"

755
00:55:55,386 --> 00:55:56,706
"1. Hotel 2. Car 3. Credit cards..."

756
00:55:58,226 --> 00:55:59,666
Let's put an end to it.

757
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:01,810
I'll just...

758
00:56:06,266 --> 00:56:07,586
...disappear for you.

759
00:56:18,826 --> 00:56:22,666
Mister, did you see Hari today?

760
00:56:23,066 --> 00:56:24,586
Wasn't she going on vacation?

761
00:56:24,986 --> 00:56:27,426
I saw her loading lots of luggage
into a car earlier.

762
00:57:19,866 --> 00:57:21,386
Why is it so steep?

763
00:57:26,906 --> 00:57:31,066
Hari, just leave me here
and bring your mum.

764
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,147
Forget it.
I'm not leaving you here alone.

765
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:35,706
Here we go.

766
00:57:37,786 --> 00:57:39,146
What am I going to do?

767
00:57:40,218 --> 00:57:42,018
I think she really left.

768
00:57:44,426 --> 00:57:45,834
Min Hari.

769
00:57:47,226 --> 00:57:50,066
How can you leave me like this?

770
00:57:52,042 --> 00:57:53,779
If you leave like this...

771
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,386
If you leave...

772
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:01,866
...then what about me?

773
00:58:15,946 --> 00:58:18,946
And that's how Hari left.
