"Episode 7"

2
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:15,324
What is this uncomfortable silence?

3
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:21,652
Wow, it's such a clear day!

4
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:22,754
Please close the window,
I prefer silence.

5
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,615
Yes. We'll go in silence.

6
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:32,366
Wow, these are cool sunglasses!

7
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:33,652
You're going to get smudges on them.

8
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:35,965
I know. We don't want any smudges.

9
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:44,738
I'll take over the wheel
at the next rest stop.

10
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:46,650
I'm not planning to make any stops.

11
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,793
I think we should
head directly there as well.

12
00:00:58,317 --> 00:00:59,597
Do you think this is a vacation?

13
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,665
No.

14
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:04,744
I've got a lot of things on my mind,
so can we go quietly?

15
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:05,733
Sure.

16
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:13,454
I'm trying to be quiet,
but I'm having trouble controlling it.

17
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:15,988
What's this?
Why does he have to be so cold?

18
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,796
If you were going to be this way,
why did you give me the onion?

19
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:33,210
What?

20
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,349
Never mind.

21
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,585
Please carry on.

22
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:40,537
Please take a look at this...

23
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:43,126
-Hey!
-I've seen it already.

24
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:44,840
When is Kim Shinhyuk going to grow up?

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,888
Probably never.

26
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:48,832
No one gives a reaction
quite like Jackson.

27
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,463
Jackson...

28
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,359
Wow, this air is so fresh!

29
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:17,678
Why don't we fill ourselves with food
instead of air?

30
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:18,761
Okay.

31
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:23,778
-How do you do?
-Hello.

32
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:25,868
Would you like to order?
What would you like?

33
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,094
I'll have the vegetable bibimbap.

34
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:28,472
We'll have two tenderloin specials.

35
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:29,708
No, I want the vegetable.

36
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,626
Isn't that too expensive?

37
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,060
Do you have a problem with the price...

38
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,787
...when I'm the one who's paying?

39
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:42,388
You should really try our raw meat plate.

40
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:47,022
It's direct from the farm,
so the meat is really fresh.

41
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:48,422
We'll take an order of that, too.

42
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:49,869
Sure!

43
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:53,133
Two tenderloin specials
and one raw meat platter!

44
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:56,226
It's so expensive!

45
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:58,807
I think it's going to be too much.

46
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,267
I'm not going to ask you to pay,
so don't worry about it.

47
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:03,942
I already told you that it's on me.

48
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:12,634
Who left their wallet here like this?

49
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:16,259
They went together,
so it should be all right.

50
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:20,427
Maybe he left it here on purpose?

51
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:22,007
That's smart.

52
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,774
The meat that we bring in are fresh...

53
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:31,380
...and of top quality.

54
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:33,583
It practically melts in your mouth.

55
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:34,987
Is it done yet?

56
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:40,276
It's to die for!

57
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:41,748
My goodness.

58
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,244
Sorry about the grease.

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,465
Would you like an apron?

60
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,153
Aren't you going to wear one?

61
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,959
I don't care about my clothes.

62
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:52,712
Oh, right... My employee badge.

63
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:54,376
I don't want this to get dirty.

64
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,986
Are you dating the badge?

65
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:58,066
Why must you wear
that on a business trip?

66
00:03:58,623 --> 00:04:00,860
This is my greatest possession.

67
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,018
Simply wearing it gives me strength.

68
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:12,321
I don't know
how I should interpret that scoff.

69
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:13,374
Oh, no.

70
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:16,312
That seems awfully provocative.

71
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:21,644
If you take it off,
you'll get grease on your clothes.

72
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,067
Let's eat.

73
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:33,218
What do you keep looking at?

74
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:40,788
Quit staring at me.

75
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:53,166
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:57,075 --> 00:04:58,079
What the...

77
00:04:58,488 --> 00:05:00,220
You've had a feast.

78
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:04,576
That will be 185 dollars.

79
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:05,680
Yes.

80
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:14,246
It's 185 dollars.

81
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:16,341
Sure.

82
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:22,832
185 dollars!

83
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:34,744
I already told you
that I'm paying for it.

84
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,638
Thank you for the meal!

85
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:49,627
That was the best meat I've ever tasted!

86
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:58,787
Well...

87
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:03,187
Let me borrow some...

88
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:07,806
What did you say? I couldn't hear
because of that motorcycle.

89
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,928
I left it back at the office,

90
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:14,962
my wallet.

91
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:18,081
Let me use your card
during the business trip.

92
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:22,981
Is there something wrong
with this machine?

93
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,983
You don't have enough balance.

94
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:28,807
You're short 40 dollars.

95
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:29,959
Really?

96
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:32,230
What should I do?

97
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,142
We can pay you when
the rest of our team gets here.

98
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:38,267
What?

99
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:40,908
So you can skip out on your tab?

100
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:43,178
We're not those kinds of people.

101
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,636
Then I can leave you with my ID.

102
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:49,264
My goodness. Unbelievable.

103
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:51,254
I'll leave this as collateral,

104
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:53,495
and when our people arrive,
we'll come back to pay you.

105
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,653
I won't put up with this!

106
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:59,631
I have a truckload of these!

107
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:01,892
These are worth a dollar!

108
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:03,226
Give me my 40 dollars.

109
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:04,766
This isn't worth a dollar.

110
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:06,421
This is part of
the 2015 FW Paris collection.

111
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:11,214
I don't care where it's from!

112
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:12,339
This won't do.

113
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,281
Honey, call the police.

114
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:20,082
We've got a problem here!
These people are crazy!

115
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,010
I can't believe they're ripping me off!

116
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,893
How far are you?

117
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:26,381
We're passing Daejeon now.

118
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:27,531
Daejeon?

119
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:29,859
Why are you in Daejeon when you're
supposed to head to Kangwon Province?

120
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:31,060
It's the opposite direction.

121
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:33,627
Oh, my, what am I going to do?

122
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:36,309
I thought it was
in the Kyungsang Province!

123
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,409
So it's Kangwon Province?

124
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:41,700
What am I going to do?

125
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,925
Yes, I'll turn the car around right away.

126
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,703
Why? Is something wrong?

127
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:50,796
We're supposed to be in Kangwon Province,
not Kyungsang.

128
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:52,064
I had no idea.

129
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:54,319
What?

130
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:56,508
How can you make that kind of mistake?

131
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,281
How long will it take us
to get there from here?

132
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:06,905
Call the police.

133
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:08,128
Wait, hold on.

134
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:11,792
I'll call my friend
and tell her to wire the money.

135
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,519
Why isn't she picking up?

136
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:26,743
She's not picking up?

137
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:31,747
Are you sure it's not on purpose?

138
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:35,886
Don't pull any funny business,
and give the phone to me when she does.

139
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:36,948
Okay.

140
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:42,156
Can you call someone
and ask them to send you some money?

141
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,719
I don't have anyone I can call.

142
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:48,041
Not a single person?

143
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:49,969
No one.

144
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,184
How can you not know a single person?

145
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,115
I'm going crazy!

146
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:09,148
That's Shinhyuk's phone.
I wonder where he is?

147
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:11,458
He's in a meeting with Photographer Kang.

148
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:12,920
Gosh.

149
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:18,808
Isn't Jackson supposed to be Hyejin?

150
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:21,532
Yes, Hyejin.

151
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,315
Hello?

152
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:25,466
Yes, hello!

153
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,699
Are you acquaintances with a Kim Hyejin?

154
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:28,997
Who is this?

155
00:09:29,077 --> 00:09:33,011
Yes, Kim Hyejin needs to pay her tab...

156
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:34,933
...but her card has been declined.

157
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:39,754
Please send money
to her account for her tab.

158
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,038
Look here, Lady.

159
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:44,289
This is rather awkward.

160
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:47,005
How are you going to
make a living with that script?

161
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:51,938
Practise your pitch
and try again later, okay?

162
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:55,064
What a joke.

163
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:58,852
No one pick up Hyejin's calls.

164
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,651
Why, Ms Cha?

165
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:04,268
I can't believe that they're
phishing through cell phones now.

166
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:06,108
It was a voice phishing attempt
from Hyejin's number.

167
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,540
I can tell it's fake.

168
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:10,224
Really? Oh, my!

169
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:12,379
I'm getting the same call!

170
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:14,749
Don't pick it up, Ms Joo.

171
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:16,642
I'm not falling for this.

172
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:18,342
Beat it, you phisher!

173
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:20,203
Why isn't anyone picking up?

174
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:21,788
Gosh.

175
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,443
What should we do?

176
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,234
What else can you do?

177
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:31,296
You'll need to work off the rest.

178
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:42,295
Change into this. This is your uniform.

179
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,464
I don't know what you want us to do...

180
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,458
...but I'm not going to wear this.

181
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:50,584
Change into it.

182
00:11:00,822 --> 00:11:01,811
Take a look.

183
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:03,381
This is my farm.

184
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,937
I want you to clean the cow manure,
40 dollars' worth.

185
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:09,974
What?

186
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:11,569
You want us to scoop cow poop?

187
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:13,798
How can you expect us to do that?

188
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,222
I'll call the police then.

189
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:18,645
Hello?

190
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:21,401
-Things are crazy over here!
-We'll scoop the poop!

191
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:24,977
If we don't, the police
will come here, so just do it!

192
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:26,908
But, I've got a weak stomach!

193
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:53,583
Why did you have to order the
tenderloin special and raw meat plate?

194
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:54,903
I can hear you.

195
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:57,805
And I'm sure you ate much
more than I did.

196
00:11:58,023 --> 00:12:01,068
If I knew you were broke, I would've
settled for the vegetable bibimbap!

197
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:03,925
You ordered
an extra bowl of cold noodles!

198
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:07,410
If you didn't order that,
we'd be scooping five dollars less.

199
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:09,347
Why are you changing the story now?

200
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:11,644
You told me that I could order that!

201
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:13,625
Just get back to cleaning the poop.

202
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:17,304
If we stuck with the bibimbap,
we wouldn't be going through this.

203
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:19,051
Again, I can hear you.

204
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:29,500
Cow poop!

205
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,554
Cow poop.

206
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:35,108
Are you okay?

207
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,874
Do I look okay to you?

208
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:37,916
Gosh!

209
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:39,995
I can't do this!

210
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:41,740
The ma'am, the ma'am!

211
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,298
We should pick up the pace.

212
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:03,092
How much poop is 40 dollars' worth?

213
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:09,358
These are good.

214
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:10,774
They're plump and tasty.

215
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:12,035
Thank you for the food!

216
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:13,344
I'm going to eat all of it by myself.

217
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:14,606
You're eating it all again?

218
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:19,365
Of the countless things
we can eat in this world,

219
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:21,365
why are we eating this kind of meat?

220
00:13:21,898 --> 00:13:25,179
You don't know
how great this tastes, do you?

221
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:29,200
-Try it, it's delicious.
-That's disgusting!

222
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:31,236
I feel like politely refusing.

223
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:33,644
Put aside your reservations,
and just try it once.

224
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:34,720
Disgusting.

225
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,140
-Open wide.
-This is wrong.

226
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:41,992
She really enjoyed
eating this disgusting thing.

227
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:49,709
Forget this!

228
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,443
-What are you doing?
-Lunatic.

229
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:53,557
Are you crazy?

230
00:13:53,637 --> 00:13:55,848
It touched the fish cake!
I really wanted the fish cake!

231
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,848
You just want to eat everything yourself.

232
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:00,976
What are you doing?

233
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:12,730
Over there.

234
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,755
There?

235
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:15,740
Enjoy!

236
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,410
Come here, baby!

237
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:24,716
Dig in!

238
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,618
Eat a lot!

239
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:30,089
This is so much poop!

240
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:32,666
-This has to go up there!
-Stop, stop, stop.

241
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,199
A little more.

242
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:43,467
We're done.

243
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:44,835
Here.

244
00:14:46,406 --> 00:14:48,345
I dragged it all the way here,
so you bring it back.

245
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:49,375
What?

246
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:51,860
Seriously?

247
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,666
Why don't we keep this experience
between us?

248
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,080
Why?

249
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,462
What's wrong with scooping cow poop?

250
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,950
Scooping poop because we
couldn't pay for the tab...

251
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,027
...is nothing to brag about.

252
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:25,508
Okay.

253
00:15:25,588 --> 00:15:28,346
If it bothers you that much,
we'll keep it a secret.

254
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:49,207
You've finally worked enough
to pay your tab.

255
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:51,450
You can wash up over there.

256
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:52,599
Yes.

257
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:57,544
What?

258
00:15:57,862 --> 00:15:58,807
My name badge!

259
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:00,553
Where did it go?

260
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,192
I had it just moments ago!

261
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:03,490
You lost your badge?

262
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,756
Yes. Where did I drop it?

263
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:09,131
So, why did you have to wear it
everywhere?

264
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:10,663
Forget it.

265
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:12,765
We don't have time,
so we'll need to wash up and get going.

266
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:15,275
I really need my company badge!

267
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:19,531
You can always have
another one issued to you.

268
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,105
Let's get going.
We've lost enough time already.

269
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,233
It may not be important to you,
but it's important to me.

270
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,304
I can't leave it buried
under a mound of poop.

271
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:33,316
After I wash, I'm leaving
in 20 minutes, no matter what!

272
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,055
Gosh...

273
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:46,212
Seriously. Where did it go?

274
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,806
My badge, my badge.

275
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:01,208
My badge.

276
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,945
My badge!

277
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:21,402
Where did you find it?

278
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,060
I found it on the ground.

279
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,073
Where on the ground?

280
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:25,902
I looked everywhere for it!

281
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:27,550
Are you sure you were
searching carefully?

282
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,190
I found it on the ground in plain view.

283
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:31,312
I'm so relieved.

284
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:34,409
Thank you very much.

285
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:42,740
I wouldn't kiss that.

286
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:45,008
-Let's go now.
-Okay.

287
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:46,431
Hey, young man!

288
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:48,786
What happened to the compost pile?

289
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,155
Did you dig through all of that manure?

290
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:58,509
Did you really dig through
all of that cow poop?

291
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:00,385
To find this for me?

292
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:02,123
What?

293
00:18:02,504 --> 00:18:04,425
I already told you that
I found it on the ground.

294
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:06,917
These flies.

295
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:12,755
-Goodbye!
-Bye.

296
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:13,937
See you around.

297
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,186
Did they lose some gold?

298
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:37,843
This is my very first time.

299
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:41,172
First time working for a great company...

300
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:44,255
...and the first time
I've had my picture on anything.

301
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:49,056
While I was job hunting,

302
00:18:49,136 --> 00:18:52,001
I used to envy people
who had work badges.

303
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:54,837
So every time I look at my badge...

304
00:18:55,323 --> 00:19:01,283
...I'm thankful and it fills me with joy.

305
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:05,038
It reminds me that there's
a place for me in this company.

306
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:09,030
It's proof that
I'm a part of the company.

307
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:15,415
I'm taking this work badge thing
a bit too far, aren't I?

308
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,847
Yes, a bit too far.

309
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:23,325
But I do understand to a certain degree.

310
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:28,537
Everyone has a few things
that are precious...

311
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:31,520
...which seem worthless to others.

312
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:37,076
What kinds of things do you have?

313
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:41,652
The thing you shattered the other day.

314
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:42,830
What?

315
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:46,181
What's this? What are you doing here?

316
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,604
Oh, that.

317
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:59,230
Why the hand?

318
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:14,841
What are you doing right now?

319
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:17,619
What?

320
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:20,050
I'm asking you to repay me
for the shattered glass.

321
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:21,967
What?

322
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,761
My goodness.

323
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:26,344
Oh, you don't have the money right now.

324
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,559
Send it to me when we get back to Seoul.

325
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:29,285
My account number is 0820492...

326
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:30,921
Wait, wait.

327
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,820
What was after 08204?

328
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:38,229
You're too easy to take advantage of.

329
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,657
Haven't you ever heard of a joke before?

330
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,375
I'll pay you back!

331
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:44,795
What was after 04?

332
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,959
Well, it cost me 1,000 dollars.

333
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,932
Okay, I get the joke.

334
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:07,710
Do we have time to be doing this?

335
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,036
I told you that we're fine.

336
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:10,701
He told us to take our time.

337
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:15,197
Oh, my, this chair is dirty.

338
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:16,887
This one, too.

339
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,534
I think I'll have to sit next to you.

340
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:20,623
Let's eat and get out of here.

341
00:21:20,703 --> 00:21:21,545
Okay.

342
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,815
We're not going anywhere.

343
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,524
First, I'll find the perfect moment
for the car to break down.

344
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:30,185
What's the matter with my car?

345
00:21:30,265 --> 00:21:31,341
Why, why?

346
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:34,039
Oh, no, I think my car broke down!

347
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,222
It won't start?

348
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:36,645
No, it's not starting.

349
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:39,335
Do you have anything in here?

350
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,014
This isn't working.

351
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:44,977
Then, I act like I'm making
a call to the service centre.

352
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:46,699
Is this the service centre?

353
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:48,080
Our car broke down here.

354
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,787
We're in the countryside.

355
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:52,106
There are mountains here.

356
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,063
And I can see rice fields all around me.

357
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:56,626
There are also lots of foxtails.

358
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:59,436
The sky is beautiful here.

359
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:04,071
The sun will eventually go down.

360
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:07,367
Oh, my, Joonwoo. Look at the stars.

361
00:22:07,447 --> 00:22:09,991
They're so pretty, aren't they?

362
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:17,569
As we stargaze together,
naturally we'll...

363
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:23,157
...kiss.

364
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,130
Then as of today, my boyfriend will be...

365
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,274
...Kim Joonwoo, the son
of the Jinsung Group's chairman.

366
00:22:28,354 --> 00:22:32,034
And I'll be hitting the biggest
jackpot of my life!

367
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:35,702
Why aren't you eating?

368
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:38,554
Well, I am eating.

369
00:22:49,472 --> 00:22:52,872
Wow, it's the ocean!

370
00:22:57,217 --> 00:22:59,088
Right, we're here for work.

371
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:01,401
Oh, this is nice.

372
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:05,261
Oh, this is nice!

373
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,223
Let's look around.

374
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:12,947
Then I'd like to make
a phone call before we begin.

375
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:15,657
If the other two is going to be late,
we need money for dinner.

376
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:17,680
I'll need someone to wire us some money.

377
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:22,722
But you're really going to
pay me back, right?

378
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,302
Serious?

379
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:27,286
I'll sign a promissory note then.
My goodness.

380
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,452
You're pretty gullible yourself, Mr Ji.

381
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:32,653
I was only kidding.

382
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,853
Go ahead and make your call.

383
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:36,922
Yes, sir.

384
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:42,899
Yes, Hyejin.

385
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:45,309
Do you want to have dinner
with me later tonight?

386
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:46,306
Well...

387
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:49,745
How about at 8 PM in Kangwon Province?

388
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,241
Why Kangwon?

389
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:54,345
Oh, you're on a business trip,
aren't you?

390
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:57,012
Are you coming back tomorrow?

391
00:24:01,162 --> 00:24:03,705
Sungjoon, I'm getting another call.
I'll call you back.

392
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:05,671
Yes, I'll call you
when I get back to Seoul.

393
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:06,698
Yes.

394
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:12,568
Hey, wife.

395
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:15,269
You weren't getting your phone all day.

396
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:16,720
I know.

397
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,628
I was involved in some labour earlier.

398
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:20,808
What are you talking about?

399
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:22,837
I'll tell you when I get back to Seoul.

400
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:25,478
Hari, I need to borrow some money.

401
00:24:25,776 --> 00:24:28,506
What?
Why do I feel like you're phishing me?

402
00:24:28,818 --> 00:24:32,404
We need money right now,
but I have no money in my account.

403
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:33,879
Yes, okay. I'll send it right away.

404
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,088
Oh, and I'll be back tomorrow.

405
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:37,945
I got caught up
with a business trip at work.

406
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,605
A business trip?

407
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,345
With whom?

408
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,035
Ji Sungjoon.

409
00:24:44,944 --> 00:24:46,126
Just the two of you?

410
00:24:46,406 --> 00:24:47,674
Well, as of now.

411
00:24:47,754 --> 00:24:49,758
But our teammates are joining us
later tonight.

412
00:24:50,243 --> 00:24:51,802
Oh, I see.

413
00:24:52,215 --> 00:24:53,255
Thanks!

414
00:24:53,335 --> 00:24:55,082
What? Yes.

415
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:56,972
Sure.

416
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,550
I think this belongs to you.

417
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:15,268
Ahreum, aren't you going home?

418
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,094
Go home? It's only 4 PM.

419
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:18,095
What?

420
00:25:18,271 --> 00:25:19,387
It's only 4 PM?

421
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:21,178
It really is.

422
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:22,865
It's only 4:00.

423
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,643
I thought it was about seven.

424
00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:27,728
Isn't time going so slow today?

425
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,960
Good. If you're not busy,
you can do this for me.

426
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,537
I'm going out for some fresh air.

427
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:32,889
Hey!

428
00:25:33,707 --> 00:25:34,889
Why, that...

429
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,522
Are you sure that you know the way?

430
00:25:44,602 --> 00:25:46,030
Why are we still in the countryside?

431
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,556
I know the way.

432
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:48,605
This is...

433
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:50,990
...a shortcut.

434
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,919
That's odd...

435
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:56,612
Hey, you're sweating.

436
00:25:56,692 --> 00:25:57,928
-Are you okay?
-What?

437
00:25:58,263 --> 00:25:59,635
I'm totally...

438
00:26:00,944 --> 00:26:02,426
...not fine.

439
00:26:03,848 --> 00:26:04,872
Oh, no.

440
00:26:04,952 --> 00:26:07,229
I think something was wrong
with the fish I had earlier.

441
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:08,900
What am I going to do?

442
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,839
I need to use the restroom.

443
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:11,987
You have indigestion?

444
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,881
Bathroom.

445
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:15,983
Oh, no, I don't see
any bathrooms around here.

446
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:19,502
I can't hold it much longer.

447
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:21,414
I need a bathroom!

448
00:26:21,903 --> 00:26:23,503
-This is crazy!
-What am I going to do?

449
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:25,800
Hey, hey! Isn't that a bathroom?

450
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,319
Where, where?

451
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:28,448
Yes, it is!

452
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,670
I thought I was going to die.

453
00:26:52,662 --> 00:26:53,909
But...

454
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:56,746
Why did this have to happen
in front of Kim Joonwoo?

455
00:26:58,872 --> 00:26:59,858
It's okay.

456
00:26:59,938 --> 00:27:01,150
You can handle this, Seol.

457
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:03,977
What's this?

458
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:05,776
Why is this happening?

459
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,393
Han Seol, are you okay?

460
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:18,008
Hey, can you give me some tissue?

461
00:27:18,608 --> 00:27:19,480
What?

462
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:23,394
I need tissue, tissue.

463
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:25,856
What? I can't hear you, speak louder.

464
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:29,044
Give me some tissue!
There's no tissue here!

465
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:30,799
Oh, tissue?

466
00:27:31,955 --> 00:27:34,027
It's all over now!

467
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,007
No, it's okay.

468
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:40,176
You can handle this, Seol.

469
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:41,496
You can do it.

470
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:50,334
Are you okay?

471
00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:53,585
It's only a natural
physiological phenomenon.

472
00:27:53,665 --> 00:27:54,524
Let's go.

473
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,813
Since we're here,
I should use the restroom too.

474
00:28:00,777 --> 00:28:02,529
It's okay, you can manage this, Seol.

475
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:07,118
You can't handle this!

476
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:10,327
This is so humiliating! It's all over!

477
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:16,772
Han Seol, are you okay?

478
00:28:16,852 --> 00:28:18,428
That was the smell of compost.

479
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,256
Can't you see that
we're surrounded by it?

480
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:22,455
You've got to know that!

481
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:25,647
All right, let me help you get up.

482
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:28,853
That wasn't me, it was the compost!

483
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:32,867
Why? Does your leg hurt?

484
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:34,025
Yes.

485
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:39,772
You've sprained it really badly.

486
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,378
Do you think you can still drive?

487
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:43,465
No, I can't. You'll have to drive.

488
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,783
I don't have a license.

489
00:28:44,863 --> 00:28:45,791
What?

490
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:49,309
Why isn't my little sister
getting her phone?

491
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:56,633
Yes, Kim Joonwoo.

492
00:28:56,922 --> 00:28:59,159
How's the location hunt coming along?

493
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,290
It's an emergency.

494
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,880
We're barely halfway there,
and we're stranded.

495
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
What?

496
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,103
Han Seol sprained her leg,
so she can't drive.

497
00:29:06,183 --> 00:29:07,346
And I don't have a license.

498
00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:08,626
Hey, what about Jackson?

499
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:10,718
I mean, Hyejin.

500
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:12,851
She's gone ahead with the deputy chief.

501
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:14,373
Hey, hey.

502
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,060
Turn around. I've got the runs again.

503
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,034
Hey, let go of me!

504
00:29:19,863 --> 00:29:22,257
-Hey, I've got to go.
-Hurry! Hurry!

505
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:25,242
Hey, Kim Joonwoo. Hey, you!

506
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:29,678
Wait.

507
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:35,065
Does that mean Jackson is alone with him?

508
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:38,151
This is an overnight business trip.

509
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:48,861
Mr Ji.

510
00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:52,391
We can see the lighthouse from here,
so isn't this place perfect?

511
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:54,721
It's also perfect for our theme
of vacationing alone.

512
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:56,004
I guess so.

513
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,908
It's not bad.

514
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:05,237
Do you draft the plans yourself?

515
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:07,638
Yes, well whatever comes into my head.

516
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,468
That's really cool.

517
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:24,780
I'm thinking about monotone colours.

518
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:28,649
We want to portray the loneliness
while vacationing alone.

519
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:32,726
We should also include a lamp
and some letterheads on the table.

520
00:30:33,955 --> 00:30:34,838
Letterheads?

521
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,431
Even if you come here alone...

522
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:40,176
...you'd want to write about it
and tell someone.

523
00:30:40,753 --> 00:30:42,745
And sometimes you
feel like sending a letter...

524
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:45,037
...instead of making a phone call.

525
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,066
I'm sure the person would
rather be here at the ocean...

526
00:30:49,146 --> 00:30:50,771
...with someone special.

527
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:54,070
So this person might
light a bonfire alone...

528
00:30:54,657 --> 00:30:56,724
...drink some warm tea...

529
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,090
...and maybe take a few Polaroid pictures.

530
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,940
The person would probably
have a great time.

531
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:07,332
Because he wants to tell that special...

532
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,885
...someone that this is a great place...

533
00:31:10,105 --> 00:31:13,698
...and that they should come together
next time.

534
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:19,104
Portraying letters and postcards
would change the theme...

535
00:31:19,618 --> 00:31:24,406
...from loneliness to one of anticipation.

536
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,293
Oh, I'm sorry.

537
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:35,065
I think I took it too far again.

538
00:31:35,303 --> 00:31:37,015
Like I know anything!

539
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:43,541
Come to think of it,
I've experienced that before.

540
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,553
Anticipating letters.

541
00:31:50,694 --> 00:31:52,112
What are you going to do
with all that bread?

542
00:31:52,192 --> 00:31:53,672
You're not going to eat
all these, are you?

543
00:31:53,752 --> 00:31:54,945
What? You're going to cry?

544
00:31:55,453 --> 00:31:56,651
Come on, cry!

545
00:31:56,732 --> 00:31:57,924
Come on, come on.

546
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:00,739
When I moved overseas as a kid...

547
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:03,819
...I couldn't speak the language
and I had no friends.

548
00:32:04,563 --> 00:32:08,040
But I had a friend who would
send me letters from Korea.

549
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:13,838
I wanted to tell her
that I was doing well...

550
00:32:14,994 --> 00:32:16,679
...and that I was adjusting well.

551
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:24,144
I think she gave me the courage
to stay strong and survive.

552
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:32,978
Although, when the letters
stopped arriving...

553
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,515
...I was a bit heartbroken.

554
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:42,511
I see.

555
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:46,514
Anyway, I guess we'll end up
with a warmer feature article.

556
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,472
Good idea!

557
00:32:58,472 --> 00:33:00,173
I should finish up the sketches.

558
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:07,069
Are there any better locations?

559
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,838
How do you do?

560
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:17,894
Your dog is so pretty! How old is he?

561
00:33:17,974 --> 00:33:19,126
He's three years old.

562
00:33:19,856 --> 00:33:21,843
-What's his name?
-His name is Professor.

563
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:25,438
So cute!

564
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:28,180
Bye now!

565
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:30,209
Bye.

566
00:33:57,444 --> 00:33:58,665
Yes, Ms. Cha.

567
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:01,348
We've found a great location.

568
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:04,658
I'll send you some photos
I took with my phone.

569
00:34:05,464 --> 00:34:06,405
All right!

570
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:08,005
Kim Hyejin.

571
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:10,951
Why don't we wrap things
up here and move on?

572
00:34:14,577 --> 00:34:16,343
Why are you looking at me like that?

573
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,886
Is something on my face?

574
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,148
No.

575
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:22,439
It's just my first time.

576
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:24,706
Your first time for what?

577
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:28,067
It's the first time I heard you
call me by my name.

578
00:34:28,147 --> 00:34:30,330
You were always like,
"Look here, Support".

579
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:33,142
I didn't always refer to you
as "Look here, Support"!

580
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:34,204
Look here, Support.

581
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:35,193
Look here, Support.

582
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,674
Hey, look here, Support.

583
00:34:36,754 --> 00:34:37,593
Look here, Support.

584
00:34:37,673 --> 00:34:38,609
Look here, Support.

585
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:39,725
Look here, Support.

586
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:46,886
Still, isn't that more appropriate
than Crazy Joon?

587
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:49,903
-How do you feel about that?
-Pardon?

588
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:51,766
That nickname is perfect for him,
Crazy Joon.

589
00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:54,435
Look here, you Crazy Joon...

590
00:34:54,797 --> 00:34:57,705
I wasn't the one who created
that nickname.

591
00:34:57,785 --> 00:34:59,022
Let's go have some dinner.

592
00:35:00,704 --> 00:35:01,805
Gosh.

593
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:05,943
How can you call me Crazy Joon?

594
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:07,235
You've got the wrong idea.

595
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:08,927
It wasn't me who referred to you as that.

596
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:10,989
You can always pay back
that 1,000 dollars.

597
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:13,859
What? That has nothing to do with this.

598
00:35:14,116 --> 00:35:15,834
How can you call me Crazy Joon?

599
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,022
I told you, it wasn't me!

600
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:23,537
What are you doing?

601
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,068
I don't eat peas.

602
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:36,381
It doesn't taste very good
and it's all mushy.

603
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:38,166
I don't know why people eat it.

604
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:42,288
Why are you laughing?

605
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:44,751
You just reminded me of someone.

606
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:49,123
Oh, it's a Rubik's cube.

607
00:35:54,938 --> 00:35:56,707
Oh, my. I solved it!

608
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,964
I solved it! I must be a genius.

609
00:36:00,343 --> 00:36:02,160
You've only solved one side.

610
00:36:03,257 --> 00:36:05,080
Let me see that. I'll solve it for you.

611
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,892
I only need 30 seconds.

612
00:36:11,076 --> 00:36:12,865
Wow, you're fast!

613
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,317
It's not working.

614
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:20,611
What was that? This takes brains...

615
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:23,546
...but I guess you're
not some genius, either.

616
00:36:23,626 --> 00:36:26,194
I'm good at anything that takes brains!

617
00:36:26,274 --> 00:36:29,329
You know, the video game
where you stack blocks...

618
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:30,983
What was the name of that game?

619
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:36,185
-That, right?
-Yes, that! The name was...

620
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,783
-Tetris!
-Tetris!

621
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:43,824
It takes me a tenth of a second
to drop each block.

622
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:47,009
I think so fast,
that you can hardly keep up.

623
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:49,915
And you've got
the wrong jingle for Tetris.

624
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:56,696
That's the main melody.

625
00:36:56,776 --> 00:36:59,077
No, it's not! Tetris goes...

626
00:37:04,907 --> 00:37:06,379
You're completely wrong.

627
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:08,555
You have a knack for arguing, Kim Hyejin.

628
00:37:08,856 --> 00:37:10,355
You're wrong, I tell you!

629
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:13,779
Did you like girl groups?

630
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:14,951
Of course I did!

631
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:16,105
One, two, three!

632
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:17,236
-SES!
-SES!

633
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:19,849
Which SES member?

634
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:20,956
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

635
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:22,050
Did you watch dramas?

636
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,206
Yes, I did.

637
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:24,458
What did you like to watch?

638
00:37:24,736 --> 00:37:26,257
-Star in my Heart!
-Star in my Heart!

639
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,171
-That's amazing!
-My goodness.

640
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:32,478
-Looking here and there.
-Michael.

641
00:37:33,177 --> 00:37:34,883
You have the same hairstyle.

642
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:38,075
If you are the same age as me,
I bet you know this very well.

643
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,469
-The one with pointy hair...
-I know.

644
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,168
I'm really sorry,
but we're closing for the night.

645
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,580
Oh, really?

646
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:51,831
Wow, look at the time.

647
00:37:55,345 --> 00:37:57,531
We were here for a long time.

648
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:58,697
Yes.

649
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,660
-Should we get going?
-Yes, of course.

650
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:14,890
I'm so sorry.

651
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,454
Are you still sick?

652
00:38:25,688 --> 00:38:26,792
No, I'm fine.

653
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,786
I think something
got caught in my throat.

654
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,454
I forgot to thank you for that.

655
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:44,398
Thank you for that day.

656
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,096
It's going to be okay.

657
00:38:47,606 --> 00:38:48,680
It's okay.

658
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:50,562
Nothing's going to happen.

659
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:53,764
Yes, well.

660
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:02,612
My mother died...

661
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,638
...when I was 12.

662
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:08,958
She was in a car accident on a rainy day.

663
00:39:10,637 --> 00:39:13,083
Mum.

664
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:15,768
Ever since that day,
I had a hard time driving in the rain.

665
00:39:16,193 --> 00:39:18,359
I keep getting the feeling...

666
00:39:18,682 --> 00:39:21,612
...that I'll be in the same
kind of accident.

667
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,362
I was doing fine for a while...

668
00:39:24,232 --> 00:39:27,210
...but I don't know
what happened that day.

669
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:32,039
But why am I talking about this?

670
00:39:32,948 --> 00:39:35,905
Was there whiskey in my dessert?

671
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,895
Wow!

672
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:04,457
I wish I could take half
of this back to Seoul.

673
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:15,036
I thought you had become
a completely different person.

674
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:21,499
I thought my gentle, pudgy
friend Sungjoon disappeared forever.

675
00:40:23,095 --> 00:40:26,258
But you're still the same.

676
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:30,124
If I didn't hide from you like a fool,

677
00:40:30,423 --> 00:40:32,958
we'd be laughing comfortably
together like right now.

678
00:40:33,116 --> 00:40:35,921
And I'd be there for you
during your difficult times.

679
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:38,750
Sungjoon!

680
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:42,655
Today...

681
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:47,928
...I think I could come clean today.

682
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:52,228
That I'm your friend, Kim Hyejin.

683
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:54,704
I think I can tell you everything...

684
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:59,211
on a day like today.

685
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,052
Yes, Mr Ji.

686
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:12,287
I don't think she can drive right now.

687
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:14,825
Yes, I'm sorry.

688
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:16,947
I'll see you back at the company.

689
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,790
Yes, sir.

690
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:25,763
That was the smell of compost.

691
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:27,502
Can't you see that
we're surrounded by it?

692
00:41:27,582 --> 00:41:29,871
You've got to know that!

693
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:32,292
Hey, hey.

694
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:35,999
Turn around. I've got the runs again...

695
00:41:39,126 --> 00:41:40,543
She's kind of cute.

696
00:41:41,506 --> 00:41:44,211
I'm done for! My life is over!

697
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:46,046
Ouch!

698
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,410
It's all over.

699
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,846
I'm done for.

700
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:05,995
I'm about to tell you something
that might surprise you.

701
00:42:06,602 --> 00:42:08,691
Have you ever heard that...

702
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:15,324
...some memories
are best kept in the past.

703
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:21,637
And that memories are most beautiful
when they're reminisced?

704
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:26,631
I felt that way until recently.

705
00:42:28,288 --> 00:42:29,369
But today...

706
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:34,806
...I realized
that it might not be the case.

707
00:42:40,294 --> 00:42:42,845
Kim Hyejin,
what are you trying to tell me?

708
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:44,155
Mr Ji.

709
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,830
-To be honest...
-Hey, Sister!

710
00:42:59,649 --> 00:43:01,239
You owe me sea snails!

711
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:04,863
I, Kim Hyejin, promise to grant
Kim Shinhyuk three favours!

712
00:43:04,943 --> 00:43:07,918
See, you've made me a promise!

713
00:43:07,998 --> 00:43:10,885
Are you trying to back out of our deal?

714
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,856
What sea snails?

715
00:43:13,482 --> 00:43:17,191
Who comes all the way
to Kangwon Province for sea snails?

716
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:18,766
Me.

717
00:43:19,984 --> 00:43:21,123
I'm kidding.

718
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:24,231
Joonwoo couldn't make it,
so I'm filling in for him.

719
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:27,483
I thought you might need help
hunting for a location.

720
00:43:28,474 --> 00:43:30,834
I didn't know that you work so hard.

721
00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:32,790
Let's go inside.

722
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:36,523
Since I just got here, we should
have a drink before we call it a night!

723
00:43:36,774 --> 00:43:37,885
I don't drink.

724
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,597
Then go on ahead.

725
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:42,635
-We'll go after we've had a drink.
-What?

726
00:43:42,715 --> 00:43:44,781
Let's go.
They have non-alcoholic beer these days.

727
00:43:47,536 --> 00:43:49,574
Why did you come here?

728
00:43:49,654 --> 00:43:50,845
Why do you think?

729
00:43:51,401 --> 00:43:52,751
Let's go, Little Sister.

730
00:43:54,992 --> 00:43:59,021
Hey, it's nice to be away from the city!

731
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:03,205
But since I came here in such a hurry...

732
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:05,441
...I didn't pack any underwear.

733
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:08,156
Do you have any underwear
that I can borrow?

734
00:44:10,116 --> 00:44:11,490
Did you leave yours with me?

735
00:44:11,976 --> 00:44:13,475
I'm not an underwear merchant...

736
00:44:13,555 --> 00:44:15,680
...so stop talking
about underwear with me!

737
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,820
I've only brought my own.

738
00:44:18,091 --> 00:44:20,925
Then do I have to wash mine and dry them?

739
00:44:21,153 --> 00:44:24,472
I usually sleep in my underwear.

740
00:44:24,552 --> 00:44:27,561
If I have to wash them,
where will that put me?

741
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,184
I'm so sorry.

742
00:44:31,264 --> 00:44:32,620
Goodness.

743
00:44:33,412 --> 00:44:36,056
Buy a pair at the convenience store.

744
00:44:36,136 --> 00:44:37,863
You're definitely a brain.

745
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:40,753
Why didn't I think of that?

746
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:43,714
Hyejin, let me open that for you.

747
00:44:43,794 --> 00:44:45,037
Since I'm your older brother.

748
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:47,794
This is how you open this.

749
00:44:55,148 --> 00:44:58,123
Outside the company,
we've agreed to be siblings.

750
00:44:58,203 --> 00:44:59,606
Right, Hyejin?

751
00:45:00,424 --> 00:45:02,362
Oh, brother and sister?

752
00:45:03,923 --> 00:45:05,555
That's not alcohol-free.

753
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:12,919
Kim Hyejin likes to be
friendly with everyone.

754
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,788
No, it's not like that...

755
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:17,323
Little Sister, wait a second.

756
00:45:18,376 --> 00:45:19,695
There's something on your face.

757
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:22,134
There, it's gone.

758
00:45:23,238 --> 00:45:26,101
I brought you a gift from Seoul.

759
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,202
A gift.

760
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:39,257
Yes! That's the reaction
I was waiting for!

761
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:40,456
Am I right?

762
00:45:41,378 --> 00:45:42,522
Seriously!

763
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:46,369
I thought it was a real bug!

764
00:45:50,472 --> 00:45:51,947
There was a mosquito buzzing around.

765
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:53,914
Mosquitoes in the fall?

766
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,164
Hey, that didn't feel so good.

767
00:46:02,506 --> 00:46:04,111
You look really creepy.

768
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:05,180
What?

769
00:46:07,343 --> 00:46:09,705
Greasy and creepy...

770
00:46:18,384 --> 00:46:19,371
Hurry.

771
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,998
How does someone get drunk so quickly?

772
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:36,412
I can't tell whether he's drunk or not.

773
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,013
That was tiring.
Jackson, get me a cup of water.

774
00:46:39,093 --> 00:46:40,418
Go and get it yourself.

775
00:46:41,463 --> 00:46:44,635
If you can't handle a single drink,
why did you insist on drinking?

776
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,629
Aren't you going to get a cup
of water for your older brother?

777
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:49,190
Are you going to act petty like this?

778
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:56,129
Jackson, do you think I look creepy, too?

779
00:46:57,463 --> 00:46:58,537
No, right?

780
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:01,457
I'll get you some water.

781
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,899
What's wrong with my face?

782
00:47:07,094 --> 00:47:08,093
Tell me what?

783
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:09,632
What? What is it?

784
00:47:11,271 --> 00:47:12,704
You startled me!

785
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:17,627
You're so good looking,
I'm always surprised to see you.

786
00:47:19,743 --> 00:47:20,763
Hi.

787
00:47:21,357 --> 00:47:22,871
Shall I look through the pictures?

788
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,910
There are a lot of great locations.

789
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,272
I missed you, my friend.

790
00:48:30,293 --> 00:48:32,352
Hey, when did you get home?

791
00:48:32,432 --> 00:48:34,190
-Late last night.
-I see.

792
00:48:34,674 --> 00:48:37,560
Did anything happen
at your business trip?

793
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,800
Happen? Like what?

794
00:48:39,654 --> 00:48:43,477
Was it awkward between
you and Ji Sungjoon?

795
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:46,147
I thought it would be.

796
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:48,882
But he's easy to get along
with outside of work.

797
00:48:49,962 --> 00:48:51,112
I have to get going now.

798
00:48:51,587 --> 00:48:54,333
It's the week of deadlines,
so it'll be hard to see each other.

799
00:48:54,413 --> 00:48:56,729
Don't cry because I'm not here,
and don't wait up for me.

800
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:57,809
Okay.

801
00:48:58,779 --> 00:49:00,846
Make sure that you feed yourself!

802
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:02,211
Okay.

803
00:49:02,762 --> 00:49:04,672
Hey, you're going to fall! Stop running!

804
00:49:13,182 --> 00:49:15,639
Good morning, Kim Hyejin.

805
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,184
Oh, yes.

806
00:49:18,264 --> 00:49:20,194
Good morning, Mr Ji.

807
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,626
-Good morning.
-How are you?

808
00:49:24,706 --> 00:49:25,998
Hello.

809
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:29,541
Now, it's time for deadlines, so let's
all cooperate together and do well.

810
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:30,543
Yes, sir.

811
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,593
Let's do this!

812
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:33,426
-Let's do it!
-Go for it!

813
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,208
-What's wrong with Mr Ji?
-Is something wrong with him?

814
00:49:41,288 --> 00:49:43,405
His new attitude is starting to scare me.

815
00:49:48,065 --> 00:49:50,979
Hey, you're growing a beard!

816
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:52,230
Looks good on you.

817
00:49:54,196 --> 00:49:57,432
Everyone, let's do this!

818
00:49:57,512 --> 00:49:59,475
-Yes!
-Yes!

819
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:07,098
I think it's good, but it would be
better to take this bit out.

820
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:08,321
Is this the only thing
that needs editing?

821
00:50:08,401 --> 00:50:10,010
-Yes.
-I understand.

822
00:50:13,793 --> 00:50:14,795
Yes, Hyejin.

823
00:50:15,424 --> 00:50:17,371
How was your business trip?

824
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:21,185
I couldn't get a hold of you.

825
00:50:21,265 --> 00:50:23,586
Sorry, I've lost track of time.

826
00:50:24,324 --> 00:50:26,177
Mr Ji, the photographs
for the movie segment...

827
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:27,267
Wait a moment.

828
00:50:27,347 --> 00:50:29,414
I have deadlines to meet,
so I'm a bit busy now.

829
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:31,301
Sorry, I'll have to call you back.

830
00:50:32,183 --> 00:50:34,010
Sungjoon, Sungjoon.

831
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:56,910
Thanks for lunch.

832
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,098
I'm so tired.

833
00:51:22,766 --> 00:51:23,817
Hyejin.

834
00:51:26,756 --> 00:51:27,878
Hyejin.

835
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:29,469
Get me the box.

836
00:51:29,549 --> 00:51:30,690
Yes, I understand.

837
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,908
It's finished!

838
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:37,092
I'm going to sleep until tomorrow.

839
00:51:37,172 --> 00:51:39,205
The person who wakes me will die.

840
00:51:39,285 --> 00:51:40,714
So stay away from me.

841
00:51:40,794 --> 00:51:42,756
I need some sleep.

842
00:51:51,389 --> 00:51:52,597
Have you arrived?

843
00:51:53,307 --> 00:51:54,895
Good work everyone.

844
00:51:55,564 --> 00:51:57,634
Hang in there a little longer.

845
00:51:57,849 --> 00:51:58,746
Pardon?

846
00:51:59,447 --> 00:52:04,670
The models for our anniversary edition
will be available this Thursday.

847
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:08,774
They're top models,
so we have to accommodate their schedules.

848
00:52:09,077 --> 00:52:11,432
I'm going to lose it!

849
00:52:12,121 --> 00:52:13,343
Come on now.

850
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:17,367
This is the final stretch,
so let's work hard and celebrate after.

851
00:52:19,243 --> 00:52:21,336
I should quit this job.

852
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:23,213
I don't care about wealth
or honour anymore.

853
00:52:23,293 --> 00:52:24,227
Yes.

854
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,562
What's going to be our makeup concept?

855
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,646
-Yes.
-Is that so? Yes.

856
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,405
Regarding the collaboration
with James Taylor...

857
00:52:28,485 --> 00:52:30,317
Let's schedule it for this Thursday.

858
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,393
Yes.

859
00:52:34,471 --> 00:52:35,492
Yes.

860
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,391
Yes?

861
00:52:44,247 --> 00:52:45,394
You have a delivery.

862
00:52:46,836 --> 00:52:47,863
Thank you.

863
00:52:48,452 --> 00:52:49,874
Well, Mr Ji.

864
00:52:50,623 --> 00:52:54,432
After the photo shoot on Thursday,
will you have some time?

865
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:58,882
I can't pay you for the glass,
but I'd like to buy you dinner.

866
00:52:59,232 --> 00:53:01,728
And there's something
I'd like to tell you.

867
00:53:05,285 --> 00:53:06,158
All right then.

868
00:53:23,454 --> 00:53:27,349
Jackson, what were you
talking to Mr Ji about?

869
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:31,533
I asked him if he had time
after the photo shoot on Thursday.

870
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:33,689
I plan to tell him everything then.

871
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,328
Really?

872
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:47,192
Why are you looking at me like that?

873
00:53:49,788 --> 00:53:50,749
Oh, no.

874
00:53:53,204 --> 00:53:57,298
Do I remind you
of your little sister again?

875
00:53:57,378 --> 00:53:58,329
What?

876
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:01,746
Yes.

877
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:05,147
The more I look at you,
the more you start to resemble her.

878
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:11,124
The way you can eat anything,
and the way you look at me.

879
00:54:12,955 --> 00:54:14,349
Go on and eat, Little Sister.

880
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:15,417
Yes.

881
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,339
That's hot!

882
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:27,443
Now, you're exactly like her.

883
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:31,217
Let's eat.

884
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:37,649
Big Brother, have some more noodles.

885
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:41,602
You don't have to do that.

886
00:54:42,408 --> 00:54:43,571
How much do I owe you?

887
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:44,882
It'll be 20 dollars.

888
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:49,174
Wow, that's so cute!

889
00:54:49,254 --> 00:54:50,552
Is that your dog?

890
00:54:50,632 --> 00:54:51,743
Yes, that's her.

891
00:54:51,823 --> 00:54:52,736
Coco.

892
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:54,380
My younger sister.

893
00:54:55,163 --> 00:54:56,406
-Thank you, Aunt.
-Thank you.

894
00:54:56,486 --> 00:54:57,944
-Good night.
-Bye.

895
00:54:58,721 --> 00:55:00,363
Coco? Sister?

896
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,703
Little Sister?

897
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,508
Then are you comparing me to your dog?

898
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:08,986
A dog?

899
00:55:09,066 --> 00:55:09,919
Yes, why?

900
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:11,349
I thought she was your sister!

901
00:55:11,429 --> 00:55:13,721
Yes, my little sister.
She was a part of the family.

902
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:18,758
You didn't think she was human, did you?

903
00:55:19,878 --> 00:55:22,290
You've had the wrong idea!

904
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:24,850
You're completely confused.

905
00:55:26,803 --> 00:55:27,795
Why, you...

906
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:28,833
Are you making fun of me?

907
00:55:28,913 --> 00:55:30,321
Come here!

908
00:55:30,768 --> 00:55:32,669
What's the matter?
I never said she's human.

909
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:34,782
You want to get bitten by a woman
that looks like a dog?

910
00:55:34,862 --> 00:55:36,707
Coco never bit anyone! Don't bite me!

911
00:55:36,787 --> 00:55:38,771
Coco, my foot!
I'm going to bite your nose!

912
00:55:38,851 --> 00:55:41,518
I didn't do anything,
so why are you overreacting?

913
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:49,999
You always joke around and tease me
and now you compare me to your dog?

914
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:53,839
Why did I give you more noodles?

915
00:55:53,919 --> 00:55:55,222
About that...

916
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:58,391
I felt sorry for you because
I thought that your sister died!

917
00:55:58,471 --> 00:56:01,142
I wanted to be good to you,
but this is going too far!

918
00:56:01,222 --> 00:56:02,781
How can you do this to me?

919
00:56:06,041 --> 00:56:08,815
Are you ignoring me like a dog now?

920
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:12,154
Yes, that's all you think I am, a dog.

921
00:56:18,452 --> 00:56:19,874
That's why I said that.

922
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:22,883
Yes, let's hear your reason!

923
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,778
Why do you treat me like this? Why?

924
00:56:25,658 --> 00:56:26,717
Jackson,

925
00:56:27,393 --> 00:56:29,247
I think I have feelings for you.

926
00:56:31,406 --> 00:56:32,370
What?

927
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,124
You told me that you're
coming clean with the chief editor.

928
00:56:34,204 --> 00:56:35,790
But for some reason, it bothered me.

929
00:56:36,362 --> 00:56:39,568
It bothers me to think that things
will go well between the two of you.

930
00:56:39,648 --> 00:56:41,923
And I keep thinking about you.

931
00:56:42,508 --> 00:56:44,178
I was wondering why I felt that way...

932
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:46,687
...and now I think I know.

933
00:56:50,338 --> 00:56:52,217
I think I like you.

934
00:56:52,861 --> 00:56:54,087
A lot.

935
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,930
Mr Kim.

936
00:57:00,736 --> 00:57:02,252
What are you talking about?

937
00:57:05,866 --> 00:57:08,244
I almost fell for it again!

938
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,566
Your ridiculous lies!

939
00:57:09,646 --> 00:57:11,515
It's not a lie. I'm being sincere.

940
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,513
I really have feelings for you.

941
00:57:13,593 --> 00:57:15,110
Yes, right!

942
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:17,801
I'm not talking to you anymore!

943
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:20,775
Seriously.

944
00:57:22,988 --> 00:57:24,063
Really?

945
00:57:26,323 --> 00:57:27,728
You can't do that to me!

946
00:57:30,195 --> 00:57:32,138
I've really fallen for her!

947
00:57:32,218 --> 00:57:34,169
I like her, even when she acts like that!

948
00:57:34,424 --> 00:57:35,463
Jackson!

949
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,793
Hyejin.

950
00:57:36,873 --> 00:57:37,995
Kim Hyejin!

951
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,963
How was the business trip?

952
00:57:42,274 --> 00:57:43,230
The business trip?

953
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:47,723
It was rather odd this time around.

954
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:49,488
Do you know what I did there?

955
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:51,071
I scooped cow manure...

956
00:57:52,462 --> 00:57:54,702
I don't think the timing is right.
We've just had dinner.

957
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:56,338
Why?

958
00:57:56,496 --> 00:57:57,990
Was it fun?

959
00:57:59,092 --> 00:58:00,573
No, I'll tell you about it next time.

960
00:58:01,692 --> 00:58:02,888
Why, what is it?

961
00:58:04,238 --> 00:58:08,025
We have an intern that shares your name.

962
00:58:08,105 --> 00:58:09,436
She's our age,

963
00:58:09,858 --> 00:58:13,092
but she remembers all of the arcade
jingles from back in the day.

964
00:58:13,172 --> 00:58:14,142
She's like...

965
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:17,262
She was trying to imitate the song.

966
00:58:17,342 --> 00:58:18,744
It was so funny.

967
00:58:20,279 --> 00:58:21,327
Sungjoon.

968
00:58:21,407 --> 00:58:22,348
Yes?

969
00:58:24,408 --> 00:58:26,200
Can I ask you one thing?

970
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:28,772
What is it?

971
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:33,412
Are you meeting with me...

972
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,640
...because I'm your childhood friend?

973
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:42,881
What do you mean all of a sudden?

974
00:58:44,361 --> 00:58:45,289
I want to...

975
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,133
...hear your answer.

976
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:53,113
I want to know how you feel about me.

977
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,612
And why...

978
00:58:56,473 --> 00:58:58,395
...you're meeting with me.

979
00:59:02,311 --> 00:59:05,931
Because I'm sure of my feelings.

980
00:59:11,046 --> 00:59:12,122
Hyejin.

981
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:16,765
I'm warning you one last time.

982
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:18,788
You can't treat me like that, okay?

983
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:20,575
Okay, okay.

984
00:59:20,655 --> 00:59:21,784
I'm sorry.

985
00:59:22,137 --> 00:59:23,693
This is how I feel about you.

986
00:59:36,917 --> 00:59:38,412
As a token of my apology...

987
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:46,465
Can you help me throw away
my shoe that doesn't fit?

988
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:51,980
Sungjoon thinks that someone
other than me is his first love.

989
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:55,684
I think I'm falling for him.

990
00:59:56,268 --> 00:59:57,566
My avatar.

991
00:59:57,646 --> 00:59:59,593
I shouldn't meet him.

992
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,235
What the...

993
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:03,636
What the what?

994
01:00:03,977 --> 01:00:05,541
So, what's the token of your apology?

995
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:07,516
What do you keep looking at?

996
01:00:09,132 --> 01:00:10,548
What's the matter?

997
01:00:38,729 --> 01:00:42,918
I won't act in ways that
might make you concerned.

998
01:00:43,565 --> 01:00:45,349
What is it that you want to tell me?

999
01:00:45,429 --> 01:00:46,817
How much do you know
about your girlfriend?

1000
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:50,146
I'll root for your love.

1001
01:00:50,494 --> 01:00:51,743
I'm sorry, Hyejin.

1002
01:00:51,823 --> 01:00:53,155
Please end this.

1003
01:00:53,514 --> 01:00:54,557
Pretending to be Kim Hyejin.

1004
01:00:54,637 --> 01:00:55,931
Then what are you?

1005
01:00:56,131 --> 01:00:57,818
I like her.

1006
01:00:58,294 --> 01:00:59,750
I like Kim Hyejin.

1007
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:01,750
Who are you?

1008
01:01:02,015 --> 01:01:04,409
Who are you to keep
getting on my nerves?
