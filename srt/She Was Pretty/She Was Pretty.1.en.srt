Excuse me!

5
00:01:44,678 --> 00:01:45,979
More beer please.

6
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:48,768
Right away! Here's another round.

7
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:00,973
There you go!

8
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:15,875
Yes, yes.

9
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:17,897
Me? Right now?

10
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:20,232
I'm still at the Hannam Bridge.

11
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,940
Wow, the night view is spectacular!

12
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:24,357
As if.

13
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,607
You were at the bridge 30 minutes ago.

14
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,857
Girl, how can you not be here
for my birthday?

15
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,440
I'm almost there...

16
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:32,981
-We'll order now.
-I'll see you in a bit.

17
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:35,607
-We're ready to order.
-Coming!

18
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:42,857
Don't you think that girl's pretty?

19
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:46,565
Here's your beer and popcorn.

20
00:02:46,898 --> 00:02:49,107
What's this? Who asked for popcorn?

21
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,690
Where's our food?

22
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:52,148
Oh, my!

23
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:55,565
Our chef's putting extra attention
into your order...

24
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:57,107
...so it must be taking longer than usual.

25
00:02:57,232 --> 00:02:59,232
I'll go and nudge him a bit.

26
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:01,065
Excuse me.

27
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,774
Wasn't that pretty server over there...

28
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:05,357
supposed to serve our table?

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,399
What?

30
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:08,897
-Would you like this?
-Just give me anything.

31
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:10,148
I understand.

32
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:12,981
Oh, right.

33
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,192
I guess I'm the inferior server
when it comes to looks.

34
00:03:17,273 --> 00:03:19,565
I'll tell my friend over there
to bring you the order...

35
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:21,273
...so don't you worry!

36
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:44,607
Are you enjoying the birthday party
I've thrown for you?

37
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:46,774
I guess.

38
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:48,565
Thank you.

39
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,981
Hari.

40
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:52,940
Ta-da.

41
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:53,981
My gift to you.

42
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:57,565
Brand new, directly from Paris...

43
00:03:57,649 --> 00:04:00,524
Here, here! Wife! Wife!

44
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,897
Hyejin!

45
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:03,399
Here, here!

46
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:08,357
Wow, look at that!

47
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:11,232
Hey Hari, you have friends like that?

48
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:13,857
"Like that"?

49
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,065
They say birds of
a feather flock together...

50
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:19,315
...but this is ridiculous.
Look at how she looks.

51
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:23,816
What are you trying to say?

52
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:28,023
-What gives you the right to say that?
-I mean...

53
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,774
Hey, do you even know my friend Hyejin?

54
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,315
Do you?

55
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,732
Hey, Min Hari.
About this necklace I got for you...

56
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:39,897
Why don't you keep your necklace?

57
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:44,273
And I don't want to see you ever again.

58
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:48,065
My wife, come here!

59
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:50,898
I want her.

60

61
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,107

62
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:56,816

Hey, why is it so flashy here?

65
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:03,816
I don't think I'm dressed properly
for the occasion.

66
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:05,148
You can dress however you want.

67
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:07,190

and I'll get my own food.

78
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,482
They say that food brings ghosts
back to life...

Hari!

87
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:59,107
One day, a thought crossed my mind.

88
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:05,690
I wondered if lead characters
only exist in movies and dramas.

89
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:18,399
-Be careful.
-Slow down!

90
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,897
I know how to swim!

91
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:26,315
Like the rejected popcorn at the bar,

92
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:29,440
maybe in reality,

93
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:35,416
lead and supporting
characters also exist.

94
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:40,315
I'll probably end up as a friend,
three degrees from the lead role.

95
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:45,273
No, I may simply be an extra...

96
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:48,628
...that doesn't even deserve
the spotlight.

97
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:52,440
What's that sound? Did she fart?

98
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:54,399
Why is she soaked like that?

99
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,273
Did you sleep well?

100
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,774
You're up early.

101
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:47,107
I'm first!

102
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,148
Why did you leave without
saying anything last night?

103
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:51,565
Oh, last night.

104
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:55,315
They needed my help at the bar,
so they texted me an SOS.

105
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:58,023
I don't know why
I'm so good at what I do!

106
00:08:58,774 --> 00:09:00,357
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

107
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:05,649
It died.

108
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:07,248
I'll need to get it fixed later today.

109
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:09,482
Did you drop it in the toilet?

110
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:12,107
How many times have you done that?

111
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:13,315
So clumsy.

112
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:14,774
Well, that's me.

Let's eat.

114
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:23,898
Are you trying to build a tower?

115
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,357
I have an interview later today.

116
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,981
I'll only be confident on a full stomach.

117
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:30,981
You haven't heard back
from any previous interviews?

118
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,774
I have.

119
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:35,565
My only wish is to work late
for someone somewhere.

120
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:36,981
Why won't they hire me?

121
00:09:37,065 --> 00:09:38,981
I hope every company that
rejected me goes bankrupt!

122
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,190
No, scratch that.

123
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:43,774
My mom told me to be beware of karma.

124
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:46,482
Are you done with your speech yet?

125
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:53,816
Oh, no. I'm late!

126
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:06,391
Which floor are you heading to?

127
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,190
-Second floor.
-Second floor?

128
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:10,065
Second floor?

129
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:12,774
-Either of you...
-Aren't you getting off?

130
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:14,981
Either one of you should get off.

131
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:18,148
I thought I got on first...

132
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:19,857
Maybe not?

133
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:23,148
I'm going to be late!

134
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:33,897
Excuse me.

135
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:35,649
Get on.

136
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:45,148
I did not disregard my studies...

137
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:49,940
...so that I could graduate the Merseyside
Local University with excellent grades.

138
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,774
Therefore, I'm proud to tell you that...

139
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:58,107
...I always try to be a confident person
regardless of my position or state.

Yes.

00:11:07,237 --> 00:11:08,362
Oh.

145
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,357
It's in an area outside of the city.

146
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:17,065
It's not very well-known,
but it's a school with a vision!

147
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:19,587
And the campus is really beautiful.

148

Yes.

But why are all of your past
employments under three months?

151
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,232
One place, the company went belly up.

Who's that guy? Is he your new boyfriend?

169
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,524
No.

170
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:57,232
I'm thinking about whether or not
I should see him.

171
00:12:57,315 --> 00:13:00,607
If you're not going out with him,
why are you kissing him?

172
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:04,357
I'll have to know if he's
a good kisser in order to decide!

173
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:07,732
Come on, we're going to the market.

174
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:09,232
We're out of tissue.

175
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:18,690
I wish I could borrow your body
and face for my interviews.

176
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:21,816
I would nail every one of them.

177
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:25,023
If I could do that, I would've let you
borrow it over a hundred times.

178
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:29,148
Hey, when did you
switch boyfriends again?

179
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:31,565
Do any of those guys around
you make your heart beat faster?

180
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:33,466
Why does it have to?

181
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,088
If he's nice, I'll try and meet him.

182
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,155
You make it sound so easy.

183
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:44,898
Then did you ever find true love
among any of those guys?

184
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,897
True love?

185
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,774
What's that?

186
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:54,023
You miss him when he's not around,
and you're happy when you're with him.

187
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:55,774
You do things you'd normally never do,

188
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:57,857
and you see him wherever you go.

189
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:59,690
Something like that?

190
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:04,065
True love or what not is all just a myth.

191
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:09,732
Hey!

192
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:11,524
Mister, Mister.

193
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,315
What do you think you're doing?

194
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:16,565
I was wondering how much this is.

195
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,568
I'm not going to explain everything,

196
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,774
but just like squeezing out olive oil,

197
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,524
all men are the same, is what I'm saying.

198
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:25,693
There's no need to stress about it.

199
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:27,315
What's the value of true love?

200
00:14:27,857 --> 00:14:30,690
If it exists, how much would it cost?

201
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:32,440
What?

202
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:33,857
That'll be 47 dollars.

203
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,399
Stop being so old-fashioned.

204
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:41,981
You should start dating again.

205
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:43,315
Thank you.

206
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,440
Dating is a waste of money.

207
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:48,273
And no one is interested in me, anyway.

208
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,273
I'm going to work on my resume.

209
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,940
So much spam mail.
I don't want a steamy night.

210
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:03,190
Spam these days look like real e-mails.

211
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:07,023
Wait.

212
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:08,649
"Ji Sungjoon"?

213
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:10,897
Ji Sungjoon would be...

214
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:13,482
Can it be that Ji Sungjoon?

215
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:20,023
"It's been a while, do you remember me?"

216
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,141
"I'll be back in Korea soon.
If you have time, let's meet up."

217
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,690
Is it really him?

218
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:25,898
Why?

219
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:27,440
Who's Ji Sungjoon?

220
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:30,023
Why, don't you remember?

221
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:32,732
When your father relocated
to the office in Japan...

222
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:34,732
...the guy who moved into your old house.

223
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:36,440
Oh, yes.

224
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:38,857
That fat kid?

225
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,898
Stop right there, fat boy!

226
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:45,357
What are you doing in my house?

227
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:47,607
No, I...

228
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:50,524
Dad!

229
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:53,649
Who's that fatty?

230
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:55,649
He's like a bum.

231
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:58,649
Is he the neighborhood idiot?

232
00:15:58,898 --> 00:16:02,190
When I saw him at the house,
I thought he was just a loser.

233
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,107
I was so surprised when I heard...

234
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,898
...that the two of you had become friends.

235
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,898
But why is the fatty contacting you now?

236
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:13,897
He wants to meet.

237
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,065
What?

238
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:33,981
So that naive Sungjoon is coming back?

239
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:49,107
Time to go!

240
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:55,482
Wife!

241
00:16:57,774 --> 00:17:00,897
Oh, you're meeting the fatty today?

242
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:03,273
Did you talk to Fatty on the phone yet?

243
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,649
No, only by e-mail.

244
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,273
He's going to call me when he arrives.

245
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:09,273
Hey, do you think
there's a public phone there?

246
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,023
Public phone?

247
00:17:11,107 --> 00:17:12,816
Oh, your phone's getting fixed?

248
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:14,690
Just take my phone instead.

249
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:16,816
You'll be uncomfortable without a phone.

250
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:20,357
I'm tired of all of these guys
calling me, anyway.

251
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,065
I want to smack you,
but I can't because it's true.

252
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,190
But why are you meeting that fatty?

253
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:29,440
I don't think
it'll benefit you in any way.

254
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,107
We were really close friends.

255
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:34,357
And he was kind of...

256
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,774
...like my first love.

257
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,399
Gosh.

258
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:41,940
I didn't know that
your standards were so low.

259
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,357
So low, that you've buried
them underground!

260
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:46,565
Keep making fun of me.

261
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:51,607
You can say whatever you like,
but he and I share a special relationship.

262
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:54,148
I wonder how he's changed!

263
00:17:54,232 --> 00:17:56,273
Stop it, I'm going to crash.

264
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:06,607
Thank you, thank you!

265
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:08,940
Hey.

266
00:19:13,897 --> 00:19:15,981
-Why?
-Come here.

267
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:21,818
-What are you doing?
-Hold still.

268
00:19:21,898 --> 00:19:23,565
After all, he's your first love.

269
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:27,524
You look much better.

270
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:32,232
This work is Renoir's Dance
in the Country.

271
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,399
In the painting, the main character
is Renoir's friend,

272
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:36,440
Paul and his wife-to-be...

273
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:39,107
Maybe those two are not
the main characters of the painting?

274
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:46,399
I mean, based on the perspective,
the lead can always change.

275
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:50,282
Oh...

276
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,898
...I'm sorry for interrupting your lesson.

277
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:12,275
How do you do?
I'm assigned to cover this exhibit.

278
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:15,898
The Most Korea's handsome
features editor, Kim Shinhyuk.

279
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:19,065
Sungjoon, it's Hyejin.

280
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:20,357
I've arrived.

281
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,940
Call me at this number when you get here.

282
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:38,399
Five minutes left!

283
00:20:54,273 --> 00:20:56,357
Sungjoon. It's you, right?

284
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,273
It's been so long!

285
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:04,357
You... you haven't changed at all!

286
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:05,565
Who are you?

287
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:11,981
You're not Sungjoon...

288
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:13,482
...Sir?

289
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,065
No, I'm not!

290
00:21:16,898 --> 00:21:19,315
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

291
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,190
Ma'am, why are you so strong?

292
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,190
Look, I'm not old enough
to be called a ma'am.

293
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:26,399
Whatever...

294
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,981
What the...

295
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:33,898
Hello?

296
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:35,649
Hyejin, this is Sungjoon.

297
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:37,525
Yes, Sungjoon.

298
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,981
Where are you now?

299
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:40,984
I'm near the fountain.

300
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:42,023
The fountain?

301
00:21:42,774 --> 00:21:44,690
I'm near the fountain, too.

302
00:21:49,753 --> 00:21:50,940
I think I've found you.

303
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:52,107
Really?

304
00:21:52,357 --> 00:21:54,816
I don't see you anywhere.

305
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:56,690
Don't you see me?

306
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Here.

307
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:07,273
No way.

308
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:20,273
Kim Hyejin.

309
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:21,565
Wait.

310
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,816
In the confusion of trying to
make ends meet all the time...

311
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:28,357
...I had forgotten one important fact!

312
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:31,816
The image he has of me in the past...

313
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:35,107
Sit down next to the friend
you want to get to know.

314
00:22:39,732 --> 00:22:40,857
Must be something like this.

315
00:22:41,023 --> 00:22:42,148
First prize goes to...

316
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:44,273
...Kim Hyejin from fifth grade.

317
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:48,649
Kim Hyejin! Kim Hyejin!

318
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:50,690
Or maybe something like this?

319
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:54,774
Fatty, fat boy!

320
00:22:54,897 --> 00:22:58,023
Hey, stop making fun of Sungjoon!

321
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:02,190
That's the very least
he would expect from me!

322
00:23:04,897 --> 00:23:05,981
Are you Hyejin?

323
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,232
No, I'm not.

324
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:09,565
I'm so sorry.

325
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:10,607
Honey.

326
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,065
Hyejin, where are you?

327
00:23:28,065 --> 00:23:30,148
Wasn't that pretty server over there...

328
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:31,860
...supposed to serve our table?

329
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,148
Where is Youngmin University?

330
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:38,232
Applicant Kim Hyejin has been rejected.

331
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:39,940
-Rejected.
-Rejection.

332
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:42,399
You've been rejected.

333
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:45,565
Our home used to have a lot of money...

334
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:49,190
...but my father lost his business
after Sungjoon moved away.

335
00:23:50,148 --> 00:23:53,649
And I used to be pretty like my mom,

336
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:58,399
but after a while...

337
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:03,898
...my dad's traits began to emerge
in late adolescence,

338
00:24:04,357 --> 00:24:08,148
and my looks changed over time.

339
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:17,607
Hey. Kim Hyejin.

340
00:24:19,023 --> 00:24:21,440
Why are you back already?
Didn't you meet Fatty?

341
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:24,023
About that...

342
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:32,774
Let's just go home, Hari.

343
00:24:36,148 --> 00:24:37,981
If he ended up turning into a hot guy...

344
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:39,377
...you should definitely go after him.

345
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:41,023
Why would you run away?

346
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,107
He didn't even imagine
that I'd turn out like this.

347
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,716
I was right in front of him,
and he couldn't recognize me.

348
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:51,065
There's no more trace of the pretty
Kim Hyejin that he used to know.

349
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:55,148
I didn't want him to see me this shabby.

350
00:24:55,649 --> 00:24:57,232
I got scared.

351
00:24:57,399 --> 00:24:58,898
That's why I ran away.

352
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:02,357
I was eager to see him again...

353
00:25:06,774 --> 00:25:08,148
...but I was too naive.

354
00:25:09,565 --> 00:25:12,440
Hey, there's nothing wrong with you!

355
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:14,232
Girl, you're a good catch!

356
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,357
Just meet him.

357
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,816
If he asks me what I do,

358
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,981
do I tell him I'm unemployed at 30?

359
00:25:19,336 --> 00:25:20,795
If he says he couldn't recognize me,

360
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:22,816
do I apologize for looking like this?

361
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:24,107
Hey...

362
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,023
I want to preserve
the memory of my first love.

363
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:30,607
If I don't meet him,

364
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:34,732
he'll keep those great memories of me.

365
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:36,357
Kim Hyejin.

366
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:39,649
You're being ridiculous.

367
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:42,190
And you're talking like an idiot.

368
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:43,857
Go and meet him now!

369
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,148
He's a nice guy,
so he'll seem glad to see me.

370
00:25:46,565 --> 00:25:48,273
But I bet he'll feel
uncomfortable inside.

371
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:50,482
"She's gone."

372
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,273
"The girl that I once loved is gone."

373
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:54,857
That's what he'll think.

374
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:56,732
Hey, come on.

375
00:25:56,897 --> 00:26:01,690
I wish I could borrow
your body and face for today.

376
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,148
Wait, Hari.

377
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:07,107
I've just thought of something...

378
00:26:08,607 --> 00:26:11,148
...and I think you can help me.

379
00:26:26,774 --> 00:26:28,232
Sungjoon.

380
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:37,190
Kim Hyejin?

381
00:26:38,857 --> 00:26:39,940
You must be Hyejin.

382
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,690
Sorry I'm late.

383
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:45,897
It's been a while.

384
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,897
Have you been well?

385
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:53,857
Hyejin.

386
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,065
I've missed you, Kim Hyejin.

387
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,649
Hey, kid!

388
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,898
Did you move here?

389
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:45,148
My best friend Hari used to live here.

390
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,568
I'm in the fifth grade, what about you?

391
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:50,482
Third grade, fourth grade?

392
00:27:56,897 --> 00:27:58,774
Hey, kid!

393
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:03,315
Will everyone welcome our new student?

394
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:05,440
His name is Ji Sungjoon,
and he just transferred here.

395
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:07,981
Hey, kid! You're not a kid?

396
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:09,482
She called him a kid!

397
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:12,981
That's not a kid. It's a fatty!

398
00:28:25,898 --> 00:28:27,607
My mom asked me to give this to you.

399
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,190
And sorry, I thought
you were younger than me.

400
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,357
You should've told me that you weren't.

401
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,816
Are you working on a puzzle?

402
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,857
I saw that painting in a textbook!

403
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,649
There's someone here in the corner.

404
00:28:48,023 --> 00:28:49,232
You found her.

405
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:52,232
That girl is hiding.

406
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:54,565
Hiding?

407
00:28:55,107 --> 00:28:57,148
She really does look like she's hiding.

408
00:28:57,981 --> 00:28:59,357
I wonder what she's looking at?

409
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:02,649
Maybe she wants to
dance on the stage, too?

410
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,897
In my opinion, she's watching the man...

411
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:09,940
...because she secretly likes him.

412
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,190
That could be true, too.

413
00:29:12,774 --> 00:29:15,232
She's hidden,
so it's kind of like a picture puzzle.

414
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:17,940
A picture puzzle?

415
00:29:18,981 --> 00:29:21,981
Look. You couldn't find her unless
you were really searching for her.

416
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:23,440
Like a picture puzzle.

417
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:25,357
You're right.

418
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,482
It really is like a picture puzzle.

419
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:32,190
I didn't want to disappoint
my first love.

420
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:38,315
I refused to end up like a piece
of popcorn in front of my first love.

421
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,524
So eventually, I just...

422
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:50,565
...watched him as I hid
from his surroundings.

423
00:29:54,107 --> 00:29:56,148
Don't make any mistakes
and do as we planned.

424
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:00,440
Here is our menu.

425
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:05,524
Should we go ahead and order?

426
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:06,981
Okay.

427
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:14,690
Would you like to place an order?

428
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:17,690
Miss?

429
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:19,565
Miss.

430
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,273
What?

431
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,607
Would you like to place an order?

432
00:30:26,898 --> 00:30:27,860
Give me this, this one.

433
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,607
The grilled shrimp and caviar
with the filet mignon steak.

434
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,690
Coming right up.

435
00:30:31,774 --> 00:30:32,690
Okay.

436
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:34,482
No!

437
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:38,607
Forget the filet mignon steak
and give me a cup of coffee.

438
00:30:38,857 --> 00:30:41,232
-Coffee.
-Sure.

439
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,065
I don't know what to ask you first.

440
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:49,440
I have so many questions.

441
00:30:52,273 --> 00:30:53,315
What about work?

442
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,857
What kind of work do you do?

443
00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:57,357
When he asks you what you do,
tell him this.

444
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:58,940
I'm still studying.

445
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,482
I think I was meant to study.

446
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:04,607
So you're still in school?

447
00:31:05,023 --> 00:31:05,898
What about you?

448
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:09,732
I'm involved in art directing.

449
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:12,565
I have no idea what that is.

450
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,897
Oh, I see.

451
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,981
Are your parents doing well?

452
00:31:17,357 --> 00:31:18,273
Of course.

453
00:31:18,357 --> 00:31:19,649
My mom and dad are doing...

454
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,273
Well!

455
00:31:24,897 --> 00:31:28,524
They're both doing well.

456
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,232
Are you okay?

457
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,357
Are your parents doing well, too?

458
00:31:44,315 --> 00:31:47,940
My father is in Seattle,
and I was in New York for work.

459
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:52,065
I don't see him often,
but he's doing well as always.

460
00:31:52,774 --> 00:31:53,981
What about your mother?

461
00:31:57,774 --> 00:31:58,774
What?

462
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:05,148
His mother passed away.

463
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,565
Oh, gosh.

464
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:14,816
Your father...

465
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:18,898
I thought he might've remarried.

466
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,399
Oh, okay.

467
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:24,440
Yes, he did remarry.

468
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:26,148
It's been about seven years now.

469
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:29,273
I had a feeling that he did,
which is why I'm asking.

470
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,565
But why did you decide to contact me
all of a sudden?

471
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:40,981
I was cleaning up my place
before I came back to Korea...

472
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:42,897
...and I found a box.

473
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:45,232
I didn't know I still had them,

474
00:32:45,816 --> 00:32:48,482
but I found the letters
that you used to write me.

475
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:52,273
It reminded me of our childhood...

476
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:55,898
...and I wanted to reunite with you.

477
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,482
I see.

478
00:32:58,357 --> 00:33:01,232
Why did you stop contacting me back then?

479
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:04,732
If he asks why I stopped
contacting him, tell him this.

480
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:09,774
After you left the country,
we also left to Japan.

481
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:12,732
But then I lost your address.

482
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:15,940
I was curious about you, too.

483
00:33:16,897 --> 00:33:18,857
It's nice to finally meet you again.

484
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:21,399
And so the mystery is solved.

485
00:33:22,524 --> 00:33:25,440
My letters kept being returned to me,
so I was wondering what happened.

486
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,897
I see.

487
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:30,898
Do you remember the puzzle back then?
It was in the box, too.

488
00:33:31,482 --> 00:33:33,940
Puzzle?

489
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:37,649
Oh, the puzzle...

490
00:33:38,857 --> 00:33:39,940
Oh, that.

491
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:47,482
"The hidden girl"

492
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:49,440
Are you all right?

493
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:53,774
"The hidden girl" Oh, the hidden girl!

494
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:57,315
You remember?

495
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:02,857
I had forgotten that I had it...

496
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:07,440
...but then remembered
that we used to put it together.

497
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:09,898
I felt thankful.

498
00:34:12,107 --> 00:34:16,482
Until I met you, I was always alone.

499
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:20,315
But I realized something
when you became my friend.

500
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,607
That even if you have
just one friend in the world...

501
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,565
...you won't be lonely.

502
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:32,232
That life could be fun.

503
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,357
I was glad you were my friend, Hyejin.

504
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:45,148
I was happy that I had
such a great friend like you.

505
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:52,774
Then I became thankful,
and I started to miss you.

506
00:34:54,482 --> 00:34:55,898
So I started looking for you.

507
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,565
Now that I'm here,

508
00:35:02,774 --> 00:35:04,524
I think I've made the right choice.

509
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,440
I think I've made the right choice too.

510
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:28,816
I'll drop you off where you live.

511
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,981
It's okay. I drove here, too.

512
00:35:32,023 --> 00:35:33,065
Really?

513
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:38,357
Then I guess we'll part ways for today.

514
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:39,690
Sungjoon.

515
00:35:40,774 --> 00:35:42,148
I have something to tell you.

516
00:35:43,065 --> 00:35:48,357
To preserve our precious memories,
and bring this night to a beautiful end,

517
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,273
tell him this.

518
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,273
I'm going overseas for school.

519
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:55,190
What?

520
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:58,107
I regret having to tell you this
on our reunion,

521
00:35:58,482 --> 00:36:00,232
but I've been preparing to go overseas.

522
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,357
Oh, I see.

523
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,607
Where are you going?

524
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:10,981
What?

525
00:36:12,732 --> 00:36:13,899
"Great Britain's Magician of Light"

526
00:36:14,524 --> 00:36:16,424
"Great Britain's Magician of Light"
To the United Kingdom.

527
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:18,148
I'm going to the UK.

528
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,273
When are you leaving?

529
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:23,482
-Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

530
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,897
Yes, tomorrow.

531
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:26,148
Tomorrow?

532
00:36:31,897 --> 00:36:34,357
What am I going to do now?

533
00:36:36,232 --> 00:36:38,357
It feels too early
to part ways like this.

534
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,607
We'll contact each other again.

535
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:43,273
Okay.

536
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:48,148
I go to London a couple of
times a year for work,

537
00:36:48,649 --> 00:36:50,732
so I guess I'll see you then.

538
00:36:51,232 --> 00:36:52,482
Good luck there.

539
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:56,107
And keep in touch.

540
00:36:57,273 --> 00:36:59,482
Okay. I had fun today.

541
00:37:00,649 --> 00:37:03,190
I'll be leaving now.

542
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:08,065
Wait, Hyejin.

543
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:13,524
Yes?

544
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,897
Can you wait here for just five minutes?

545
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:18,232
-Five minutes?
-Yes, exactly five minutes.

546
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:19,981
I'll be back before then.

547
00:37:20,357 --> 00:37:22,482
Wait, where are you going?

548
00:37:32,732 --> 00:37:33,732
Welcome.

549
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:34,816
Yes, hello.

550
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:43,981
Safe!

551
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:46,607
I made it back in time.

552
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,023
Where did you go?

553
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:55,981
I wanted to get you a parting gift.

554
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,148
It'll be useful in London.

555
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:00,190
Use this to avoid the thing you hate.

556
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:02,065
Okay.

557
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,107
Thanks.

558
00:38:09,065 --> 00:38:12,065
Good luck and keep in touch.

559
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:16,524
Yes, it was nice to see you again.

560
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,399
Goodbye.

561
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:33,649
Have a good trip.

562
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:59,023
How can a person change so much?

563
00:39:00,232 --> 00:39:03,399
Only a transformer could
make such a drastic change.

564
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:06,940
He gave you this gift.

565
00:39:07,816 --> 00:39:09,816
He mentioned something
about avoiding something you hate?

566
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:11,273
Something I hate?

567
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,440
It's only an umbrella.

568
00:39:22,065 --> 00:39:23,524
I thought it was something special.

569
00:39:24,273 --> 00:39:25,440
My beer is empty.

570
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:28,190
Stay here, I'll get one for you.

571
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:31,023
What's with her?

572
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:45,148
You're asleep?

573
00:39:46,816 --> 00:39:49,690
Hey, wash your makeup before you sleep.

574
00:39:50,565 --> 00:39:51,607
Hari.

575
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,940
Min Hari!

576
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,524
You must be tired from acting.

577
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,440
I'm sorry I'm such an ugly friend.

578
00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:57,818
"Ji Sungjoon: I miss you, Hyejin!"

579
00:40:57,898 --> 00:40:59,690
"Ji Sungjoon: I got your letter."

580
00:41:03,774 --> 00:41:04,649
"Ji Sungjoon: When should we meet?"

581
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:05,898
"Delete all checked items?"

582
00:41:12,065 --> 00:41:14,897
-What are you talking about?
-That's not that!

583
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:19,524
-I'll hold the best birthday party!
-Count me in!

584
00:41:28,357 --> 00:41:30,232
Hey, it's dangerous. Sit down, kid!

585
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:33,107
The door! Mister, open this door!

586
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,065
Please open this door! Mister, please!

587
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,816
Open this door!

588
00:41:37,897 --> 00:41:40,315
Mister, open this door.

589
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:44,315
Please! Mister, open this door. Please?

590
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,649
Mister, open this door for me!

591
00:41:46,732 --> 00:41:47,898
Open the door...

592
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,232
Mom, Mom...

593
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,440
I'm afraid.

594
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:08,898
Mom.

595
00:42:10,023 --> 00:42:11,232
I'm afraid of the rain.

596
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:14,649
Mom, I'm afraid of the rain!

597
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:20,065
Sungjoon, what's wrong?

598
00:42:20,482 --> 00:42:22,315
-Are you okay?
-Mom, the rain...

599
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:25,107
I'm afraid of the rain.

600
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,482
Let's go.

601
00:42:29,065 --> 00:42:30,148
I'm afraid of the rain.

602
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:35,232
Mom, the rain...

603
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,357
My mom, she...

604
00:42:37,148 --> 00:42:40,232
I'm afraid of the rain!

605
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:06,565
I'm here with you now.

606
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,357
I'll be your umbrella.

607
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,774
You hold onto the hidden girl.

608
00:43:44,315 --> 00:43:47,565
A puzzle isn't complete
without all of the pieces.

609
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,607
We'll meet again someday
and complete the puzzle.

610
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:54,524
Okay.

611
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,857
Bye, Sungjoon.

612
00:44:40,482 --> 00:44:42,148
"Delete all checked items?"

613
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,607
"Delete all checked items?"

614
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:52,857
"All items have been deleted."

615
00:44:55,232 --> 00:44:58,148
Goodbye, my first love.

616
00:45:03,898 --> 00:45:07,649
"She Was Pretty"

617
00:45:10,816 --> 00:45:11,897
What's the matter?

618
00:45:12,981 --> 00:45:14,482
What? Why, why?

619
00:45:14,607 --> 00:45:20,857
Sometimes, reality hits us
without any warning.

620
00:45:21,273 --> 00:45:24,482
Hari, what am I going to do?

621
00:45:24,732 --> 00:45:25,981
Why, what's the matter?

622
00:45:26,065 --> 00:45:30,232
Sometimes, you never get your way...

623
00:45:30,315 --> 00:45:31,940
"Congratulations on being accepted to
Jinsung Magazine's Internship"

624
00:45:32,023 --> 00:45:32,940
Wow!

625
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:38,774
And other times,
things just work themselves out.

626
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:42,273
Cheers!

627
00:45:42,357 --> 00:45:44,816
-Congratulations, Kim Hyejin!
-I love you, Min Hari!

628
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:51,898
Min Hari!

629
00:46:12,774 --> 00:46:14,649
I did it!

630
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:21,148
-Employee, employee, employee!
-Employee, employee, employee!

631
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,732
"Employee"

632
00:46:46,897 --> 00:46:49,315
Kim Hyejin, it's been a long road.

633
00:46:49,649 --> 00:46:52,482
I have a feeling that
good things are in store...

634
00:47:08,898 --> 00:47:10,898
Things may not always go my way...

635
00:47:11,023 --> 00:47:13,023
...but it'll only help me grow stronger.

636
00:47:13,315 --> 00:47:14,649
It's time to forget about the past...

637
00:47:14,816 --> 00:47:18,565
...and start a brand new chapter
in Kim Hyejin's life!

638
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:20,023
Onward!

639
00:47:22,315 --> 00:47:23,774
Onward I go!

640
00:47:31,107 --> 00:47:32,524
What a waste...

641
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:49,898
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

642
00:47:55,482 --> 00:47:57,690
If you're really injured,
I'll help you up.

643
00:47:58,273 --> 00:47:59,565
But if you're embarrassed...

644
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,273
...I advise that you get up
and make a run for it.

645
00:48:11,816 --> 00:48:14,065
Do you want to try and get up?

646
00:48:16,816 --> 00:48:18,399
No.

647
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,482
My front tooth.

648
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:25,232
I think I've lost my front tooth!

649
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,607
My tooth!

650
00:48:27,816 --> 00:48:29,107
My tooth!

651
00:48:29,565 --> 00:48:30,565
This?

652
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,732
This is just chewing gum.

653
00:48:37,107 --> 00:48:38,190
What?

654
00:48:43,897 --> 00:48:45,023
They're all there.

655
00:48:45,315 --> 00:48:46,357
Why don't you get up?

656
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,565
I'm going to be late!

657
00:48:51,816 --> 00:48:53,148
What a weird woman.

658
00:48:58,315 --> 00:49:00,023
Black loafers with white socks?

659
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:02,399
Michael Jackson?

"Management Support Department"

00:49:13,296 --> 00:49:15,379
Now, please introduce yourselves.

662

I'm Lee Seolbi.

That's a beautiful name.

665
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,296
It's a pleasure.

666
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,630
How do you do?
I'm the new intern, Kim Hyejin!

667
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:32,795
I will put my heart and soul
into my work here!

668
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,754
That's quite a voice you have there!

669
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:40,197
This isn't the barracks,
so you can lower your voice.

670
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:41,252
Yes, sir!

671
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:47,460
Congratulations for getting hired.

672
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:49,252
Thank you, thank you.

673
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,043
Our job here at Management Support...

674
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:56,710
...is to make sure that
the company runs smoothly.

675
00:49:56,835 --> 00:49:59,500
As the title infers,
we are a core division...

676
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:02,168
...that both manages
and supports the company.

677
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:03,710
Oh, that's right.

678
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,252
Core division.

679
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:09,918
I hope we can bring you both on board
as full-time employees in three months.

680
00:50:10,002 --> 00:50:11,168
I'll do my very best!

681
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,751
My desk!

682
00:50:15,085 --> 00:50:17,293
Here are your intern badges.

683
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:20,168
Lee Seolbi, your picture came out well.

684
00:50:22,543 --> 00:50:24,252
-Please don't lose this.
-Thank you very much!

685
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,626
"Kim Hyejin"

686
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,584
My work badge!

687
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,168
-Miss Kim Hyejin?
-Yes!

688
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,377
Did you call for me, Chief?

689
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,293
That's why you're here, isn't it?

690
00:50:41,876 --> 00:50:45,419
This is the first job I'm giving you.

691
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,835
A very important job
that we are in charge of.

692
00:50:48,293 --> 00:50:49,960
Do you think you can handle it?

693
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:52,876
You can depend on me on anything!

694
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:55,918
We have a reception every month...

695
00:50:56,002 --> 00:50:58,210
...for all the employees
who have birthdays.

696
00:50:58,293 --> 00:51:01,500
We are in charge of
providing the refreshments.

697
00:51:02,002 --> 00:51:04,419
About 500 metres away is
a place called Woori Market.

698
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,793
They've worked with us for many years.

699
00:51:05,876 --> 00:51:08,543
They give us 10 percent discount,
so go there.

700
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,668
Thank you very much!

701
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,460
Buy the gift cards as gifts
at the post office.

702
00:51:15,584 --> 00:51:18,793
Oh, and can you pay
my utility bill while you're there?

703
00:51:20,168 --> 00:51:23,085
Energy conservation campaigns
are our responsibility, too.

704
00:51:23,543 --> 00:51:25,584
I want you to put up
these posters on every floor.

705
00:51:26,168 --> 00:51:28,918
And I trust that you
won't use the elevators...

706
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,210
...while putting up
these conservation posters.

707
00:51:42,419 --> 00:51:44,002
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

708
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:48,419
I'm back!

709
00:51:50,127 --> 00:51:55,168
I didn't realize my job requires me
to run everywhere.

710
00:51:55,626 --> 00:51:58,293
You're completely out of breath!

711
00:51:58,584 --> 00:51:59,668
Are you all right?

712
00:52:00,293 --> 00:52:01,210
I'm fine!

713
00:52:02,002 --> 00:52:03,293
Then get me a cup of water.

714
00:52:03,543 --> 00:52:04,543
Sir?

715
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:06,835
Yes, sir.

716
00:52:13,335 --> 00:52:14,252
Nice!

717
00:52:16,293 --> 00:52:17,793
Why don't you take that off at home?

718
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:18,876
Why?

719
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,002
I'm going to sleep with this on!

720
00:52:22,168 --> 00:52:23,127
Oh, right.

721
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,626
Now that I'm getting a salary,
I'll pitch in from now on.

722
00:52:33,252 --> 00:52:34,500
Hey, Patriot.

723
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,210
You've given me my independence.

724
00:52:37,626 --> 00:52:40,127
If it wasn't for you,
my dad wouldn't have let me move out.

725
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,293
So you hold onto this.

726
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:45,960
I didn't give you independence.
I don't want to be a freeloader.

727
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:47,584
-Take it.
-Forget it!

728
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:49,335
-Take it.
-I said no!

729
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:51,584
Take it!

730
00:52:58,168 --> 00:53:01,335
Mr Boo, I've completed the excel
spreadsheet and sent it to you.

731
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,210
Already?

732
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:07,252
Miss Hyejin, you're undoubtedly
the best worker here!

733
00:53:07,335 --> 00:53:10,419
That's why I endorsed your hiring!

734
00:53:11,626 --> 00:53:14,876
Mr Boo, you're the one who hired me?

735
00:53:15,085 --> 00:53:16,210
You didn't know?

736
00:53:16,584 --> 00:53:20,377
I made it absolutely clear
that I wanted Kim Hyejin...

737
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,501
...as one of my new interns!

738
00:53:25,252 --> 00:53:28,876
Female workers are always texting men.

739
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:30,793
They take hour long breaks.

740
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:32,419
And they refuse to work late...

741
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,710
...because they want to go and meet men.

742
00:53:34,793 --> 00:53:37,876
Some get married within
one year of being hired!

743
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,293
But what about our Miss Hyejin?

744
00:53:41,668 --> 00:53:43,584
She's perfect!

745
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:45,960
She doesn't receive any calls from men.

746
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:48,751
And she's got no dates
to look forward to.

747
00:53:48,876 --> 00:53:49,751
I guess.

748
00:53:49,835 --> 00:53:51,419
A lacking resume?

749
00:53:51,668 --> 00:53:53,460
That can be an advantage sometimes!

750
00:53:53,793 --> 00:53:55,960
She'll never think about
going to another company!

751
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,668
I'm a great judge of character!

752
00:54:01,751 --> 00:54:02,668
You're right!

753
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,085
Chief, you're the best!

754
00:54:09,002 --> 00:54:10,543
Should I do something else?

755
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:11,918
Do what?

756
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:13,876
It's 6:00, so get ready to go home.

757
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,293
Take that box to
The Most Editing Department.

758
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:21,252
They always request things from us...

759
00:54:21,335 --> 00:54:23,960
...and never come to get it.

760
00:54:24,168 --> 00:54:25,543
The Most Editing Department?

761
00:54:39,793 --> 00:54:42,002
I didn't know we had this department!

762
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:48,835
Yes?

763
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,460
I'm here from the Management
Support Department.

764
00:54:58,751 --> 00:55:00,293
Jackpot!

765
00:55:00,668 --> 00:55:02,835
-Come here!
-Okay!

766
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:06,501
-Check this out and confirm. Hurry!
-Yes, ma'am.

767
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,460
Please approve this layout.

768
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:35,210
Wow, so this team creates the magazine?

769
00:55:43,793 --> 00:55:44,835
Excuse me...

770
00:55:45,043 --> 00:55:46,960
...I'm from the
Management Support Department.

771
00:55:47,085 --> 00:55:48,377
The items that were requested...

772
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,960
Just leave it anywhere there.

773
00:55:50,668 --> 00:55:51,793
In three minutes?

774
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,501
-Yes.
-I'll put it here then.

775
00:55:53,835 --> 00:55:54,751
It's you.

776
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,793
Go down and give this to a courier,

777
00:55:59,454 --> 00:56:00,709
and come back for
the document translations.

778
00:56:00,793 --> 00:56:01,710
Ma'am?

779
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:04,918
It's door number 4444,
so don't ring all of the doors.

780
00:56:05,377 --> 00:56:06,835
And if you're going to work for me...

781
00:56:07,793 --> 00:56:10,168
...you have to do something
about that hair.

782
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,060
This will pay for the courier.
I'm headed to the Art Department.

783
00:56:13,584 --> 00:56:16,584
Wait, why should I?

784
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,210
Why am I doing this?

785
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,460
I've brought the documents with me.

786
00:56:25,377 --> 00:56:28,002
Are you from The Most Editing Department?

787
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,377
-Yes, I am...
-Here you go.

788
00:56:30,918 --> 00:56:32,043
Thank you!

789
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:39,293
What was she saying?

790
00:56:40,584 --> 00:56:43,876
Wait, where have I seen her before?

791
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,210
You're here?

792
00:56:49,127 --> 00:56:50,168
Here.

793
00:56:51,252 --> 00:56:53,419
There are some typos.

794
00:56:53,835 --> 00:56:56,710
This was overlapped with
our 20-year anniversary issue...

795
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:59,335
...so they're only focusing on that.

796
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:03,377
And look out for grammatical errors.

797
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,960
I really need that done.

798
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,085
What?

799
00:57:06,252 --> 00:57:07,668
What kind of editing?

800
00:57:08,127 --> 00:57:09,500
Well, excuse me.

801
00:57:09,668 --> 00:57:11,419
Why are you giving me this?

802
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:19,377
Joonwoo, who is she?

803
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:21,876
That person?

804
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,210
She's our new proof-reading freelancer.

805
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,043
There are only a few typos,
so it won't take you very long.

806
00:57:33,377 --> 00:57:34,252
What?

807
00:57:34,335 --> 00:57:36,793
But I could swear
we've met somewhere before.

808
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,168
Have we met before?

809
00:57:38,419 --> 00:57:40,419
-No we haven't.
-Did we meet at a club?

810
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:45,002
I was wondering why I have to do this...

811
00:57:45,085 --> 00:57:46,127
Did you complete the translations?

812
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,668
What? Oh, right.

813
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:49,460
Right here.

814
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,127
Thanks again.

815
00:57:52,419 --> 00:57:53,377
Yes.

816
00:57:55,377 --> 00:57:57,543
I'm curious. Why is everyone...

817
00:57:57,626 --> 00:58:00,335
Go to the cafe on the first floor
and take coffee to the studio.

818
00:58:00,918 --> 00:58:02,710
The first floor of
the building across from here.

819
00:58:03,668 --> 00:58:04,626
Wait.

820
00:58:27,377 --> 00:58:29,210
What's this place about?

821
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,793
Now, we'll take 10!

822
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:38,168
Coffee.

823
00:58:38,918 --> 00:58:40,210
Where is my coffee?

824
00:58:40,835 --> 00:58:42,626
The coffee is here!

825
00:58:46,252 --> 00:58:47,668
I'm so sorry.

826
00:58:48,793 --> 00:58:50,751
My apologies. I'm late, aren't I?

827
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,835
I was involved in
a car accident on the way here.

828
00:58:52,916 --> 00:58:54,043
Who are you?

829
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,460
What?

830
00:58:56,421 --> 00:58:59,043
I'm the new editing freelancer.

831
00:58:59,332 --> 00:59:00,252
What?

832
00:59:02,002 --> 00:59:03,460
Then who was that frizzy hair?

833
00:59:03,835 --> 00:59:06,793
She completed
the translations without any errors.

834
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,127
I had her proof-read my documents, too.

835
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,793
And she did a great job.

836
00:59:10,876 --> 00:59:12,419
Who on earth is she then?

837
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:19,085
Oh, no!

838
00:59:19,168 --> 00:59:20,960
Stop! Mister!

839
00:59:21,835 --> 00:59:24,293
"Management Support Department"
What? The Most Editing Department?

840
00:59:24,807 --> 00:59:27,918
Why am I being reassigned there?

841
00:59:28,002 --> 00:59:30,587
They've requested your transfer.

842
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:34,043
Ask them for the details,
and return here after three months.

843
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:36,377
What? For three months?

844
00:59:37,751 --> 00:59:39,876
But I'm prepared to do my best
here at Management Support.

845
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,751
You can do that when you get back.

846
00:59:41,835 --> 00:59:43,377
Just go.

847
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,210
The Most Editing Department
is the most influential department.

848
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:47,793
We do whatever they demand.

849
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:49,335
If you do a great job over there...

850
00:59:49,584 --> 00:59:51,710
...it'll help you
land a full-time position here.

851
00:59:52,252 --> 00:59:53,293
But...

852
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:07,127
Excuse me.

853
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:09,377
So you've arrived?

854
01:00:11,377 --> 01:00:12,960
Have a seat over there.

855
01:00:13,085 --> 01:00:14,501
-Over there?
-Yes.

856
01:00:15,043 --> 01:00:16,210
I look forward to working with you.

857
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,377
Yes.

858
01:00:22,043 --> 01:00:23,085
She's here.

859
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,127
I know I've seen her somewhere before.

860
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:26,626
What?

861
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:35,252
I know I've seen her someplace before.

862
01:00:37,419 --> 01:00:38,460
Yes, Hari.

863
01:00:38,584 --> 01:00:40,002
What was your text about?

864
01:00:40,584 --> 01:00:42,043
Why were you transferred?

865
01:00:42,127 --> 01:00:43,210
I don't know.

866
01:00:43,626 --> 01:00:45,377
I don't know what's going on.

867
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,835
Buongiorno!

868
01:00:46,918 --> 01:00:48,793
-Have you arrived?
-How are you today?

869
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,168
Ciao!

870
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:55,210
The weather is wonderful outside!

871
01:00:55,293 --> 01:00:56,168
Goodness!

872
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,210
Hey, an amazing lady just walked in.

873
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:06,710
Sometimes, reality hits us
without any warning.

874
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,793
That's the guy from the elevator!

875
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,710
I hate that guy!

876
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:15,210
Is he here yet?
I thought he's coming today.

877
01:01:15,835 --> 01:01:19,460
That's why you must
always be on your toes.

878
01:01:20,085 --> 01:01:21,419
Oh, there he is now.

879
01:01:21,793 --> 01:01:25,127
Something you couldn't prepare for.

880
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:29,460
Attention!

881
01:01:29,793 --> 01:01:31,002
Allow me to introduce to you.

882
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:36,668
He's the deputy chief editor
transferred from our New York branch.

883
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,501
Hello, Kim Hyejin?

884
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:41,127
Hey!

885
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:43,500
Oh, right!

886
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:45,377
Michael Jackson!

887
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,434
It's a pleasure to meet you.

888
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:49,960
I'm your deputy chief editor,
Ji Sungjoon.

889
01:01:50,147 --> 01:01:52,377
None of us saw this coming.

890
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,751
-This was the beginning...
-This was the beginning...

891
01:01:54,835 --> 01:01:57,127
...of our very own picture puzzle.

892
01:02:13,002 --> 01:02:14,293
"She Was Pretty"

893
01:02:14,419 --> 01:02:15,584
Allow me to introduce you.

894
01:02:15,793 --> 01:02:16,793
I'm Ji Sungjoon.

895
01:02:17,335 --> 01:02:18,210
Nice to meet you.

896
01:02:18,293 --> 01:02:21,293
Then you'll have to
face Ji Sungjoon every day?

897
01:02:21,501 --> 01:02:23,460
Hey, what if he recognizes me?

898
01:02:23,793 --> 01:02:25,835
This will be our first meeting.

899
01:02:25,918 --> 01:02:28,500
Out, out, out...

900
01:02:28,751 --> 01:02:29,793
Do you have a screw loose?

901
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:32,501
There's no reason for us
to take this abuse!

902
01:02:32,835 --> 01:02:34,876
I thought it was your wish to work late?

903
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:37,626
So why are you resigning
over something like that?

904
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:39,168
I'm sorry.

905
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:42,043
Did you think you could fool me forever?

906
01:02:47,252 --> 01:02:48,168
"She Was Pretty"

907
01:02:50,252 --> 01:02:54,419
"She Was Pretty"
