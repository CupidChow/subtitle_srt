1
00:00:02,111 --> 00:00:03,991
Yes, this is Ji Sungjoon.

2
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:05,451
You've sent me an email?

3
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:07,943
I'll check it right away
and call you back.

4
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:14,570
What, you're not coming out to see me?

5
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:17,361
Do I even have a sister anymore?

6
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:18,695
All right then.

7
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:21,528
I'll go to Hari's hotel
and ask her to buy me lunch.

8
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:23,736
Hey, don't go and see Hari either!

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,236
You never listen to me!

10
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:26,903
Kim Hyerin, are you serious?

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,069
All right, I'm going.
I'll see you there.

12
00:00:30,403 --> 00:00:31,862
That belongs to me.

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,443
Mister, that notebook
you're holding onto...

14
00:00:34,528 --> 00:00:35,862
It belongs to me.

15
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:40,862
Gosh, I can't stand her!

16
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:45,653
Nice to meet you.

17
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:53,027
Excuse me.

18
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:56,653
What's wrong with this lady?

19
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,986
Why are the two of them together?

20
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:12,486
But how do you know my sister?

21
00:01:12,695 --> 00:01:13,986
Who are you?

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,862
Me?

23
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:18,194
I'm a friend of your sister.

24
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,820
What kind of friend?

25
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:23,736
Ma'am!

26
00:01:23,903 --> 00:01:26,319
Excuse me, you can't take that.

27
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,444
I'm not taking it.

28
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:29,736
Just for a moment...

29
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:31,944
Ma'am!

30
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:35,736
See. I'm not taking it.

31
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:36,986
Thanks for letting me use it.

32
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,486
What's wrong with that woman?

33
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:50,110
Why that little!
If she spills the beans, I'm done for!

34
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,862
How can I put this?

35
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:54,944
Wait.

36
00:01:57,528 --> 00:01:58,736
Yes, this is Ji Sungjoon.

37
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,117
Yes, Mr Ji.

38
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:02,276
This is the intern from
Management Support.

39
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:03,943
You know, the one
who's always singled out.

40
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,944
Let me tell you why I called you.

41
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:10,486
Miss Ra-Ra was looking for you!

42
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,403
Yes, she wants to see you right away.

43
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:13,653
All right.

44
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:17,111
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:19,862
I wanted to talk some more,
but I have to go.

46
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:33,547
Hey, Kim Hyerin.

47
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:35,256
What's with you?
Why are you coming now?

48
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:37,172
I just met someone who
claimed to be your friend.

49
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:38,882
What did you say to that man?

50
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:40,548
Did you tell him that
you're here to see me?

51
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:42,256
Did you mention that your sister
works for the magazine...

52
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,840
...and that her name is Kim Hyejin?

53
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:45,048
If I say I did?

54
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,798
He knows who I am.

55
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:48,256
It's all over now.

56
00:02:48,757 --> 00:02:49,882
I didn't.

57
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:51,297
You didn't?

58
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,339
Are you so old that
you're hard of hearing?

59
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,632
I didn't say anything.

60
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:56,173
I'm so relieved!

61
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:59,006
Hyejin, by any chance, did you...

62
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,673
-...borrow money from that man?
-I didn't borrow money from anyone!

63
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:04,631
And didn't you learn
not to talk to any strangers?

64
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:05,631
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:07,924
It was completely obvious
that he knew you!

66
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,423
Stop talking about him.

67
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:11,756
Get yourself a hamburger and go home.

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,882
Don't stray anywhere
and head straight home, okay?

69
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,465
Hyejin! Hey!

70
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:17,714
What's this?

71
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,465
What am I going to do with five dollars?

72
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:25,327
Oh my, mamma Mia!

73
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:27,925
You startled me.

74
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:30,803
Look at my hands shaking...

75
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:33,302
Can you hold my hands for a moment?

76
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:35,011
They're trembling.

77
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:37,845
I heard that you called for me.

78
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,052
Oh, I called for you?

79
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:43,845
That's odd. I don't think I did.

80
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:45,552
That you want to see me right away.

81
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:47,178
I said that?

82
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,741
But, I don't think I did.

83
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:57,845
There's been a misunderstanding...

84
00:03:58,386 --> 00:03:59,845
I must've been mistaken.

85
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:01,257
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:03,219
You.

87
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,428
Me?

88
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:06,595
You still have that!

89
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:09,178
Please.

90
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,919
Please be more Most-esque, okay?

91
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,342
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,470
Can't you create articles
that are more concise?

93
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:33,905
We're not requiring a 100 page
minimum class journal.

94
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:36,301
I thought you all were
professionals that realized...

95
00:04:36,386 --> 00:04:38,386
....the magazine business
is won within 0.03 seconds,

96
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:40,471
but now I see that
I'm dealing with amateurs.

97
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:45,427
If you can't hook them
with one line or a picture...

98
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:47,386
...you cannot sell magazines.

99
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,968
We'll review project proposals
like we run our meetings.

100
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:53,636
I will only accept proposals that
can be summed up in three minutes.

101
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:56,052
And as for the 20th
anniversary special issue...

102
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:59,219
...we're going back to the drawing board.

103
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:00,552
What?

104
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:01,803
Back to square one?

105
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,011
Wait, why?

106
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:05,509
We had some good ideas.

107
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:09,303
What are your standards for a good idea?

108
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:11,052
Well...

109
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:13,553
-If it's relatively amusing...
-There's only...

110
00:05:14,344 --> 00:05:15,845
...one standard for a magazine.

111
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,470
It sells.

112
00:05:19,344 --> 00:05:22,011
Are you absolutely certain
that this anniversary issue will sell?

113
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:23,845
More than Europe?

114
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,928
Isn't it too early to say
if it will sell or not?

115
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:35,219
And if you keep pressuring us like this...

116
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:37,010
...how will we be comfortable
enough to share our ideas?

117
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:38,052
Am I right?

118
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:40,677
Why don't we do this more easily?

119
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:41,887
More freely.

120
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:43,884
Isn't that good, being free?

121
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,594
Then why do you bother to show up
at the company?

122
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,927
Why not stay home?

123
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,136
And be free.

124
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:52,011
You don't have to be so hurtful...

125
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:58,386
We'll think of some new concepts
and resume our meeting.

126
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:01,819
Oh, Miss Cha Jooyoung.

127
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,929
Did you get in touch with James Taylor?

128
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:07,845
I'm still trying, but they
have an extremely tight schedule.

129
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,009
And I'm wondering
if it's the right time...

130
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:11,928
...to ask them
for a collaboration project.

131
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:15,260
I think I gave you too much credit,
Miss Cha Jooyoung.

132
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:16,427
Sir?

133
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:20,928
Our anniversary issue will feature
collaboration with James Taylor.

134
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:25,094
I'll get in touch with them myself,
so don't worry about it anymore.

135
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:32,595
Nobody talk to me for the rest of the day.

136
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,219
-Don't talk to me either.
-Me neither.

137
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:45,803
What happened in America
that changed him so drastically?

138
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:17,428
Wow!

139
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:22,969
Gosh, look at that!

140
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:34,553
-Jackson, what are you doing?
-What the...

141
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:37,260
You've ruined my picture.

142
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:38,885
What were you watching?

143
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:40,094
Did you see Ironman fly by?

144
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:41,720
Ironman?

145
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:42,969
No, it's nothing.

146
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:44,595
Because the sky is pretty.

147
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,136
-The sky?
-Yes.

148
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,982
Wow.

149
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,609
It's so pretty!

150
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:07,636
Isn't that Jackson?

151
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:16,969
Oh my, it's like she's twirling a sangmo.

152
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:20,428
She's going to topple over!

153
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:30,744
Ma'am, please sit here.

154
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:31,703
Oh...

155
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,828
Mr Driver, please wait
until grandma here is seated.

156
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,734
Okay, we're ready to go!

157
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,394
You're right.

158
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:44,723
It's pretty.

159
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,806
Did anything come
into the lost and found?

160
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:55,348
It should be something
that looks like an MP3 player.

161
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:56,560
Yes, it has.

162
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:58,909
The concierge received
a call asking for it.

163
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:00,816
It must belong
to the guest in 2024.

164
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:03,306
2024 would be the suite?

165
00:09:03,848 --> 00:09:05,473
-Yes.
-I'll be back with it.

166

167
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,696
♪ Happy birthday to you

168
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,492

169
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:19,897
♪ Happy birthday to you

170
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,775
Happy wedding anniversary.

171
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,768
I'm going to marry dad later.

172
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:29,863
Don't you dare. He's my man.

173
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,950
No, he's my man.

174
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:33,269
Oh, dear.

175
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,579
Wow, thank you!

176
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:53,789
"Dad"

177
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:58,349
This woman was insulting my mom.

178
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:20,158
Did your hand heal?

179
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:23,599
I just thought the sky was pretty today.

180
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:31,575
You're right.

181
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,741
It's disgustingly beautiful.

182
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:49,782
I'm leaving.

183
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
Hari.

184
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:53,614
Oh, right.

185
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:56,413
Did you see the sky earlier today?

186
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:57,954
It was really pretty.

187
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:00,152
Hey, Min Hari.

188
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:01,829
What's with you?
Why are you so bubbly?

189
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,912
Why are you acting like a little girl?

190
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:07,787
I know.

191
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:09,298
What's wrong with me?

192
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:10,938
Forget I mentioned anything.

193
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:13,663
-I'm leaving.
-You're just leaving?

194
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:16,162
Just like that?

195
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,996
-My wife!
-You're home.

196
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:25,454
-Glad to see you.
-Were you waiting for me?

197
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,037
I came outside to throw away the trash.

198
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:33,462
You're barely dressed today.

199
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,071
Hey, people are going to talk about you.

200
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:39,463
It's my body and my life,
so who cares how I live?

201
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:40,827
Why should I care what other people say?

202
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:43,288
-Like a bum.
-Is that so?

203
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,870
You go on inside.
I need to get more trash bags.

204
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:49,244
Come here. Stay with me.

205
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:51,829
What's wrong with you? Did you drink?

206
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:53,787
No, I didn't!

207
00:11:56,746 --> 00:11:58,621
-What?
-We'll need to control Hyerin...

208
00:11:58,706 --> 00:12:00,321
...before she spills the beans
on the entire thing.

209
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:01,746
He can never find out!

210
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:02,906
He must never find out!

211
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:04,829
I know.

212
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:06,496
But why are you overreacting?

213
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:08,454
What?

214
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,916
If we get caught, it'll be bad for you.

215
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:18,210
I was about to give up
on the whole thing.

216
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:19,668
But as I faced the possibility
of getting caught...

217
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:23,087
I started thinking about
the humiliation I'd go through.

218
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,372
And can you imagine how he'd feel?

219
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:30,207
When he discovers that the intern
he walks all over at work...

220
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,697
...is in fact his first love...

221
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:34,072
I can't even imagine it.

222
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,749
Hyejin.

223
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,314
What do you think would've happened...

224
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:44,124
...if you met with him in the first place?

225
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,208
Who knows?

226
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,166
And it would've been really awkward
meeting again in the company.

227
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,916
I don't know.
I don't even want to think about it.

228
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,916
But why do you ask?

229
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:02,708
No reason.

230
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:05,958
I'm just wondering.

231
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,790
But about Ji Sungjoon...

232
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:12,333
Okay, that's enough.

233
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:16,708
Let's stop talking about him now.

234
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:19,828
-What?
-Why should we be talking about him?

235
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,138
He ignores me,

236
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:24,681
so I think I should
stop thinking about him too.

237
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,070
So let's stop talking about him.

238
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:30,124
Let's go. I need to study some more
of that alien language.

239
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,375
Why don't we go and get some tteokbokki?

240
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,707
Why does it seem everyone
wants to eat that these days?

241
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,500
Why? Who else?

242
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,291
Nobody. It's some weirdo.

243
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,665
Why, is he really disgusting?

244
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:50,041
He's like the king of lunatics.

245
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,749
Gosh!

246
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:57,939
But, you...

247
00:13:58,647 --> 00:14:02,124
Why haven't you done
something about that yet?

248
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:03,790
Please.

249
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:06,748
Try and be more Most-esque, okay?

250
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:13,904
How do I become more Most-esque?

251
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:33,999
What the?

252
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:35,796
Who are you looking for?

253
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,124
How are you today?

254
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:41,367
"Kim Hyejin"

255
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:45,561
Are you trying to be funny?

256
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:50,583
The chief editor asked me
to be more Most-esque.

257
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,416
Wait.

258
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,416
What is "Ah" supposed to mean?

259
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,124
What? Am I trying to be funny?

260
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,333
Why, that...

261
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,664
He's whatever!
He wasn't raised correctly!

262
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,250
Not even close!

263
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,046
Listen up everyone!

264
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:16,499
You startled me!

265
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,749
You're going to get it
if it's not good news.

266
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:21,166
Mr Ji scheduled
a meeting with James Taylor!

267
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:22,707
Really?

268
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,498
They're on a tour across Asia,
heading to Beijing from Tokyo,

269
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:29,416
but somehow he
convinced them to stop by Korea!

270
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:33,291
I thought their schedule was packed?

271
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:34,791
Mr Ji is pretty amazing.

272
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,541
They're scheduled
for an hour long meeting.

273
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,041
It'll happen as they
transfer flights at the airport.

274
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,944
-One hour might not be enough.
-The airport?

275
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:40,987
Just one hour?

276
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:43,531
He plans to get a collaboration
agreement within an hour?

277
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:45,176
That's impossible.

278
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,374
I'll determine whether
or not it's impossible,

279
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,416
so keep your opinions to yourself.

280
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,291
Miss Cha Jooyoung, give me
the files relating to James Taylor.

281
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,166
Feature and fashion teams,
find more resources for me.

282
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,916
I need them all, as soon as possible.

283
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,458
-Yes, sir.
-And...

284
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:01,027
I'll need someone to drive me later.

285
00:16:01,112 --> 00:16:02,819
I need to review some
documents on the way.

286
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,523
Meet me at the first floor
at 2 PM sharp.

287
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,707
I've secured the meeting.

288
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,874
At 4 PM.

289
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:16,331
Well, I guess he pulls
his weight around here.

290
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,999
But who's going to drive Mr Ji later?

291
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,943
-You will.
-I have other plans.

292
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,333
Jackson.

293
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:25,519
You have a hole in your side.

294
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,376
Really?

295
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,583
Then Hyejin will go,
since you really want to.

296
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,208
Yes, Hyejin can go!

297
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,041
Well, I think someone else should.

298
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,708
I'm sorry. There wasn't a hole.

299
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,667
My eyesight has been getting worse...

300
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:42,999
Mr Kim!

301
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:46,372
How can you play
this kind of joke on me!

302
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,915
How long are you
going to avoid him?

303
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:51,416
It's a good opportunity
to get to know him!

304
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:53,438
You're more ambitious than you look.

305
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,268
No, wait.

306
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,166
Everyone, give her a hand!

307
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:11,556
We're off.

308
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,916
What's this? Look here, Support.

309
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:24,375
What are you doing here?

310
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,708
Well, everyone else was busy,
so I was the only one able to drive you.

311
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,375
Do you even know how to drive?

312
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:34,458
I've never seen you do anything right.

313
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,749
I aced both the writing
and driving exams!

314
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:46,846
What's this? So awkward!

315
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,832
Oh, you must enjoy tennis!

316
00:17:59,686 --> 00:18:01,249
I've never heard of him before,

317
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,123
but this James Taylor must
be a really talented artist.

318
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,249
I've seen several dresses
with his design...

319
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,664
I'd like to read this in peace.
Can you cooperate with me?

320
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:11,708
Yes?

321
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:14,285
Yes, sir.

322
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,809
But we're heading to
Incheon Airport, aren't we?

323
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,045
Right, Incheon Airport?

324
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:46,683
"Incheon Airport"

325
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:53,683
Where are you going right now?

326
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,061
-What? The airport...
-Why are you going to Incheon?

327
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:58,479
We're supposed to be in Gimpo Airport!

328
00:18:58,563 --> 00:19:00,230
What? It was Gimpo?

329
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:02,937
I asked you earlier,
and since you didn't respond,

330
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:04,730
so I thought it was Incheon!

331
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,633
What do I do?

332
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,281
I'll turn around right away.

333
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:10,021
You can't turn around!

334
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:12,770
This highway leads straight to Incheon!

335
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:14,272
What?

336
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:15,938
What am I going to do then?

337
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,896
There's an exit off the next toll gate.

338
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:23,188
We still have time, so hurry!

339
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:24,272
Yes, sir!

340
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,230
Why is there a traffic jam?

341
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:35,315
Is there an accident up there?

342
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:43,563
Miss Cha Jooyoung, it's me.

343
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:44,521
Head on over to Gimpo Airport...

344
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:45,812
This is Joo Ahreum.

345
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:48,770
She left for an event without her phone.

346
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:56,058
Who is in the office right now?

347
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,086
Find someone and send them
to Gimpo Airport right away...

348
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:04,887
What's she doing?

349
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,832
Is she trying to get a snack right now?

350
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,958
Mr Ji!

351
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,041
Mr Ji, get out.

352
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,166
What?

353
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:15,206
Hurry up.

354
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,416
Are you joking right now?

355
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,040
-Hurry, hurry!
-What are you...

356
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:21,166
-Hurry, hurry!
-What the...

357
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:22,625
What are you doing?

358
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:24,664
Hurry up!

359
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:26,500
What are you doing?

360
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,375
What is this?

361
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,457
-Give him some money.
-Give him what?

362
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,039
Money. Hurry up!

363
00:20:33,124 --> 00:20:34,748
What are you talking about right now?

364
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,043
Get your hands off me!

365
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,874
Mister, here.

366
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,832
One, two, three, four.

367
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:43,957
-Good?
-You're headed to Gimpo Airport?

368
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,500
Yes. He has to arrive before 4:00.

369
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:48,457
Hurry up and get on.

370
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:50,123
You can get there in time on a motorcycle.

371
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,998
-You expect me to ride that?
-Goodness, you talk too much!

372
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,956
Mister, get going!

373
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,166
We're off!

374
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,624
Mister, get going!

375
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,748
We're off!

376
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,749
I'll drive the car to the airport!

377
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,832
Make sure you get there by 4 PM!

378
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:06,472
Ride like the wind, Mister!

379
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:27,208
I'm in. That sounds fun.

380
00:21:27,748 --> 00:21:28,832
What time should we meet?

381
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,916
I'll call you back.

382
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:57,040
What happened?

383
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:58,374
Did you get here in time?

384
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,208
Was the deal a success?

385
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,958
Yes, I'm on my way out now.

386
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,041
And about the collaboration project...

387
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,625
He agreed to it.

388
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:11,001
Yes, I'll see you in the office.

389
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,041
I thought you didn't make it
and missed the meeting!

390
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:17,041
This is great, isn't it?

391
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,041
Oh, the bread.

392
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,708
It smells, doesn't it?

393
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:38,708
I'll clean out the car
and put in an air freshener.

394
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:44,164
What do you think you're doing?

395
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:45,624
What?

396
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:46,554
Are you an idiot?

397
00:22:47,414 --> 00:22:48,618
Or are you mentally ill?

398
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,708
Can you do anything right?

399
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,208
If this project went wrong,
were you going to take responsibility?

400
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,749
How can you make
such a ridiculous mistake?

401
00:23:03,124 --> 00:23:08,082
I asked you where we were going, but...

402
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,083
Do you know what kind of person
I find most pathetic?

403
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,874
The person just working hard
not working well.

404
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,271
Like you.

405
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,832
I'll find my own way back, so you go on.

406
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:55,779
For your information, do you know
what kind of person I hate the most?

407
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,873
People who never listen...

408
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,790
...and those who think
they're better than anyone.

409
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,124
Like you, Mr Ji!

410
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:06,082
I've asked you several times
if we're heading to Incheon.

411
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,832
But you're the one who ignored me
and chose not to listen!

412
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,664
So if you didn't have a habit
of looking down on everyone...

413
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,416
...this never would've
happened in the first place!

414
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,375
I just...

415
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,583
I just wanted you to know that!

416
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,041
Why did I have to reunite with him?

417
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:55,124
Why did that crazy reporter
trick me into this?

418
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,664
Ma'am. How much for the bread?

419
00:24:57,748 --> 00:24:59,166
These aren't for sale.

420
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,582
Mister, just give me a dollar.

421
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,625
A dollar?

422
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,999
How's the hotel work?

423
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,748
I'm fine with it.

424
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,684
But I'm sure that others
have a problem with it.

425
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,291
I don't know anything,

426
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:20,583
but I'm the concierge manager
only because of my father.

427
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,500
You don't have to put it like that.

428
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,458
That day, I...

429
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:32,291
Let me apologize.

430
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,166
Yes.

431
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,748
I thought you should be sorry.

432
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:39,999
Hari.

433
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:51,832
Yes, I forgot to tell you
that I have dinner plans.

434
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,333
Go on without me.

435
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:54,625
Okay.

436
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,041
That sounded like home,

437
00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:02,541
so why didn't you tell her
that you're with me?

438
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,458
After what happened,

439
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,832
I don't want her to get the wrong idea.

440
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:15,041
The three of us are a family,
but she'll feel left out.

441
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:18,500
I don't want her to get the wrong idea.

442
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:21,500
She wouldn't get the wrong idea just
because we're having dinner together.

443
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,583
At least not a real family.

444
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,707
Hari, if you can call her
and apologize...

445
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:30,583
I should go back to kindergarten.

446
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:34,166
I was taught the person who does
something wrong makes the apologies.

447
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:38,250
I must've been given the wrong lesson.

448
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:42,479
Take pity on that woman.

449
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:44,250
She has many scars.

450
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:48,029
So if you'd open up to her first...

451
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,371
I think I should get going.

452
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:53,208
Dad, you should go home
and have dinner with your family.

453
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,664
Harmoniously.

454
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:57,791
Hari.

455
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:00,989
Hari.

456
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:02,822
Hari.

457
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:09,031
Miss! That bread was good.

458
00:27:09,197 --> 00:27:10,989
-Thanks again!
-Don't mention it.

459
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:12,489
See you later!

460
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:21,324
Hari, where are you?

461
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:22,825
I'm feeling down in the dumps.

462
00:27:23,197 --> 00:27:25,239
Should we get drunk somewhere?

463
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:38,184
I've had a bad day,
and now it's raining.

464
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:40,809
Thank you very much!

465
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:12,808
Welcome.

466
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:13,892
Hello.

467
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:31,742
I wanted to get you a parting gift.

468
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:34,142
It'll be useful in London.

469
00:28:35,156 --> 00:28:36,976
Use this to avoid the thing you hate.

470
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,226
Look here, Support! That umbrella!

471
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,351
He mentioned something about
avoiding something you hate.

472
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:24,601
Ma'am, can I get a bottle of soju
and some clam soup?

473
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:25,601
Yes.

474
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,309
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

475
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:29,518
Oh, Hyejin?

476
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:30,726
Sungjoon?

477
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:32,726
Do you work out here?

478
00:30:32,976 --> 00:30:34,934
Yes, it's close to my hotel.

479
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:39,726
I started coming here,
because it's close to my company too.

480
00:30:40,434 --> 00:30:41,559
I see.

481
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:43,351
Then I'll see you around.

482
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:45,767
Okay.

483
00:30:58,518 --> 00:30:59,476
Get in.

484
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:03,685
Come and hang out with me!

485
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:06,975
No, Sungjoon, I think I'm going...

486
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:08,767
Just get in, hurry!

487
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,517
Hurry, hurry!

488
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:11,726
Well?

489
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,351
What should we do today?

490
00:31:18,603 --> 00:31:19,936
Should we go for a drive?

491
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:21,518
Or...

492
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:23,933
Are you uncomfortable?

493
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:25,892
-You can put this behind.
-No, I'm fine.

494
00:31:28,351 --> 00:31:30,393
-Do you play tennis?
-Speedminton.

495
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:31,934
The gym gave it to me for free.

496
00:31:32,268 --> 00:31:34,976
-I recently signed up at the gym.
-I see.

497
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:51,184
Look at that!

498
00:31:52,685 --> 00:31:54,268
Who drank all of my alcohol?

499
00:31:57,766 --> 00:32:00,101
Ma'am, one more soju please?

500
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:02,393
-Right away.
-Ma'am, one more glass please?

501
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:05,184
Jackson?

502
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:07,726
Who told you to sit down?

503
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:11,683
Do you have any idea
what I went through because of you?

504
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:13,726
Sit someplace else. Go away, go away.

505
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,225
Ma'am, can I get an order
of chicken feet as well?

506
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,017
-Right away.
-I said go!

507
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:20,017
But I don't like chicken feet.

508
00:32:20,102 --> 00:32:20,977
Really?

509
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:23,309
You should've told me then!

510
00:32:24,184 --> 00:32:27,309
Ma'am, give us extra chicken feet!

511
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:29,059
Make it overflow.

512
00:32:30,476 --> 00:32:31,409
Overflow.

513
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:34,767
Here, take this.

514
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,808
The loser pays for food.

515
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:41,351
-No, I'm not really in the mood.
-Here I go.

516
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:42,809
No...

517
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:50,309
Hey, wait. Time out.

518
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,016
There. You're dead now.

519
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:58,142
Take this.

520
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,228
Now, come on.

521
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:22,767
Kim Hyejin seems to be
off her game today.

522
00:33:22,892 --> 00:33:24,766
This is totally unfair!

523
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,353
How is it unfair?

524
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:32,059
What are you...

525
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:47,309
Good now?

526
00:33:52,643 --> 00:33:54,393
-Fair and square?
-What?

527
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:55,981
Yes...

528
00:33:56,989 --> 00:33:58,656
Now, come on!

529
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:01,184
I'm playing seriously now.

530
00:34:01,518 --> 00:34:02,685
Here I go.

531
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:05,742
Hurry.

532
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:14,963
There we go! That's it!

533
00:34:17,976 --> 00:34:19,976
You're rather competitive, aren't you?

534
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:22,850
You were gritting your teeth
and smashing the speeder.

535
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,724
Look who is talking.

536
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,700
You played like
your life depended on it.

537
00:34:28,726 --> 00:34:29,892
Was it that obvious?

538
00:34:34,826 --> 00:34:36,993
Oh right. I met your little sister.

539
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,892
Right.

540
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:41,470
I heard, from Hyerin.

541
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:44,892
But she looks just like you
when you were young.

542
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,726
She does, doesn't she?

543
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:51,309
We should eat together, the three of us.

544
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:53,351
Oh, okay.

545
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:54,934
We'll see.

546
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:03,304
Why did you cry earlier?

547
00:35:06,393 --> 00:35:08,268
It just looked like you were crying.

548
00:35:09,268 --> 00:35:10,976
Maybe I'm asking a personal question.

549
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,309
Well, no.

550
00:35:15,268 --> 00:35:17,518
I had some trouble at work.

551
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:20,017
It's nothing serious.

552
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:23,518
I'm relieved to hear that.

553
00:35:28,142 --> 00:35:29,267
Does my daughter want to ride the swings?

554
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:32,601
-Yes!
-We're having fun!

555
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:33,934
-Aren't you having fun?
-Yes.

556
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:35,184
When we get home,
should I read you a book?

557
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:36,683
-Yes.
-What should we eat?

558
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,017
Should we head to the convenient store?

559
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:39,643
Where should we go?

560
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:43,976
When do you miss your mother the most?

561
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,226
My mom?

562
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:50,401
Why are you asking about my mom?

563
00:35:53,142 --> 00:35:55,101
You were talking about your mother...

564
00:35:56,017 --> 00:35:58,809
...when we went out for meat soup.

565
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:03,226
Maybe I shouldn't
ask such personal questions.

566
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:04,643
It's okay.

567
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:13,226
Well, I'm reminded of her
when I trim my fingernails.

568
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:14,601
Fingernails?

569
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:18,934
I'm left-handed,
so I had trouble trimming my left hand.

570
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:24,309
It used to bleed a lot,
so she used to trim my nails for me.

571
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:29,434
But it became a habit of mine,
and now look at my hands.

572
00:36:32,686 --> 00:36:34,104
I think that's why.

573
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,850
It's hard living...

574
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:42,142
without a mother.

575
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:46,850
It must've been hard for you
when you were little.

576
00:36:50,685 --> 00:36:54,603
But I think I grew up just fine.

577
00:36:56,338 --> 00:37:02,046
Someone named Kim Hyejin
was there for me at the time.

578
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:18,685
Who is it?

579
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:20,892
Who keeps drinking my alcohol?

580
00:37:21,264 --> 00:37:22,681
Ma'am.

581
00:37:22,766 --> 00:37:24,112
Stop it.

582
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,790
You're a bad drunk.

583
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,886
Let go of me!

584
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:31,541
Because of that Crazy Joon...

585
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:33,962
I think I'm going to have to
get drunk today!

586
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:35,755
Ma'am!

587
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:37,939
Be careful.

588
00:37:38,595 --> 00:37:40,261
Let go of me!

589
00:37:40,346 --> 00:37:42,190
Jackson, you're drunk. Let's go.

590
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,233
I'm not drunk.

591
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:47,830
To be honest...

592
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,767
I'm really drunk.

593
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:53,550
It's a secret.

594
00:37:56,017 --> 00:37:57,351
Yes, whatever.

595
00:37:57,518 --> 00:37:58,685
Let's go.

596
00:38:01,184 --> 00:38:04,726
What makes him so much better than me?

597
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:09,309
He wasn't always such a hotshot!

598
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:11,267
I should tell everyone!

599
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:12,267
Tell everyone what?

600
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:14,768
You act like you know Mr Ji or something.

601
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,767
I did know him, yes I did.

602
00:38:19,393 --> 00:38:21,226
To be honest, he and I...

603
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:26,892
He and I...

604
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:29,439
Oh, no.

605
00:38:31,757 --> 00:38:34,049
Jackson, where do you live? Tell me!

606
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:36,351
Let go! I'm going home alone!

607
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:42,767
-Stop pushing me!
-I didn't push you.

608
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:49,807
I told you not to push me!

609
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:51,184
I didn't push you.

610
00:38:54,526 --> 00:38:58,776
That coward,
fatty doesn't even know who I am!

611
00:39:00,726 --> 00:39:02,766
I'm going to tell everyone!

612
00:39:03,268 --> 00:39:05,351
I'm going to tell everyone everything!

613
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:08,142
Where's my phone?

614
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:09,643
My phone.

615
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:19,987
-Jackson!
-Hey, phone!

616
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:22,017
Hey, phone!

617
00:39:22,892 --> 00:39:25,850
-Hey, phone!
-I'm going to lose my mind.

618
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,872
I could take you all the way home.

619
00:39:33,766 --> 00:39:35,322
I can take my car from here.

620
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:39,309
All right.
Be careful and get some rest.

621
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:40,351
Okay.

622
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:44,434
Well, Sungjoon.

623
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:49,766
To be honest...

624
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,767
I have a fiance.

625
00:39:57,805 --> 00:39:58,681
What?

626
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:00,516
But he doesn't want me
to meet any other men.

627
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,184
Even childhood friends.

628
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,734
So from now on,
we can't see each other anymore.

629
00:40:08,226 --> 00:40:10,309
Right, when are you going to buy me food?

630
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:12,101
What?

631
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:13,393
What?

632
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:16,781
You lost the game,
and now you're backing out?

633
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:19,601
No, it was a bet.

634
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:22,745
-Oh, this is yours.
-Forget it, give it to me next time.

635
00:40:23,934 --> 00:40:29,226
It's been chilly these days,
but your skirt is too short.

636
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:34,184
You don't want to catch a cold
being fashionable...

637
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:35,476
...so wear something warm.

638
00:40:35,952 --> 00:40:36,793
Got it?

639
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:38,101
Yes.

640
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:39,268
See you.

641
00:40:40,476 --> 00:40:41,766
Wait, Sungjoon.

642
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:43,517
It's okay, go on.

643
00:40:43,601 --> 00:40:44,559
Bye.

644
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:47,549
I mean...

645
00:40:57,934 --> 00:41:03,017
I guess I can tell him next time.

646
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:06,726
I'll take care of this next time.

647
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:18,017
There's no reason
to tell him about it today.

648
00:41:20,766 --> 00:41:21,809
It won't matter.

649
00:41:26,393 --> 00:41:27,642
You're who?

650
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:28,892
Me, me.

651
00:41:29,184 --> 00:41:30,226
Support.

652
00:41:30,726 --> 00:41:32,226
Intern, intern!

653
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:36,101
Hey, what's this?
Didn't you save my number?

654
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:38,643
Save what?

655
00:41:40,393 --> 00:41:41,643
Hey, look here, Support.

656
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:43,016
I think you've had too much to drink...

657
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:48,767
I don't think I can sleep tonight
without telling you this!

658
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:50,474
That's why I called you!

659
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:51,643
That's why you called?

660
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,756
Crazy Joon, Mr Crazy Joon!

661
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:56,351
Do you know who I am?

662
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:59,226
If you knew, you'd be shocked!

663
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,059
Look here, Support...

664
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,518
I'm...

665
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:05,745
Kim Hyejin.

666
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:06,892
So what?

667
00:42:06,976 --> 00:42:10,970
I'm telling you that I'm Kim Hyejin!
Kim Hyejin!

668
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:15,827
What?

669
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,794
Say that again.

670
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:19,184
What did you just say?

671
00:42:31,142 --> 00:42:32,642
You don't want to catch a cold
being fashionable...

672
00:42:32,726 --> 00:42:34,059
...so wear something warm.

673
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,434
Look at you.

674
00:42:46,518 --> 00:42:48,767
How much did you drink last night?

675
00:42:49,226 --> 00:42:51,139
I don't know. I don't remember.

676
00:42:54,434 --> 00:42:56,892
Hey, who was that guy
who carried you here last night?

677
00:42:58,268 --> 00:42:59,184
What?

678
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:00,431
Who carried me?

679
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:03,349
Right, the lunatic reporter.

680
00:43:03,434 --> 00:43:05,643
He's going to make fun of me forever!

681
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:11,166
After what you've been
through last night...

682
00:43:11,393 --> 00:43:13,268
...you'd want to hydrate yourself.

683
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:16,892
Hyejin, can you wake up?

684
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:18,184
-Hyejin!
-Kim Hyejin!

685
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:19,726
Miss Hari!

686
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:22,225
She's a mess right now!

687
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:24,559
She threw up on the guy
who brought her here!

688
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,559
Let go!

689
00:43:25,643 --> 00:43:27,017
He's washing up in the store.

690
00:43:27,976 --> 00:43:29,975
Excuse me, I'm Hyejin's friend.

691
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:31,766
-Are you okay?
-Do you want to die?

692
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,309
I can't say that I am.

693
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:35,475
But I guess I'll manage?

694
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:39,309
I'm going to lie down!

695
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:41,767
-You're not lying down here! Get up!
-Hyejin!

696
00:43:43,017 --> 00:43:43,933
Hey, you...

697
00:43:44,017 --> 00:43:45,932
Thank you for bringing Hyejin home!

698
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:48,350
She's not in such a great condition,
so I'll be taking her home now.

699
00:43:48,434 --> 00:43:49,434
Let's go...

700
00:43:49,518 --> 00:43:50,849
-My goodness.
-Let's go.

701
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:51,976
Let go of me!

702
00:43:53,268 --> 00:43:55,059
That's what happened? I did that?

703
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:56,849
I'm crazy.

704
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,017
Oh, right. I have to go early today.

705
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:00,476
Let's talk when I get back.

706
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:01,766
See you.

707
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,934
I've really got to stop drinking...

708
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,393
Did the sun rise from the west today?

709
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:10,726
You wear miniskirts in the winter,
so why are you wearing trousers now?

710
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,024
I know.

711
00:44:12,226 --> 00:44:13,518
I felt like trousers today.

712
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:15,766
Hey, I'm leaving.
Make sure you take care of that hangover.

713
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:16,892
Yes, see you later.

714
00:44:19,268 --> 00:44:22,726
Why can't I remember anything?
Am I getting too old?

715
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,434
Yes, Mother.

716
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:51,059
What's the matter with my daughter?

717
00:44:52,101 --> 00:44:53,434
Did you drink?

718
00:44:53,976 --> 00:44:56,226
No. It's because I'm tired.

719
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,351
I'm so busy at work lately.

720
00:44:58,559 --> 00:44:59,766
I'm not drinking.

721
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:03,393
But why are you calling me
so early in the morning?

722
00:45:03,678 --> 00:45:06,138
Come by on the weekend
with Hari and eat here.

723
00:45:06,476 --> 00:45:08,476
We should celebrate
since you got a new job.

724
00:45:08,686 --> 00:45:11,894
I want to show off some of my cooking.

725
00:45:12,638 --> 00:45:15,280
Please don't do that, Mom!

726
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:17,142
We can order in.

727
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:20,226
The dress code will be red, okay?
Tell Hari too, okay?

728
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:22,309
We don't need a dress code.

729
00:45:22,934 --> 00:45:24,850
Okay. I'll ask if she can make it.

730
00:45:25,476 --> 00:45:28,226
My baggy clothes are
still at your house, right?

731
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,268
No, the one I have has a hole
so I'll come and get it then.

732
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,102
I'm not drinking!

733
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:35,309
Yes.

734
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:42,766
What's this?

735
00:45:42,851 --> 00:45:43,893
"Outgoing Call: Mr Ji"

736
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:45,895
Did I get drunk and call Ji Sungjoon?

737
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:48,101
What am I going to do?
What did I say to him?

738
00:45:48,892 --> 00:45:51,142
Remember, remember, remember!

739
00:45:51,643 --> 00:45:52,808
Do you know who I am?

740
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:55,266
If you knew, you'd be shocked!

741
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:58,475
I'm Kim Hyejin. Kim Hyejin!

742
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,475
I'm Kim Hyejin! Kim Hyejin!

743
00:46:06,954 --> 00:46:08,101
You bad drunk.

744
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:09,892
Green light.

745
00:46:15,495 --> 00:46:19,141
Mr Kim, did you see me
get drunk and call Mr Ji?

746
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:20,309
Probably.

747
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:22,475
What did I say?
Did you hear everything?

748
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:24,643
I heard a few things.

749
00:46:25,476 --> 00:46:27,242
Did you hear me or not?

750
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,327
I'm so hungry that I can't remember.

751
00:46:30,767 --> 00:46:33,100
If I had one of these,
I would remember!

752
00:46:33,184 --> 00:46:34,100
One Kimbap, please!

753
00:46:34,184 --> 00:46:35,892
I think I'll need two to remember...

754
00:46:36,142 --> 00:46:37,685
Give me two.

755
00:46:38,226 --> 00:46:39,309
Thank you.

756
00:46:39,518 --> 00:46:40,685
-Have a good day.
-Thanks.

757
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:45,350
Well, what did I say?

758
00:46:45,434 --> 00:46:48,393
Shouldn't you begin
by apologizing to me first?

759
00:46:48,737 --> 00:46:50,196
You threw up all over me!

760
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:54,142
I'm so, so, so very sorry
that had to happen.

761
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:56,393
What did I say to Mr Ji?

762
00:46:56,892 --> 00:47:00,766
I had no idea that you two
had a thing like that going on.

763
00:47:06,184 --> 00:47:07,058
Jackson.

764
00:47:07,142 --> 00:47:08,518
Wake up, Jackson.

765
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,688
Jackson, snap out of it.

766
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:13,809
What's with the blank face?

767
00:47:14,184 --> 00:47:16,142
Don't worry. You didn't say much.

768
00:47:17,173 --> 00:47:18,173
Are you sure?

769
00:47:18,434 --> 00:47:20,475
Why must I go through this
in the middle of the night?

770
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,161
If you knew, you'd be shocked!

771
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:28,225
I'm telling you that I'm Kim Hyejin!

772
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:31,264
I'm Kim Hyejin you jerk!

773
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,807
Jerk?

774
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:33,976
Jackson.

775
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,434
When things started to get bad,
I stole your cell phone from you.

776
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:42,393
But I think he heard
you calling him a jerk.

777
00:47:44,497 --> 00:47:45,414
What happened afterwards?

778
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:47,413
Are you sure
I didn't say anything else?

779
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:50,753
It ended with "you jerk".

780
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:52,830
That's a relief!

781
00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:55,283
What else can there be?

782
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,933
Was there something
you wanted to say to him?

783
00:47:58,913 --> 00:48:00,289
No, well, nothing.

784
00:48:00,748 --> 00:48:04,174
I was angry, so I took it out on him.

785
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:05,816
That's too bad.

786
00:48:06,331 --> 00:48:09,247
I should've taken a video
and made fun of you forever!

787
00:48:09,991 --> 00:48:13,145
But you do realize that
you owe me 10 meals now, right?

788
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:17,688
I don't know, because
I don't remember much from last night.

789
00:48:20,835 --> 00:48:22,476
Now you're backing out?

790
00:48:22,561 --> 00:48:24,853
10 meals. No, just one meal.
Just buy me one meal.

791
00:48:25,263 --> 00:48:27,596
Just one.

792
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:31,199
I'm Kim Hyejin. Kim Hyejin!

793
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,075
I'm Kim Hyejin, you jerk!

794
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,699
What?

795
00:48:37,783 --> 00:48:38,908
Say that again!

796
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,367
What did you say to me just now?

797
00:48:41,492 --> 00:48:42,648
Jerk?

798
00:48:44,808 --> 00:48:45,934
Look here, Support!

799
00:48:46,116 --> 00:48:48,824
-Let's go home, okay?
-Give it back.

800
00:48:48,908 --> 00:48:51,657
Give me back my phone!
Give me, give me!

801
00:48:51,741 --> 00:48:52,824
Kim Shinhyuk?

802
00:49:05,272 --> 00:49:06,729
Buongiorno!

803
00:49:06,814 --> 00:49:09,771
Oh my, my dear Mr Ji!

804
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:11,307
My love.

805
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,240
I'm so proud of you.

806
00:49:15,325 --> 00:49:17,741
Bravo. Bravo! Bravo!

807
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:22,824
We are having a party tonight!

808
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:28,149
Mr Ji has brought in James Taylor,

809
00:49:29,408 --> 00:49:33,242
and we were able to
proceed with our project.

810
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:35,366
I have plans later,
so I don't think I can attend.

811
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,783
No, no.

812
00:49:37,158 --> 00:49:40,824
I have something to tell you later...

813
00:49:41,075 --> 00:49:44,154
so I demand you be there!

814
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:46,822
-We can talk about it now.
-Ladies and gentlemen!

815
00:49:47,116 --> 00:49:54,095
I don't want anyone to miss it,
so make sure everyone's there.

816
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,408
Yes, ma'am.

817
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,740
Especially you, Joonwoo you cutie!

818
00:49:58,824 --> 00:50:01,031
-Yes, ma'am.
-Make sure that you're there.

819
00:50:01,116 --> 00:50:02,116
Yes ma'am.

820
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,908
Kim Joonwoo,
you were the jackpot all along?

821
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:13,824
Yes, the chief editor loves him.

822
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:18,158
From now on, you're in my crosshairs.

823
00:50:21,325 --> 00:50:23,053
Print these files and take them to Mr Ji.

824
00:50:23,408 --> 00:50:24,617
He'll know what they are.

825
00:50:24,908 --> 00:50:25,908
You want me to?

826
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:29,456
Oh no, what am I going to do?

827
00:50:36,126 --> 00:50:37,876
Miss Cha asked me to give this to you.

828
00:50:38,408 --> 00:50:39,366
Leave it there.

829
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,533
Yes, sir.

830
00:50:45,532 --> 00:50:47,240
Well, about last night...

831
00:50:47,325 --> 00:50:50,283
I think you had too much to drink
and made a mistake.

832
00:50:50,741 --> 00:50:51,991
So let's act like it never happened.

833
00:50:52,533 --> 00:50:53,533
What?

834
00:50:55,908 --> 00:50:56,866
Oh, yes.

835
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,866
Thank you very much.

836
00:51:00,116 --> 00:51:01,033
Oh, and...

837
00:51:03,283 --> 00:51:06,533
Let's forget
about what happened yesterday...

838
00:51:07,668 --> 00:51:08,794
...during the day as well.

839
00:51:11,256 --> 00:51:13,838
Oh, yes.

840
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:30,408
Here's your triple Americano shot.

841
00:51:33,265 --> 00:51:34,556
You're lost in thought again.

842
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:36,242
What?

843
00:51:36,783 --> 00:51:38,408
I know your routine now.

844
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:41,617
You never realize it
when someone is addressing you.

845
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:44,783
You've got great concentration.

846
00:51:45,617 --> 00:51:46,659
Oh, yes.

847
00:51:51,617 --> 00:51:54,408
I've asked you several times
if we're heading to Incheon.

848
00:51:54,493 --> 00:51:57,201
But you're the one who
ignored me and chose not to listen!

849
00:52:03,325 --> 00:52:05,408
What's wrong with Crazy Joon?

850
00:52:14,412 --> 00:52:15,786
What's that?

851
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:17,783
Forget you!

852
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:19,533
Let's get back to work!

853
00:52:20,575 --> 00:52:21,824
Cheers!

854
00:52:21,908 --> 00:52:23,575
No, no, no.

855
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:26,408
We toast in a Most-esque way!

856
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,393
Ladies and gentlemen, salute!

857
00:52:29,478 --> 00:52:31,437
Salute!

858
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,242
Salute!

859
00:52:45,116 --> 00:52:47,074
What are you doing, Mr Ji?

860
00:52:47,158 --> 00:52:51,450
This is your welcoming party as well,
so shouldn't you have a drink?

861
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:54,950
I still have much to do,
and I'll be leaving soon.

862
00:52:55,866 --> 00:52:57,575
Didn't you want to
talk to me about work?

863
00:52:57,659 --> 00:52:58,659
No.

864
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:02,659
Do you think I'd talk about
work in a place like this?

865
00:53:03,116 --> 00:53:04,533
I don't usually do.

866
00:53:04,788 --> 00:53:07,620
I just wanted you to be here.

867
00:53:15,824 --> 00:53:16,908
Then I'll be going.

868
00:53:17,618 --> 00:53:18,659
You can't cheat.

869
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:20,950
You can't leave without having a drink.

870
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:24,490
If you really want to leave,
leave after a drink.

871
00:53:25,075 --> 00:53:26,491
-Have one.
-She's right.

872
00:53:26,575 --> 00:53:27,949
-We haven't been here for very long.
-Right.

873
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:29,991
-Please join us.
-Sing a song!

874
00:53:30,533 --> 00:53:33,616
-Drink up, drink up!
-Drink up, drink up!

875
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,365
Drink up, bottoms up!

876
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,599
Quiet.

877
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:42,809
Would you like a love shot
with me instead?

878
00:53:54,772 --> 00:53:55,772
Well, Mr Ji.

879
00:53:57,971 --> 00:53:59,116
See you tomorrow.

880
00:53:59,824 --> 00:54:00,950
He must be busy.

881
00:54:02,908 --> 00:54:04,741
Oh, he can drink.

882
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,492
-Salute.
-Salute.

883
00:54:07,826 --> 00:54:08,909
Yes, Hari.

884
00:54:10,267 --> 00:54:11,267
Okay.

885
00:54:11,973 --> 00:54:13,057
Pour me one.

886
00:54:13,142 --> 00:54:14,767
We have a company party tonight.

887
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:15,768
Yes.

888
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:17,103
Go on without me.

889
00:54:17,188 --> 00:54:19,063
I'll see you at home. Bye.

890
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,095
Jackson.

891
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,703
You startled me!

892
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:25,184
I got a call from my roommate.

893
00:54:30,731 --> 00:54:31,689
What the...

894
00:54:32,017 --> 00:54:34,142
-Mr Ji!
-Mr Ji!

895
00:54:37,922 --> 00:54:38,975
Mr Ji!

896
00:54:39,475 --> 00:54:40,850
-Mr Ji.
-Get up!

897
00:54:44,854 --> 00:54:47,722
My goodness, what do we do?

898
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,769
Look in his wallet.

899
00:54:48,854 --> 00:54:49,729
Wallet?

900
00:54:50,628 --> 00:54:51,670
Wallet.

901
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:56,350
Here it is! The card key!

902
00:54:56,517 --> 00:54:58,808
But showing it to me
doesn't open the door!

903
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:00,470
Oh, yes.

904
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,100
Don't you know how to use a card key?

905
00:55:10,244 --> 00:55:11,092
Thank you.

906
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,483
There, on the sofa.

907
00:55:27,225 --> 00:55:28,807
Where should I leave this?

908
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:29,891
-Give it to me, give it to me.
-What?

909
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:32,143
Give it to me, give it to me.

910
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:34,102
Let's get going!

911
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,516
I'm tired.

912
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,516
Get me a glass of water.

913
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,350
This isn't your home!

914
00:55:38,464 --> 00:55:40,256
I'll buy you one outside. Let's go.

915
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:42,141
Water!

916
00:55:42,702 --> 00:55:43,660
Water.

917
00:55:56,019 --> 00:56:00,186
My shoulders are suffering
because of all of these drunk people!

918
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:06,600
I've brought Mr Ji's card key with me.

919
00:56:08,807 --> 00:56:09,848
I'll give it to him later.

920
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,933
How can he have nothing but water
in the fridge?

921
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:15,308
He used to eat so much.

922
00:56:15,392 --> 00:56:16,379
Jackson!

923
00:56:16,464 --> 00:56:17,713
What are you thinking about?

924
00:56:18,738 --> 00:56:21,572
Hey, stop playing.

925
00:56:21,737 --> 00:56:25,155
I haven't seen him drink
anything but coffee in the office.

926
00:56:25,534 --> 00:56:26,950
I wonder whom he has lunch with.

927
00:56:27,155 --> 00:56:29,322
Why should I care?
I don't care if he starves!

928
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:30,831
Jackson!

929
00:56:31,785 --> 00:56:33,507
Tell me what you're thinking!

930
00:56:34,197 --> 00:56:35,325
Seriously, stop it!

931
00:56:38,572 --> 00:56:39,936
Why are you always playing jokes?

932
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,521
You made me go
all the way to the airport!

933
00:56:42,606 --> 00:56:44,247
Do I look like an easy target to you?
Do I?

934
00:56:44,489 --> 00:56:45,468
Sorry.

935
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:47,530
You're like my little sister.

936
00:56:47,614 --> 00:56:49,321
I've never had a big brother like you.

937
00:56:50,656 --> 00:56:51,988
I'm sorry if I offended you.

938
00:56:52,072 --> 00:56:54,908
You really seem like my younger sister,
that's why.

939
00:56:54,993 --> 00:56:58,742
Then why don't you go
and play jokes on your own sister?

940
00:56:58,826 --> 00:56:59,826
You can do that!

941
00:57:00,286 --> 00:57:01,231
She died.

942
00:57:01,993 --> 00:57:03,076
When I was 13.

943
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,221
I don't know why I told you that.

944
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:15,264
I'll be going now.

945
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:16,858
I'll see you tomorrow.

946
00:57:17,295 --> 00:57:19,442
No, no. Mr Kim. Mr Kim!

947
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,580
Oh no.

948
00:57:22,665 --> 00:57:24,462
I just made a huge mistake!

949
00:57:28,368 --> 00:57:29,702
Where's my phone?

950
00:57:30,008 --> 00:57:31,289
I need to apologize right away!

951
00:57:34,361 --> 00:57:35,227
No way.

952
00:57:35,628 --> 00:57:36,742
I can't believe this!

953
00:57:36,826 --> 00:57:38,979
My phone's filled
with pictures of me and Hari!

954
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:43,711
1111?

955
00:57:44,034 --> 00:57:45,660
Or 0000?

956
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:49,034
Of course not.

957
00:57:49,118 --> 00:57:50,849
It couldn't be that simple.

958
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:52,637
What is it?

959
00:57:58,389 --> 00:57:59,341
Maybe...

960
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,552
Right!

961
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:11,327
World left-hander's day?

962
00:58:49,034 --> 00:58:52,535
He hasn't come for his MP3 player yet?

963
00:58:53,695 --> 00:58:55,695
That was the guest in 2024, wasn't it?

964
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:59,118
Give it to me. I'll give it to him.

965
00:59:11,243 --> 00:59:12,201
Oh, right.

966
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,211
"Ji Sungjoon"?

967
00:59:22,076 --> 00:59:25,034
If you ever want me to buy you lunch,
give me a call.

968
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:29,733
How does Kim Hyejin
know a great guy like this?

969
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:32,816
Okay. I'm going to call him.

970
00:59:33,983 --> 00:59:37,983
Completely unaware, A and B
eventually recognize each other...

971
00:59:38,654 --> 00:59:41,487
...as they reach a crossroad.

972
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:46,149
And the moment they realize
that they're at a crossroad...

973
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:47,525
Oh my, Mister!

974
00:59:48,281 --> 00:59:50,735
You can't be in here!

975
00:59:50,941 --> 00:59:51,816
What?

976
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,011
How did you get in here
without a key card?

977
00:59:54,096 --> 00:59:55,702
There are only suites in this floor.

978
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,108
Leave before our guests see you!

979
00:59:58,192 --> 00:59:59,483
I'm sorry. Leave now, hurry!

980
00:59:59,568 --> 01:00:00,470
Hari!

981
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:01,720
Miss Ha.

982
01:00:01,805 --> 01:00:03,565
This man was wandering...

983
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:04,816
I'm sorry, sir.

984
01:00:06,452 --> 01:00:09,035
Our employee must have
been confused.

985
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,861
Apologize now!

986
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,327
He's staying in the suite.

987
01:00:13,412 --> 01:00:14,725
Room 2024.

988
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:16,185
But he looks homeless...

989
01:00:20,656 --> 01:00:22,030
I'm so sorry.

990
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:26,572
Well, I'm a forgiving person.

991
01:00:26,739 --> 01:00:28,030
So I'm willing to let this go.

992
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:30,239
I'm so sorry!

993
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,857
Oh, this.

994
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,712
Thank you. See you again.

995
01:00:36,121 --> 01:00:37,705
But your voice sounds...

996
01:00:38,912 --> 01:00:40,204
...familiar.

997
01:00:40,872 --> 01:00:42,746
-I see.
-See you soon.

998
01:00:45,055 --> 01:00:48,490
Some crossroads cannot be
seen with our eyes.

999
01:00:54,663 --> 01:01:01,658
It hides the fact that
it'll make our lives more complicated.

1000
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,954
Do you remember the puzzle back then?
I found it in the box.

1001
01:01:31,496 --> 01:01:33,579
So this is what you found?

1002
01:01:43,126 --> 01:01:44,699
Hey, how did you get in here?
