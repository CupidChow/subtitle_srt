1
00:00:02,498 --> 00:00:04,007
"Episode 3"

2
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:11,418
I asked you for this earlier...

3
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:31,378
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

4
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:34,240
Kim Hyejin!

5
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:36,967
What's going on with you?

6
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,157
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:41,772
It's great to see you, Sungjoon!

8
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:44,541
Wait.

9
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:49,139
I can't believe we're meeting here again!

10
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:50,402
What brings you here?

11
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,272
I want to ask you the same thing.

12
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:56,832
I thought you were supposed
to be studying overseas.

13
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,225
It's Manager Min's badge.

14
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:00,960
Ms Min!

15
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,336
Let's go talk someplace else.

16
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,600
-Ms Min!
-Let's talk outside.

17
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:08,289
Wait.

18
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,333
Sir, you'll have to move your car.

19
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:12,555
We're backed up.

20
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:15,188
I understand, I'm sorry.
I'll move it right away.

21
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,950
Wait here for me.

22
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:20,697
Okay.

23
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:23,185
Didn't you hear me calling for you?

24
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:24,565
You've dropped this.

25
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:26,713
What am I going to do?

26
00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:28,898
I'm going to lose my mind!

27
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:40,946
As you already know...

28
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:43,894
...I'm studying overseas.

29
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,176
Yes, that's right.

30
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:47,489
You even sent me a picture from London.

31
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:52,151
Can you guess why I'm here now?

32
00:01:57,808 --> 00:01:58,828
Well...

33
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:01,062
...I was over there.

34
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,719
But...

35
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:08,079
And shortly afterward,
I received a call from Korea.

36
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:10,609
I was given an opportunity
to work in this hotel...

37
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,222
...and I really wanted the job.

38
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:15,829
And so, I was able to return
to Korea shortly afterward.

39
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:16,855
Gosh.

40
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:19,744
I'm not even famous,
but I've experienced so much!

41
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,595
Then you should've told me
that you've returned.

42
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:42,130
I almost left without saying hello to you

43
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,872
because I thought you were in London.

44
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:45,970
I thought I was seeing things.

45
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:49,439
Do you see this?

46
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,061
I'm getting goose bumps.

47
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:54,629
You see, I was going
to contact you later today.

48
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,460
But we happened to meet right here!

49
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:58,948
Anyway, I think it's great.

50
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:01,221
I was disappointed that you had
to leave like that.

51
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:03,149
But I didn't expect this at all.

52
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:05,909
I didn't imagine that
you'd become a hotelier.

53
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,554
I couldn't imagine you'd be a deputy
chief editor for a fashion magazine.

54
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:13,727
How did you know that
I'm a deputy chief editor?

55
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:15,560
What?

56
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:17,715
Well...

57
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,766
...you told me when we met last time!

58
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:25,924
Did I bring that up?

59
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:27,092
Sure you did.

60
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:33,170
Well, it's good to see you again.

61
00:03:34,073 --> 00:03:35,083
I know, right?

62
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:38,032
Do you know the Jinsung Magazine
building past the intersection?

63
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:39,533
That's where I work.

64
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,703
It's pretty close, so we'll be able
to see each other often.

65
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:54,429
"My Husband"

66
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,325
Whose phone is that? Please answer it!

67
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:04,306
-Yes, you've reached Kim...
-Hey!

68
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,155
Oh, no! This is bad!

69
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:07,697
Do you know who I met just now?

70
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:08,827
My goodness.

71
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:11,469
When you hear this,
you're going to freak out...

72
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:12,709
The person whom...

73
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,989
...you're trying to freak out
is not here at the moment.

74
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:19,677
-Who is this?
-Kim Shinhyuk.

75
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:22,460
-What?
-If it's something exciting...

76
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,170
...you can tell me, and I'll
make sure she gets the message.

77
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:27,713
What's he saying?

78
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:30,214
No, it's okay.

79
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:32,069
I'll call back later.

80
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,108
Who was that?

81
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:37,949
Did she really tender
her resignation or not?

82
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:42,792
But I need to handle this right away!

83
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,555
Hey, why are you coming home now?

84
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,665
And why didn't you get your phone?

85
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:55,723
Didn't some guy tell you
that I called earlier?

86
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:57,534
No, that's not what's
important right now.

87
00:04:57,634 --> 00:04:59,507
Do you know what
happened at the hotel earlier?

88
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:02,007
I've got the worst luck!
Don't be shocked, all right?

89
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:03,684
At the hotel, I ran into...

90
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,887
-Jerk!
-I met the jerk!

91
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:07,629
What?

92
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:10,062
I will not resign from this company!

93
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:12,650
What's she saying?

94
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,708
Jerk? Who?

95
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:18,113
You didn't hand in your resignation?
I thought you were quitting today!

96
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:19,469
Why should I? Why should I quit?

97
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:21,409
I'm going to work at that company
with my head held high!

98
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:23,975
So, you're no longer going to quit?

99
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,181
Anyway, I completely support
your decision to stay.

100
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:29,850
But why all of a sudden?
And who's this jerk you speak of?

101
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,449
That jerk, Ji Sungjoon!

102
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,492
So, the jerk is Ji Sungjoon?

103
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:37,251
That's whom you're referring to?

104
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:42,079
This morning, you were talking about
how you two have something special.

105
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:43,572
Why are you calling him a jerk now?

106
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:45,941
Do you know what he said to me?

107
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,474
Let me tell you what he said to me!

108
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,631
And that's what he said to me, that dog!

109
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,431
No way...

110
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:59,848
He seemed gentle and compassionate.

111
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:01,549
And there's the verdict. He's a psycho.

112
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,869
He's got multiple personalities.

113
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:05,214
First love, my foot!
Feed him to the dogs!

114
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:09,260
Wait, what's going on here?

115
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:14,190
Now, that I think about it, lying about
studying abroad was the right decision.

116
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,475
He's never going to find out...

117
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,855
...so I would've cheated
myself by resigning!

118
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:21,509
So, about that...

119
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,146
He's got a rotten temper
and I can't stand the way he talks!

120
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:27,961
Everyone in the office
calls him Crazy Joon!

121
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,970
That's cold!

122
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:33,154
He's always had an ulterior motive.

123
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,215
He was returning to Korea...

124
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:36,601
-...but he doesn't have a girlfriend.
-But he doesn't have a girlfriend.

125
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:39,087
So, why not try and hit on
the prettiest girl at your old school?

126
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:40,829
That's what he's up to!

127
00:06:41,549 --> 00:06:43,167
I've heard that someplace before.

128
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:44,624
We're complete strangers now!

129
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:47,206
I'm not going to worry about him
and only focus on work.

130
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,710
So, don't you ever
bring him up in front of me again!

131
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,832
Gosh, I hate him!

132
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:55,657
Gosh.

133
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:57,909
How did the situation turn like this?

134
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:01,461
So, do I tell her that I met
Ji Sungjoon earlier today, or not?

135
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:02,847
Oh, right.

136
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:05,073
You mentioned that something
happened at the hotel.

137
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,159
-What?
-What was it?

138
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,041
You said that it was something urgent.

139
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:11,418
I did?

140
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:15,826
Oh, my. Why did I suddenly forget
what I was going to say?

141
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:17,953
You've been drinking too much these days.

142
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:21,339
Come on. Given our mood,
let's have one more beer tonight.

143
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:22,974
Okay.

144
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,187
Yes, she's determined
to keep her job now.

145
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,897
Why tell her about it and make her worry?

146
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:35,356
I'll just take care of it on my end.

147
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:18,743
Americano Ristretto with triple shot.

148
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,233
Here is your Americano Ristretto
with triple shot.

149
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:30,507
Sir?

150
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:32,987
Sir.

151
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:35,560
-Yes.
-Here's your coffee.

152
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:37,215
Oh, thank you very much.

153
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:49,298
Oh, my. What's the matter with him?

154
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:14,973
It's go time!

155
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,806
It's go time!

156
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:28,309
Why do you always say that
when it's time to cross?

157
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:29,949
Because a green light tells you
to go ahead and cross.

158
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,167
What about the red lights?

159
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:32,401
The red lights?

160
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:34,313
The red lights are red lights.

161
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,374
But that's a little weird.

162
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,507
My whole family says that.

163
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,980
But now that you mention it,
it is a bit weird.

164
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,551
Yes, just focus on your salary.

165
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,915
-Salary, salary.
-Jackson!

166
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:52,869
Good morning!

167
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:53,957
Do you want a bite?

168
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:55,975
-No.
-Why not?

169
00:09:56,561 --> 00:10:01,149
I've had just one bite. Try it!

170
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:14,293
"Sungjoon"
Oh, no.

171
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:15,597
It's Ji Sungjoon!

172
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,996
Yes, Sungjoon.

173
00:10:21,349 --> 00:10:23,012
Yes, Hyejin. Where are you right now?

174
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:24,743
I'm at home.

175
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:26,953
But why do you ask?

176
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:29,398
I was wondering if you
were headed to work.

177
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:30,834
No.

178
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:34,414
But why are you asking me that
all of a sudden?

179
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:37,649
I was at the crosswalk,
and it reminded me of you...

180
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:40,215
Never mind.

181
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,992
Go on and get ready for work.
We'll talk again later.

182
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:44,215
I'll call back soon.

183
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:45,546
Hey, Sungjoon.

184
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:48,094
Yes?

185
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:50,177
When do you have some time?

186
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,149
I have something to tell you.

187
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:55,328
Let's meet up.

188
00:10:57,109 --> 00:11:00,734
Sir, why don't you take a coffee break?

189
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,461
No coffee. I'm taking herbal medication.

190
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,607
But this coffee is filled
with my affection.

191
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:07,524
Go for it!

192
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:10,709
I said I don't want any!

193
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:13,212
Joonwoo, your morning coffee.

194
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:16,420
-You're tired, aren't you?
-Thank you.

195
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,669
-How are you today?
-Mr Kim, good morning!

196
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:21,940
This is for you.

197
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,070
I don't have any money.

198
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,450
If you're trying get money,
look elsewhere.

199
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:27,492
You're so funny, Mr Kim!

200
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:28,976
Such a jokester!

201
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,768
What's with her?

202
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:34,699
Did she put something in here?

203
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:37,770
Jackson, want to give this a try?

204
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:41,672
Seol, I want coffee, too...

205
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:43,092
I'm so sleepy.

206
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:44,389
Then why don't you go for a jog?

207
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:46,452
Fresh air is the best
when you're feeling sleepy.

208
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,436
Oh, my goodness... What's with her?

209
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:54,210
I'm her superior,
so why is she neglecting me?

210
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:57,145
Good morning.

211
00:11:57,245 --> 00:11:58,758
-How are you?
-You've arrived?

212
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:03,807
Crazy Joon has entered the building.

213
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,949
He's prepared to devour us again today.

214
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:09,791
Get ready for
his barrage of insults again.

215
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:12,147
We have a meeting in 10 minutes.

216
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:18,429
Three months will go by quickly.

217
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:21,150
Whatever I do here,
time will keep ticking.

218
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:24,029
I'm not going to cower
like an idiot anymore.

219
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,638
I was the ace of the management team!

220
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:28,590
I'll show them what I'm made of!

221
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:41,531
Next issue, we're planning on
grooming and cosmeceutical brands.

222
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:42,990
What? A cos-what?

223
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,820
People are willing to spend
on fashion and cosmetics now.

224
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:49,909
So, as far as grooming is concerned...

225
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:51,069
Is this outer space?

226
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:54,246
Why is everyone talking gibberish?
I don't understand any of this!

227
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,184
We've already heard
this kind of theme before

228
00:12:56,284 --> 00:13:00,142
so I want you to provide more specifics.

229
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,551
-Okay.
-Next, the fashion team?

230
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,676
We're thinking about featuring
fashion in movies by the era.

231
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:10,749
We can research
the Garconne look of the 1920s...

232
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:11,784
A what-son?

233
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:13,824
What kind of son is him?

234
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:15,379
Or a 40s military look.

235
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,071
We can correlate the era to each trend

236
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:23,674
by providing parallels
to specific movie frames.

237
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:27,452
I've prepared some still shots of some
of the movies we've reviewed.

238
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:28,802
Hyejin.

239
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,194
Hyejin, can you turn on the monitor?

240
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,021
What's a monitor?

241
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,886
Oh, monitor.

242
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:38,510
Okay.

243
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,193
Why isn't this turning on?

244
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:58,080
Well, Hyejin. That's not the one.

245
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:04,473
I'm so sorry.

246
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:12,886
Gosh!

247
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,300
Hyejin, the remote for the stand...

248
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:22,883
I'm so sorry!

249
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:26,863
I thought I already told you
that I don't like to waste time!

250
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:36,149
Develop your ideas from today,
and be prepared to present them.

251
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:40,463
Oh, and who's taking the minutes?

252
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:43,564
That would be me.

253
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:50,429
Bring it to me as soon as it's prepared.

254
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:51,381
Yes, sir.

255
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:54,404
-Good work everyone.
-Good work everyone.

256
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:57,202
Hyejin, you were hilarious today.

257
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,784
Why did you have to do that?

258
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:08,953
-Look here, Support.
-Yes, Mr Ji!

259
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,924
You fell for it, didn't you?

260
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,570
Do you have a phobia of Mr Ji?

261
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:20,229
Why would I have something like that?

262
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,416
You're acting really weird!

263
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:23,192
You normally work and talk very well.

264
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:26,044
But the very mention of Mr Ji
makes you freeze up!

265
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,504
Why is that?

266
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:31,657
You look like you're hiding something big.

267
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:35,555
Goodness! That's utter nonsense!

268
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:36,853
What do I have to hide?

269
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:38,982
Don't make me laugh!

270
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:43,193
Goodness. That's so ridiculous.

271
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:44,720
Unbelievable!

272
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,585
Don't make me laugh!

273
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:48,267
This is so unbelievable!

274
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:50,525
She's not normal.

275
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:56,037
"Fashion Team: Styles In Movies"

276
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:57,853
I don't get any of this!

277
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:03,309
Well...

278
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,901
You're the assistant
for the Beauty Team, aren't you?

279
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:12,946
What if I am?

280
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:16,449
They were talking about the cosmos
or something during the meeting...

281
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:18,355
I'm busy right now.

282
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:24,509
Sir, I have a question for you.

283
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:27,090
Can you ask me later?
I'm a bit tired right now.

284
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:30,509
-Ms Cha.
-Hey, I need you.

285
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,125
Translate these documents right away.

286
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,908
But what's the Garconne thing
that was mentioned in the meeting?

287
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:37,830
Yes, I'm on my way now.

288
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:54,048
Look here, Support.

289
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:58,101
-Are you here on a golden parachute?
-Excuse me?

290
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,945
Did you get this job
because you know someone here?

291
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:03,549
I went through the entire hiring process.

292
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:05,204
I got here on my own abilities.

293
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:07,264
Then are you working two jobs?

294
00:17:07,749 --> 00:17:08,689
Two jobs?

295
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,080
No I don't, this is my only job.

296
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:16,457
Then how do you explain
your incompetence?

297
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,773
You work for a magazine,

298
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,408
on the editing department
and you're unfamiliar with these terms?

299
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:26,314
I was transferred here
not too long ago...

300
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:29,429
...and I'm getting used to it...

301
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,229
So, you expect me to cut you some slack?

302
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:35,488
You'll do the minimum
as long as you get paid?

303
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,759
No, that's not what I meant.

304
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,429
I mean...

305
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:42,273
The responsibilities here
are completely different...

306
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:44,749
...and everyone's too busy to teach me...

307
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,909
No one's here to teach you anything.

308
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:48,724
It's your responsibility
to pick things up.

309
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:52,354
I don't care where you've come from...

310
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:54,349
...but I only work with professionals.

311
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:56,613
What I'm telling you is that

312
00:17:56,713 --> 00:18:01,607
I'm in a position to fire you
if your work doesn't shape up.

313
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:06,549
And I don't care about
your computer skills.

314
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:09,229
Just make sure that
your work is straightened out.

315
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:12,121
I don't want the meeting logs
to simply look good.

316
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:18,127
-Well...
-Take my words seriously...

317
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,558
...because I don't normally
make empty threats.

318
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:23,019
You're dismissed.

319
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:29,911
-Well, Mr Ji...
-How many times must I tell you?

320
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:32,307
I don't like to waste time with nonsense.

321
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:44,169
Whose idea was it
to hire someone like that?

322
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:58,869
Hyejin, Hyejin.

323
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:01,436
Stop by the Substitution Department
and help Han Seol with her work.

324
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:02,946
The Substitution Department?

325
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:09,973
What is all of this?

326
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:11,620
What does it look like?

327
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,740
The photo shoot is over,
so we're sending these back to the agency.

328
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,410
My back is killing me.

329
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,042
Why don't you come here and help me?

330
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:20,273
Oh, okay.

331
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:25,349
Separate these by brands,
and then we'll separate them by agency.

332
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:28,008
Yes. Separate by brands.

333
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:32,138
This is...

334
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:34,046
Shu... No.

335
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:35,576
Shury...

336
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:37,864
Shue...

337
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:43,749
And this is...

338
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:45,554
B... Ba...

339
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,029
No, Bio...

340
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:49,229
Are you dyslexic?

341
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:50,286
Excuse me?

342
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:52,989
No, I've just never seen these before.

343
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:54,156
Gosh.

344
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:57,007
You've never seen these brands before?

345
00:19:57,749 --> 00:19:59,403
Don't you ever wear makeup?

346
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,176
I do, at the supermarket.

347
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,984
My goodness.

348
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:06,291
Hand me the brush kit.

349
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:07,634
The brush kit...

350
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,054
...would be...

351
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:13,835
Don't tell me that
you don't know what a brush kit is.

352
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:16,426
Do you know what CC cream is?

353
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,262
A blusher?

354
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,448
Primer?

355
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:22,159
You really have no idea, do you?

356
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,472
Is your father a snake handler
or a wild ginseng hunter?

357
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:27,885
No. My father ran a print store.

358
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:30,835
You weren't born in the mountains

359
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:34,187
so how can a woman be so unaware
of the very basics of cosmetics?

360
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:36,352
My goodness.

361
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:45,619
Why did he have to be there
at this moment?

362
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:49,524
Like this.
Get these to look good on each other.

363
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,270
Hyejin.

364
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,388
Get me that BK corduroy
blouson over there.

365
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:54,602
What?

366
00:20:57,349 --> 00:20:58,220
Yes.

367
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:00,446
What is BK?

368
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:03,186
Blouson? What shade of blue is it?

369
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,617
No, not there,
but the third one from the right.

370
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:10,681
That's the left. The right!

371
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:11,656
Move!

372
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,437
I'm not cut out for this.

373
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:33,084
Oh, yes!

374
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,147
You've crumbled it for me!

375
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:41,629
Were you in the middle of
destroying extra brain cells?

376
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:44,225
But you don't look like a genius to me.

377
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:45,613
Want some?

378
00:21:56,557 --> 00:21:58,731
Someone must've ruined her day.

379
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:00,295
Wonder who that is.

380
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:09,456
Give me anything to do!

381
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:11,657
Everyone here knows
that I'm a great worker, right?

382
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:18,256
Why don't all of us at Management Support
meet for a company dinner later?

383
00:22:18,356 --> 00:22:21,130
Company dinner, company dinner!

384
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:22,629
What's the matter with her?

385
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,365
I know, it's frightening.

386
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,068
She's lost it.

387
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:29,662
Company dinner, company dinner!

388
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,912
I want you to focus.

389
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:45,517
Three months will pass quickly.

390
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:47,743
-Go back inside.
-Mr Boo.

391
00:22:47,843 --> 00:22:49,045
You can't forget me.

392
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:51,189
Come get me after three months, promise?

393
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,593
You have to promise me!

394
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:03,452
She has the expression of an animal
being dragged off to slaughter.

395
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:35,792
-Have some.
-Thank you.

396
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:48,549
Hyejin.

397
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:49,785
-Yes.
-Proofread this.

398
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:52,142
Hyejin.

399
00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:55,854
Hyejin.

400
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:04,568
This stop is Mokdong Station...

401
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,765
Ma'am, please sit here.

402
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:25,527
Mr Driver, please wait
until grandma here is seated.

403
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:30,394
Okay, we're ready to go!

404
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:31,773
Let's go!

405
00:24:37,386 --> 00:24:38,792
Hey, Hari!

406
00:24:40,949 --> 00:24:42,149
I'm sorry, okay?

407
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:45,399
Are you going to stop seeing me
because I made a simple mistake?

408
00:24:46,637 --> 00:24:47,987
A simple mistake?

409
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,011
You're really worthless.

410
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,269
You still don't get it, do you?

411
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:53,829
Do you want me to teach
you another lesson?

412
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,614
My goodness.

413
00:24:56,469 --> 00:24:58,466
Wait, Hari.

414
00:24:58,566 --> 00:24:59,595
Min Hari!

415
00:24:59,695 --> 00:25:00,893
I'll be better to you.

416
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,992
It seems you've done something really bad.

417
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:09,715
Gosh, you startled me.

418
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:13,023
Mister, you did something
to tick off my sister, didn't you?

419
00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:14,423
Sister?

420
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,259
So, you're Hari's little sister?

421
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,398
Can't you tell by the way
both of us are shockingly beautiful?

422
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:24,661
Do you want me to give you a tip
on how to make up with my sister?

423
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:26,861
I'd be really thankful.

424
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:30,570
Then order me a strawberry smoothie
from the cafe nearby

425
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,090
and I'll tell you all about it.

426
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,697
Strawberry smoothie, my foot.

427
00:25:35,797 --> 00:25:38,311
You should go because she's a con-artist.

428
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,542
That hurts!

429
00:25:39,642 --> 00:25:41,456
-Hey, hey!
-That hurts!

430
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:42,826
She's not Hari's sister...

431
00:25:42,926 --> 00:25:45,084
-...so get going.
-Let go of me!

432
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:46,285
She's not her sister?

433
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:48,002
Let go.

434
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:50,829
That hurts, it really hurts!

435
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:51,869
Hey!

436
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:54,681
I told you to stay away from here!

437
00:25:54,781 --> 00:25:55,909
Let go of me.

438
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:58,359
I'm not here to see you!
I'm here to see Hari!

439
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,059
Why, you!

440
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:03,269
You better not rip off
anymore of Hari's boyfriends!

441
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:05,042
I'll throw you out!

442
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:07,344
I can't believe we come
from the same parents.

443
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:08,500
Get out of here!

444
00:26:08,989 --> 00:26:10,776
You're ugly and you've got a bad temper!

445
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:15,826
What did you just say to me?

446
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:20,686
I said that you're ugly
and you've got a bad temper!

447
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:23,621
Kim Hyerin, I better not catch you!

448
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:27,170
She's not my sister. She's my enemy!

449
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,462
Gosh, my legs.

450
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:37,803
Gosh!

451
00:26:38,949 --> 00:26:41,869
Hey, what are you doing there?

452
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:48,054
Why are you passed out on the floor?

453
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:50,189
Go inside and sleep.

454
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:57,283
Hari, do you know what a BK corduroy is?

455
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,649
I bought one last week.

456
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:01,749
What?

457
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,137
You know what that is?

458
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:12,549
I mean, when did we start calling
a black jumper, a BK corduroy?

459
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:14,585
Cosmeceutical? Garconne look?

460
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:18,301
The Great King Sejong
would turn in his grave.

461
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:21,775
Why abandon a perfectly good language
and describe it in English?

462
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,290
We're describing clothes and makeup here.

463
00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:29,269
It's nothing but frivolousness
and superficiality.

464
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:31,536
I have no idea what they're talking about

465
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:33,587
but I need to show Crazy Joon
something soon.

466
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:36,493
I'm always getting torn down by him

467
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:38,889
and I was an ace at
Management Support Department.

468
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:40,941
Seems to me like it's your fault.

469
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:42,575
What?

470
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:46,934
Why do you consider industry
lingo as superficiality?

471
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:50,288
What about medical terms, IT terms,

472
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:51,767
and the English used
in the hotel industry?

473
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:53,141
They're not superficial at all.

474
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:55,887
Aren't you the one who's underestimating

475
00:27:55,987 --> 00:27:59,150
fashion and beauty
as something superficial?

476
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:03,148
It's obvious that your superior
would find a problem...

477
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,820
...with your lack of knowledge.

478
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:07,416
Hey, Min Hari. Whose side are you on?

479
00:28:07,709 --> 00:28:10,225
I want to do well...

480
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,423
...but I've never seen any of this before!

481
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:15,661
So, did you put in any effort?

482
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:19,794
You've been spending
your time cursing Sungjoon.

483
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:24,145
Have you ever picked up one
of their magazines and read through it?

484
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:30,668
If not, I don't think you can blame them
for being pretentious.

485
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:32,672
Hey, you...

486
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:36,110
I'm going to bed.

487
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:45,678
Brat!

488
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:47,945
She should take my side!

489
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:52,136
Aren't you the one who's underestimating

490
00:28:52,236 --> 00:28:55,270
fashion and beauty
as something superficial?

491
00:28:55,623 --> 00:28:56,862
Did you put in any effort at all?

492
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:04,661
Have you ever picked up one
of their magazines and read through it?

493
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:42,783
Now, that you thought about it,
I'm right, aren't I?

494
00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:46,990
It makes me angry to think that
other people are being mean to you.

495
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:48,909
Mark anything you
come across that you don't know.

496
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:51,662
I've always lived by my fashion magazines
instead of my textbooks.

497
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:53,669
I'm the professional,

498
00:29:53,749 --> 00:29:55,329
so I'll teach you
everything you need to know.

499
00:29:57,149 --> 00:29:58,491
Okay, she's a good friend.

500
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:39,699
I'm sorry.

501
00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:53,733
Short girls with great bodies should
wear skinny jeans with high heels.

502
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,710
These are wild pants.
You know wild pants, right?

503
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,876
Bell bottoms.

504
00:30:56,976 --> 00:30:58,869
They look like trumpets at the ankles.

505
00:30:58,969 --> 00:31:01,331
Bell bottoms are back in style for 2015.

506
00:31:01,431 --> 00:31:03,061
I wear them all the time.

507
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,392
Short, skinny girls
should wear boot cut jeans.

508
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:07,315
Boot cuts are also a 2015 trend.

509
00:31:30,629 --> 00:31:31,705
This.

510
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:32,929
A screw brush.

511
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:34,336
-This one.
-Eyelash curler.

512
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:36,909
-Highlights.
-This?

513
00:31:36,989 --> 00:31:38,000
Eyebrow tint!

514
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,613
Mascara, lip tint, blush.

515
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:44,510
Describe what that person is wearing.

516
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:49,678
She has on a wide fedora,
with a flower pattern sweatshirt...

517
00:31:50,217 --> 00:31:55,507
...a see-through unbalanced skirt,
and a spangle clutch!

518
00:31:56,189 --> 00:31:57,143
And her shoes?

519
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,484
Lace-up boots.

520
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:03,727
Yes!

521
00:32:07,478 --> 00:32:11,959
"She Was Pretty"

522
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:16,154
Mamma Mia!

523
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:18,786
No, no, no.

524
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:22,312
Not most-esque at all.

525
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:24,649
I can't stand that.

526
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:31,094
Joonwoo, can you go
fetch me the fringe skirt?

527
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:32,137
Yes, ma'am.

528
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:37,438
Here's your fringe skirt.

529
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:39,596
Grazie, Lint.

530
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:41,483
Here.

531
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:44,964
Fashion.

532
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:47,107
Yes, this is the feel.

533
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,512
Very most-esque, right?

534
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:51,512
Yes. We'll proceed with this.

535
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:12,438
For the 50s and 60s look,
we cannot leave out the Hepburn look.

536
00:33:13,229 --> 00:33:17,050
Like the Capri pants
and ballet shoes from "Sabrina"...

537
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:21,372
...and the black see-through
and sunglasses in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"

538
00:33:21,472 --> 00:33:25,279
we want to outline
the lead's fashion profile.

539
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:27,580
I hear and I understand it all!

540
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,739
I can understand
the foreign language now!

541
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:42,788
What did you just say?

542
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:47,206
Oh, I'm so sorry.

543
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:48,916
I'm really sorry.

544
00:33:49,016 --> 00:33:50,862
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry!

545
00:33:59,352 --> 00:34:00,814
"Hepburn Look: Beauty of 1950s, 1960s"

546
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:04,432
You don't have a problem
with anything today, do you?

547
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,139
Perfect, isn't it?

548
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:11,896
It's fine, you can go.

549
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:13,040
Yes, all right.

550
00:34:14,749 --> 00:34:16,454
Oh, no!

551
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:19,444
I apologize.

552
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:31,618
I could've been perfect today!

553
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:41,279
I think today's a good day.

554
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:42,598
What?

555
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,016
For what?

556
00:34:45,269 --> 00:34:46,429
Have you forgotten already?

557
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:49,939
It's because of me that you were hired
into our editing department,

558
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,507
so you owe me something big.

559
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:54,103
I don't think I owe you anything.

560
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:55,361
I think you do.

561
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:58,610
There's a great tteokbokki place.
Let's go after work?

562
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,749
No, thanks.

563
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:01,709
Are you really going to be like this?

564
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:03,364
Yes, all right. We'll do this.

565
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:05,906
Then give me money,
so I can go eat by myself.

566
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:06,969
What?

567
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:08,005
Money.

568
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:13,827
Is three dollars enough?

569
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:17,631
I was only joking with you,
so why are you taking me so seriously?

570
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:18,820
Okay, we'll do this.

571
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:22,709
See this coin?

572
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:27,204
Heads, you pay for food,
and tails, you don't have to.

573
00:35:27,509 --> 00:35:29,902
-Okay?
-Why must I?

574
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,102
Heads or tails.

575
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:33,829
-Heads...
-Tails!

576
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:39,785
Oh, heads!

577
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:42,584
See, you were destined to pay for dinner.

578
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:45,935
That's not heads, it's tails!

579
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:50,894
What are you talking about?

580
00:35:50,994 --> 00:35:52,109
The number is heads
and the face is tails!

581
00:35:52,189 --> 00:35:56,395
No, General Yi Sunsin is heads,
and the number is tails!

582
00:35:56,495 --> 00:35:58,569
So, you're certain
that the general is heads?

583
00:35:58,909 --> 00:35:59,911
Is there a law that says it?

584
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:01,300
There isn't a law, but...

585
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,923
You've consulted
the Korea Minting Corporation?

586
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:04,698
No, but...

587
00:36:04,798 --> 00:36:06,234
Look here, Jackson.

588
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,930
Let's say that a foreigner
is visiting Korea.

589
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,883
Which is more important?

590
00:36:10,983 --> 00:36:11,925
The face of a general?

591
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:14,158
Or the number, which can be 100 or 500?

592
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:18,710
-The number?
-Right!

593
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,494
On a coin, the most
important thing is the number.

594
00:36:21,594 --> 00:36:23,186
Therefore, the number serves as heads.

595
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:24,262
You got it?

596
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:31,186
Jackson, you're not
very intelligent, are you?

597
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:35,100
Anyway, dinner is on you tonight. Okay?

598
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:37,584
How will you survive without me?

599
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:46,414
This was heads?

600
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:48,555
I've always thought the face
of the coin was heads.

601
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,456
How can I write it better?

602
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,077
What are you working on, Manager?

603
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:08,143
What?

604
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:10,197
No, it's nothing.

605
00:37:16,307 --> 00:37:17,389
"That Woman"

606
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:18,589
Don't be late tonight.

607
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:20,229
Dad's birthday!

608
00:37:21,977 --> 00:37:23,314
Ms Cha, here you go.

609
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:29,664
We've sent your translations
by email already.

610
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:34,469
I've searched for more related articles
and I've translated them too.

611
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:36,229
I thought it might be helpful.

612
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,381
That's thoughtful of you.

613
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:39,772
Thank you.

614
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:44,134
Oh, when you leave for the day,
return these for me.

615
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:45,135
Yes!

616
00:37:47,669 --> 00:37:49,651
But, where to?

617
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:53,232
-Hello. I'm returning these.
-Okay.

618
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:54,311
Have a good day.

619
00:37:57,189 --> 00:37:58,337
Wow!

620
00:37:58,437 --> 00:38:00,339
A library in the company.

621
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:12,005
Yes, Hyejin. I'm heading out now.

622
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:14,545
I'm sorry, but can
we postpone this for two hours?

623
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:17,440
I forgot about a previous engagement.

624
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:19,938
Yes, all right.

625
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:21,356
Yes.

626
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:22,749
I'll see you later.

627
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:33,883
There are a lot of books.

628
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:38,078
There are fairy tales here.

629
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:45,776
"Sparky Looks for Hidden Pictures"

630
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:51,715
This was published
from my father's company.

631
00:38:55,389 --> 00:38:57,807
I really loved this book.

632
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,369
-Why?
-You promise to buy me some tteokbokki...

633
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:24,909
...and then you stand me up?

634
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,256
All right, I'm going.

635
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,325
I said I'll be there!

636
00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:56,386
This is a tie.

637
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:58,125
Give it to your father later.

638
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:01,133
Shouldn't you at least play the part?

639
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:03,248
After all...

640
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,400
...you're his daughter.

641
00:40:07,149 --> 00:40:08,498
Happy birthday.

642
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:10,549
I got you a belt.

643
00:40:10,649 --> 00:40:13,316
Why did you get me a gift?

644
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:15,551
Of course I would.

645
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:17,779
Still, I'm your daughter.

646
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:21,454
I'd prefer it if you visit more often.

647
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:23,544
You don't even come home anymore.

648
00:40:24,795 --> 00:40:26,009
Give me a second.

649
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,589
Yes, President Jin.

650
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:32,989
Go ahead and eat.

651
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:34,663
I'm going to be on the phone for a while.

652
00:40:35,629 --> 00:40:36,533
Yes.

653
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:40,269
So, you don't have time to respond to me

654
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:42,080
but you had the time
to shop for his gift?

655
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:44,937
I was cautioned to fulfill
my duties as a daughter.

656
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:48,572
So, people say that I'm insolent...

657
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:52,363
...but they never describe me as rude.

658
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:56,192
Not only do you seem to have good manners
you seem sociable as well.

659
00:40:57,029 --> 00:40:58,491
Particularly with men.

660
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:00,309
What?

661
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:03,081
I heard that you rented the hotel
and threw quite a party.

662
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:08,418
Are you normally so boisterous?

663
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:14,429
Well, the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

664
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:25,452
I had a birthday party with my friends.

665
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:28,259
Your father is good friends
with the owner of that hotel.

666
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:30,846
It was full of peering eyes and witnesses.

667
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:33,765
Can you please watch yourself in public?

668
00:41:34,797 --> 00:41:37,813
At least play the part, will you?

669
00:41:38,149 --> 00:41:39,789
If you're such a fan of moderation,

670
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:43,926
why don't you keep it moderate
for your plastic surgery?

671
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:48,495
You've gone too far
with the shots this time.

672
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:57,470
Your insolence...

673
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:01,195
...as well as your promiscuity...

674
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:06,883
You are your mother, inside and out.

675
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:11,338
Look.

676
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:14,660
What do you think
you know about my mother?

677
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:17,927
What gives you the right
to talk about my mother like that?

678
00:42:18,027 --> 00:42:19,218
What do you think you're doing?

679
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:20,614
Dad.

680
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:23,685
This woman was insulting my mom.

681
00:42:24,149 --> 00:42:25,307
Honey.

682
00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:29,483
Dad.

683
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:31,433
Who are you calling "this woman"?

684
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:33,000
Apologize to her immediately.

685
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:36,137
Dad.

686
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:38,137
Apologize to her this instant!

687
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:51,103
I've committed an unforgivable crime.

688
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:55,717
If you could find it in your heart
to forgive me...

689
00:42:58,015 --> 00:42:59,935
...I'd be really thankful.

690
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:04,939
Satisfied?

691
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:07,943
I'll get out of your sight now.

692
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,617
You've agreed that it's on you

693
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:42,109
so why don't you let me eat what I want?

694
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:43,644
You're so petty.

695
00:43:44,026 --> 00:43:46,793
Don't call me petty
when I'm paying for this.

696
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:48,577
Gosh.

697
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:51,084
"My Husband"

698
00:43:55,212 --> 00:43:56,909
Goodness!

699
00:43:57,389 --> 00:44:00,207
It takes effort to look
pathetic like that.

700
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:04,462
Jackson, can I have some fish cake?

701
00:44:04,749 --> 00:44:07,885
I think it'll be a waste
if we pass that up now.

702
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:11,187
The ones you don't like are
the ones who always ask for more!

703
00:44:11,909 --> 00:44:14,213
Yes, have your fill.

704
00:44:14,669 --> 00:44:15,720
Thank you!

705
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:20,429
Oh, it's hot!

706
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:24,467
My tongue!

707
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:29,896
That's much better.

708
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:35,825
Why, is there something on my face?

709
00:44:37,629 --> 00:44:38,629
Have your fill.

710
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,150
Yes, thank you.

711
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:50,869
But do you normally survive
on cup ramen, rice balls,

712
00:44:50,949 --> 00:44:52,417
and things like that?

713
00:44:52,909 --> 00:44:55,428
It's the life of a bachelor.

714
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:57,421
Do you live alone?

715
00:44:58,189 --> 00:45:00,151
Are you from the countryside?

716
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:03,269
It burns! My goodness!

717
00:45:04,029 --> 00:45:06,830
I'm so sorry, are you okay?
Were you burned?

718
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,802
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-Come here.

719
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:10,375
I'll do it.

720
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,684
Wait, allow me. I'll do it for you.

721
00:45:13,029 --> 00:45:14,645
Don't touch me there!

722
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:15,989
I'm not touching you!

723
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:18,889
Where are you, I need you right now.

724
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:26,207
Do you have a reservation?

725
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,829
Yes, with Kim Hyejin.

726
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:29,220
Please follow me.

727
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:07,083
Hyejin, where are you?

728
00:46:08,989 --> 00:46:10,069
What? Where?

729
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,946
That hit the spot.

730
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:17,004
I'm always prepared to eat,
so you can buy me food anytime.

731
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:19,669
I take the bus from here.

732
00:46:19,749 --> 00:46:21,000
How do you go home?

733
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:23,469
I'm full,
so I think I'll be taking a stroll.

734
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:25,869
Then, see you tomorrow.

735
00:46:26,389 --> 00:46:27,497
Yes, goodbye.

736
00:46:27,597 --> 00:46:28,630
Thanks for the food.

737
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:36,203
Yes, you've got to be really poor
to be taking advantage of me.

738
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:41,310
Paying back student loans is still
a huge problem even if we find a job.

739
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:44,786
I'll just consider this
as me helping the needy.

740
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:56,618
"Where are you?
I need you right now."

741
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:16,130
"My Wife"

742
00:47:18,149 --> 00:47:19,171
Miss?

743
00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:21,974
Miss?

744
00:47:26,269 --> 00:47:27,403
Where are you right now?

745
00:47:27,503 --> 00:47:29,029
What is this text about?
Is something wrong?

746
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:32,502
Well, the lady here
is extremely drunk right now.

747
00:47:32,602 --> 00:47:33,874
May I know who I'm speaking with?

748
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:36,763
Where?

749
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:40,989
Yes, I'll be there soon.

750
00:47:58,669 --> 00:47:59,935
My head.

751
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:03,293
Why did you drink so much?

752
00:48:03,393 --> 00:48:04,937
You shouldn't drink alone like that.

753
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:09,574
I'm drinking to get drunk,
not to get full.

754
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:11,593
I guess you're right.

755
00:48:13,149 --> 00:48:14,487
Did you see the news today?

756
00:48:14,587 --> 00:48:16,922
It was about global warming...

757
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:20,537
...and I see now that it was about you.

758
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:27,294
I'm saying that you're extremely hot.

759
00:48:28,816 --> 00:48:29,964
It burns!

760
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,070
Was that a little creepy?

761
00:48:35,189 --> 00:48:37,723
I was trying to be funny. Gosh.

762
00:48:37,823 --> 00:48:39,439
It burns!

763
00:48:40,088 --> 00:48:41,651
You're not funny.

764
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:42,810
And your boyfriend?

765
00:48:45,909 --> 00:48:47,262
I'm sure you have one.

766
00:48:48,389 --> 00:48:50,555
But I think you can handle another.

767
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:52,019
Do you want to leave with me?

768
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:53,652
Will you beat it?

769
00:48:53,752 --> 00:48:56,167
You're starting to irritate me.

770
00:48:58,865 --> 00:49:00,719
Let's leave together.

771
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:01,909
To some place more romantic...

772
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:04,043
Why don't you go there alone?

773
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:12,101
You're obviously looking
for a one-night stand

774
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:15,549
so why don't you stop acting so arrogant?

775
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:16,849
Hey.

776
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:20,229
Does your wife
know that you behave like this?

777
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:23,529
If you want to embarrass yourself,
why don't you take off the ring first?

778
00:49:23,629 --> 00:49:24,906
Garbage.

779
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,660
What did you just say to me?

780
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:31,848
Say it to me again.

781
00:49:32,693 --> 00:49:33,945
Who do you think you are?

782
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:39,949
I said that you were
embarrassing yourself!

783
00:49:40,029 --> 00:49:41,402
-No.
-Embarrassing yourself!

784
00:49:41,502 --> 00:49:42,835
My face!

785
00:49:42,935 --> 00:49:44,094
-Stop.
-It's because of guys like him...

786
00:49:44,194 --> 00:49:46,229
...this country doesn't advance!

787
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:47,595
You're nothing but a bum!

788
00:49:47,695 --> 00:49:49,589
-Hey, come here!
-Sir.

789
00:49:49,669 --> 00:49:50,709
Come here!

790
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:52,919
-Let go.
-Let go!

791
00:49:53,019 --> 00:49:54,750
You come here!

792
00:49:55,189 --> 00:49:56,389
-Come here!
-Sir!

793
00:49:56,469 --> 00:49:58,292
Let go! Let go!

794
00:49:59,737 --> 00:50:01,068
That stings.

795
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:03,477
What kind of psychopath was that?

796
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:12,686
-Who are you?
-You don't have to know who I am.

797
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:15,090
Go and apologize to the woman.

798
00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:17,326
I'll give you three minutes.

799
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:21,439
What gives you the right
to give me three minutes?

800
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:22,730
Do I look like a microwave to you?

801
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:25,798
I should be filing charges,
not apologizing to her.

802
00:50:28,149 --> 00:50:31,148
That Crazy Joon! Why is he so difficult?

803
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:34,589
Did he shoot down
all of our ideas at the meeting?

804
00:50:34,669 --> 00:50:38,344
No, I think a few made it through.

805
00:50:38,444 --> 00:50:39,944
-How do you know that?
-What are you saying?

806
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:41,669
I can read him now.

807
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:44,189
Watch his arms during the meetings.

808
00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:46,158
-His arms?
-What about his arms?

809
00:50:47,269 --> 00:50:51,109
You're running out of time,
so go and apologize.

810
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:55,918
Do you hear that barking, too?

811
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:07,357
I despise wasting time for no reason.

812
00:51:08,669 --> 00:51:13,409
When he decides on something,
he rolls up his sleeves.

813
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:15,296
I think it's his habit.

814
00:51:23,445 --> 00:51:25,229
Mister, please let me off here.

815
00:51:26,749 --> 00:51:27,709
Are you okay?

816
00:51:30,272 --> 00:51:31,167
Yes.

817
00:51:31,669 --> 00:51:32,611
Let's go.

818
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:35,738
What's the matter?

819
00:51:39,709 --> 00:51:41,217
Gosh...

820
00:51:42,322 --> 00:51:43,447
Let's leave for now.

821
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:08,775
What's that face?

822
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,182
Excuse me, I'm looking for
a woman who came here alone.

823
00:52:13,282 --> 00:52:15,549
Oh, you're the wife from earlier!

824
00:52:15,629 --> 00:52:16,509
What?

825
00:52:16,589 --> 00:52:18,465
Yes, that's right. I'm the wife.

826
00:52:18,565 --> 00:52:19,806
Where's my friend?

827
00:52:19,906 --> 00:52:21,243
Didn't you see her on your way in here?

828
00:52:21,343 --> 00:52:24,869
Some guy came by and took her away.

829
00:52:25,429 --> 00:52:26,464
A guy?

830
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:29,614
Who could it be?

831
00:52:30,589 --> 00:52:32,640
Was it the man she was kissing
in front of the house?

832
00:52:39,971 --> 00:52:41,982
Write your name
and date of birth right here.

833
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:49,070
Did you change your name recently?

834
00:52:50,326 --> 00:52:51,537
You've spelled your name wrong.

835
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:54,172
Right.

836
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:56,556
I think I got so angry
that I've lost my mind.

837
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:57,548
Hand it over.

838
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:03,629
Mister, don't you need
to be treated as well?

839
00:53:04,149 --> 00:53:05,069
What?

840
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:07,687
I think he's cut himself on the face.

841
00:53:09,629 --> 00:53:10,697
Your face.

842
00:53:15,549 --> 00:53:16,954
It's okay. It's nothing.

843
00:53:17,054 --> 00:53:19,488
No it's not, it might scar!

844
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:23,020
I'm really fine, Miss Kim Hyejin.

845
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:35,425
You've had a tetanus shot,
but don't forget to take your medication.

846
00:53:35,989 --> 00:53:36,997
I'm going to check.

847
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,490
Okay.

848
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:43,198
But why don't you ask me anything?

849
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:45,010
About what?

850
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:49,953
I stood you up
and I was found drinking by myself.

851
00:53:52,669 --> 00:53:54,246
I'm sure something bothered you.

852
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,615
I'm sure it's not fun to talk about...

853
00:53:56,949 --> 00:53:58,612
...so I didn't want to bring it up.

854
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:05,296
I wanted to see you today because...

855
00:54:05,396 --> 00:54:06,298
Follow me.

856
00:54:06,749 --> 00:54:07,778
Where are we going?

857
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:09,972
Thank you.

858
00:54:15,509 --> 00:54:17,979
That's probably full of calories.

859
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,240
You need to eat
if you want to take your medication.

860
00:54:21,761 --> 00:54:24,224
And it'll help with your hangover
because you've had a lot to drink.

861
00:54:24,989 --> 00:54:28,184
Then maybe I'll have a bite?

862
00:54:44,389 --> 00:54:45,840
This doesn't taste like it, either.

863
00:54:48,216 --> 00:54:52,942
Remember I used to be fat?

864
00:54:53,042 --> 00:54:55,736
Hey, you weren't just fat.
You were like a pig...

865
00:54:56,669 --> 00:55:00,426
I mean, you were cuddly.

866
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:08,800
Well, my mom used to feed me this
because she thought I looked gaunt.

867
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,889
I hated to eat it back then...

868
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:15,868
...but I started missing it
after she died.

869
00:55:17,074 --> 00:55:19,664
No matter where I go,
I can't find the same taste.

870
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:24,816
I missed how it tasted.

871
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:27,031
She cooked it for hours...

872
00:55:28,962 --> 00:55:30,722
...in front of the fire.

873
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:34,561
But she can't do that for me anymore.

874
00:55:38,149 --> 00:55:39,785
I guess that's why I missed it.

875
00:55:44,229 --> 00:55:46,795
I think I'm able to say these things
because it's you.

876
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:55,619
It's been a while since I met someone
whom I can be myself with.

877
00:56:01,509 --> 00:56:02,433
Let's eat.

878
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:03,767
Okay.

879
00:56:06,149 --> 00:56:07,007
Oh, right!

880
00:56:07,107 --> 00:56:08,349
Why did you want to meet me earlier today?

881
00:56:08,429 --> 00:56:09,545
You wanted to tell me something?

882
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:22,615
What's this?

883
00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:26,494
It seems to be Ms Min's handwriting.

884
00:56:27,882 --> 00:56:29,971
I saw her writing that earlier today.

885
00:56:30,776 --> 00:56:32,378
"I'm reassigned to Jeju Island."

886
00:56:32,709 --> 00:56:35,170
"The man I'm supposed
to marry hates me meeting other men."

887
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:36,901
"I get fired and go overseas again."

888
00:56:38,383 --> 00:56:40,208
"The entire family
moves out of the country."

889
00:56:40,308 --> 00:56:41,389
What's this all about?

890
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:43,892
Which is the option
that she wants to happen?

891
00:56:45,789 --> 00:56:47,197
Hello, Miss Kim Hyejin.

892
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:50,749
Why are you speechless all of a sudden?

893
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:55,457
Is it hard to talk about?

894
00:56:57,189 --> 00:56:58,328
No.

895
00:56:59,509 --> 00:57:05,669
I felt bad for leaving you
hanging at the hotel...

896
00:57:06,114 --> 00:57:10,104
...so I wanted to buy you dinner.

897
00:57:11,709 --> 00:57:13,241
I thought it was about something else.

898
00:57:14,229 --> 00:57:16,436
You're rather bland sometimes.

899
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:20,174
If I'm bland,
would you like some salt with it?

900
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:23,931
Eat before it gets cold.

901
00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:26,181
Okay.

902
00:57:29,469 --> 00:57:32,961
Yes, you were injured because of me...

903
00:57:34,629 --> 00:57:36,281
...so maybe I shouldn't tell you today.

904
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,319
I'll tell you later.

905
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:43,172
I heard that the world is
only that which you can see.

906
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:48,626
The same might go for human beings.

907
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:53,029
Why isn't she coming?

908
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:54,149
Hey, Hari.

909
00:57:56,589 --> 00:57:58,471
What was that text message about earlier?

910
00:57:58,571 --> 00:57:59,542
Are you okay?

911
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:01,375
What's wrong with your hand?

912
00:58:01,475 --> 00:58:02,419
Were you injured?

913
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:04,588
Hey, what happened? Is it bad?

914
00:58:04,688 --> 00:58:06,029
I fell and injured myself a little bit.

915
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:07,829
This isn't a little bit.

916
00:58:07,909 --> 00:58:09,992
Girl, you should've been more careful!

917
00:58:10,092 --> 00:58:12,053
-I'm fine.
-Hey, let's go inside.

918
00:58:12,509 --> 00:58:14,162
Why did you have to hurt yourself?

919
00:58:14,262 --> 00:58:16,648
"Prescription: Kim Hyejin"

920
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:20,768
When you don't care, you can't see.

921
00:58:25,429 --> 00:58:26,549
Did you make it home safely?

922
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:29,215
Be careful until your hands
are completely healed.

923
00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:31,873
Good night and I'll see you soon.

924
00:58:33,269 --> 00:58:35,450
The more you discover,

925
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,963
the more clearly
you begin to see the person.

926
00:58:40,029 --> 00:58:42,639
Like Hari on that day.

927
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:53,017
Here's the Americano Ristretto
that you've ordered.

928
00:58:53,669 --> 00:58:54,629
Sir?

929
00:58:56,525 --> 00:58:57,457
Sir?

930
00:58:58,349 --> 00:58:59,429
Here's your coffee.

931
00:58:59,509 --> 00:59:00,546
Oh, thank you.

932
00:59:15,189 --> 00:59:16,471
Yes, this is Ji Sungjoon.

933
00:59:17,109 --> 00:59:18,483
You've sent me an email?

934
00:59:18,949 --> 00:59:21,123
I'll check it right away
and call you back.

935
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:30,389
I don't have time to eat with you.

936
00:59:30,469 --> 00:59:32,262
Go straight home, okay baby?

937
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:34,875
Hey, don't go and see Hari either!

938
00:59:34,975 --> 00:59:36,226
You never listen to me!

939
00:59:36,829 --> 00:59:38,536
Kim Hyerin, are you serious?

940
00:59:38,636 --> 00:59:40,563
All right, I'm going. I'll see you there.

941
00:59:41,469 --> 00:59:43,198
Who does she take after?

942
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:47,221
That belongs to me.

943
00:59:56,325 --> 00:59:58,350
Gosh, I can't stand her!

944
01:00:22,777 --> 01:00:24,350
"She Was Pretty"

945
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:27,935
What makes you any better than me?

946
01:00:28,035 --> 01:00:29,549
After neglecting me like this,

947
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:33,069
imagine him finding out
that I'm his first love.

948
01:00:33,149 --> 01:00:34,189
He can never find out!

949
01:00:34,269 --> 01:00:36,313
I should tell him everything!

950
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:38,354
You act like you know Mr Ji.

951
01:00:38,454 --> 01:00:39,782
To be honest...
