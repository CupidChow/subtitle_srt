1
00:00:02,706 --> 00:00:05,106
After we're successful
with the 20th anniversary issue...

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:08,009
...and "The Most" is saved...

3
00:00:09,231 --> 00:00:11,314
...I'm going to propose to you.

4
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:24,379
I'll do whatever it takes to save
"The Most" so I can propose to you.

5
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:32,487
Sungjoon.

6
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:37,938
I've always lived with
the feeling that I had lost you.

7
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,314
I missed you for 15 years...

8
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,189
...and we've finally reunited.

9
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:50,146
I don't ever want to lose you again.

10
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,968
The next 15 years...

11
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:57,256
...and the next 15 years...

12
00:00:58,386 --> 00:00:59,913
...and the next after that.

13
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:05,521
For as long as time allows...

14
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,432
...I want to be with you.

15
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:18,310
Did I overwhelm you?

16
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:26,313
But the truth is...
I'm nervous saying this.

17
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:39,987
I've never been this certain
of anything in my life before.

18
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:45,609
So, I wanted to make sure
I got my feelings across.

19
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:51,350
I have no more reason to hold back.

20
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:55,009
Are you cold?

21
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:00,348
Try this.

22
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:08,714
I hope we really succeed.

23
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:13,876
Like you said...

24
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:19,286
...I really hope you successfully...

25
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:24,571
...save "The Most" magazine.

26
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,819
I really do.

27
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,892
Hello, Director Shin. November 7th?

28
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,534
That's fine by me.

29
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:15,154
Okay, see you then.

30
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:17,389
By the way, how are you holding up?

31
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:20,462
I mean, with the Leonard Kim situation.

32
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:21,465
What about him?

33
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:36,992
Hi, this is the personal manager
of Leonard Kim.

34
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:40,883
I'm sorry to tell you that
the interview with "The Most"

35
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:44,332
has been canceled
for unavoidable reasons.

36
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,516
I'm sorry again.

37
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:47,199
What on Earth...

38
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:56,914
Hello?

39
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:59,456
I just got your message.
What do you mean by that?

40
00:04:01,883 --> 00:04:07,547
Okay, so you're saying that
our interview is canceled?

41
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:15,177
There are rumors going around right now.

42
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:17,739
He's being investigated for marijuana use

43
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,322
and it's going to hit
the front page soon.

44
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:20,493
Didn't you hear?

45
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,825
Did you check with Leonard Kim?

46
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:29,933
What's going on? Is the rumor true?

47
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:32,735
It's hitting the front page next week.

48
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,952
The interview is a no-go.

49
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,051
There goes our chance to place first.

50
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,727
Our last chance.

51
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:00,283
So, our 12-page main interview
is gone for good?

52
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:03,605
-No way.
-What do we do?

53
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:06,470
If we don't place first,
we'll close down, right?

54
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,895
What do we do?

55
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,583
How could this happen?

56
00:05:10,683 --> 00:05:13,862
Then instead of Leonard Kim,
how about Chae Minjung?

57
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:15,463
She's confirmed for a Hollywood movie.

58
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:20,302
She's on location abroad for the movie
and can't meet up with us.

59
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:23,422
Or Go Sungjin, the youngest designer
to debut a New York collection.

60
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:26,518
I thought about him,
but he won't generate enough buzz.

61
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:29,075
In other words,
he's not a trump card for us.

62
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:31,976
Isn't it almost impossible
to get someone on that level?

63
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:34,544
It's public knowledge that we were
going to interview Leonard Kim.

64
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:37,171
Who would agree to be the back-up plan?

65
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:39,655
If we can't find anyone

66
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:42,947
we have to publish without
a main interview?

67
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:47,224
What if we really close down?

68
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:49,052
What about Ten?

69
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:51,035
-What?
-What?

70
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:52,100
Ten?

71
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:56,855
The enigmatic best-selling author
was recently revealed to be Korean.

72
00:05:57,302 --> 00:06:00,194
And the latest novel, "Memory",
is a huge hit.

73
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,942
Who else could generate more buzz?

74
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:05,631
But would Ten agree
to a photo shoot and an interview?

75
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:10,227
If it's Ten, we won't need
a photo shoot or an interview.

76
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:12,450
-Pardon?
-What do you mean?

77
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:17,065
Just an interview in itself would be
enough to be the talk of the town.

78
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:20,969
This could be the very trump card
that we need right now.

79
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:24,095
It would be great if we get Ten.

80
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:26,263
I don't think they'll agree...

81
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:29,798
We have nothing to lose.
I'll contact the publisher.

82
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:32,940
In the meanwhile, come up
with a list of other possibilities.

83
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:38,261
Contact everyone you know.
We need a list of back-ups.

84
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,259
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

85
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,112
Ten?

86
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:50,243
We don't know any private information.

87
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,672
We didn't even know Ten was Korean.

88
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:56,768
Then how have you been contacting Ten?

89
00:06:57,357 --> 00:07:00,416
We exchange manuscripts by email,
and we translate and publish it.

90
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:02,622
All we have is an email address.

91
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:04,784
Which I'm not at liberty to reveal.

92
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:12,195
In the least, can you pass on
my request for an interview?

93
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:14,095
Sure, I can shoot over an email.

94
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:17,442
But don't get your hopes up.
I doubt anything will come of it.

95
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:20,933
Even so, please pass on my request.

96
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,290
And please contact me
if you get a response.

97
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:26,831
Sure.

98
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:37,483
Hyejin, you met with the Art Department?

99
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,423
Yes.

100
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:40,975
How did it go with the publisher?

101
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:44,961
The odds are against us,
and all we can do is wait.

102
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:53,839
What are you doing?

103
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:55,969
You said that I give you strength.

104
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,142
So, look at me.

105
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:59,611
Will 100 seconds do?
Go ahead, look all you want.

106
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:04,955
Don't stress yourself out.

107
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:06,893
We'll find a way.

108
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:16,592
Will we be able to publish
the 20th anniversary issue?

109
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:18,022
We have to.

110
00:08:18,102 --> 00:08:20,173
There's a special article
included this time.

111
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:22,978
Mine.

112
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,549
Cheer up!

113
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:46,484
Han Seol, why are you avoiding me?

114
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:48,555
When did I do that?

115
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:51,155
You didn't pick up all weekend.

116
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:53,161
You've been acting strangely.

117
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:57,939
I think we should reconsider
the whole dating thing.

118
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,496
What?

119
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:05,312
We should rethink our relationship.

120
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,285
Hey, Han Seol!

121
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:11,655
Han Seol!

122
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,152
Hey, Hyejin.

123
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:23,153
Just wondering if you'll be home
for dinner.

124
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:27,073
Oh, you're working late?

125
00:09:28,662 --> 00:09:29,687
Yes.

126
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:31,366
Okay.

127
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,339
You quit the hotelier job?

128
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:44,582
Yes.

129
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:47,547
Why didn't you tell me?

130
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:48,809
Did you grow tired of it?

131
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:52,264
Do you want me to...

132
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:54,543
...look into a different job for you?

133
00:09:57,262 --> 00:09:58,284
No.

134
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:03,461
I need to figure out something for myself.

135
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:07,456
I'm curious how far I can go on my own...

136
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:13,187
...and want to explore
the things I can do.

137
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,586
Hello?

138
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:24,320
Yes.

139
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:28,502
No, I'll be home for dinner.

140
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:32,334
I stopped by to see Hari.

141
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:34,446
I wanted to talk to her.

142
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:38,045
Okay, see you at home.

143
00:10:42,662 --> 00:10:47,574
Tell me if you need my help
or if things get too hard.

144
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:50,948
That won't happen.

145
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,771
If I have a moment of weakness
and call for help...

146
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:58,344
...I want you to reject me, okay?

147
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:01,460
That's how you can really help me.

148
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:14,931
Gosh.

149
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:19,441
I bluffed that I could handle things,
but what now?

150
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:22,175
No, no, no.

151
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:24,716
This isn't the end of the world.

152
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:29,007
That's right. I can do this.

153
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:31,982
I can do this! I can do it!

154
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:38,146
Who is she talking to?

155
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,269
How is there not a single prospect?

156
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:55,895
And soon we'll have some
rookie as our vice-president.

157
00:11:56,622 --> 00:11:58,190
What are you talking about?

158
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:05,780
Rumors are that the chairman's son
is coming next week as the new VP.

159
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:08,398
What? Another rich kid?

160
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:10,875
Haven't we seen this, done that?

161
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:13,117
Why is it always the rich son?

162
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:14,150
That's what I'm saying.

163
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,465
Wait, doesn't that make him
our chief editor's nephew?

164
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:20,486
Do you think he can talk
to his father and save our magazine?

165
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:25,781
If we want to place first,
why not hire a bunch of models?

166
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:29,808
We'll go with a sexy concept.

167
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:31,774
That'll sell like hotcakes.

168
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:34,059
That is so not Most-esque!

169
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:36,222
Let's not lower our standards, please.

170
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:37,238
Sorry.

171
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:38,653
It goes here.

172
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:41,558
He's taking office next week?

173
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,449
I'm running out of time to seduce him.

174
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:46,753
Which one is he?

175
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,384
Poongho the bum?

176
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,475
No way.

177
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,398
Then Shinhyuk?

178
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:08,559
I'll try my hand at Shinhyuk first.

179
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:15,230
Mr Kim! Are you heading home?

180
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,949
Well I'm certainly
not heading back to work!

181
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:20,131
If you don't have plans,
want to grab dinner...

182
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,026
Oh, Han Seol!

183
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:24,838
I see nose hairs peeping out.

184
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:25,952
What?

185
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:28,731
Good thing no one else saw that.

186
00:13:29,382 --> 00:13:31,925
Aren't you grateful? You must be.

187
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:33,867
Snip those hairs. You owe me dinner!

188
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:38,945
What the...

189
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:42,221
Why is he talking about my nose hairs
when he has that ugly beard?

190
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,260
Gosh, how annoying!

191
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:47,090
Do I really want to do this?

192
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:50,390
Yes, I should keep trying.

193
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:54,573
This is seriously so annoying.

194
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:56,873
Any word from Ten?

195
00:13:57,422 --> 00:14:00,117
Ten must be traveling.
The email hasn't been read yet.

196
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:02,164
It's probably best if you just give up.

197
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,477
If you hear anything at all,
please contact me.

198
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:05,892
Okay.

199
00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:20,245
Ms Cha.

200
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:23,295
Sorry, I have to postpone the material...

201
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,765
...that I promised to send by today.

202
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:31,317
The Art Department is asking about
the layout of the main interview.

203
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,484
What do I tell them?

204
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,399
Advertising Department
is also hounding me.

205
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,569
They need to know our subject
so that they can do the PR.

206
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:38,707
What do I do?

207
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:40,468
We have no idea ourselves

208
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:42,678
and now we have to deal
with the other departments.

209
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:48,973
Good work today, everyone.

210
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,715
Let's call it a night.

211
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:52,313
Yes?

212
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:59,748
But the Art and Advertising Departments
need confirmation right now...

213
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:02,481
I'll talk to both teams myself.

214
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,250
Everyone, go home.

215
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,815
We'll have a meeting tomorrow morning.

216
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:10,545
But Mr Ji...

217
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:13,464
Mr Ji.

218
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:18,583
What on Earth is he thinking?

219
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:21,823
He knows that there's
no point sitting around like this.

220
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:26,784
What happens to him
if our department closes down?

221
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,065
Is he going back to New York?

222
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,535
Headquarters is way too cutthroat.

223
00:15:31,942 --> 00:15:35,219
They won't take him back.

224
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:37,973
But he'll probably go back
to the States, right?

225
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:40,835
He would have no reason to stay here.

226
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:55,781
Jackson!

227
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:57,986
Mr Kim.

228
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,396
Remember my favourite saying?

229
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:02,375
It's not over till it's over.

230
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:06,778
It's not over yet,
so don't worry too much.

231
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:08,668
I won't.

232
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:11,746
See you tomorrow.

233
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:32,462
What? What is it?

234
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,031
My friend...

235
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:40,278
...wants to set me up.

236
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:43,616
-And?
-So...

237
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:46,957
...should I say yes?

238
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:50,167
Go ahead.

239
00:16:59,302 --> 00:17:00,658
I'll ask one last time.

240
00:17:01,742 --> 00:17:06,683
Should I go on this blind date?

241
00:17:07,622 --> 00:17:09,283
I said, go ahead.

242
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:24,066
Hey, it's me.

243
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:26,904
I'll...

244
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:29,667
...go on the date.

245
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,435
Bye.

246
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:08,011
Fine, meet another girl.

247
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:17,171
"Shinhyuk"

248
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:21,652
What are you doing? That's gross!

249
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:23,952
What's gross?

250
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:26,565
It's fine, it's yours after all.

251
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:29,971
Why does your head hurt?

252
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:31,102
Maybe you're coming down with a cold?

253
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:32,157
Let me see.

254
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:35,902
I got you several different medications.

255
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:38,443
This is for migraines,
this one's for the flu.

256
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:41,112
Joonwoo!

257
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,523
Joonwoo.

258
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:06,528
Joonwoo...

259
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:08,231
Joonwoo!

260
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:12,013
What? Stop, stop! Sir, stop the bus!

261
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:13,466
You think this is a cab?

262
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:15,040
Get off at the next stop.

263
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,494
The drivers always stop
the bus in dramas.

264
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,262
Han Seol!

265
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:22,180
Joonwoo.

266
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,792
Meet me at the next stop!

267
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:26,868
Joonwoo!

268
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:36,451
Han Seol.

269
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:39,822
Joonwoo, don't do it.

270
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,280
Oh, I think I pulled something.

271
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,511
Don't go on that blind date.

272
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:46,010
Don't meet another girl.

273
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:50,382
Fine, I won't do it.

274
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:52,056
I won't meet another girl.

275
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:53,982
You're the only one for me.

276
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:55,562
I like you so much.

277
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,582
Me, too. I like you a lot.

278
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:00,882
Then kiss me.

279
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,706
Okay!

280
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:04,338
Again.

281
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:05,585
Sure!

282
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:09,789
Now, enough of the kiddie stuff.

283
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:42,024
Hey, it's the kiss maniac. Hi.

284
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:44,127
Stop teasing me.

285
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,475
Where are you?

286
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:47,603
Are you still at work?

287
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:49,916
No, I'm by the river. Working out.

288
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,062
Okay, I'll call you when I get home.

289
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:54,100
Bye.

290
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:12,567
Ji Sungjoon, let's play!

291
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:15,290
Let's play, Sungjoon.

292
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:17,571
Hyejin.

293
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:20,685
First one to make 10 points wins.
Loser buys drinks. You in?

294
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:26,025
Start!

295
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:39,989
Come on, try to steal it.

296
00:21:58,659 --> 00:21:59,990
Oh, not bad.

297
00:22:02,995 --> 00:22:04,566
Hello, Chief Editor!

298
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:10,219
-Hey...
-Steal.

299
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:15,652
You cheated!

300
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,712
Are you okay?

301
00:22:19,812 --> 00:22:21,551
-Put it in, put it in.
-Hold on.

302
00:22:31,857 --> 00:22:32,975
Let's go to my place.

303
00:22:37,062 --> 00:22:38,750
-Here.
-Thank you.

304
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,833
Hold on.

305
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:51,225
What are you doing?

306
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:52,742
Give me your hand.

307
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:54,913
My hand? Why?

308
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:56,662
I'm going to trim your nails.

309
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:01,934
Oh, I guess I haven't
trimmed them in a while.

310
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:05,124
It's fine. I'll do it when I get home.

311
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:07,925
I want to do it for you.

312
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:09,034
Come on.

313
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:18,773
You barely have any time
to even trim your nails.

314
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:22,510
So, I'll do it for you.

315
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:36,647
I have no doubt that...

316
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:39,889
...you did your very best.

317
00:23:40,822 --> 00:23:43,385
What happened was out of your control...

318
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:46,102
...so please don't blame yourself.

319
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:55,088
I believed that I was doing
the right thing...

320
00:23:57,735 --> 00:23:59,093
...but now I know better.

321
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:03,196
My decision might not have been
the best decision.

322
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,358
I have regrets, and so I feel bad.

323
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:18,959
Regret is inevitable,
but don't blame yourself.

324
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:26,209
You did everything you could.

325
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:36,816
All we can do is end things well, right?

326
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,538
Here, show me your nails.

327
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:46,687
Perfect.

328
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,345
Your hands are so pretty.

329
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:56,406
Give me your hand.

330
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:08,582
We're going to scrap the main interview.

331
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:10,513
-Pardon?
-Scrap it?

332
00:25:10,613 --> 00:25:12,051
-No way.
-But Mr Ji.

333
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:13,053
Mr Ji.

334
00:25:13,153 --> 00:25:16,702
We're publishing the 20th anniversary
issue without a main interview?

335
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,705
It will definitely affect our sales.

336
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:22,075
But we don't need
an interview to make a good issue.

337
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:27,505
Keep working
on the articles you're writing.

338
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:30,235
And think of any special articles

339
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:33,006
or topics that you've
always wanted to write.

340
00:25:33,422 --> 00:25:39,245
It makes sense to fill the issue
with the things that we enjoy most.

341
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:42,462
I do like the idea,
but isn't it too risky?

342
00:25:43,302 --> 00:25:46,513
But if we don't place first,
it'll be the end of "The Most" Korea.

343
00:25:51,662 --> 00:25:54,161
Any word from Ten?

344
00:25:54,862 --> 00:25:56,689
Right, what happened to Ten?

345
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:57,622
No word back?

346
00:25:57,982 --> 00:26:00,463
My lovely teammates!

347
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:03,067
Such worry, worry, worry.

348
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:05,314
This is not Most-esque at all.

349
00:26:05,862 --> 00:26:09,243
I happen to agree fully with his idea.

350
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:12,851
Less worry, more fun, okay?

351
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:14,911
Seize the moment! Enjoy the present!

352
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:17,154
This may be our final issue!

353
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:21,367
Shouldn't it be the most Most-esque ever?

354
00:26:21,862 --> 00:26:24,613
Don't worry about being discontinued.

355
00:26:25,193 --> 00:26:29,103
Who knows?
There are such things as miracles.

356
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:31,077
Good luck!

357
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:44,431
What do you think?

358
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:46,458
Do you like what you wrote?

359
00:26:47,742 --> 00:26:48,920
It's not bad.

360
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:51,062
Then rewrite it.

361
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,178
Yes, ma'am.

362
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:57,382
How's this?

363
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,123
-That's...
-No good, no good.

364
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:00,951
Oh, you startled me!

365
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:02,356
Delivery.

366
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:04,432
What? Delivery.

367
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:05,682
Did we order this?

368
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:07,062
Did I order it?

369
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:08,531
I think you have the wrong place.

370
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:11,913
I ordered it. Let's eat.

371
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:13,948
Yes!

372
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:16,043
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

373
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:17,443
So good.

374
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:19,465
Chew carefully.

375
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:20,622
Slow down.

376
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:22,220
Yum, so good!

377
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:24,709
Stop being so obvious, please!

378
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,670
Why are you hitting him?

379
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,824
Are you okay?

380
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:29,780
Don't hit my Joonwoo.

381
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:33,957
Don't hit my Seol.

382
00:27:37,582 --> 00:27:39,790
That picture is pixelated.

383
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:41,253
You're right.

384
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,929
Eunyoung, below that.

385
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,252
The caption is missing.

386
00:27:45,352 --> 00:27:47,465
The color of the one next
to that needs to be adjusted.

387
00:27:47,942 --> 00:27:50,400
-Wasn't that photo a B cut?
-You're right.

388
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,302
Check that one.

389
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:55,740
E is missing. E, E.

390
00:27:56,102 --> 00:27:57,440
-Hyejin.
-Yes?

391
00:28:02,622 --> 00:28:03,898
Do you like this draft?

392
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:08,251
I think it's good.

393
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:09,988
I like your edits.

394
00:28:10,342 --> 00:28:15,050
It's not a professional article,
but it's refreshing and unique.

395
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,420
You've gotten a lot better, Hyejin.

396
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:19,582
Touch it up a little
and we can publish it.

397
00:28:19,662 --> 00:28:20,790
Really?

398
00:28:21,382 --> 00:28:24,109
You're starting to look
like a real reporter.

399
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:27,547
Thank you, thank you so much.

400
00:28:42,182 --> 00:28:43,148
This is good.

401
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:45,431
We can send this right to print.

402
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:48,862
There are a lot of fun articles
this time around.

403
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:51,069
Everyone was excited to write
about the things they wanted.

404
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:54,462
You're right.

405
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:56,738
I wish we had done this sooner.

406
00:28:57,422 --> 00:28:59,162
It's very Most-esque.

407
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:02,103
Excuse me.

408
00:29:02,982 --> 00:29:03,996
Ms Cha?

409
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:06,209
Yes?

410
00:29:12,742 --> 00:29:13,878
Thank you for everything.

411
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:15,462
And I'm sorry.

412
00:29:18,622 --> 00:29:20,823
It isn't over yet, Mr Ji.

413
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:23,763
We might end up placing first.

414
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:35,557
"She Was Pretty"

415
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:48,861
This is the final draft.

416
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:57,162
Once it goes over to print,
it's finally over.

417
00:29:57,942 --> 00:30:01,535
Is this really the end of "The Most"?

418
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:05,366
So, we're bound to be discontinued?

419
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,909
What are you talking about?
Life is full of surprises.

420
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:13,225
Who knows? We might beat "New Look".

421
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:17,269
There's no way to tell
until the results come in.

422
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:21,792
I'll take that.
I'll drop it off at the printers.

423
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:25,540
You'll go yourself?

424
00:30:27,422 --> 00:30:28,352
Yes.

425
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:32,825
How about celebrating with a team outing?

426
00:30:33,302 --> 00:30:34,504
-What?
-An outing?

427
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:42,037
Is something wrong?

428
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:44,022
Well, the thing is...

429
00:30:44,102 --> 00:30:50,926
It feels kind of awkward to hear
you proposing a team outing.

430
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:52,432
Is that so?

431
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:57,477
I'll join you after dropping this off.

432
00:30:57,577 --> 00:30:58,866
Pick a place and call me.

433
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,110
It's all on me tonight.

434
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:05,843
See you later.

435
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:07,582
See you.

436
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:15,523
Why the long faces?

437
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,757
Perk up and pick a place.

438
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:20,345
Mr Ji is paying tonight.
Let's put a dent in his credit card.

439
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,669
Yes, something really expensive.

440
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:24,261
-Steak!
-Lobster.

441
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:25,651
Let's eat chicken!

442
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,641
No more chicken.
I've eaten enough for a lifetime.

443
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:28,902
Lobster! Let's eat lobster.

444
00:31:28,982 --> 00:31:29,966
-Sushi.
-King crab.

445
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:32,202
-Lobster.
-No, let's eat chicken!

446
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,889
I think we're good to print

447
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:40,860
but Advertising will
probably do a final check.

448
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,724
"The Most, December Issue"

449
00:31:43,462 --> 00:31:45,940
Why did you come yourself, sir?

450
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:51,318
This issue is special.
Please handle it with care.

451
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:35,415
Bravo!

452
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:51,988
I approve, Shinhyuk.

453
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:54,662
Throw some more, Shinhyuk.

454
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:56,476
Stop it.

455
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,886
You're killing the mood.

456
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:04,302
Have you seen the hyena that scavenges
at the foot of the mountain?

457
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,575
The hyena searches for
the dead to ease its hunger.

458
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:10,303
I no longer want to be a hyena
I want to be a leopard.

459
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:15,572
I want to be a leopard that lives
on the snow-covered Kilimanjaro peak.

460
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:38,273
Oh, my! He's here! Our Mr Ji is here!

461
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:40,733
Sing us a song. Sing, sing!

462
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,487
Mr Ji!

463
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:47,846
Mr Ji! Mr Ji! Mr Ji!

464
00:33:47,946 --> 00:33:49,172
No, but I...

465
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:10,698
Funny.

466
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:12,523
Please, turn it off.

467
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,710
He's the one singing.

468
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:22,129
So, why am I embarrassed?

469
00:34:48,343 --> 00:34:49,968
So cool.

470
00:35:33,222 --> 00:35:34,076
What?

471
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:35,852
Back to the office?

472
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:54,296
Gosh, I'm so tired.

473
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:55,851
So tired.

474
00:35:57,348 --> 00:35:59,419
Joonwoo, pass me the medicated patch.

475
00:35:59,902 --> 00:36:00,858
Medicated patch.

476
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:03,611
Here you go.

477
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:07,628
I'm sick of this month after month.

478
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:10,145
Where's the money and glory in this?

479
00:36:10,245 --> 00:36:12,142
You know you have a choice here.

480
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:14,254
You can just quit.

481
00:36:14,782 --> 00:36:16,808
Who said that I hate it?

482
00:36:17,582 --> 00:36:18,494
You guys know me.

483
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:22,902
Once I'm hooked, I bulldoze forward.

484
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:25,134
-Yes, we know.
-That's you.

485
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:31,303
I saw "The Most" magazine for
the first time while in high school.

486
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,748
It opened my eyes to a new world.

487
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:35,733
I was hooked.

488
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:39,532
I never looked back since.

489
00:36:40,102 --> 00:36:43,225
I went to fashion school,
became a fashion assistant.

490
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:45,879
I wanted to join "The Most" so much

491
00:36:45,979 --> 00:36:48,475
that I lied to my parents
that I was studying abroad.

492
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:49,822
Instead I worked as an assistant here.

493
00:36:49,902 --> 00:36:52,863
My dad found out and shaved my head.

494
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:54,502
-Really?
-I remember!

495
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:55,685
You should've gone to a temple then.

496
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:57,349
You wore hats all the time.

497
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,742
I love it when people ask me what I do.

498
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,862
"Where do you work", they ask.

499
00:37:02,942 --> 00:37:03,925
-"The Most".
-"The Most".

500
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:04,975
"The Most"!

501
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:07,182
Don't you love answering?

502
00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:09,222
I feel so proud.

503
00:37:09,302 --> 00:37:10,497
Yes, you're right.

504
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:12,394
Every deadline...

505
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:16,833
...I tell myself I'd be crazy
to do this the next month.

506
00:37:17,294 --> 00:37:19,203
Yet I'm still here.

507
00:37:19,902 --> 00:37:22,886
The insanity is strangely addictive.

508
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:25,342
We go through hell every month

509
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:29,538
but isn't it exhilarating in a way?

510
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:33,355
Or is it just me?

511
00:37:33,782 --> 00:37:34,982
I think we all know that feeling.

512
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:35,999
Workaholic.

513
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:39,233
Actually, I would say that
you've got a problem.

514
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:40,463
Come here!

515
00:37:41,513 --> 00:37:43,886
It's addictive, you have to admit.

516
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:45,366
You're hilarious.

517
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:47,435
I'd have to agree.

518
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:05,386
Oh, my Most!

519
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:08,057
Where is the most Most-esque?

520
00:38:08,157 --> 00:38:11,502
Where can I find my Most?

521
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:12,572
Here!

522
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:17,767
Chief Editor,
the new VP is your nephew, right?

523
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:18,852
Yes.

524
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:21,716
Can't you talk to him about saving us?

525
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:24,269
Save us!

526
00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:27,993
Oh, cuties.

527
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:31,522
I'm a salaried editor.

528
00:38:31,622 --> 00:38:33,316
No, no, no.

529
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:38,045
-Please save us.
-Save us!

530
00:38:38,145 --> 00:38:39,410
Where did Jackson go?

531
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,572
I think you should save us.

532
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:43,476
Who? Everyone?

533
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:44,440
Yes.

534
00:38:45,902 --> 00:38:47,399
Where's my phone?

535
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:50,307
What are you doing here?

536
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:02,206
Nothing...

537
00:39:04,502 --> 00:39:06,757
I'm so sleepy.

538
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:10,375
I can barely keep my eyes open.

539
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,557
I imagine you must be exhausted.

540
00:39:14,702 --> 00:39:15,898
You think so?

541
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:25,358
Is it okay if I lie here?

542
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,010
Yes, get some sleep.

543
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:46,660
The responsibility is mine
to protect the team.

544
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:52,810
I have to do everything I can
because they're my responsibility.

545
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:56,358
"Latest edition's score graph"

546
00:40:05,855 --> 00:40:07,213
He collapsed at the airport.

547
00:40:07,662 --> 00:40:09,354
He's not made of steel.

548
00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:11,428
Of course his body can't handle
the workload.

549
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:25,141
You poor thing.

550
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:29,055
You poor, poor thing.

551
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:39,752
You did well.

552
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:44,270
Don't blame yourself.

553
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:49,525
You did so well.

554
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:45,058
Hey. You stayed up all night?

555
00:41:48,582 --> 00:41:51,503
There are so many jobs out there,

556
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:53,807
and I can't find a single one for myself.

557
00:41:54,902 --> 00:41:56,541
This really sucks.

558
00:41:58,464 --> 00:41:59,456
Forget this!

559
00:42:00,502 --> 00:42:02,226
I'm going to bed, Hyejin.

560
00:42:09,502 --> 00:42:10,690
A list of jobs?

561
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:14,899
"Hotelier"

562
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,549
Found one.

563
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:23,701
-Hello, Mr Kim.
-Jackson! Jackson!

564
00:42:24,102 --> 00:42:26,742
This is terrible! This is crazy!

565
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:29,357
How do I even start to explain?

566
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:31,554
What? What's going on?

567
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:34,537
I can't tell you over the phone.
I have to tell you in person.

568
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:36,142
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

569
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:38,339
Brace yourself, okay?

570
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:40,075
What? Wait, Reporter Lunatic...

571
00:42:41,742 --> 00:42:44,625
What could it be?

572
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,222
What is it? What's going on?

573
00:42:49,302 --> 00:42:50,819
Get in! There's no time to lose!

574
00:42:51,105 --> 00:42:52,622
Tell me what's wrong!

575
00:42:52,702 --> 00:42:54,189
There's no time!

576
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:55,954
-Jackson, get in!
-But...

577
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:05,410
How do I tell you this?

578
00:43:05,902 --> 00:43:07,350
Jackson, don't be shocked.

579
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:11,365
You're scaring me. What's going on?

580
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:13,957
I'm dead serious right now.

581
00:43:14,057 --> 00:43:16,300
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

582
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:19,697
Otherwise, I can't tell you. Okay?

583
00:43:23,622 --> 00:43:26,475
I promise I won't tell anyone.
What is it?

584
00:43:26,942 --> 00:43:30,238
Jackson, the truth is...

585
00:43:38,262 --> 00:43:39,309
I'm so bored.

586
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,721
What?

587
00:43:43,382 --> 00:43:45,102
I mean, the final draft is done.

588
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:49,177
And I don't have anyone to play with.

589
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:51,411
So, let's have fun together today, okay?

590
00:43:51,511 --> 00:43:52,761
Seriously!

591
00:43:52,861 --> 00:43:54,700
I thought it was about something serious!

592
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:56,642
I can't believe I fell for it again.

593
00:43:57,022 --> 00:43:57,942
Stop the car.

594
00:43:58,022 --> 00:44:00,776
Oh! I do have life and death news.

595
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:02,957
What news?

596
00:44:03,662 --> 00:44:04,976
I am dying of hunger.

597
00:44:06,742 --> 00:44:09,326
So, let's eat!

598
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:11,789
Let's go! In style!

599
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:20,550
Jackson, Jackson!

600
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,094
They just added marinated meat!

601
00:44:22,194 --> 00:44:24,921
It's grade A meat, Jackson!

602
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:26,162
Come on, hurry!

603
00:44:28,057 --> 00:44:29,850
What's he doing?

604
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,142
Look, watch me.

605
00:44:31,222 --> 00:44:32,785
Unsheathed!

606
00:44:36,062 --> 00:44:37,439
Did you see? Did you?

607
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:38,404
Yes, I did.

608
00:44:38,504 --> 00:44:39,474
Excuse me!

609
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,542
Do you have pickled radish?

610
00:44:44,135 --> 00:44:45,022
Pardon?

611
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:47,734
Pickled radish is good for
cleaning the palate, you know?

612
00:44:49,217 --> 00:44:51,017
I'll bring some right over.

613
00:44:53,382 --> 00:44:56,127
Who asks for pickled radish at a buffet?

614
00:44:58,102 --> 00:45:00,144
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

615
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:03,702
The best pickled radish is
the ones that you feed to me.

616
00:45:03,782 --> 00:45:05,554
You have hands.

617
00:45:11,422 --> 00:45:14,723
Gosh! What's with you?

618
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:23,136
So good!

619
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:24,566
Unbelievable!

620
00:45:27,195 --> 00:45:28,549
Thank you for the meal.

621
00:45:28,649 --> 00:45:30,382
Next on the itinerary.

622
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:33,731
What now? Can't I go home?

623
00:45:34,102 --> 00:45:35,511
Wow, you're such a betrayer!

624
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:39,205
No time for me now
that you have a boyfriend?

625
00:45:39,582 --> 00:45:41,159
Today is a special day.

626
00:45:41,259 --> 00:45:43,041
I know, you're especially bored.

627
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:47,039
Bingo! Which is why we need
to have fun today.

628
00:45:47,382 --> 00:45:52,688
Something super spectacular!
It'll be a roller coaster ride!

629
00:45:52,788 --> 00:45:53,742
Let's go!

630
00:45:53,822 --> 00:45:56,742
Oh, scary! Scary!
I don't do roller coasters.

631
00:45:56,822 --> 00:45:58,303
But it's so much fun.

632
00:45:58,403 --> 00:46:00,640
Put your hands up. Put your hands up!

633
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:05,229
Put your hands up!

634
00:46:10,362 --> 00:46:13,079
Let's go! Let's go!

635
00:46:23,662 --> 00:46:25,405
That was so much fun.

636
00:46:26,022 --> 00:46:28,177
Jackson, one more go?

637
00:46:29,262 --> 00:46:30,311
Jackson?

638
00:46:34,702 --> 00:46:35,980
My legs are jelly.

639
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,651
Are you a kid?
Why are you scared of roller coasters?

640
00:46:40,462 --> 00:46:42,912
I told you that I can't ride them!

641
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:45,822
Let go of the fear and enjoy it.

642
00:46:46,142 --> 00:46:47,940
I promise you it'll be fun.

643
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:51,413
What? What's that?

644
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:52,810
That looks super fun!

645
00:46:54,942 --> 00:46:58,425
Gosh! He's like a little kid
in a candy store.

646
00:47:10,942 --> 00:47:14,996
So much fun. Jackson, isn't it fun?

647
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:18,262
Hi!

648
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:30,945
So cute.

649
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,102
How can you fall for it every time?

650
00:47:38,182 --> 00:47:40,902
Will you please stop
scaring me all the time?

651
00:47:42,582 --> 00:47:43,570
Gosh.

652
00:47:45,022 --> 00:47:46,656
That looks fun!

653
00:47:50,622 --> 00:47:51,902
I'll get you back.

654
00:48:09,422 --> 00:48:12,408
Oh, no! He's out cold!

655
00:48:13,462 --> 00:48:15,735
Mr Kim! Mr Kim!

656
00:48:15,835 --> 00:48:17,704
Oh, no, what do I do?

657
00:48:17,804 --> 00:48:18,898
Jackson!

658
00:48:22,622 --> 00:48:24,902
Did you really think I fainted?

659
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:28,183
Who do you think I am? You?

660
00:48:28,928 --> 00:48:31,526
Oh my goodness, such fun!

661
00:48:36,022 --> 00:48:37,530
Gosh, he always gets me.

662
00:48:43,142 --> 00:48:44,169
Wasn't it fun today?

663
00:48:44,269 --> 00:48:46,059
I wish every day was like today.

664
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:49,810
You're more hyped up than usual today.

665
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,722
I told you, it's a special day.

666
00:48:52,822 --> 00:48:54,102
What's so special about it?

667
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:58,549
You'll find out tomorrow.

668
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:01,312
What? What do you mean?

669
00:49:01,412 --> 00:49:03,290
Oh! What's that?

670
00:49:10,662 --> 00:49:11,582
There you go.

671
00:49:12,502 --> 00:49:14,283
Well? Do I look good?

672
00:49:14,902 --> 00:49:16,840
I guess. You look like a thimble.

673
00:49:17,862 --> 00:49:19,782
-How much?
-10 dollars.

674
00:49:19,862 --> 00:49:21,847
-Give him 10 dollars.
-What?

675
00:49:21,947 --> 00:49:23,807
This is your present to me. Okay?

676
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:25,389
Thanks, I'll treasure it.

677
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:27,207
-Have a good evening.
-Wait, but...

678
00:49:35,382 --> 00:49:36,342
Here.

679
00:49:36,422 --> 00:49:37,369
Thank you.

680
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:38,785
Have a good evening.

681
00:49:41,102 --> 00:49:42,732
It was a crazy day.

682
00:49:43,622 --> 00:49:45,683
It feels like one big blur.

683
00:49:46,142 --> 00:49:48,662
Be honest.
It was exceptionally fun, wasn't it?

684
00:49:48,742 --> 00:49:49,622
Right? Right?

685
00:49:49,702 --> 00:49:53,241
Yes, it was exceptionally fun.

686
00:49:55,422 --> 00:49:58,738
By the way, Jackson,
I cancel what I said before.

687
00:49:59,382 --> 00:50:00,262
What?

688
00:50:00,342 --> 00:50:03,850
I want to cancel what I said
about not being friends with you.

689
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:07,228
I've thought about it,
and we're just friends.

690
00:50:07,328 --> 00:50:10,390
Really good friends. Right?

691
00:50:12,862 --> 00:50:18,911
Yes, you're right.
We're really good friends.

692
00:50:19,502 --> 00:50:23,434
Oh no, I wish I were your classmate.

693
00:50:23,534 --> 00:50:26,404
Then I'd be your first love.

694
00:50:26,504 --> 00:50:27,347
What?

695
00:50:27,742 --> 00:50:30,783
Just kidding. Cancel that.
It was a joke.

696
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,329
Between friends.

697
00:50:34,462 --> 00:50:39,404
I should've just kissed you that day
that I confessed my feelings.

698
00:50:39,982 --> 00:50:42,150
What? What are you?

699
00:50:42,702 --> 00:50:45,896
Just kidding. Cancel that.
It was a joke.

700
00:50:45,996 --> 00:50:47,720
We're just friends.

701
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:50,510
Stop being silly and go home!

702
00:50:52,862 --> 00:50:55,488
I should get going.

703
00:50:56,942 --> 00:50:57,957
See you tomorrow.

704
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:01,424
Take care, Jackson.

705
00:51:02,462 --> 00:51:03,369
What?

706
00:51:03,702 --> 00:51:06,637
You sound like we're never
seeing each other again.

707
00:51:07,822 --> 00:51:08,905
I'm off.

708
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:13,382
Jackson.

709
00:51:13,462 --> 00:51:14,387
Yes?

710
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:16,645
Did I ever tell you?

711
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:19,726
I really like you.

712
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:23,522
Not in that romantic,
boy-likes-girl sort of way.

713
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:28,831
I like you as a person, Jackson.

714
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:33,757
I like you, Kim Hyejin, for who you are.

715
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:40,395
That came out of nowhere.

716
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:43,087
Thanks for everything.

717
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,751
I had fun...

718
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:48,257
...thanks to you.

719
00:51:54,422 --> 00:51:56,918
Take care. Bye.

720
00:52:00,942 --> 00:52:01,955
Bye.

721
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:47,765
"Inauguration of
Jinsung Magazine's Vice-president"

722
00:52:49,622 --> 00:52:53,081
Mic test. One, two, one.

723
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:56,458
"Inauguration of
Jinsung Magazine's Vice-president"

724
00:52:57,742 --> 00:52:59,086
Hello, this is the print shop.

725
00:52:59,822 --> 00:53:01,242
Oh, "The Most"?

726
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:04,094
Yes, we're beginning
the binding work today.

727
00:53:07,342 --> 00:53:08,344
Pardon?

728
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:16,351
It's finally D-day.

729
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:25,562
Hello?

730
00:53:26,422 --> 00:53:28,949
What do you mean someone
asked you to stop printing?

731
00:53:29,982 --> 00:53:31,182
Who told you to stop?

732
00:53:31,262 --> 00:53:35,682
Someone from "The Most" just called
and told me to stop the binding work.

733
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:38,155
It didn't seem like a prank call.

734
00:53:38,622 --> 00:53:39,787
Do you know what's going on?

735
00:53:41,782 --> 00:53:43,503
I'll find out and call you back.

736
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,024
"Mr Ji, I will do the interview
with the Most."

737
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,436
"From Ten"

738
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:00,146
Ten?

739
00:54:02,942 --> 00:54:06,810
Amazing. This book is so engaging.

740
00:54:07,582 --> 00:54:11,582
Do we have to go to
this inauguration ceremony?

741
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:14,029
Why do all employees have to attend?

742
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:16,122
So, the rich kid can show off?

743
00:54:16,222 --> 00:54:18,551
Let's go for the Chief Editor's sake.

744
00:54:19,182 --> 00:54:20,653
And see what this kid looks like.

745
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:27,829
Speaking of which where are
Kim Poongho and Kim Shinhyuk?

746
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:30,494
Senior Poongho is probably
napping somewhere.

747
00:54:42,982 --> 00:54:46,805
Going down. Seventh floor.
The door is closing.

748
00:54:57,102 --> 00:54:58,076
Eunyoung.

749
00:54:59,902 --> 00:55:01,543
You're at work, not the library.

750
00:55:02,622 --> 00:55:05,925
It's so fun that I can't put it down.

751
00:55:06,622 --> 00:55:07,781
Wow, amazing.

752
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:14,079
Where did Shinhyuk and Poongho go?

753
00:55:14,662 --> 00:55:17,291
You'll find out soon enough.

754
00:55:17,391 --> 00:55:20,778
We'll begin the inauguration ceremony

755
00:55:20,878 --> 00:55:24,374
of Jinsung Magazine's new vice-president.

756
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:33,654
Wow, amazing.

757
00:55:33,754 --> 00:55:36,575
A word from the vice-president himself.

758
00:55:40,702 --> 00:55:41,829
But... that's...

759
00:55:42,142 --> 00:55:43,544
-That's...
-Jooyoung...

760
00:55:44,862 --> 00:55:46,016
That's...

761
00:55:46,918 --> 00:55:47,906
I can't believe this.

762
00:56:04,582 --> 00:56:05,718
Good morning,

763
00:56:05,818 --> 00:56:10,703
I'm Kim Poongho, the new
vice-president of Jinsung Magazine.

764
00:56:13,502 --> 00:56:15,361
What is Poongho doing up there?

765
00:56:15,742 --> 00:56:18,211
That's what I'm saying!
What's he doing?

766
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:19,394
How?

767
00:56:22,502 --> 00:56:26,682
He looks very Most-esque today.

768
00:56:45,742 --> 00:56:46,805
Nice to meet you.

769
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:48,791
I'm Ji Sungjoon from "The Most" Korea.

770
00:57:03,142 --> 00:57:05,566
Nice to meet you. I'm Ten.
