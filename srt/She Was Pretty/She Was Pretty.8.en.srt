1
00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:05,262
What the...

2
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:06,679
What the what?

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,470
So what's the token of your apology?

4
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:10,554
What do you keep looking at?

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,721
What's the matter?

6
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,721
I feel cramped, let me go!

7
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:22,487
Don't watch that.

8
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:24,602
Someone's drunk
and relieving himself in public.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,095
That's gross, don't look.
Let's get going, okay?

10
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:28,176
Gosh.

11
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:29,965
I'm not going to look. Let me go.

12
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:31,004
Let's go.

13
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:32,835
I want to be your girlfriend now...

14
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:37,548
...not just your childhood friend.

15
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:41,154
I want to know...

16
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:44,368
...how you feel about it...

17
00:00:45,802 --> 00:00:46,928
...and about me.

18
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:00,956
I guess you don't feel the same way.

19
00:01:01,403 --> 00:01:03,297
You're hesitant.

20
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:06,884
You must feel differently.

21
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:14,637
Let's go.

22
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:19,014
And I thought you really had a sister!

23
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:20,721
I'm so angry!

24
00:01:20,802 --> 00:01:23,123
Stop following me now!
I'm going inside, so beat it!

25
00:01:23,204 --> 00:01:24,169
Jackson,

26
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:27,751
about the friend that you live with.

27
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:31,499
Is she the one you described
as your other half?

28
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:33,828
Why are you asking
about Hari all of a sudden?

29
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:37,421
No particular reason. Let's talk.

30
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,788
I spoke with her briefly
the last time I dropped you off...

31
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:49,886
...because you had too much to drink.

32
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,797
The two of you must be awfully close.

33
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,409
Since you describe her as your other half.

34
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:57,679
We're more than just close.

35
00:01:58,236 --> 00:01:59,721
Our moms were best friends

36
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:01,700
so we were always with each other
since we were born.

37
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:03,621
We were friends from birth.

38
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:06,223
The best thing I've ever done

39
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:08,387
was becoming friends with Hari.

40
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:12,333
You know how there's
always a bit of jealousy,

41
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:13,765
even between close friends?

42
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:15,095
It's human nature.

43
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,689
But whenever something good happens to me

44
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,438
she's 100 percent happy for me,
like my mother would be.

45
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:25,053
That's Hari.

46
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:29,805
Oh, and she's really pretty, too.

47
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:33,814
See? I'm not joking, right?

48
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:37,512
And her body is like a Barbie doll.

49
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:42,012
Are you falling for her? Are you?

50
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:46,642
No, she's off limits.

51
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,963
Jackson, I think
you're a hundred times prettier than her.

52
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:51,053
Are you trying to tease me again?

53
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:52,637
Stop talking nonsense and go away!

54
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:54,383
Hey, Jackson.

55
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,257
About your friend...

56
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:06,429
Never mind.

57
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:07,845
See you.

58
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:08,970
Dream about me.

59
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:14,539
He's fallen for her already.

60
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,494
Why did I show him her picture?

61
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:27,192
I'm sure it was somewhere here.

62
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:38,693
Ji Sungjoon, what are you doing?

63
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:42,219
After we head to middle school,
we won't be able to come back here.

64
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,178
We'll have to leave our mark.

65
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:46,345
All finished.

66
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,580
What's that? Is it you and me?

67
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:49,595
Yes.

68
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,928
When we graduate from middle school

69
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:53,626
let's come back to see this, okay?

70
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,845
All right!

71
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:56,429
-You little runts!
-Sungjoon, run!

72
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:57,934
Who told you to write on the walls?

73
00:03:58,015 --> 00:03:59,140
It's here!

74
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,749
Hyejin, it's still here! Look here.

75
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:03,925
Don't you remember this?

76
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,893
Wow, I didn't expect it'd still be here!

77
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:09,286
That's really amazing.

78
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:10,803
Oh Hyejin, remember when...

79
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:12,095
Can we...

80
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,864
...stop talking about the past?

81
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:19,695
Instead of talking about our past...

82
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:22,987
...why don't we talk about the present?

83
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:28,679
I'm not used to spending time
reminiscing about the past.

84
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:30,580
The present is...

85
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:35,595
...more important to me right now.

86
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:49,057
What are you doing?

87
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:50,322
Give me a second.

88
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,178
There.

89
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,765
All right, Hyejin.

90
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:07,117
Let's stop talking about the past...

91
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,794
...and talk about us now.

92
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:12,348
You and I, here and now.

93
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:18,831
One moment.

94
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,071
Hey, Min Hari!

95
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:10,107
What the...

96
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,649
What are you doing here?

97
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,940
What's the matter with you?

98
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:21,938
You won't see me or pick up
my calls anymore.

99
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,304
Why else?

100
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:28,989
That means you're out.

101
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:32,380
You couldn't take a hint
and waited in front of my house?

102
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:33,553
Who is he?

103
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:35,125
What does the chump do?

104
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:39,963
Who are you calling a chump?

105
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:43,464
Watch what you say about him!

106
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:46,922
If you say anything like that again,
I'll kill you myself!

107
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:54,092
Hyejin?

108
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:58,119
Hari, have you met someone?

109
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,906
-Did you? Really?
-Well...

110
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,633
Hyejin, about that...

111
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,088
That's great news!

112
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:06,547
Congratulations, Hari!

113
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:17,860
Do you remember telling me this?

114
00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:22,050
That your own mother left you...

115
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,527
...and that you didn't trust men, either.

116
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:28,755
So, you refused to believe in true love.

117
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:36,428
It has been on my chest
since I heard you said that.

118
00:07:37,464 --> 00:07:40,547
I wonder what kind of guy made my friend

119
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,669
fall head over heels for him?

120
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,672
He deserves an award.

121
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,088
What kind of person is he?

122
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,380
I'm curious.

123
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:50,130
I'm so curious!

124
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,880
Why are you being so bashful?

125
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:57,975
Now I get why
you looked so worried these days.

126
00:07:58,297 --> 00:08:00,817
We'll need to celebrate this occasion.

127
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:04,064
Wait right here.
I'll go and get a few beers.

128
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:10,047
Hari,

129
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:14,675
I'll root for your love.

130
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,631
I'm always cheering for you!

131
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:21,464
How exciting!

132
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:25,713
I'm sorry, Hyejin.

133
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,953
Just give me two months.

134
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,339
I'll stay with Sungjoon for two months.

135
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:37,713
Just two months.

136
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,380
Then...

137
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:45,505
Then I'll tell him.

138
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:48,796
I'll tell him everything.

139
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:56,214
-Are you home?
-What the...

140
00:08:58,713 --> 00:09:02,309
What... what are you doing here?

141
00:09:03,172 --> 00:09:05,562
Gosh, you've got some nice clothes.

142
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:07,713
Can you give me some?

143
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:12,341
What are you doing here?

144
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:15,547
I was in the area when
I was reminded of my underwear.

145
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,116
I'm here to get my underwear back.

146
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:22,547
What's with you and underwear?

147
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,713
Forget that, and hand over my card key.

148
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:26,130
You're late today.

149
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,672
Did you have a date tonight?

150
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:30,047
I've heard that
you have a beautiful girlfriend.

151
00:09:30,672 --> 00:09:33,284
I don't think we're close enough
to be discussing this.

152
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,913
How much do you know
about your girlfriend?

153
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:36,339
What did you say?

154
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,909
Because not everything is
as it seems to appear.

155
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:40,511
Look here, Mr Kim.

156
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:42,428
What is it you want to tell me?

157
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:47,466
There's something I want to tell you,
but I'm holding back right now.

158
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:50,404
I don't know if it's my place
to say anything.

159
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:54,672
I'm leaving.

160
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:56,255
Good night.

161
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:59,283
-Oh, right.
-Gosh.

162
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:00,796
I'll enjoy this.

163
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:02,755
Good night.

164
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:31,922
Did you sleep well?

165
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:34,214
Should we see each other tonight?

166
00:10:34,712 --> 00:10:37,339
There's a movie I wanted to watch,
so let's go see that.

167
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:41,255
It's the last showing tonight.

168
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:42,882
Let's have breakfast!

169
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:44,380
Why are you on the phone
so early in the morning?

170
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:47,214
Is it your guy?

171
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:50,672
Hello? Hyejin.

172
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:52,593
Congratulations to the two of you!

173
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,297
I'd like to meet you sometime!

174
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,214
What was that?

175
00:10:58,172 --> 00:10:59,144
"Sungjoon"

176
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,131
Hyejin?

177
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,963
Why did you hang up in such a hurry?

178
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:07,778
What were you talking about?

179
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:10,422
I'll give you some privacy.

180
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:15,380
I've fallen in love

181
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:27,796
My precious Nion,
I hope you grow big and healthy!

182
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,547
I should glue this together.

183
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,297
This is much too difficult.
It's too hard.

184
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,380
B looks a little too fat.

185
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:40,775
Ahreum.

186
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:43,775
I can't choose. It's too close.

187
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:45,469
I choose B. No...

188
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,799
A.

189
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,786
Gosh. But I like B.

190
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:51,190
It's difficult choosing
between two good ideas.

191
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:54,422
Ladies and gentlemen!

192
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,008
Attention!

193
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,270
Okay, I will now ask you a question.

194
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:03,162
I need a response in half of a second.

195
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:04,326
That's the rule.

196
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,482
This is a Chinese restaurant!

197
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:08,550
All of you are about to order.

198
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:10,214
Noodles or spicy soup? Answer!

199
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,297
-Noodles.
-Spicy soup.

200
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,297
-Spicy soup.
-Noodles.

201
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,547
-Spicy soup.
-Noodle soup combo!

202
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:15,091
-Disqualified!
-Noodles.

203
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:17,332
I'm on a diet, so I'll pass.

204
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:20,339
Everyone look forward. Wow!

205
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:23,343
There lies a decision in front of you,
A or B. Answer!

206
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:25,258
-B!
-B.

207
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:26,214
-A.
-B.

208
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:27,172
-A.
-B.

209
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,088
-A.
-Okay, B it is.

210
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:30,591
Go with B!

211
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:33,205
Yes. Your heart says O,
but you want to say X.

212
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,633
Your heart says X,
but you want to answer O.

213
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,755
We're hesitating, like this.

214
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:38,755
Why?

215
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:41,218
Because we don't really know what we want.

216
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:45,091
So, decide without thinking!
That's your true feelings!

217
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:46,380
Understand, okay?

218
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:47,464
See you later.

219
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:52,838
-There you go!
-What...

220
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,124
Are you on your way to return these?

221
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:56,550
It's okay, I'll do it.

222
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:58,633
No, my hands feel empty.

223
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:00,464
-Let's go.
-No, give it back.

224
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,505
-I insist.
-Really, it's okay.

225
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:03,589
Give it to me!

226
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,540
My sole!

227
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:17,343
How can you wear a shoe
until it wears out like this?

228
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,813
If I glue it back on, I can wear it
for another year!

229
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,436
Forget this.

230
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:24,723
Jackson, get on my back.

231
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:26,719
I'm okay. I can walk.

232
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:31,455
Come on, get on.
You're going to hurt your feet.

233
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:33,598
I said I'm fine.

234
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:37,672
Stop being stubborn and get on.

235
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:39,841
What was that sound?

236
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:41,130
Did you fart?

237
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:43,793
Jackson, I think my pants split open.

238
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,796
What?

239
00:13:46,047 --> 00:13:47,333
They did split open!

240
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:48,675
Jackson.

241
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:50,964
Cover me before people see my underwear.
Hurry!

242
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,130
Hurry up!

243
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:53,088
Jackson, Jackson!

244
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:54,550
Jackson, hurry!

245
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:56,047
Hurry up and get on my back!

246
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,250
Let's go.

247
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:02,342
Thank you very much.

248
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:14,815
What kind of props are these?

249
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:19,091
It's for the photo shoot
for the 20th anniversary issue

250
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:21,061
but we'll need to exchange them.

251
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:22,396
I see.

252
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:27,404
But are you still going to tell Mr Ji...

253
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:29,755
...what you wanted to tell him?

254
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:32,763
Yes, we're meeting afterwards.

255
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:35,922
If you hadn't showed up
at the business trip

256
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,464
I would've told him everything by now.

257
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:39,339
You're no help at all.

258
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:44,706
Do you see him as a friend...

259
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,431
...or something more?

260
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:48,841
What?

261
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:52,172
Are you sure
that you see him as a friend...

262
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:54,880
...and nothing more?

263
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:58,172
No, well...

264
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:01,214
Your heart says O, but you want to say X.

265
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:03,047
Your heart says X,
but you want to answer O.

266
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,715
We're hesitating, like this.

267
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:05,963
Why?

268
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:31,963
What's this?

269
00:15:34,214 --> 00:15:36,963
Are you insane or what?

270
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:07,505
Hyejin.

271
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:11,299
What happened to you?

272
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,130
I'm sorry. I got in a fender-bender
on my way here.

273
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,880
An accident?

274
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:17,963
Are you hurt?

275
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,130
Does it ache anywhere?

276
00:16:19,464 --> 00:16:22,088
You should've gone straight to
the hospital instead of coming here!

277
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:23,713
Let's go to the hospital now.

278
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:26,128
I'm fine.
It wasn't that big of an accident.

279
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:28,674
But I'm sorry that
we couldn't watch the movie.

280
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,230
You said that it's
the final show time tonight.

281
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:31,907
How can you worry
about the movie right now?

282
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:35,421
You should've been more careful!
How did you get into an accident?

283
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:37,464
You can never know with car accidents.

284
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:40,562
You may not realize it now,
but there could be an after-effect.

285
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:45,255
I'm sorry.

286
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,796
I won't worry you anymore.

287
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:50,831
I'll pay attention to what
I'm doing from now on.

288
00:16:51,838 --> 00:16:56,034
You won't need to worry
about me ever again.

289
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:05,616
I'll send you photographs of the site.

290
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:06,922
Yes.

291
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,172
Your mail.

292
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,464
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

293
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:32,702
Try this.

294
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:35,117
I don't eat breakfast, take it with you.

295
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:37,380
But, still...

296
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:40,299
I need your approval on these.

297
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,532
Mr Kim, take this
if you haven't had breakfast.

298
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:45,796
I've had breakfast,
but I haven't had dessert yet.

299
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:48,505
Thank you.

300
00:17:57,172 --> 00:17:58,130
What?

301
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:00,236
Do you have something else to tell me?

302
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,957
No, I don't.

303
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,547
Why is he in a bad mood?

304
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,196
I wonder if something's going on.

305
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,073
Hyejin.

306
00:18:57,712 --> 00:18:58,796
Sungjoon.

307
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:02,550
Wait right here.

308
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:03,902
What is it?

309
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:07,016
Ta-da!

310
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:12,172
Let's watch the movie
we missed the other day.

311
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,158
I found out that this place is
showing the movie until tonight.

312
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,830
I had to dispatch all of
my resources to find this place.

313
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:23,005
You brought me here
to watch this movie with me?

314
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:24,304
Let's go inside.

315
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:38,917
You're not having fun?

316
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:41,258
Yes, I am.

317
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:45,005
Go on, you wanted to see this.

318
00:19:56,214 --> 00:19:58,589
Isn't the male lead a good actor?

319
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:01,464
That elevator scene was so good!

320
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:02,924
What? Elevator?

321
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:08,557
Oh, the elevator scene?

322
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:11,261
Yes, I think it was good, too.

323
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:14,575
Didn't you like the movie?

324
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:18,584
No, I watched it with you,
so of course I liked it!

325
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:22,422
Thank you!

326
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:35,838
"Revised and proof-read by Kim Hyejin"

327
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,088
It's there!

328
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:44,044
My name is really in a magazine!

329
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:47,631
My name is really in a magazine!

330
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:49,632
Dad, Mom, are you proud of me?

331
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,196
Revised and proof-read by Kim Hyejin?

332
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:53,922
Goodness!

333
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:56,759
It really is my daughter's name!

334
00:20:57,135 --> 00:20:59,321
It looks too small in fine print.

335
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:01,920
That there is my daughter!

336
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:21,172
Oh, it's go time!

337
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:27,880
Oh, it's go time!

338
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,005
Oh, it's go time!

339
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:44,672
Mr Ji?

340
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:46,589
Good morning!

341
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,631
Ouch!

342
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,631
What are you doing?

343
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:55,922
The light is about to change.

344
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:56,963
Run!

345
00:21:57,464 --> 00:21:58,631
Hurry, run!

346
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:02,672
We almost got caught
in the red light, didn't we?

347
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:05,047
Oh, right!

348
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:07,681
After the photo shoot ends tonight

349
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:09,432
can I buy you dinner?

350
00:22:09,757 --> 00:22:11,299
I can't do anything too expensive...

351
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,297
Actually, since you didn't charge me
for the 1,000 dollar glass frame...

352
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,589
I'll buy you anything you want!

353
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:21,088
And my name is in this month's issue.

354
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:28,422
You're getting a call.

355
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:33,145
Then go ahead and take that call.
I'll see you later.

356
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,755
"Hyejin"

357
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:51,985
The gap has been reduced.

358
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:55,043
But we're still second in sales

359
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,052
in subscription rates
and advertisement revenue.

360
00:22:58,718 --> 00:23:01,507
Now you have two more chances left.

361
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,835
I hope you show us that
we haven't overrated you.

362
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:08,410
Okay, I got it.

363
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:17,497
Oh, I'm sorry.

364
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:20,005
I thought you'd be
in the studio right now.

365
00:23:20,622 --> 00:23:22,713
Mr Kim Poongho wanted me
to give this to you.

366
00:23:24,172 --> 00:23:25,214
Leave it there.

367
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,007
Well, are you okay?

368
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:30,214
You seem really tired.

369
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,713
"This Month's Issue Score Graph"

370
00:23:58,258 --> 00:23:59,508
That's so pretty.

371
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:00,838
Wow, look at that!

372
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,903
Awesome.

373
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,466
Isn't it beautiful?

374
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:06,581
Brand names are sought
after for a good reason.

375
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:07,663
I know.

376
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:10,267
There's something unique
about James Taylor.

377
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:14,757
Jackson, let's have dinner together
after we're done here.

378
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:15,715
It's on me.

379
00:24:15,796 --> 00:24:17,788
You already know that today's
an important day for me.

380
00:24:18,464 --> 00:24:21,239
Do you really have to tell him that?

381
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,214
Why do you keep bringing it up?

382
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,589
Please stay out of my business.

383
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:30,409
I'm posting this online!

384
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,073
Put away your cameras!

385
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:37,005
Are you spectators here?

386
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:38,561
Don't you have any common sense?

387
00:24:38,755 --> 00:24:41,547
Don't you know we have just a month
until the 20th anniversary edition?

388
00:24:41,796 --> 00:24:44,216
If you post that online
and someone rips it off

389
00:24:44,297 --> 00:24:45,505
who is going to take responsibility?

390
00:24:46,547 --> 00:24:48,224
Put the dress away right now.

391
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:49,922
Yes, sir.

392
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:51,547
Stop!

393
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,755
What do you think you're doing?

394
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,882
What kind of fashion assistant
touches garments

395
00:25:03,963 --> 00:25:05,547
with an armful of accessories?

396
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,911
If you damage the outfit...

397
00:25:09,255 --> 00:25:10,674
...will you take responsibility?

398
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:13,380
I forgot to take off my accessories.

399
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:15,875
I want someone else
in charge of wardrobe...

400
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:19,108
...and you can march straight
out of that door,

401
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:20,986
away from this studio.

402
00:25:27,755 --> 00:25:28,880
Lights!

403
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:33,672
Why is he so angry?

404
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:35,187
Gosh, I hate him.

405
00:25:36,422 --> 00:25:37,505
What is it?

406
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,297
See, he isn't in a good mood today.

407
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:46,253
Let's just have dinner together.

408
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:50,130
Did you know it's my birthday today?

409
00:25:50,672 --> 00:25:52,229
Wow, you lie again!

410
00:25:52,505 --> 00:25:55,214
You said we were born on the same year,
but that you're born in January.

411
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:56,589
-Did I say that?
-Hyejin.

412
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,047
Yes?

413
00:26:02,755 --> 00:26:04,130
Take the outfit into the dressing room

414
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:06,433
and hold onto it until the model arrives.

415
00:26:06,576 --> 00:26:07,500
Yes.

416
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,558
Yes, I'll move it right now.

417
00:26:10,963 --> 00:26:12,838
Parking is horrible at this studio.

418
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:15,769
What's this? Are you loafing around?

419
00:26:16,464 --> 00:26:18,963
Of course not!
I'm looking after this dress...

420
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:21,505
I need to check the model's
makeup with Ahreum...

421
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:24,496
...so move my car for me.

422
00:26:24,577 --> 00:26:25,835
It's parked on the ground lot.

423
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:27,547
But...

424
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,172
I...

425
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:32,922
Gosh.

426
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:43,464
Good luck at the photo shoot.

427
00:26:44,214 --> 00:26:45,172
Okay.

428
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:50,755
What's the matter, Miss Min?

429
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:52,271
Does your stomach hurt?

430
00:26:52,352 --> 00:26:53,370
Yes.

431
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,632
I've been getting this piercing
feeling in my gut lately.

432
00:26:56,713 --> 00:26:59,743
Let me get you some medicine
for your stomach pain.

433
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:01,966
Will you? Thanks.

434
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:02,963
Anytime.

435
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:23,888
How did you get in here?

436
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:25,587
Stop what you're doing now.

437
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:28,589
-What are you talking about?
-Please stop, Min Hari.

438
00:27:30,297 --> 00:27:31,505
Stop pretending to be Kim Hyejin.

439
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,589
So, you're the reporter
who works with Hyejin?

440
00:27:42,297 --> 00:27:46,016
I somehow found myself
between the three of you...

441
00:27:47,222 --> 00:27:49,348
...but when I found out,
I couldn't turn a blind eye.

442
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:56,744
Hari, the two of them
are going to meet tonight.

443
00:27:58,826 --> 00:28:00,326
And Jackson...

444
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,810
I mean, Hyejin is
planning to tell Mr Ji everything.

445
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:15,339
Isn't that the worst way
for him to find out about you?

446
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:21,464
The best way to inflict
the least amount of pain is...

447
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:25,768
...for you to come clean.

448
00:28:26,836 --> 00:28:30,784
Then all three of you
will be able to manage.

449
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:33,422
I'm asking you.

450
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,515
I'm cold.

451
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,258
Is it raining outside?

452
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:50,666
Yes, it started pouring all of a sudden.

453
00:28:50,838 --> 00:28:53,261
-Here's your car keys.
-Thanks.

454
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:56,335
What's up with your hair?

455
00:28:58,297 --> 00:28:59,380
What?

456
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:01,214
Oh, my hair.

457
00:29:02,838 --> 00:29:06,631
My hair is naturally curly,
so it gets frizzy in the rain.

458
00:29:07,672 --> 00:29:09,297
You look ridiculous.

459
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:13,172
Your hair!

460
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:14,380
Hair?

461
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:16,437
My hair!

462
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:25,505
It's go time!

463
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:27,422
It's go time!

464
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:29,339
It's go time!

465
00:29:30,297 --> 00:29:31,712
It's go time!

466
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:34,255
Why do you always say that
at a green light?

467
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,088
Because it's telling us to go.

468
00:29:47,712 --> 00:29:49,026
Wait a minute...

469
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:50,551
What's wrong with this dress?

470
00:29:51,214 --> 00:29:52,713
-Oh, my.
-Why, what's wrong?

471
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,547
What's going on here?

472
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,589
-It wasn't me!
-I don't know.

473
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:08,838
I guess we'll have to cancel the shoot.

474
00:30:12,713 --> 00:30:13,880
Who was it?

475
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,033
Who was in charge of the wardrobe?

476
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:21,130
It was me.

477
00:30:25,713 --> 00:30:26,796
You again?

478
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,380
Why is it always you?

479
00:30:31,672 --> 00:30:32,796
What are you supposed to be?

480
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:35,172
Who are you?

481
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:39,464
Why do you keep getting on my nerves!

482
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,922
I'm sorry.

483
00:30:43,713 --> 00:30:46,519
I was negligent.

484
00:30:49,963 --> 00:30:50,963
Get out of my sight.

485
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:56,589
Stop driving me crazy, and...

486
00:30:58,547 --> 00:30:59,589
...just disappear.

487
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:03,339
I don't ever want to see you again.

488
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:06,796
You're...

489
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:09,672
...fired.

490
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:40,432
I was responsible for that.

491
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:44,381
The dress was so pretty...

492
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:48,849
I really wanted to try it on.

493
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:50,380
What are you talking about?

494
00:31:51,631 --> 00:31:52,713
Who are you?

495
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:55,687
She's a new model from the agency.

496
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,047
I think she came here
to introduce herself.

497
00:31:58,963 --> 00:32:01,047
I only wanted to wear it once.

498
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:03,838
I'm so sorry.

499
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,422
Why, you...

500
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:06,963
How could you?

501
00:32:07,547 --> 00:32:09,712
Do you realize
what's happened because of you?

502
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:13,589
I understand.

503
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:15,589
I got it, so you can leave now.

504
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:19,422
Mr Ji, what about Hyejin?

505
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:21,796
Let's call it a day.

506
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:43,149
Kim Joonwoo, is it already over?

507
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,631
The photo shoot has been postponed.

508
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:50,508
The dress was damaged,
so we have to wait until it's repaired.

509
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:51,922
What happened to the dress?

510
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:56,422
Where's Jackson?

511
00:32:57,992 --> 00:32:59,425
I have to tell him.

512
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,047
I have to be the one to tell him.

513
00:33:03,284 --> 00:33:04,616
Get your phone, Ji Sungjoon.

514
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,047
Pick up your phone!

515
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,310
Get the phone! Pick up!

516
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:14,172
"Hyejin"

517
00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:41,838
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

518
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:45,214
Did you call me?

519
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:48,382
Hyejin?

520
00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:51,088
Hari.

521
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,712
Today...

522
00:33:56,922 --> 00:33:58,963
...Ji Sungjoon fired me.

523
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,339
He never wants to see me again.

524
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:05,631
He told me to disappear.

525
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:08,968
What are you talking about?

526
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:12,713
Where are you?

527
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:29,796
Hyejin.

528
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:32,464
Hey!

529
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:35,937
It's Hari, my sweet Hari!

530
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,796
Sit down.

531
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,922
I must have fooled myself.

532
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:49,874
I thought we got to know
each other during the business trip...

533
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:54,589
...and I thought he was
the Sungjoon that I used to know.

534
00:34:56,672 --> 00:34:59,505
I thought we could go back
to the way it was.

535
00:35:01,712 --> 00:35:06,373
So, I was prepared to tell him
everything tonight...

536
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:11,490
...but then I got fired.

537
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,601
He didn't even hesitate
a moment to fire me.

538
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:24,340
I can't believe I was a fool.

539
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:28,759
I'm such an idiot, right?

540
00:35:40,963 --> 00:35:42,528
I'm sorry, Hyejin.

541
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:43,631
What?

542
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:45,880
Why would you be sorry?

543
00:35:46,297 --> 00:35:47,963
I'm so sorry.

544
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:00,214
You're such a crybaby.

545
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:02,806
You cried when I was hired...

546
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:04,963
...and now you're crying
because I'm fired?

547
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:13,505
He was beginning to complicate things...

548
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,340
...so at least
I don't have to deal with him anymore.

549
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:18,422
So, stop crying!

550
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:20,796
You'll ruin your pretty face.

551
00:36:27,712 --> 00:36:29,505
Isn't that your guy? Pick it up.

552
00:36:32,672 --> 00:36:35,297
"Sungjoon"

553
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:37,505
I don't want to pick it up.

554
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:40,712
I won't.

555
00:37:03,712 --> 00:37:07,646
So, every time I look at my badge...

556
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:12,880
I'm thankful and it fills me with joy.

557
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:27,149
Hyejin, what am I going to do?

558
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:32,838
What are we going to do?

559
00:37:44,672 --> 00:37:48,005
Hyejin, I need this translated...

560
00:37:48,086 --> 00:37:49,993
Right, she's not here anymore.

561
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:53,261
She was really good at translating.

562
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:55,924
Didn't Crazy Joon go overboard?

563
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:57,505
Just because he was in a bad mood.

564
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:59,297
I feel so bad for Hyejin.

565
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,380
But how did she handle all of this work?

566
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:07,841
I know, right?

567
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:10,005
Did we always have this much work to do?

568
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:12,712
I miss Hyejin.

569
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:15,130
I wonder what she's doing.

570
00:38:25,547 --> 00:38:26,672
Hello?

571
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,183
Yes, hello.

572
00:38:28,508 --> 00:38:31,550
I'm one year older than your age limit

573
00:38:31,631 --> 00:38:34,422
so I wanted to ask
if I could still submit my resume.

574
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:36,814
Yes.

575
00:38:37,672 --> 00:38:38,713
I see.

576
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:43,209
Yes. I understand.

577
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:47,639
Mr Boo, did you hear the news?

578
00:38:47,966 --> 00:38:49,841
Kim Hyejin was cut from the editing team

579
00:38:49,922 --> 00:38:51,617
so shouldn't we bring her back?

580
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:54,258
I've heard the news

581
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:57,589
but we gave the other team
the right to reinstate her

582
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,796
so my hands are tied.

583
00:39:01,094 --> 00:39:03,571
Seolbi, is my excel spreadsheet ready?

584
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:06,656
Give me a minute.
I'm putting on some makeup.

585
00:39:08,922 --> 00:39:13,172
"She Was Pretty"

586
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:24,398
Since we're starting from square one,
I thought there would be improvements.

587
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:27,188
At this rate, do you think we'll have
the 20th anniversary edition ready?

588
00:39:27,922 --> 00:39:29,589
Do any of you have ideas?

589
00:39:29,963 --> 00:39:31,255
Anything at all?

590
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,566
-If not, I'll guess I'll...
-How about a fairy tale concept?

591
00:39:35,464 --> 00:39:37,799
That's been done hundreds of times.

592
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,464
Moreover for our special edition?

593
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:42,587
I'm not talking the same old thing.
I'm talking about a fresh new angle.

594
00:39:42,668 --> 00:39:45,049
Focusing on the background characters
instead of the main characters.

595
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,174
Background characters?
How would you do that?

596
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:48,589
Don't you know the musical "Wicked"?

597
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:50,880
That green witch from Oz
was the main character.

598
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:54,424
We can focus on supporting characters

599
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:56,079
instead of the famous ones like that.

600
00:39:56,297 --> 00:39:58,214
We can feature various
background characters.

601
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:02,047
It's fresh.

602
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,880
When I saw Cinderella as a child

603
00:40:03,963 --> 00:40:07,109
I kind of sympathized
with the step sisters.

604
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,190
Shouldn't we hear
their side of the story, too?

605
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:13,007
Yes, and the princess
who falls asleep in the forest?

606
00:40:13,088 --> 00:40:14,627
There's something fishy about that.

607
00:40:14,963 --> 00:40:18,380
A guy she's never met before comes by
and kisses her while she's asleep.

608
00:40:18,464 --> 00:40:21,892
She should've slapped him
instead of saying okay!

609
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:26,339
Why don't we redefine
the main leads as well?

610
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:30,966
For instance, we can
dress up the Seven Dwarfs

611
00:40:31,047 --> 00:40:33,422
to represent various parts
of Snow White's sexiness.

612
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,753
Snow White can wear
a leather bustier and hot pants.

613
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:39,710
And it looks really good on her!

614
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:41,297
This sounds really fun!

615
00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:43,547
What do you think, Mr Ji?

616
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:47,877
Let's not limit ourselves to
only fairy tales and extend the scope.

617
00:40:48,101 --> 00:40:50,601
A concept showing that
if you shift the spotlight...

618
00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:55,553
...the supporting characters
can also become leads.

619
00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:59,130
Then let's proceed with this idea,
and develop it by teams.

620
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:01,755
-Good work everyone!
-Good job.

621
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:03,047
Good work.

622
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:16,631
What's this?

623
00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:18,631
Why don't you take a look at it first?

624
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:21,898
"Kim Hyejin"

625
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,921
If lost and found, please return
and you can expect good fortune!

626
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:27,214
I've seen it,

627
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,214
so what do you want me to do about it?

628
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:32,547
You're so impatient.

629
00:41:37,755 --> 00:41:39,880
"You're the only hero?
I'm the hero, too!"

630
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:42,562
To be honest, it wasn't my idea.

631
00:41:43,922 --> 00:41:45,255
It's Kim Hyejin's idea.

632
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:48,589
If we proceed with this concept...

633
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:51,818
...we should bring her back.

634
00:41:57,005 --> 00:41:58,963
Didn't she refuse to come back,
even though we asked her to?

635
00:41:59,047 --> 00:42:01,494
That was when Miss Cha asked her.

636
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:05,262
Since you're the one who
misunderstood and overreacted...

637
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:08,508
...if you were to ask her personally,
she might reconsider.

638
00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:11,878
So, you want me to apologize
and bring her back?

639
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:15,631
What kind of company apologizes
and begs interns

640
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:18,589
to come back
when it's against their will?

641
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:24,171
Let's forget the entire thing
and think of a new concept.

642
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:26,966
Is something wrong with my eyes?

643
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,880
I thought you were a rational person

644
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:33,491
but why aren't you ever
rational with Kim Hyejin?

645
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,589
It's like you have feelings for her.

646
00:42:39,712 --> 00:42:40,880
Look here, Mr Kim.

647
00:42:40,963 --> 00:42:42,172
Let me ask you one thing.

648
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:46,172
If another assistant
made the same mistake that day

649
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:48,388
would you have fired her
on the spot as well?

650
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:50,547
If you're going to continue,
you can leave my office.

651
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:51,922
I need an answer from you.

652
00:42:52,755 --> 00:42:54,547
Are you sure you don't have...

653
00:42:56,713 --> 00:42:58,297
...any feelings for Kim Hyejin?

654
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:02,464
Your heart says O, but you want to say X.

655
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:05,963
Your heart says X,
but you want to answer O.

656
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:07,796
We're hesitating, like this.

657
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,422
You're hesitating.

658
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:14,761
You don't know what you're talking about.

659
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,229
Who do you think you are?

660
00:43:16,547 --> 00:43:19,005
Why are you involving yourself with her?

661
00:43:20,255 --> 00:43:23,234
Because I like her.

662
00:43:25,464 --> 00:43:27,047
I like Kim Hyejin.

663
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:29,963
Is that good enough for an answer?

664
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:49,172
Jackson!

665
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,464
Mr Lunatic!

666
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,513
Oh, this was your house!

667
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:58,804
I'm on assignment right now to document
"The beautiful roads of Seoul."

668
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:01,354
This alleyway is kind of beautiful,
is it not?

669
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:06,505
Okay, I'll let you get on with it.

670
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:10,963
Why can't you just come back?

671
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:12,880
You know it's just Mr Ji who overreacted.

672
00:44:12,963 --> 00:44:14,872
Everyone is waiting for you, Jackson.

673
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:15,882
I'm not going back.

674
00:44:15,963 --> 00:44:17,774
I feel much better now because
I don't have to go there.

675
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,239
I've got to go.
I'm looking for another job.

676
00:44:20,755 --> 00:44:22,027
Oh, how can this be?

677
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:23,755
I've been looking for someone.

678
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:26,762
This is great.
Jackson, you can be my assistant.

679
00:44:26,843 --> 00:44:27,680
What?

680
00:44:27,761 --> 00:44:31,771
Kim Hyejin, I've heard that you have
experience working for a magazine.

681
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:33,329
Okay, you're hired.

682
00:44:34,382 --> 00:44:36,674
Stop joking. I've really got to go.

683
00:44:36,755 --> 00:44:39,993
I, Kim Hyejin, promise to grant
Kim Shinhyuk three favors!

684
00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:42,631
This is my second favour.

685
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,838
Jackson, come back as my assistant.

686
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:47,258
I'm really sorry

687
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:50,214
but I don't want to be involved
with "The Most" anymore.

688
00:44:50,297 --> 00:44:52,209
You'd probably get a huge pay raise.

689
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,290
How much?

690
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,712
That's pretty.

691
00:45:09,547 --> 00:45:11,661
Jackson, I'm thirsty.

692
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:12,698
Yes, sir.

693
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,160
Come forth.

694
00:45:18,547 --> 00:45:20,428
Come forth!

695
00:45:20,713 --> 00:45:24,912
Come forth, come forth!

696
00:45:25,713 --> 00:45:27,589
Why are you running from me?

697
00:45:27,672 --> 00:45:29,422
Jackson, where are you going?

698
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,049
Jackson, did you know this?

699
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:39,921
If you can hop all the way
over there on one leg...

700
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:41,672
...your wish will come true.

701
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:43,255
Wow, really?

702
00:45:43,796 --> 00:45:44,796
You're lying again.

703
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,447
What do you take me for?

704
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:49,681
Would I play a prank on you
while you're unemployed?

705
00:45:49,922 --> 00:45:52,508
There's all sorts of videos
on the internet!

706
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:53,755
You've never seen it before?

707
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,297
Really?

708
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,258
Don't do it then. Your loss.

709
00:45:57,339 --> 00:45:58,255
Let's just go.

710
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:01,550
I want to be hired, I want to be hired.

711
00:46:01,631 --> 00:46:03,547
Please let me find a job!

712
00:46:03,631 --> 00:46:04,631
What's with her?

713
00:46:04,713 --> 00:46:05,880
She's crazy.

714
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:07,755
She looks ridiculous.

715
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:14,880
You're dead meat!

716
00:46:16,952 --> 00:46:20,007
I thought your assignment was
to document the roads of Seoul?

717
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:21,505
Gyeonggi Province is nearby

718
00:46:21,586 --> 00:46:24,372
so it'll be disappointing
if we don't cover it, too!

719
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:40,190
Wow, I love the air here!

720
00:46:41,047 --> 00:46:42,172
Isn't this cool?

721
00:46:42,255 --> 00:46:44,424
Jackson, you've got to be photogenic.

722
00:46:44,505 --> 00:46:46,880
Ready, one, two.

723
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:52,589
One more, ready.

724
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,088
Jackson, one, two.

725
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:07,297
This is so funny!

726
00:47:19,286 --> 00:47:20,870
Remember you asked me this?

727
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:26,314
If I'm 100 percent certain that
I see Sungjoon as a friend?

728
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:29,630
I thought about it, and I was wrong.

729
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:33,505
I think I liked Sungjoon...

730
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:36,455
...as a man.

731
00:47:40,005 --> 00:47:42,005
You know those mirrors?

732
00:47:42,922 --> 00:47:44,672
The kind that you
see through on one side...

733
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,005
...but not the other?

734
00:47:48,938 --> 00:47:53,505
There was always a mirror
like that between us.

735
00:47:55,005 --> 00:48:01,671
I can see him so clearly,
but he can't seem to see me.

736
00:48:05,796 --> 00:48:09,346
Some days I just want to hide from him...

737
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:14,868
...and on others,
I wish he'd recognize me.

738
00:48:17,422 --> 00:48:20,486
That's why I was so miserable.

739
00:48:22,672 --> 00:48:24,422
But I managed through it thanks to you.

740
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:28,005
And it was fun working
with the editing staff.

741
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,339
I know you're here to comfort me today.

742
00:48:35,547 --> 00:48:38,440
I sincerely thank you.

743
00:48:39,005 --> 00:48:41,317
Then why don't you go out with me?

744
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:43,172
You're joking again?

745
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,005
I take that back,
I don't like you at all.

746
00:48:53,088 --> 00:48:54,339
Hello?

747
00:48:56,005 --> 00:48:57,047
Yes.

748
00:48:59,172 --> 00:49:00,989
Then I'll see you later.

749
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,464
"You're the only hero?
I'm the hero, too!"

750
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:23,324
"I'm not the villain!
I opposed the power-hungry Wizard of Oz!"

751
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:24,755
"I saved the prince
because he was in danger."

752
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:26,838
"I didn't mean to lie to him.
Please listen to my story."

753
00:49:35,713 --> 00:49:37,713
"I had no choice
but to cast a spell on her."

754
00:49:37,796 --> 00:49:39,713
"The princess belonged to me!
Where did our happiness go?"

755
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:46,631
I thought you were a rational person

756
00:49:46,712 --> 00:49:51,422
but why aren't you
ever rational with Kim Hyejin?

757
00:49:53,464 --> 00:49:55,631
It's like you have feelings for her.

758
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:06,829
Hyejin, get ready to go to work.

759
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,088
Excuse me?

760
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:09,505
It's my friend's company.

761
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,196
It's not that big, but it pays well.

762
00:50:11,277 --> 00:50:13,174
They're looking to hire

763
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:16,422
and I know that I can vouch for you.

764
00:50:16,503 --> 00:50:18,920
-If I talk to him, it's a done deal.
-Really?

765
00:50:19,005 --> 00:50:20,631
Have you been lied to your entire life?

766
00:50:20,712 --> 00:50:22,437
Of course I'm sure.

767
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:26,216
You won't find
another person like me, Hyejin.

768
00:50:26,297 --> 00:50:28,088
Mr Boo, thank you.

769
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:30,791
Mr Boo, thank you very much!

770
00:50:32,255 --> 00:50:34,389
You're thankful, aren't you?

771
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:36,678
They're selling cotton candy over there.

772
00:50:36,759 --> 00:50:38,065
Can I get one?

773
00:50:38,796 --> 00:50:40,547
Yes, I'll buy you one.

774
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,505
I'll buy you 10 if I have to!

775
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:25,088
Princess, did you
get yourself tangled again?

776
00:51:35,979 --> 00:51:37,118
Bye!

777
00:51:54,838 --> 00:51:55,963
Well...

778
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:01,464
Yes, Mr Boo.

779
00:52:01,547 --> 00:52:03,871
I've already talked to him.

780
00:52:03,952 --> 00:52:05,464
He'll be calling you tomorrow morning.

781
00:52:05,547 --> 00:52:07,047
Really?

782
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:08,796
Thank you very much!

783
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:10,672
Yes.

784
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:12,796
Yes!

785
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:43,755
Why am I hiding?

786
00:52:44,672 --> 00:52:46,088
My leg is asleep.

787
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,967
Mr Ji?

788
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,597
The moon is bright.

789
00:53:05,255 --> 00:53:07,214
Oh, it's been a while.

790
00:53:14,144 --> 00:53:15,922
Your idea right here...

791
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:19,210
I want to use the concept for
our 20th anniversary edition.

792
00:53:21,297 --> 00:53:23,422
I'd like you to come back to the team.

793
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,214
No.

794
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:28,712
I don't think I'll be returning.

795
00:53:29,713 --> 00:53:33,383
But you can go ahead and use the idea.

796
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,297
I was a bit...

797
00:53:39,712 --> 00:53:41,547
...sensitive that day.

798
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:45,914
I admit that I went overboard.

799
00:53:48,963 --> 00:53:50,088
I'm sorry.

800
00:53:50,796 --> 00:53:54,938
Please come back and help us release...

801
00:53:55,134 --> 00:53:56,591
...our 20th anniversary edition.

802
00:53:56,672 --> 00:53:57,713
No.

803
00:53:58,919 --> 00:54:03,537
If only because of you,
I have no intention of going back.

804
00:54:07,713 --> 00:54:08,963
To be honest...

805
00:54:09,688 --> 00:54:15,480
...it was uncomfortable working with you.

806
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:20,172
And I've already found another job.

807
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:22,380
Mr Boo introduced me.

808
00:54:24,005 --> 00:54:25,047
Kim Hyejin.

809
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:32,152
Anyway, thanks for coming here personally.

810
00:54:33,214 --> 00:54:36,610
Goodbye then.

811
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,130
Good morning!

812
00:54:59,214 --> 00:55:00,794
-Have you arrived?
-How are you?

813
00:55:23,922 --> 00:55:25,088
Yes, Mr Boo.

814
00:55:25,977 --> 00:55:28,661
You told me to expect a call this morning

815
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,133
but I haven't received it yet.

816
00:55:31,297 --> 00:55:36,955
Oh, how am I going to put this...

817
00:55:37,355 --> 00:55:38,757
It's a no go.

818
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:39,713
What?

819
00:55:40,422 --> 00:55:43,631
I thought it was a done deal?

820
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:47,374
Life always throws curveballs.

821
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:50,130
Hyejin, I'm sorry.

822
00:55:50,214 --> 00:55:53,114
It's time for lunch, sorry.

823
00:55:53,547 --> 00:55:54,835
Mr Boo, Mr Boo!

824
00:55:57,631 --> 00:55:59,644
What is this?

825
00:56:00,172 --> 00:56:02,380
I'd like you to come back to the team.

826
00:56:03,172 --> 00:56:05,734
No, no. I still have my pride.

827
00:56:06,259 --> 00:56:07,784
Gosh.

828
00:56:08,259 --> 00:56:09,133
Yes.

829
00:56:09,214 --> 00:56:11,597
After I eat,
I'll start looking for another job!

830
00:56:18,172 --> 00:56:19,172
What's this?

831
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:20,844
Are we out of rice now?

832
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,672
My goodness!

833
00:56:26,255 --> 00:56:27,405
Dad.

834
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,046
Dad.

835
00:56:31,714 --> 00:56:32,631
What's this?

836
00:56:32,712 --> 00:56:34,505
Why didn't he finish his noodles?

837
00:56:34,755 --> 00:56:35,796
Did he go on a delivery?

838
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:39,911
I should surprise him!

839
00:56:50,422 --> 00:56:51,339
Mr Kim!

840
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:55,442
I thought the flyers would be
ready by today!

841
00:56:56,027 --> 00:56:57,530
I'll have to apologize.

842
00:56:57,611 --> 00:56:59,684
The machinery is giving me trouble.

843
00:57:00,107 --> 00:57:01,024
Again?

844
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:04,287
I can't keep giving you business
because we're friends.

845
00:57:04,368 --> 00:57:05,757
I'm sorry.

846
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:08,172
I'll have it up and running
and completed by tomorrow.

847
00:57:08,255 --> 00:57:09,255
I promise.

848
00:57:09,464 --> 00:57:10,963
Throw away that junk!

849
00:57:11,505 --> 00:57:14,216
Or tell your daughter to
buy you a new one

850
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:15,827
since she's working
for a big company now!

851
00:57:16,214 --> 00:57:17,531
Seriously!

852
00:57:18,505 --> 00:57:19,550
I'm sorry.

853
00:57:19,631 --> 00:57:21,330
I'll finish it by tomorrow.

854
00:57:33,755 --> 00:57:37,133
-Hello?
-Dad, it's me. Your daughter.

855
00:57:37,214 --> 00:57:39,040
Oh, hey daughter!

856
00:57:39,424 --> 00:57:40,508
Have you eaten?

857
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:42,447
Of course I did.

858
00:57:43,361 --> 00:57:47,817
Dad, stop having noodles all the time
and make sure you eat well.

859
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:52,334
Is everything okay over there?

860
00:57:52,715 --> 00:57:53,631
What?

861
00:57:53,712 --> 00:57:55,551
Everything is the same here.

862
00:57:55,922 --> 00:57:58,119
We're doing fine,
so don't worry about us...

863
00:57:58,587 --> 00:58:01,819
...and work hard at your company.

864
00:58:02,589 --> 00:58:05,163
Oh, is your name going to appear
on next month's issue, too?

865
00:58:05,922 --> 00:58:09,086
Of course.
They can't manage work without me.

866
00:58:10,796 --> 00:58:12,263
You can rely on me, Dad.

867
00:58:12,505 --> 00:58:16,192
Just the sound of that is
giving me strength!

868
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:18,380
Thanks, my daughter!

869
00:58:18,464 --> 00:58:19,672
Okay, Dad.

870
00:58:20,172 --> 00:58:21,667
The editor is calling for me.

871
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:23,206
I'll call you again.

872
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:44,672
"Mr. Ji"

873
00:58:51,505 --> 00:58:52,987
Yes, let's just do it!

874
00:58:54,255 --> 00:58:58,547
If only because of you,
I have no intention of going back.

875
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,447
Why did I have to tell him that?

876
00:59:03,464 --> 00:59:06,196
No, I'll still have to do it.

877
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:13,713
It was uncomfortable working with you.

878
00:59:14,608 --> 00:59:16,174
If only I left that part out!

879
00:59:16,255 --> 00:59:17,728
I can't do this!

880
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:19,339
What the...

881
00:59:22,505 --> 00:59:23,464
Hello?

882
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:25,690
Oh, Hyejin, it's me.

883
00:59:26,175 --> 00:59:28,133
I've done it!

884
00:59:28,214 --> 00:59:31,464
I bought him lunch
and convinced him to employ you.

885
00:59:31,545 --> 00:59:36,253
He's agreed to call you,
so pick up any unfamiliar calls!

886
00:59:37,796 --> 00:59:38,922
Really?

887
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:41,755
Thank you, Mr. Boo!

888
00:59:42,297 --> 00:59:43,422
Yes!

889
00:59:52,713 --> 00:59:54,672
He's crying without his owner around.

890
00:59:55,047 --> 00:59:57,026
Are you going to abandon him?

891
01:00:27,255 --> 01:00:28,869
Can someone get the phone?

892
01:00:31,547 --> 01:00:34,188
Yes, this is Kim Hyejin
from "The Most" Editing Department.
