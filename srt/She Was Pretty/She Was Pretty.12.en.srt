00:00:02,308 --> 00:00:04,708
"Episode 12"

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,250
Hyejung wanted to take Hari with her.

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,417
Miss Min has tendered her resignation.

4
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:26,459
What am I going to do?

5
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:29,125
I think she really left.

6
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:32,834
Min Hari.

7
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:37,301
How can you leave me like this?

8
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:41,134
If you leave like this...

9
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,426
If you leave,

10
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:49,009
then what about me?

11
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:16,217
Kim Hyejin?

12
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:19,176
Hyejin, what are you doing here?

13
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:22,259
Hari!

14
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:30,301
You didn't leave yet!

15
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,051
You're not gone.

16
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,760
I'm relieved.

17
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:35,468
I'm so relieved.

18
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:38,468
How did you come here?

19
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:41,925
Hey! How can you leave without telling me?

20
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:44,051
Where are you going to go without me?

21
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,009
Don't go, Hari!

22
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,664
Who said anything about going anywhere?

23
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:52,465
Weren't you going to
follow your mom to Japan?

24
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:53,433
No.

25
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:56,676
I'm here to see my mom leave today.

26
00:01:57,173 --> 00:02:00,048
See her off?
So you're not going with her?

27
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:02,215
Hey!

28
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:05,047
After how I've wronged you...

29
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:07,048
...do you really think I'd run away?

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Did you think I'd leave
without telling you?

31
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:18,047
Then, you're really not leaving?

32
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:20,007
Of course not.

33
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,257
I'm so happy to hear that!

34
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:25,465
I thought you were going to leave!

35
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,924
Stop crying.

36
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:38,601
I'm not going to leave you.

37
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:44,100
How can I leave you behind?

38
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:53,112
I'm going to stay close to you...

39
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:56,184
...and apologise for the rest of my life.

40
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,099
Don't cry.

41
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:15,996
Did you make up with your mom?

42
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:17,917
Yes.

43
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,412
We spent time together,
and talked about a lot of things.

44
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:27,870
I couldn't understand
why she left me when I was a kid,

45
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:33,916
but I understand now.

46
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:36,029
Not as her daughter,

47
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,954
but as a woman.

48
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:40,991
That's good.

49
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:42,745
Such a relief.

50
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:45,656
But what happened to you?

51
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,702
Why did you tender your resignation,
and what happened to your phone?

52
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:49,412
And what about your
clothes and your shoes?

53
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:51,670
I've realized that I've made
such a foolish mistake,

54
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,579
because I'm still too childish.

55
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:58,886
My dad gave me my job,

56
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:02,203
and I've been buying whatever
I wanted with his credit card.

57
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:04,870
I've been living the easy life.

58
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:09,919
And I'm sick of all the superficial
guys I've been meeting with.

59
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,987
"Letter of Resignation"

60
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,155
And then...

61
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,287
I...

62
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,453
I went for something...

63
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:29,620
...that didn't belong to me.

64
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,205
Every time I saw your face,

65
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,829
I felt like crying.

66
00:04:38,787 --> 00:04:40,829
I didn't know what to say or
how to say it,

67
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:44,745
so I ran away like...

68
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:46,704
a little child.

69
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:51,078
And...

70
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,996
I couldn't tell you
what I needed to tell you.

71
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,453
I'm sorry, Hyejin.

72
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:08,704
I'm really sorry.

73
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,037
Gosh.

74
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,787
I can't believe I did that to you.

75
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,120
I'm so very sorry.

76
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:55,495
We did narrow the gap,
but we are still second.

77
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:57,448
We only care about the results.

78
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,324
It's all worthless if we are
not on the top of the rank.

79
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,954
Don't forget that if you
don't make it this last time...

80
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:05,994
The Most Korea will be gone forever.

81
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:07,924
And it all depends on you.

82
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:25,495
So what do you plan to do now?

83
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:29,161
I'm going to give myself some time.

84
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:34,912
I'm trying to discover what
I can accomplish on my own.

85
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:39,883
I think they want you back at the hotel.

86
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:41,654
I'm never going there again.

87
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:43,993
From now on, I'm going to
do everything on my own.

88
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:44,912
Everything!

89
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:49,827
"Mr Ji"

90
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:52,662
I'm near your place. Can I see you?

91
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,527
I'm going to take a shower now.

92
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,954
Well, Hari?

93
00:06:56,203 --> 00:06:58,579
I'm going to stop
by the convenience store.

94
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:00,745
-Should I go with you?
-No!

95
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:03,665
Take a shower. I'll be right back.

96
00:07:05,078 --> 00:07:05,949
Okay.

97
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:22,891
Sungjoon.

98
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,537
Yes, Hyejin.

99
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,317
What brings you here at this hour?

100
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:30,563
Did you leave the office right now?

101
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:33,745
Wait, I need 10 seconds.

102
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:38,518
What are you doing?

103
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,241
Three, two, one...

104
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:51,046
Okay, I'll leave now.

105
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:52,137
Wait.

106
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:53,975
What?

107
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,659
I'm just here to see you.

108
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,661
I thought it would lift my spirits.

109
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:03,198
Are you okay?

110
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:07,245
You seem really tired.

111
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,370
Do you really have to work so hard
in order to make it to number one?

112
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:20,572
It's not something I can solve alone.

113
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:23,078
What do you mean by that?

114
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,097
When I accepted this mission...

115
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:31,037
I'm not simply aiming
to revive The Most Korea,

116
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:35,077
but I've accepted responsibility
for my teammates as well.

117
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:39,787
I'm sure some people will
survive even if The Most disappears...

118
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:42,787
...but some will be adversely affected.

119
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:46,954
Like the ones who still
lack experience and abilities.

120
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:51,077
It's all a part of my responsibility.

121
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,441
I have to take this seriously.

122
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:57,453
But it's difficult to do it alone.

123
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,245
If you really feel sorry for me...

124
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:01,954
you can always give me a hug.

125
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,495
I'm sure it'll cheer me up.

126
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:11,996
I'm being ridiculous again,
after I told you I wouldn't be.

127
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:14,560
I should get going.

128
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:16,218
Sleep well.

129
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:46,495
What the...

130
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,166
You're back?

131
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:51,954
What's that?

132
00:09:52,537 --> 00:09:53,870
Why are you...

133
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:55,203
...in my house?

134
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,286
Oh, I took a shower.

135
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,786
I was feeling dirty.

136
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,120
I really like your shower!

137
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:04,579
The pizza is here!

138
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,161
I didn't order any.

139
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,453
I ordered it because I was hungry.

140
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,120
I didn't have dinner yet.

141
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,078
Hey...

142
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,068
Are you okay?

143
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,067
You seem startled.

144
00:10:24,183 --> 00:10:25,144
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:34,598
I've developed some of the ideas
from the meeting, among others.

146
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:38,661
I've been home for the last two days...

147
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:40,704
...and my mind started flowing with ideas.

148
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:43,537
This is why I normally
stay away from these things.

149
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,412
Maybe I'm...

150
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:47,412
...a genius?

151
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:58,272
Have you decided to return?

152
00:10:58,347 --> 00:11:01,888
Well, you went out of
your way to convince me.

153
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:03,716
So I've decided to stay.

154
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,752
This idea is underdeveloped...

155
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,514
...and it's too late
for this kind of article.

156
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:17,472
New Look's been working on
this idea for three months now.

157
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:18,636
What?

158
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:22,305
As for the cafe report,

159
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,263
try to expand beyond
the cafes here in Korea.

160
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:26,388
It may be interesting
to compare our coffee shops...

161
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:27,680
...with the ones found in Europe.

162
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:33,097
You can provide reference to
Woody Allen's "Midnight in Paris".

163
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,806
Look, I figured just as much.

164
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:39,096
And this...

165
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,930
Let's let Mr Kim Poongho
handle this one.

166
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,305
He's rather meticulous, so he's
good at analyzing this type of data.

167
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,353
For this, you can refer to Miss Cha's
article in last year's August issue.

168
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:49,563
It should be helpful.

169
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:53,472
Are you some sort of sage?

170
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:56,055
How are you keeping tabs on everything?

171
00:11:56,305 --> 00:11:59,764
But what made you change your mind?

172
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:01,950
I thought you're
not that easy to convince.

173
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,305
I know, right?

174
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,676
I don't know what convinced me.

175
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:09,472
I think I'm starting to have fun again.

176
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:13,971
The threat of our magazine
closing down is giving me motivation.

177
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:20,220
I enjoy games where the odds
are stacked against me.

178
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:21,847
As you know, I'm a lunatic.

179
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:24,430
I won't give up without giving it a try...

180
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,166
...until the bitter end.

181
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:30,180
We still have a 50-to-50 chance.

182
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:34,346
I should get going.

183
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:36,130
If you dream about me,
handle it on your end.

184
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:39,233
That's ridiculous.

185
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:01,847
I'm sorry, I can't make it this time.

186
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,013
No, just something funny came up,
nothing special.

187
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:13,441
I missed you, too.
Let me call you back soon, all right?

188
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:15,971
Okay, bye.

189
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:21,888
I'm late, I'm late...

190
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,806
Wife, jacket!

191
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,097
Thank you!

192
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,363
I'm off now.

193
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:28,936
Oh, wait.

194
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:36,652
Are your eyebrows too dark?

195
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:39,930
There you go.

196
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:42,097
-Go, go, go!
-See you!

197
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:45,138
Oh right.

198
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,408
Well...

199
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:51,887
Have I ever told you that I love you?

200
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:54,347
Gosh.

201
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:56,510
I love you!

202
00:13:58,055 --> 00:13:59,263
Have a good one!

203
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,189
And stop running!

204
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:05,596
Wife, make lots of money!

205
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,555
Jackson!

206
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,847
Mr Kim!

207
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:41,389
Want a taste?

208
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:44,680
Mr Kim, have you come back to us?

209
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:45,680
Maybe?

210
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:46,609
Come on, Jackson!

211
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,512
I thought you were gone for good!

212
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:54,785
I really thought you
went somewhere else!

213
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:56,430
I'm so relieved now!

214
00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:59,337
Why are you so happy to see me?

215
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,764
You're making me emotional.

216
00:15:02,222 --> 00:15:04,222
You look like a puppy
that's happy to see me.

217
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:07,971
♪ Wag your tail and bark for joy

218
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:09,880
Let's go, Coco.

219
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,764
Why haven't you been showing up
for work?

220
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,263
Why do you suppose that is?

221
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:25,602
Do I really have to tell you?

222
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:34,347
By any chance, was it because of me?

223
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:42,055
Do you really think
I almost quit my job because of you?

224
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,639
Because I told you how I feel about you,
and you rejected me?

225
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,930
My goodness... What's wrong with me?

226
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:53,222
Why would you quit your job because of me?

227
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:55,971
You're right.
It was because of you, Jackson.

228
00:15:57,013 --> 00:15:57,887
What?

229
00:15:57,971 --> 00:16:00,764
Ever since you kicked me to the curb...

230
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:05,346
I have a huge hole in my heart.

231
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,764
And work just wasn't that fun anymore.

232
00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:10,013
Well, Mr Kim...

233
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:12,514
-About that day...
-But I'm fine now.

234
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,055
I'm starting to enjoy this again!

235
00:16:19,783 --> 00:16:22,222
So what made you enjoy it again?

236
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,055
Hello.

237
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,887
So what made you return?

238
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:32,053
Who knows?

239
00:16:32,555 --> 00:16:33,680
Oh, right.

240
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:35,055
Jackson, have you
ever heard of this quote?

241
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:36,846
"It's not over until it's over."

242
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,930
Sure, Yogi Berra said that.

243
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:42,013
You're a smart one, aren't you?

244
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:44,096
But what does that have
to do with anything?

245
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,887
It just crossed my mind.

246
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,806
It's not over until it's over.

247
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,097
Pretty inspirational, right?

248
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,526
What's he talking about?

249
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,722
Buongiorno!

250
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:05,353
Kim Shinhyuk!

251
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:06,722
Shinhyuk!

252
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:08,764
Oh, my!

253
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:10,854
-That lunatic.
-I'm back.

254
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:14,430
What happened?

255
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,062
Can you welcome me back
with a little less violence?

256
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:26,594
Seriously, where were you?

257
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,889
Things are going to get noisy
around here again.

258
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:44,763
How is the main interview coming along
for our 20th anniversary issue?

259
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:47,806
Well, we're trying to
get a hold of Leonard Kim, but...

260
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:49,013
Leonard Kim?

261
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:51,847
Are you talking about
the fashionista-turned-director...

262
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:54,542
...who recently won awards for his movies?

263
00:17:54,627 --> 00:17:56,169
He's really hot these days.

264
00:17:56,514 --> 00:17:58,788
But he's notorious
for avoiding interviews.

265
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:00,887
Do you think he'll work with us?

266
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:02,097
Well, Mr Ji.

267
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:04,887
I think we're over our heads here.

268
00:18:05,141 --> 00:18:08,471
Maybe we should switch to Kim Shinae?

269
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:13,097
Why?

270
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:14,764
We can't give up now!

271
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,971
It's not like we have
a zero percent chance.

272
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,680
He's notoriously private,
so if we get a hold of him...

273
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:21,971
We'll have the perfect story.

274
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:24,804
If we're the first Asian magazine
to work with him...

275
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,596
Then we're bound to be
number one in domestic sales.

276
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,804
New Look was able to
land Hollywood stars...

277
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:31,222
So why is it impossible for us
to land Leonard Kim?

278
00:18:32,138 --> 00:18:33,029
Am I right?

279
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,012
When did the two of them
start cooperating?

280
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:40,097
I don't know.

281
00:18:40,263 --> 00:18:41,179
When did they grow close?

282
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:43,763
Yes, let's challenge
those guys at New Look.

283
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:46,639
It's our 20th anniversary issue,
so let's grab the top spot!

284
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:49,138
You seem awfully motivated.

285
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:51,138
Did something happen to you
while you were away?

286
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,887
Okay. We'll continue
to pursue Leonard Kim.

287
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:57,013
Wait, your nose is bleeding!

288
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:58,263
Your nose.

289
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,389
My goodness.

290
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:01,638
Blood!

291
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:03,680
Sit down, sit down.

292
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,346
Throw your head back.

293
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,763
No, no! Lower your head.

294
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,763
What are you saying?
You're supposed to throw your head back.

295
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,888
-You're supposed to lean forward!
-You're supposed to lean back!

296
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:12,915
-You don't know anything!
-What do you know about a nosebleed?

297
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,839
I'm okay!

298
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,222
I'm fine.

299
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:19,722
You have a show to attend
at Jeju Island tomorrow.

300
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:20,905
Are you going to be okay?

301
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,803
You seem a bit tired...

302
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,639
I'm okay. I'll take care of it.

303
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:26,709
You have to throw your head back.

304
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,049
He's been looking pale, too.

305
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,097
Didn't he get enough sleep?

306
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:40,901
Maybe he's not eating right.

307
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:47,632
Hyejin, what language is that?

308
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:49,150
Are you communicating with aliens?

309
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:50,649
Yes?

310
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:55,026
Oh...

311
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:05,180
ET go home.

312
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,099
Not amused?

313
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:10,375
I found it so funny.

314
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:17,514
Here's the meeting log.

315
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,841
Thank you, Kim Hyejin.

316
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,158
But are you okay?

317
00:20:27,244 --> 00:20:28,577
You were bleeding earlier.

318
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:30,863
Yes, I'm fine.

319
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,017
You don't look so well.

320
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:36,015
I'm really okay.

321
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:37,971
What can I do to make you believe me?

322
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:40,680
Maybe I should lift my chair.

323
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:43,680
-Or maybe the desk?
-Okay, forget it.

324
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:45,847
You're fine, I get it.

325
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:51,732
I feel good.

326
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,041
Because you're worried about me.

327
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,124
Well, carry on, Mr Ji.

328
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,014
Mr Ji.

329
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,667
Burdock tea is supposed
to be good for nosebleeds.

330
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:26,917
I think it's better than coffee.

331
00:21:41,514 --> 00:21:42,639
"Joonwoo"

332
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:45,472
After work, let's go to
that spicy noodle restaurant again.

333
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:50,555
I'm sorry, I'm not feeling well today.

334
00:21:55,888 --> 00:21:57,514
Why? What's wrong?

335
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,638
-Are you okay?
-No, well...

336
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:02,472
My head hurts a little...

337
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:03,840
Why does your head hurt?

338
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:05,846
Maybe you're coming down with a cold?
Or the flu?

339
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,847
Do you have a fever?
Are you getting the chills?

340
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:09,091
Let me see.

341
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:12,389
Oh, my. Han Seol, maintain yourself!

342
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,138
Don't show any emotion!

343
00:22:15,263 --> 00:22:17,389
No, it's not that bad.

344
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,902
Ahreum!

345
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:26,930
Hyejin.

346
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,347
Yes?

347
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:34,514
Can we postpone our meeting
concerning your article to tomorrow?

348
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:36,740
I need to meet with
the art team later today.

349
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:39,595
Okay, let me know
when you have spare time.

350
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,555
Sorry.

351
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:42,263
I nominate Mr Kim Shinhyuk for the task!

352
00:22:42,347 --> 00:22:45,635
He's full of ideas,
and he's a great writer as well.

353
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:48,909
I'll help you out.

354
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:51,888
Kim Shinhyuk.

355
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:56,013
-Thanks.
-I know.

356
00:22:56,097 --> 00:22:57,013
I'll leave it to you.

357
00:22:57,514 --> 00:22:59,430
Well, I could wait until
you have the time...

358
00:22:59,514 --> 00:23:03,138
Jackson, you're not uncomfortable
around me, are you?

359
00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:05,430
Seriously?

360
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:07,930
No, of course not.

361
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:12,180
I've been giving you a hard time, so...

362
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,131
Okay, we'll let the coin decide.

363
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:16,430
Heads, I help you with your article.

364
00:23:16,514 --> 00:23:18,887
And tails, we forget
the whole thing, okay?

365
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:19,888
No.

366
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,423
The general's face, so it's heads!

367
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:25,923
That's not heads, it's tails!

368
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:28,299
You told me that the general
was tails the last time!

369
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:29,632
It turns out you were right.

370
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:30,840
The general's face is heads.

371
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:32,424
I've checked with
the Korean Minting Corporation.

372
00:23:32,882 --> 00:23:34,923
You've checked with
the Korean Minting Corporation?

373
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:38,215
Then we'll have our meeting in 10 minutes.

374
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:42,840
Was the number always tails?

375
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:44,758
He said it was heads the other day!

376
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,049
Is it heads or tails?

377
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:51,758
Did you really write this, Jackson?

378
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,839
You've got the basics down,
and you've got a great premise.

379
00:23:55,923 --> 00:23:57,299
But take a look at this, Jackson.

380
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:59,465
If you can't hook your audience
with the very first line...

381
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:00,674
...you've already lost them.

382
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,049
For instance.

383
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,174
Now, compare these two articles.

384
00:24:06,382 --> 00:24:07,632
The items are the same.

385
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:09,424
But which one stands out more?

386
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:11,057
This one, right?

387
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:13,721
Me, too. Why? Because I wrote it.

388
00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:18,697
You want to be impactful
right off the bat.

389
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,798
Then your readers
will continue to read...

390
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:24,923
In order to write a killer article,
you have to constantly gather ideas.

391
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:28,299
Make a scrapbook of any
good articles you come across.

392
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:31,965
When you have writer's block,
you can refer to your scrapbook...

393
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:34,048
...and ideas will start
popping like soda pop.

394
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:37,132
Wow, I never knew you were
so good at this.

395
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:38,716
You're like a completely different person.

396
00:24:40,382 --> 00:24:41,632
You've finally realized it?

397
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,661
So do you see me
in a different light now?

398
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:46,881
What?

399
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:50,132
I have to agree that there's nothing
more attractive than a capable man.

400
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:54,007
My professionalism probably
seems sexy to you.

401
00:24:54,507 --> 00:24:56,327
Does it make your heart skip a beat?

402
00:24:57,716 --> 00:24:59,422
No, well, Mr Kim.

403
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:01,423
I haven't shown you the real me yet.

404
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:03,006
And what kind of man I could be.

405
00:25:03,091 --> 00:25:04,269
Remember I told you?

406
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:06,354
It's not over until it's over.

407
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,174
Well, Mr Kim.

408
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,632
I really, really like you...

409
00:25:11,716 --> 00:25:12,716
Is that so?

410
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:17,632
I didn't know that you
really, really like me!

411
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:19,882
-What?
-Okay, I get it.

412
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:24,174
You really, really like me.

413
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:26,697
I see it now.

414
00:25:30,132 --> 00:25:31,303
That's it.

415
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:35,882
Well, Mr Kim. Mr Kim!

416
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:37,840
Gosh.

417
00:25:38,882 --> 00:25:40,632
That's not what I meant.

418
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,698
Han Seol.

419
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:46,432
Wait a second.

420
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:53,758
You do have a bit of a fever.

421
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:57,632
I wasn't sure, so I got you
several different medications.

422
00:25:57,716 --> 00:26:00,090
This is for migraines,
this one's for the flu...

423
00:26:00,174 --> 00:26:01,382
...and this is for a runny nose.

424
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:02,953
If you get a fever, take this.

425
00:26:05,007 --> 00:26:06,852
Joonwoo, where were you?
Follow me, we're going to the agency.

426
00:26:06,937 --> 00:26:07,894
Yes, ma'am.

427
00:26:08,674 --> 00:26:10,090
You can't take medication
on an empty stomach...

428
00:26:10,174 --> 00:26:11,716
...so be sure to eat something. Okay?

429
00:26:14,716 --> 00:26:17,194
Don't get sick!
Make sure you eat something!

430
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:21,713
Kim Joonwoo.

431
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:24,950
Why do you have to be
so kind and lovable?

432
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:28,716
Why can't you be the chairman's son?

433
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:36,490
It's my lucky day!

434
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,466
Follow the ladder!

435
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:43,744
I got it, I got it!

436
00:26:45,716 --> 00:26:48,367
Why can't they be quiet
so he can get some sleep?

437
00:26:55,341 --> 00:26:56,388
Are you trying to fight us?

438
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:58,716
-What are you doing?
-What's the matter?

439
00:26:59,642 --> 00:27:02,933
I'll pay for lunch today.

440
00:27:03,608 --> 00:27:06,816
-Really?
-I really want to pay for lunch today.

441
00:27:08,591 --> 00:27:10,758
Wow, jackpot!

442
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,678
I've already eaten,
so everyone go on without me.

443
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:16,347
Go on and enjoy your lunch.

444
00:27:19,341 --> 00:27:20,189
What's with you?

445
00:27:50,923 --> 00:27:53,756
What are you doing, my dear?

446
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,747
What?

447
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,257
Oh, my!

448
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:00,452
Your lipstick is smudged.

449
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:04,340
There you go.

450
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:08,007
You look very Most-esque again.

451
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:11,675
Thank you very much.

452
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:13,549
Ouch...

453
00:28:53,976 --> 00:28:55,630
Jackson, you're here?

454
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:56,881
Why?

455
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:59,257
You want to have some fun together?

456
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:01,382
What's your idea of fun?

457
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,716
-Anything but this.
-What?

458
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:06,340
-Let's go.
-I have to deliver this to Poongho.

459
00:29:06,424 --> 00:29:08,839
He can wait for another 30 minutes,
and it won't kill him.

460
00:29:08,923 --> 00:29:11,547
Relax! Sometimes you need
to take a breather.

461
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:13,056
-Tea time!
-Oh, no.

462
00:29:15,312 --> 00:29:16,591
I'll have an iced Americano.

463
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,482
Then I'll have an Americano, too.

464
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,632
Will your girlfriend have it iced as well?

465
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:22,577
What?

466
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,090
Well, I'm not his...

467
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:25,299
She's not my girlfriend.

468
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:28,882
Yet.

469
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:31,839
Let me get a slice of that cake, too.

470
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:33,882
-Sure.
-Mr Kim.

471
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:45,891
Well, Mr Kim.

472
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:49,674
I really do like you a lot.

473
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:51,090
There you go pouring your heart out again.

474
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:53,758
I already know that you really,
really like me.

475
00:29:54,346 --> 00:29:55,304
Right?

476
00:29:57,507 --> 00:29:58,549
Well...

477
00:29:59,028 --> 00:30:02,296
How should I put this?

478
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,550
-So what I'm trying to say is...
-Is this why you like me?

479
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,723
Oh, my!

480
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,882
Just looking at me makes you smile.

481
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,632
No, what I'm trying to say is...

482
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:25,424
Wait, is this why you like me then?

483
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,549
My tooth! I've lost my tooth!

484
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:35,721
Mr Kim!

485
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:39,715
You're making me feel uncomfortable!

486
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,591
-You don't like me, Jackson?
-Of course not.

487
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,673
Why wouldn't I like you?

488
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,756
Then I've still got a chance.

489
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,882
Remember?

490
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,965
It's not over until it's over.

491
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:53,132
You'll eventually be mine, Jackson.

492
00:30:57,215 --> 00:30:58,235
See you around.

493
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:00,632
Mr Kim! Mr Kim!

494
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:06,799
Why is he making me feel so bad?

495
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:15,382
"She Was Pretty"

496
00:31:18,812 --> 00:31:20,853
You're back?
Come here and have a slice of pizza.

497
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:23,894
Hey, Kim Hye-rin,
what are you doing here?

498
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:26,686
Hari has some extra time now.

499
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:29,480
I wanted to talk to her
about this and that.

500
00:31:32,645 --> 00:31:34,498
Oh! Is that Sungjoon calling you?

501
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:37,900
No, it's not!

502
00:31:39,828 --> 00:31:40,994
Yes, Miss Cha.

503
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,149
I've already emailed that to you.

504
00:31:43,436 --> 00:31:45,267
Yes, see you tomorrow.

505
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:48,389
I'm going to get changed
and join you for dinner!

506
00:31:50,603 --> 00:31:51,478
Hari!

507
00:31:51,732 --> 00:31:54,023
There's a guy following Hyejin around.

508
00:31:54,353 --> 00:31:55,770
And do you want to know the funny thing?

509
00:31:55,936 --> 00:31:58,685
She's playing hard to get!
Isn't it comedy?

510
00:31:59,436 --> 00:32:00,808
He seems to be an old friend,

511
00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:05,644
but he's either blind
or he's got low standards.

512
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:06,728
It's one or the other.

513
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:08,227
Hey my little sister, have your fill!

514
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:10,686
That way you'll grow nice and tall!

515
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:12,645
What are you doing?

516
00:32:13,688 --> 00:32:15,393
He even came over
to our house the other day.

517
00:32:15,478 --> 00:32:18,113
Hey! You're so cute!

518
00:32:18,198 --> 00:32:19,477
You're so adorable!

519
00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:21,853
You're just drop dead gorgeous,
aren't you?

520
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,061
Can you let go of me now?

521
00:32:24,473 --> 00:32:25,554
It hurts!

522
00:32:34,338 --> 00:32:35,421
Wife.

523
00:32:36,894 --> 00:32:37,736
Come here.

524
00:32:45,448 --> 00:32:46,448
Ta-da!

525
00:32:47,311 --> 00:32:48,269
What's this?

526
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:49,212
Open it.

527
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:55,208
Gosh.

528
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:58,603
Why did you get me shoes
all of a sudden?

529
00:32:58,772 --> 00:33:00,958
I promised to get you a pair.

530
00:33:02,144 --> 00:33:04,441
So, do you like it?

531
00:33:05,893 --> 00:33:07,812
It's so pretty...

532
00:33:08,645 --> 00:33:10,395
But I don't think I can pull this off.

533
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:14,596
Why don't you change it
for one in your size?

534
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:16,257
I'll wear something more comfortable.

535
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:24,645
Hyejin, don't you know that
a good pair of shoes...

536
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:26,133
...can take you to a good place?

537
00:33:26,478 --> 00:33:27,395
What?

538
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,991
Wear these shoes
and go somewhere great.

539
00:33:33,356 --> 00:33:36,405
Don't think about anything,
and don't worry about anything.

540
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,728
Go wherever you please.

541
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,478
Wherever you want to go.

542
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:48,894
It'll feel uncomfortable at first,
and you may have trouble walking.

543
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:53,728
But you'll quickly get used to it.

544
00:33:54,589 --> 00:34:00,297
Eventually, you'll get comfortable.

545
00:34:04,894 --> 00:34:10,351
Hari, I like how things are now.

546
00:34:10,686 --> 00:34:11,891
Hey, stop being ignorant.

547
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:16,199
Don't worry about me
and just go to Ji Sungjoon.

548
00:34:16,645 --> 00:34:20,186
If you keep acting like this,
it'll make me feel uncomfortable!

549
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:24,152
I don't care if I remain
just friends with Sungjoon.

550
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:28,019
When I was pursuing Ji Sungjoon...

551
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:30,478
...all he could think about was you.

552
00:34:32,478 --> 00:34:35,442
He's probably having
a hard time waiting for you.

553
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,319
I'm really okay.

554
00:34:43,571 --> 00:34:45,026
I really am.

555
00:34:48,228 --> 00:34:52,186
To be honest,
I wasn't really okay before.

556
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:55,853
But now...

557
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:57,977
It's for real.

558
00:34:59,977 --> 00:35:01,269
I'm really okay.

559
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:03,019
So, Hyejin.

560
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:05,936
Just go.

561
00:35:07,353 --> 00:35:09,478
And don't worry about anything else.

562
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,686
Okay?

563
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,082
I'm not going to pressure you.

564
00:36:20,893 --> 00:36:22,144
Just don't run away from me.

565
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:25,893
You're just a girl I've grown to like.

566
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:21,478
Hey Princess, what are you doing?

567
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:23,186
Princess?

568
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:45,478
Waiting is harder...

569
00:37:46,837 --> 00:37:47,963
...than I thought it would be.

570
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,686
I don't even have any water.

571
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:03,853
Hi, Princess.

572
00:39:06,422 --> 00:39:07,338
Wait.

573
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,645
That scarf!

574
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:15,061
When did he stop by?

575
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:28,144
I'm not going to run away anymore.

576
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,647
Bye!

577
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
Wife, come here.

578
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:51,061
Hari.

579
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:57,605
I want to drop you off for the last time.

580
00:39:57,867 --> 00:40:01,280
I'm going to drop you off
and then sell my car.

581
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:07,141
Thanks, see you later.

582
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,993
Good luck selling the car.

583
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:11,619
Okay.

584
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:14,868
Hyejin!

585
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:16,285
Yes?

586
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:20,077
Those shoes look great on you!

587
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:22,535
My Hyejin, you're so pretty!

588
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:23,619
You're the best!

589
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:27,369
Go, Hyejin!

590
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:49,035
Gosh.

591
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:51,867
It feels so good!

592
00:40:58,327 --> 00:40:59,618
Good morning!

593
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:00,827
-Have you arrived?
-Good morning.

594
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:05,606
Is he here yet?

595
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,160
He hasn't arrived yet.

596
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:16,229
Mr Ji hasn't come to the office yet?

597
00:41:16,494 --> 00:41:18,452
I need his confirmation on this.

598
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:21,369
Mr Ji and I had a meeting
with the art team this morning.

599
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,160
And he had another meeting afterward.

600
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:26,160
He left just moments ago.

601
00:41:30,744 --> 00:41:31,826
Hyejin, thanks for lunch...

602
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,867
See you.

603
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:37,070
Anyone wants to go in
on a ladder for coffee?

604
00:41:39,461 --> 00:41:40,461
Oh, thanks.

605
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:03,118
I'll see him at the office later.

606
00:42:04,827 --> 00:42:06,201
Miss Cha, here are
the translations you asked.

607
00:42:06,285 --> 00:42:07,868
-Oh, thank you.
-Sure.

608
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,786
Ta-da! The coffee has arrived!

609
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,051
-Coffee?
-Thank you.

610
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,109
I want iced coffee.

611
00:42:15,194 --> 00:42:16,033
This one.

612
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:18,268
-Oh, take these.
-Thank you.

613
00:42:18,353 --> 00:42:21,270
Oh! I ran into Photographer Kang
at the coffee shop.

614
00:42:21,577 --> 00:42:23,326
He was in a meeting with Mr Ji.

615
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,285
Really?

616
00:42:25,592 --> 00:42:27,258
What's this?
Didn't you put any sugar in mine?

617
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:29,409
Oh, I forgot.

618
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:32,193
Give it to me!
I'll go and get you some sugar!

619
00:42:33,827 --> 00:42:34,827
You don't have to.

620
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:41,202
Aren't you Hyejin?

621
00:42:41,617 --> 00:42:42,534
Oh.

622
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:44,160
Hello, Photographer Kang.

623
00:42:45,661 --> 00:42:48,025
But where's Mr Ji?

624
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,535
Oh, did you want to see him?

625
00:42:50,077 --> 00:42:51,993
Didn't you see him leave moments ago?

626
00:43:12,202 --> 00:43:14,202
I guess I'll see him in the office later.

627
00:43:23,502 --> 00:43:24,627
Yes, Mr Ji.

628
00:43:26,285 --> 00:43:28,286
A car will be ready for you
at the airport in Jeju.

629
00:43:30,035 --> 00:43:32,577
Will you be back on the 4 PM flight?

630
00:43:34,327 --> 00:43:38,118
Then I suppose you'll be back
at the office after 6 PM.

631
00:43:39,327 --> 00:43:40,202
Yes.

632
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,327
Yes, I'll see you later. Have a safe trip.

633
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,539
My goodness.

634
00:43:49,077 --> 00:43:51,827
Hyejin, what are you doing?

635
00:43:52,535 --> 00:43:53,410
Well...

636
00:43:53,802 --> 00:43:54,928
No, it's nothing.

637
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:01,741
Right, he was heading
to Jeju Island today.

638
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:08,743
"Weather in Jeju Island"

639
00:44:08,827 --> 00:44:11,202
I hope it doesn't rain when he gets there.

640
00:44:12,061 --> 00:44:13,603
I wonder if he had something to eat.

641
00:44:24,867 --> 00:44:27,202
Jackson, time for a meeting.

642
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,327
She's fallen asleep.

643
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:48,837
Jackson.

644
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:52,968
Can you look my way?

645
00:44:59,974 --> 00:45:04,368
Hyejin, where are the documents
from Jungin Publishing?

646
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,452
Oh, Mr Ji wanted to look over those.

647
00:45:07,744 --> 00:45:08,660
Really?

648
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:10,118
Can you take them for me?

649
00:45:10,285 --> 00:45:11,432
-Sure.
-Thanks.

650
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:23,577
Jungin Publishing...

651
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,494
Jungin Publishing...

652
00:46:00,868 --> 00:46:04,369
It'll end up sticking together!

653
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,410
Why do you need your mouth
to put on a bandage?

654
00:46:41,285 --> 00:46:42,867
Wow, this movie looks amazing.

655
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:44,619
I want to see it now.

656
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,951
I want to see him.

657
00:46:48,535 --> 00:46:51,660
Really? You want to see the movie, too?

658
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:53,202
Then you want to join the screening?

659
00:47:18,345 --> 00:47:19,885
I'll be right back.

660
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,595
Hyejin, where are you going?

661
00:47:26,535 --> 00:47:27,867
To a good place.

662
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,660
Yes, Miss Cha.

663
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,452
I've arrived earlier than expected.

664
00:47:55,118 --> 00:47:56,867
I'll see you when I get back.

665
00:48:13,243 --> 00:48:18,619
"Welcome, Ji Sungjoon"

666
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:50,907
Excuse me, are you okay?

667
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,662
Call an ambulance!

668
00:48:52,747 --> 00:48:54,707
-Are you okay?
-Someone is unconscious here.

669
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:55,626
Are you okay?

670
00:49:18,035 --> 00:49:19,163
Why isn't he arriving?

671
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,410
He's not getting his phone.

672
00:49:42,486 --> 00:49:43,445
Oh, no.

673
00:49:44,118 --> 00:49:45,025
So what happened?

674
00:49:46,689 --> 00:49:48,672
We're fortunate
it wasn't something serious.

675
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:50,326
I know.

676
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:53,452
Of course he would faint
considering how much he's overworked.

677
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:55,993
Yes, okay.

678
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,457
Poongho, you take good care of him.
Bye.

679
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,160
Did someone faint?

680
00:50:03,711 --> 00:50:04,794
Mr Ji.

681
00:50:06,042 --> 00:50:08,520
I was shocked when I heard
from the hospital earlier.

682
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:09,956
He collapsed at the airport.

683
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:12,285
Why was he working so hard?

684
00:50:12,744 --> 00:50:14,452
His body couldn't handle the stress.

685
00:50:18,827 --> 00:50:19,692
Jackson.

686
00:50:20,452 --> 00:50:21,508
Jackson, where are you going?

687
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:38,951
Taxi!

688
00:50:48,867 --> 00:50:49,867
Jackson, get in.

689
00:50:52,035 --> 00:50:53,160
I can't.

690
00:50:53,494 --> 00:50:55,867
I have to go see Sungjoon right now.

691
00:50:57,452 --> 00:50:58,494
I know, get in.

692
00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:09,369
No, wait.

693
00:51:37,452 --> 00:51:38,410
Go on inside.

694
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:41,910
Mr Kim.

695
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,577
It's okay, go on.

696
00:51:44,243 --> 00:51:46,744
You're really worried about him right now.

697
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:53,660
I feel so bad for doing this to you.

698
00:51:55,202 --> 00:51:58,784
You're such a nice person.

699
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:02,077
You've been so good to me.

700
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:06,624
I've always had a great time with you.

701
00:52:08,915 --> 00:52:13,249
You're so very good to me...

702
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,577
Goodness, Jackson.

703
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,535
You're such a softy.

704
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,867
Okay, then.

705
00:52:24,744 --> 00:52:28,410
Let's flip a coin one last time.

706
00:52:29,202 --> 00:52:31,535
If it's heads,
you go without turning back...

707
00:52:32,035 --> 00:52:33,786
...and if it's tails,
you'd better get ready.

708
00:52:35,868 --> 00:52:38,406
Because I won't let you go.

709
00:52:40,923 --> 00:52:41,824
Here we go.

710
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:02,081
Go, Jackson.

711
00:53:03,577 --> 00:53:04,455
It's heads.

712
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:10,077
Mr Kim...

713
00:53:12,827 --> 00:53:13,868
Thanks for...

714
00:53:15,645 --> 00:53:16,721
...hesitating for me.

715
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:26,202
If you don't leave now,
I may change my mind.

716
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,752
"Ji Sungjoon, Male"

717
00:55:19,868 --> 00:55:22,951
Wow, it's Kim Hyejin.

718
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:28,558
What brings you here?

719
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,494
Were you worried about me?

720
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:35,910
No.

721
00:55:41,327 --> 00:55:42,951
I'm here to give you a hug.

722
00:57:21,077 --> 00:57:22,202
"She Was Pretty"

723
00:57:22,702 --> 00:57:23,618
Hyejin.

724
00:57:23,702 --> 00:57:24,577
Yes?

725
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:34,369
Don't feel bad for me, and stop
making things weird between us!

726
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,867
You're so uncool.

727
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,077
It would've been nice if you met her...

728
00:57:38,744 --> 00:57:39,951
...from the very beginning.

729
00:57:41,535 --> 00:57:43,452
The two of them are holding hands!

730
00:57:43,537 --> 00:57:45,746
I thought you only wanted
to see me for 10 seconds?

731
00:57:48,494 --> 00:57:49,369
Hi.

732
00:57:49,653 --> 00:57:52,278
From now on, we'll suffer together!

733
00:57:53,035 --> 00:57:55,410
I won't leave you alone again.
