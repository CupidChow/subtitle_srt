1
00:00:02,497 --> 00:00:04,619
"Episode 9"

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,750
Oh, my gosh.

3
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,906
Oh, my gosh!

4
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:15,287
How have you been living with this hair?

5
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:19,638
Can you really erase all traces of
my naturally curly hair?

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,594
Well, it's quite a challenge.

7
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:27,146
But since you've met me,
you'll be taken care of.

8
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,186
Yes.

9
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:32,448
Oh, but how much is it going to cost me?

10
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:35,127
Straightening out your hair is
going to cost 300 dollars

11
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:38,041
and additional hair care...
It'll be 400 dollars.

12
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:39,416
400 dollars?

13
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:49,810
Yes, I'll do it!

14
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:51,873
I want to be born again!

15
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:57,898
My goodness, that's so pretty!

16
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,583
As part of our grand opening,

17
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,884
we're providing makeup demonstrations.

18
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:12,382
Isn't she much more beautiful?

19
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,750
Who would like to be next?

20
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,333
-Me!
-Pick me!

21
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:18,831
Look at that woman!

22
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,121
Who is she?

23
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:22,977
I want it! Do me, me, me!

24
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:31,416
What should we have for lunch today?

25
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:35,915
That's odd.

26
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:38,377
Why does that woman smell like Hyejin?

27
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,500
Mr. Boo!

28
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,043
You must still be drunk from last night.

29
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:42,750
Can someone get the phone?

30
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,636
Yes, this is Kim Hyejin
from "The Most" Editing Department.

31
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,750
Yes.

32
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:58,638
Yes, I'll send it over
on Friday by courier.

33
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,917
Yes, I understand.

34
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:02,184
Jackson?

35
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:03,377
That's Hyejin?

36
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,648
Judging from that
depressing bag, it must be her.

37
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,835
Yes. I've returned.

38
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,108
I'm sorry if I made anyone worry.

39
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,458
My apologies.

40
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,666
Hyejin...

41
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,083
I really missed you, Hyejin!

42
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:20,625
Seriously, what do you think you're doing?

43
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,708
-I really missed you.
-Hey, you're overreacting.

44
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:26,081
Welcome back, Hyejin.

45
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:27,956
You're much prettier than before.

46
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:30,339
I almost couldn't recognize you!

47
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,419
You look so pretty!

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,666
Thank you.

49
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,291
Are we going to greet
each other all day long?

50
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,270
Everyone get back to work.

51
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:39,951
-Yes!
-Yes.

52
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:53,317
What did you do to your hair?

53
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,124
Wait a minute. Do you have makeup on?

54
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,458
I can't see your freckles!

55
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:00,934
It used to look like sesame seeds
sprinkled over a peach

56
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:03,918
and it was your
defining feature, Jackson!

57
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,333
I don't like the new look!

58
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,184
The old Jackson was much better!

59
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,945
Why? Everyone else seems to like it.

60
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:12,359
Can you get back to work now?

61
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,992
Your new look isn't so bad.

62
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:20,649
Sister.

63
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:22,208
What?

64
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:23,600
Sister?

65
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,681
Then should I call you Brother instead?

66
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,125
I thought you were fired because of me.

67
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:42,412
Hey, your hair has grown a lot!

68
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:45,468
Someone must've fed you
well while I was gone!

69
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,999
Hyejin, I need the drafts
from the art team.

70
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,358
Yes, I got it.

71
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,708
Hello, Ms Kim!

72
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:21,416
I'm back.

73
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:24,356
Who's this person I see before me?

74
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:26,419
I'm the transfer from
the Management Support Team.

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,416
Kim Hyejin.

76
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:28,953
Mamma Mia!

77
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,773
Wait, you're her?

78
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:33,076
You must've come back from somewhere.

79
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:34,254
Go on, carry on.

80
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:35,388
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,756
-But, dear?
-Yes, ma'am.

82
00:04:40,124 --> 00:04:42,666
You are definitely Most-esque.

83
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,957
Brava, brava.

84
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:48,333
Thank you!

85
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:51,716
Jackson, Jackson, Jackson!

86
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,874
Should we have dinner after work?
Udon noodles?

87
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:56,918
No, no. Barbecue?
Or what should we eat?

88
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:59,166
Let's go and get a beverage for now.

89
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:00,407
But I'm busy!

90
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,719
Mr Ji went to go see you?

91
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,999
Are you here because
he asked you to come back?

92
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:09,999
No.

93
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:12,801
I'm here because I have a new goal.

94
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:14,796
Wasn't your goal to become
a full-time employee?

95
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,249
Not that one.

96
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,743
An immediate goal.

97
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:21,048
I'm going to get my dad
a new print machine.

98
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:27,124
I'm going to try hard
for his sake and for mine.

99
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:29,987
I'm not going to whine
and complain anymore

100
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:31,627
and just grit my teeth and work hard.

101
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:36,502
Then you'll need a great
senior by your side.

102
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,583
What?

103
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,311
Me, for instance.

104
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,793
Yes, Sungjoon.

105
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:58,792
Hello?

106
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:01,375
You've finally picked up.

107
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,463
Why is it so hard to get a hold of you?

108
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:08,765
If you didn't pick up today,
I was going to go to your hotel.

109
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:12,335
Make some time for me.
I really want to see you today.

110
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,500
If you're busy,
I can head on over to the hotel.

111
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,048
No, don't come.

112
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,337
Don't ever come here to the hotel!

113
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:23,182
I'm here all the time...

114
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:25,277
...so I'm really sick of this area.

115
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,500
Let's meet somewhere else.

116
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:30,536
Yes.

117
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,969
Okay, I'll see you later.

118
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:46,291
"The Most's 20th Anniversary Event"

119
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:49,294
"The Most" representatives
around the world

120
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,669
will attend
our 20th anniversary celebration

121
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,939
along with local artists
in fashion, beauty, and culture.

122
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,122
Shouldn't we expand our budget
for something flashier?

123
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:02,041
I agree. At the very least,
we should throw a cruise party.

124
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,977
It'll need to be fancy and luxurious.

125
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,833
Yes, then how about the up-and-coming
Super Junior as our musical guest?

126
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,102
That'd be great!

127
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,043
We can call them
and throw a celebration concert.

128
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:16,745
And have fireworks explode in the air!

129
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:19,249
Why don't we rent out
an entire resort on Jeju Island?

130
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,538
-That's a great idea.
-Great!

131
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:28,289
What's the matter, Mr Ji?

132
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:32,997
And Hyejin, what's with your expression?

133
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,831
I don't know, but...

134
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:43,291
I don't think we should go all out

135
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,606
for our 20th anniversary edition.

136
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:52,275
And it doesn't seem to go
hand-in-hand with our concept.

137
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:54,315
I was thinking the same thing.

138
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,523
Our concept is that the world changes
when the perspective shifts,

139
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,250
so I don't think we should be too flashy.

140
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:05,500
Don't you think we should
take another direction?

141
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:07,493
Anything specifically?

142
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:08,636
Well...

143
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:10,142
Well...

144
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:13,253
We can show some sort of
denial to flashiness.

145
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:17,573
How about we focus on behind the scenes?

146
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:19,555
Behind the scenes?

147
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:23,960
For instance, we can show
a flashy runway model

148
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,041
but focus on the artists
behind the scenes

149
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:27,410
who make it all come together.

150
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:30,366
Or sports therapists
behind world-class athletes.

151
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:33,750
We can shift the spotlight
to those types of people.

152
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:37,135
Come to think of it,
we also fit into that category.

153
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,408
A magazine seems really glamorous

154
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:40,818
but we lose many days of sleep

155
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:44,094
and we can't even wash properly
when preparing an issue.

156
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:46,982
Yes, it's really hard for us.

157
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,002
In order for a star to shine,
there must be darkness.

158
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,398
In other words, let's shift
the spotlight to the darkness

159
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,813
instead of the star.

160
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:59,194
People in the shadows
help those stars shine brighter.

161
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:02,368
How does "The Beauty of Shadows"
sound as our theme?

162
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:08,835
I think it's worth developing.

163
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,874
What does everyone else think?

164
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:12,146
-I like it.
-It's a good idea!

165
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:14,102
-I think it's good.
-I like it!

166
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:16,392
Hey, whose idea was this, anyways?

167
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,703
Was it Jackson again?

168
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:19,965
You've definitely got good sense.

169
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:23,073
Shouldn't we give her
a round of applause?

170
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,724
This is today's meeting log.

171
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:36,752
Thank you.

172
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,873
You're welcome.

173
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:39,706
Oh, Kim Hyejin.

174
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:42,218
-Yes?
-What should I do?

175
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:44,294
Should I buy a lottery ticket?

176
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:45,957
Pardon?

177
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:50,631
This promises great fortune
if it's returned.

178
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,152
I know I shouldn't have,
but I've read the entire thing.

179
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:01,608
And I've added a few ideas of my own.

180
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:07,049
The concept for our outdoor photo shoot

181
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,007
your idea for our
20th anniversary celebration

182
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:11,156
and those ideas in your scrapbook.

183
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:14,941
Maybe it's because you're an amateur...

184
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:18,633
...or maybe you have
a different perspective on things.

185
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:22,408
But it results in something warm.

186
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:24,885
Regardless, I think it's fresh.

187
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:28,530
I look forward to any
future ideas you might have.

188
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:32,123
Yes. I'll give it my all!

189
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,747
Oh, and Hyejin?

190
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:36,787
Yes?

191
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,132
This.

192
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:49,785
What is this?

193
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:58,007
"Kim Hyejin"

194
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:02,101
So, you won't lose your badge
and can preserve it for a long time.

195
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:05,849
It's a welcoming gift from a colleague.

196
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:09,549
Colleague?

197
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:22,782
How does it look? Does it suit me?

198
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:28,270
Thank you for the gift.

199
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,208
Oh, well...

200
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:33,696
Hyejin?

201
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:35,049
Yes?

202
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:39,924
I almost forgot the most important thing.

203
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:44,894
It's nice to have you here.

204
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:47,384
Welcome back.

205
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,591
Yes, Hyejin.

206
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:08,799
Sungjoon.

207
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:13,808
I'm sorry, but something came up...

208
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:15,944
...and I need to work
outside of my office.

209
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:18,049
Really?

210
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:20,464
You must be really busy.

211
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:23,049
That's too bad.

212
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,434
Call me once things start settling down.

213
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:27,216
Okay.

214
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,156
Oh, no! Miss?

215
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:26,871
She's been having stomach cramps.

216
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:29,901
Haven't you noticed any symptoms?

217
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:39,115
She's dehydrated and
she hasn't been eating well...

218
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:42,418
...and apparently
she hasn't had much sleep.

219
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:45,014
She must've been under a lot of stress.

220
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:56,049
Are you awake now?

221
00:13:57,675 --> 00:13:59,390
Do you remember what happened?

222
00:14:02,177 --> 00:14:03,442
You should lie still.

223
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:10,258
I knew you couldn't handle it.

224
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:13,968
In my opinion, you're not vicious enough

225
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,737
to keep that secret of yours.

226
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:17,360
You're only going to suffer more pain...

227
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:20,675
...as time goes by.

228
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:26,718
I thought it'd be over in a day.

229
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,799
But then it turned into another,

230
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:34,394
and another.

231
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:38,216
I tried to stop...

232
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:41,424
No, I tried to stop hundreds of times...

233
00:14:41,508 --> 00:14:43,341
Hyejin is supposed to be
your best friend...

234
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:47,273
...and you know about her first love.

235
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:48,908
It's the same for me.

236
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:51,352
He's my...

237
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:53,983
...first love, too.

238
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:02,910
I've never felt so sincere
towards anyone before.

239
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:07,341
It's the first time for me.

240
00:15:56,258 --> 00:15:58,373
My goodness, it burns!

241
00:15:58,454 --> 00:16:00,579
I almost burned myself.

242
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:03,214
Hyejin.

243
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:06,249
Yes, Hari! Are you okay?

244
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:10,676
What's this? You still look so pale!

245
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:13,424
I came here after work,
and you were sick in bed!

246
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:15,256
I was so worried about you.

247
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,993
It's burning!

248
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:23,741
It looks like you were prescribed
medicine for your stomach.

249
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:25,675
Were you stressed lately?

250
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:27,716
You get stomachaches
when you're stressed out.

251
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,477
I'll let them know that you're not
feeling well enough for school.

252
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:37,943
I have to be somewhere soon...

253
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:39,662
...so get yourself some medication.

254
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:41,707
If it gets worse, go to the hospital.

255
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:00,715
Hari, get up.

256
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:03,276
Get up and eat this. Okay?

257
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,216
There you go.

258
00:17:14,178 --> 00:17:15,345
Hyejin.

259
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:17,716
You said that you
didn't eat anything all day.

260
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,840
Eat this.

261
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,746
Whenever you were sick

262
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:26,400
you used to recover
with your mom's porridge.

263
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:27,840
It might not be identical

264
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:29,549
but I've tried to make it
as close as I can.

265
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:33,424
Open wide.

266
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:42,940
Is it so good that it makes you cry?

267
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:45,549
Thanks, Hyejin.

268
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:53,466
Thank you.

269
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:59,216
Thank you so much for being here for me.

270
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,007
I'm going to be good to you
for the rest of my life.

271
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:07,383
I'll be a good friend to you.

272
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:13,466
When this is ready

273
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,216
have a few spoonfuls
before you take your medicine.

274
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,466
It burns!

275
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:19,968
You might feel sick at night,
so I'll sleep with you for tonight.

276
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:21,091
If you get worse tomorrow...

277
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:22,341
It burns!

278
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,716
I can take time off...

279
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:25,093
What?

280
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:26,840
What's with the back hug?

281
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:31,144
Gosh...

282
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:37,299
Now that I'm hugging you,
it doesn't hurt anymore.

283
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,689
I'm your medicine, aren't I?

284
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:47,840
-Hyejin.
-Yes?

285
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:51,132
Did I ever tell you?

286
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,299
That I...

287
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:58,633
...really like you a lot.

288
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:08,508
What is it?

289
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,647
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

290
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:13,393
Or did something happen at the hotel?

291
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:18,070
No.

292
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:20,879
Nothing happened.

293
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:26,802
I'm really okay.

294
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,675
I really am.

295
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:46,429
Good morning!

296
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,635
-Have you arrived?
-Hello.

297
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:48,675
How are you?

298
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:51,385
Hyejin, you're looking sharp again today!

299
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:52,757
It must've cost you a fortune.

300
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:55,202
All my clothes are only 20 to 30 dollars.

301
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:57,675
But after being in
this team for a few months...

302
00:19:57,756 --> 00:20:00,424
I think I've improved my style
a little bit!

303
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:02,424
Right. Fashion isn't about money.

304
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:03,644
It's about style.

305
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:08,283
Why haven't you been
dressing like that earlier?

306
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,831
I've been paying off my student loans.

307
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,903
Please accept this as my way
of becoming Most-esque!

308
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,757
Thank you very much.

309
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:24,558
Shall we wrap this up
and go into preparations?

310
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,424
What should we do about
the opening speech that day?

311
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:30,885
Normally the chief editor
would give the speech,

312
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:33,164
but do you think
that's a good idea for us?

313
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:36,676
She'll open with
"Buongiorno" or something.

314
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:38,383
Since there will also be
many foreign guests,

315
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,963
shouldn't it be given in English?

316
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:42,547
I'll prepare it.

317
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:44,299
That concludes our meeting.

318
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,741
-Good work everyone.
-Good work!

319
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,805
I'm sorry I'm late.

320
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,675
My car stopped in the middle of the road.

321
00:20:51,756 --> 00:20:53,548
Did it stop while you were driving?

322
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:56,297
You'll get into a huge accident that way.

323
00:20:56,424 --> 00:20:58,405
Did you leave the car for repair?

324
00:20:58,486 --> 00:21:01,616
No, I came directly here
when my car started again.

325
00:21:01,697 --> 00:21:05,125
From A, B, C, and D,
doesn't A always come first?

326
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:06,385
Pardon?

327
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,580
I know it's very basic,
but let's be on time from now on.

328
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,948
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:16,559
I wasn't late on purpose!

330
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:19,791
Don't drive your car to the shop,
and get a rental.

331
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:21,270
I don't want you to get into an accident.

332
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:22,484
You must have been startled.

333
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:25,617
What's that, Jackson?

334
00:21:27,716 --> 00:21:30,174
Your employee badge
received an upgrade, too?

335
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,890
Where's the old Jackson?
Why do you keep changing?

336
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:34,718
Mr Ji gave this to me.

337
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,716
What?

338
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:37,552
Why would he do that for you?

339
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:38,996
He told me it's a welcome gift.

340
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:42,882
I accepted it because I feel like
he and I can be colleagues now.

341
00:21:42,963 --> 00:21:43,963
I was cool about it.

342
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:49,675
A welcome gift?

343
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,675
That is so cringe worthy!

344
00:21:53,756 --> 00:21:54,805
Nonsense!

345
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:00,826
A welcome gift?

346
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:02,633
That's ridiculous!

347
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:04,799
Nonsense!

348
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:08,591
He definitely isn't normal.

349
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:19,676
What's with that motorcycle?

350
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:20,840
He must be crazy.

351
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:23,446
Why is he putting himself
in danger like that?

352
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:24,672
What's going on?

353
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:27,549
Hey!

354
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:29,720
Lunatic reporter?

355
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:35,049
That's dangerous.

356
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:36,719
That's really dangerous!

357
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,091
Jackson!

358
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:39,675
Welcome back!

359
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:53,047
What are you doing?
That was so dangerous!

360
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,132
Here, take this.

361
00:22:55,216 --> 00:22:56,508
It's my welcoming gift.

362
00:22:57,258 --> 00:22:58,899
What? Why?

363
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:01,051
A moment ago you said
it was cringe worthy.

364
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:02,591
Why should I accept this from you?

365
00:23:02,675 --> 00:23:04,226
I told you it's a welcoming gift!

366
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,508
I'm welcoming you back to the team.

367
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:09,677
-So accept it, and be cool about it.
-What's this?

368
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:12,128
I got it because it was on
90 percent discount. Wait.

369
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:13,968
Well...

370
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:16,320
One, two, three, four...

371
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:18,799
It's difficult to calculate
how much better my gift is.

372
00:23:18,882 --> 00:23:23,354
Over a hundred little badge cases
can fit into the bag that I've given you.

373
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:26,176
The difference in scale is immeasurable.

374
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:27,719
Really, I'm okay.

375
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,011
Go and get a refund.

376
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:30,217
What?

377
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:32,633
Jackson, if you don't take this,
I'm really going to throw it away.

378
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:35,174
-You're still not going to take it?
-Yes, go ahead and throw it away then.

379
00:23:35,258 --> 00:23:36,132
You really don't want it?

380
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:37,675
Okay, forget this.
I'll give it to any passing dog.

381
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:38,926
Hey, Dog! Come here.

382
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:39,882
Come here.

383
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:43,995
Here, you can have this bag.
Keep your chews and bones in here.

384
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:47,130
It matches your coat, too!

385
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:48,385
Fantastic!

386
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:49,383
What is this guy?

387
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:51,371
-Are you crazy or something?
-Seriously?

388
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,577
Let me apologize.

389
00:23:53,658 --> 00:23:55,510
He may look normal

390
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:57,716
but he's got a few screws loose
in his head.

391
00:23:57,797 --> 00:23:58,878
I'm so sorry!

392
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:02,005
Hey, Dog! Take this with you!

393
00:24:02,426 --> 00:24:03,635
Don't you want it?

394
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:04,873
Seriously!

395
00:24:07,091 --> 00:24:09,174
Here, I'm wearing it. Satisfied now?

396
00:24:09,258 --> 00:24:10,341
Yes, that's good.

397
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:12,642
It looks good on you.
Wear it every day, okay?

398
00:24:12,723 --> 00:24:14,779
Jackson, let's go
and get some udon noodles.

399
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,926
I don't want to!

400
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:17,801
Come on, let's go.

401
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:20,610
Why are you so clingy?
I don't want to go!

402
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:52,704
First of all, thank you for...

403
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:56,815
No, no, not here. Put it over there.

404
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,408
-You know that must be prepared too?
-Yes, I'm aware of that.

405
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:05,096
-Where should I put this?
-The pictures face that way.

406
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:07,427
Place three by each entrance.

407
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:08,591
-You check this.
-Yes, okay.

408
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:09,921
And on the table...

409
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,066
Have you arrived?

410
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:13,471
I understand.

411
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:15,132
-Hyejin?
-Yes?

412
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:17,912
The brochures have arrived.
Go and place them at the entrances.

413
00:25:17,993 --> 00:25:19,285
Yes, I understand.

414
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:22,216
Mr Ji will arrive within 30 minutes.

415
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:23,764
-Okay, let's go.
-Yes.

416
00:25:24,132 --> 00:25:27,216
Joonwoo, go check if security is
standing next to the photo walls.

417
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,424
-Yes.
-Go with him, Yikyung.

418
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:29,508
Okay.

419
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:48,302
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

420
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:50,174
-Welcome.
-As-salamu alaykum.

421
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:51,785
Thank you for coming.

422
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,177
I took a picture with Lagerfeld!

423
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:57,719
Gosh, that's really Lagerfeld!

424
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,549
And Gisele Bundchen, John Cusack

425
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,843
and even Liu Wen.

426
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:04,132
Gisele Bundchen? My goodness.

427
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:06,748
You're definitely the feature editor.

428
00:26:07,378 --> 00:26:09,594
Seol, why isn't Mr Ji here yet?

429
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:12,542
What? He's not here yet?
He should've been here by now!

430
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:15,466
-Hurry up and check! Right away!
-Yes.

431
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:17,454
-Thank you for coming!
-Thank you.

432
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:20,273
And where's our emcee?

433
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,258
I'm going crazy here!

434
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:24,675
The emcee is here now.
Please escort him.

435
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:25,716
Yes, okay.

436
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:27,638
How do you do?

437
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:30,174
-How are you?
-Hello.

438
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:32,861
I'm not usually late,
but it's pouring outside.

439
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,177
I'm late because of traffic.

440
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:36,424
Sure I'm late, but you know me, right?

441
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:38,518
I'll take care of everything,
so don't worry.

442
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,906
Well, excuse me, but...

443
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:42,768
Is it raining a lot outside?

444
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:45,194
I just told you. It's pouring outside.

445
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:46,716
Why do you ask?

446
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:50,007
-Well...
-Okay, sure.

447
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:52,258
He's not getting his phone,
so what should I do?

448
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:55,162
There's only three minutes left,
so what are we going to do?

449
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:57,091
What will we do about the opening speech?

450
00:26:58,553 --> 00:26:59,594
Okay Joonwoo,

451
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:02,552
tell the staff to delay
the opening speech.

452
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:03,534
Yes.

453
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,902
I'm going to lose my mind...

454
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:08,677
Hello. Yes.

455
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:10,258
What's this? The script?

456
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:12,126
But I don't need a script.

457
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,466
Well, I'm really sorry,

458
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,675
but I think we're going to
have to delay the opening speech.

459
00:27:16,756 --> 00:27:17,834
Thank you.

460
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:19,633
Yes, I understand.

461
00:27:23,907 --> 00:27:26,250
Mr Emcee, please delay
the opening speech.

462
00:27:26,655 --> 00:27:28,394
Yes, I got it.

463
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:30,000
We're delaying the opening.

464
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:32,675
-What, hit it?
-Yes, yes.

465
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:34,771
You want me to start talking?

466
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,341
No, no. We need a delay. Delay!

467
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:37,299
Delay!

468
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:38,799
Oh, delay, delay?

469
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,203
All right.
You want me to hurry up? Okay.

470
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:49,260
We will now begin "The Most"
Korea's 20th anniversary celebration!

471
00:27:49,341 --> 00:27:50,799
A round of applause, everyone!

472
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:52,309
Thank you, thank you!

473
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:53,591
What's that?

474
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:57,471
We're supposed to delay
the opening, not pull it up!

475
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,093
What's going to happen now?

476
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:00,049
Thank you, everyone!

477
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:01,091
I'm going insane.

478
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:02,966
My name is Kim Jedong,
and I will be your emcee

479
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,882
for "The Most" Korea's 20th
anniversary celebration party.

480
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:06,091
It's great to be here.

481
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,818
Why don't we get this party started?

482
00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:22,024
My mom died when I was 12 years old.

483
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,983
She was involved in a car accident
on a rainy day.

484
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:28,249
After that day, I have trouble
driving through the rain.

485
00:28:30,716 --> 00:28:34,475
Did something happen to him?

486
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,091
The Beauty of Shadows.

487
00:28:57,091 --> 00:28:58,508
What will we do?

488
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:17,132
Why does it only show me eating?

489
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:35,480
What will we do?
Coming up is the opening speech!

490
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:39,649
Kim Shinhyuk,
don't you speak some English?

491
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,114
And you're shameless.

492
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:42,152
What?

493
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:46,177
You go up there instead and wing it.

494
00:29:55,813 --> 00:29:58,816
I didn't prepare anything,
and you want me to go up there?

495
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,771
Go up and just say anything!

496
00:30:00,852 --> 00:30:02,395
-Hurry up!
-Go on! Go!

497
00:30:03,784 --> 00:30:04,744
All right.

498
00:30:05,128 --> 00:30:06,086
What the...

499
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:12,494
Ciao! Ladies and gentlemen!

500
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,744
Hello, everyone!

501
00:30:18,494 --> 00:30:19,703
I can't watch this.

502
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:25,702
I am Kim Rara, the chief editor of
"The Most" Korea.

503
00:30:26,244 --> 00:30:31,705
You guys may have expected
the most trendy, most fabulous

504
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:36,670
most fantastic, most fancy
opening ceremony, right?

505
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:38,376
But look.

506
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,317
What have we got here?

507
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:44,619
It's a disaster. A total disaster.

508
00:30:44,703 --> 00:30:46,536
Mamma Mia!

509
00:30:48,204 --> 00:30:52,288
My eyebrows are decaying
just looking at it.

510
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:56,703
Everything here is so dull, ugly,

511
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:59,741
not glittery, not beautiful...

512
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:04,505
...and it is not Most-esque at all.

513
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,747
Absolutely.

514
00:31:06,828 --> 00:31:08,413
Passionately.

515
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:12,212
What on earth have they done to it?

516
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:15,340
It's garbage.

517
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,961
Has my team gone crazy?

518
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:20,929
Why these little...

519
00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:23,153
Oh, my...

520
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,532
I've spent all of my English for today.

521
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:31,983
Sorry. English subtitle, please!

522
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,077
Oh, no, Sungjoon!

523
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,288
Where are you right now?

524
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:57,773
The opening speech is almost over.

525
00:31:57,854 --> 00:31:59,144
Come and take care of our guests.

526
00:32:06,713 --> 00:32:10,672
My team is a complete disaster!

527
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:13,785
Especially during deadlines!

528
00:32:14,296 --> 00:32:16,787
Their hair becomes all greasy.

529
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,258
Oh, what about the dark circles?

530
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:24,388
They become human zombies.

531
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:28,104
Upon seeing their appearances,
I think to myself.

532
00:32:29,703 --> 00:32:34,411
The most hideous individuals
have gathered here.

533
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,785
But it's quite odd.

534
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:39,286
Because in my eyes,

535
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:42,095
they seem beautiful to me.

536
00:32:44,035 --> 00:32:49,712
The heroes who work behind the scenes...

537
00:32:50,196 --> 00:32:53,446
...as shown here in the video.

538
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,744
In order to meet deadlines...

539
00:32:56,494 --> 00:33:01,160
...our editing staff work tirelessly...

540
00:33:02,784 --> 00:33:04,111
...and I love my editing staff.

541
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:17,115
"The Most" Editors.

542
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:22,814
"The Most" assistants
and staff of the world...

543
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:25,342
...I love you all.

544
00:33:25,908 --> 00:33:32,451
Thanks to you all,
"The Most" has become the most glittery.

545
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:37,148
Thanks, I love you all!

546
00:33:54,452 --> 00:33:56,661
Our chief editor is the best!

547
00:34:01,703 --> 00:34:02,784
Oh, my!

548
00:34:04,624 --> 00:34:08,999
Aren't you supposed to be dependable?

549
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:10,827
I apologize.

550
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:14,390
I'm sure it wasn't on purpose.

551
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,119
What happened?

552
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:17,327
I apologize.

553
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:21,327
So, you're not going to make any excuses?

554
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:24,703
I apologize.

555
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,703
We'll talk about this later.

556
00:36:30,053 --> 00:36:32,424
"From A, B, C, and D,
doesn't A always come first?"

557
00:36:32,785 --> 00:36:35,411
"I know it's very basic, but
let's be on time from now on."

558
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:38,424
That's what he said to me,
and now he's the one who's late.

559
00:36:38,954 --> 00:36:39,913
I know, right?

560
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:42,577
Why can't he follow his own rules
after lecturing you?

561
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:46,536
Should we make another ladder
for the morning coffee?

562
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:49,889
But why isn't he showing himself,

563
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,412
when he almost ruined an important event?

564
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:54,038
Is he being moody or defiant?

565
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,536
I don't like him.

566
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,792
We should change his nickname
from Crazy Joon to Shameless Joon.

567
00:36:59,327 --> 00:37:00,411
Let's hurry up and make a ladder.

568
00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:01,639
I want three. Which number do you want?

569
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,928
Leave me out.

570
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:05,163
Stop talking and
get back to work, will you?

571
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:07,063
I should go and say something to him!

572
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,327
"Why don't you take your own advice?"

573
00:37:11,703 --> 00:37:12,868
You're just like Lee Youngae...

574
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:14,658
More like Lee Youngja than Lee Youngae.

575
00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:23,747
I mean,
don't you think you're going too far

576
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,560
without knowing the entire story?

577
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:28,455
We don't know the entire story?

578
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:31,498
Do you know something that we don't?

579
00:37:33,204 --> 00:37:36,038
Well, about that...

580
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,119
Kim Hyejin.

581
00:37:38,494 --> 00:37:39,494
Come see me.

582
00:37:45,744 --> 00:37:47,170
Why are you getting involved?

583
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,327
Because it's not fair!
They were making me so angry!

584
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:53,080
It makes me so mad
just thinking about it!

585
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:55,121
Didn't you hear them?

586
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:57,134
"Shameless Joon"?
"Take your own advice"?

587
00:37:57,215 --> 00:37:58,477
They don't know anything!

588
00:37:58,785 --> 00:38:00,340
I'm so mad!

589
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:07,850
How can you laugh when
they were making fun of you just now?

590
00:38:09,077 --> 00:38:11,703
Well, it's not so bad.

591
00:38:12,577 --> 00:38:13,452
What?

592
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,185
You're kind of overdoing it

593
00:38:16,475 --> 00:38:20,314
but it's nice to have
someone stick up for me.

594
00:38:20,577 --> 00:38:23,418
It's not the time for jokes right now.

595
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:24,624
I was wrong.

596
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,997
And I deserve to be made fun of.

597
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:28,206
Mr Ji.

598
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:29,940
A company is under no obligation

599
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:32,569
to understand individual circumstances.

600
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,704
As an individual

601
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:38,293
I should take complete
responsibility for my actions.

602
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:39,829
No, still...

603
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,170
Anyway, thanks again.

604
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:45,868
I guess getting you
this gift really paid off.

605
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,077
Let's go back inside.

606
00:38:56,952 --> 00:39:01,369
"She Was Pretty"

607
00:39:03,952 --> 00:39:05,519
Hyejin, I need to see you.

608
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:06,890
Yes.

609
00:39:10,035 --> 00:39:11,286
Do you want to write an article?

610
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:12,494
Excuse me?

611
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:15,476
The fairy tale concept is
originally yours.

612
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,330
Write a page about it.

613
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:19,244
It can be a feature, fashion, or beauty.

614
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:20,685
Use your discretion.

615
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:22,140
I couldn't.

616
00:39:22,452 --> 00:39:25,163
I'm not confident,
and I'm not ready for that yet.

617
00:39:25,244 --> 00:39:27,556
If it doesn't meet my expectations,
I won't use it.

618
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:29,705
Why don't you write me a few pages?

619
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,059
Keep it short, about two pages.

620
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,307
No, no, I couldn't...

621
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:36,677
I'll just focus on supporting
the rest of you.

622
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:38,160
Are you sure?

623
00:39:39,082 --> 00:39:40,945
If you're not willing, then...

624
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,286
All right, you can go.

625
00:39:43,286 --> 00:39:44,286
Well...

626
00:39:46,244 --> 00:39:49,741
Thank you for thinking of me.

627
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,633
Jackson, why don't you give it a try?

628
00:40:01,714 --> 00:40:03,751
I couldn't. That's nonsense.

629
00:40:07,035 --> 00:40:08,244
Miss Cha!

630
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:09,704
Jackson wants to give it a try!

631
00:40:09,785 --> 00:40:11,782
No, I don't.

632
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,411
What's the matter with you?

633
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,259
Just take a stab at it!

634
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:17,385
Jackson's going to do it!

635
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:19,321
Kim Shinhyuk,
when are you going to grow up?

636
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:20,414
Tomorrow.

637
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:23,036
-But she's still going to do it.
-Seriously!

638
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:32,286
Well?

639
00:40:33,994 --> 00:40:35,202
How are you feeling now?

640
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:39,243
I'm fine now.

641
00:40:39,868 --> 00:40:40,924
That's good to hear.

642
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,022
See you around.

643
00:40:47,952 --> 00:40:49,066
Well...

644
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:53,096
May I ask you for a favour?

645
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:54,213
A favour?

646
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:00,386
It's too slow!

647
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:02,585
Can't you go any faster?

648
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,374
It'll be scary because
it's only your first time.

649
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:05,829
What's scary?

650
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,202
There's no such word in my dictionary.

651
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:11,398
Then don't blame me if you start crying!

652
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:12,827
We're off!

653
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:18,119
This is amazing!

654
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:19,952
It's amazing!

655
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,374
You...

656
00:41:59,994 --> 00:42:02,461
You're drinking coffee at night again?

657
00:42:02,784 --> 00:42:03,994
I still have some work to do.

658
00:42:05,202 --> 00:42:06,619
-You're off?
-Yes.

659
00:42:09,012 --> 00:42:10,105
Do you like it?

660
00:42:10,186 --> 00:42:11,102
What?

661
00:42:13,012 --> 00:42:14,221
Renoir.

662
00:42:18,714 --> 00:42:19,631
No.

663
00:42:20,077 --> 00:42:21,536
I don't know much about him.

664
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:25,636
But when I look at this picture...

665
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,371
...it makes me feel good.

666
00:42:27,452 --> 00:42:29,123
He's my favourite painter.

667
00:42:29,746 --> 00:42:31,496
Remember the picture you saw

668
00:42:31,577 --> 00:42:33,821
when you broke
the glass casing at my house?

669
00:42:35,023 --> 00:42:36,639
Oh, yes.

670
00:42:37,927 --> 00:42:40,868
Renoir only painted his happiest moments.

671
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:44,288
He said that there was already
too much suffering in the world.

672
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:47,452
I think he wanted to convey
only happiness in his art.

673
00:42:47,827 --> 00:42:51,536
That's probably why his art
brings people happiness.

674
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,536
Why are you laughing all of a sudden?

675
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:58,286
It's nothing.

676
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:01,311
You should go back inside.
I'm going to take the bus home.

677
00:43:02,036 --> 00:43:03,412
All right, then, I'll see you tomorrow.

678
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:04,577
Goodbye.

679
00:43:35,994 --> 00:43:37,831
I'll wait with you
until your bus gets here.

680
00:43:37,912 --> 00:43:39,121
It's a nice night

681
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:40,994
and I don't feel like
going back right now.

682
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,502
I could use some fresh air.

683
00:43:55,827 --> 00:44:00,050
Have you ever heard of
"the god of opportunity"?

684
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:01,868
The god of opportunity?

685
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:03,952
No.

686
00:44:04,661 --> 00:44:06,536
I'm not that smart, so...

687
00:44:12,988 --> 00:44:14,598
It's a god looking something like this.

688
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,098
Oh, there's a pe...

689
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:18,098
I mean...

690
00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:21,428
He's naked...

691
00:44:21,513 --> 00:44:23,641
No, not his body.

692
00:44:24,315 --> 00:44:26,398
Look at his face.

693
00:44:26,825 --> 00:44:27,700
See?

694
00:44:27,781 --> 00:44:28,948
He only has hair in the front.

695
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,522
You're right! He's bald
in the back of his head.

696
00:44:31,781 --> 00:44:34,425
Since he has only hair in the front...

697
00:44:34,726 --> 00:44:37,018
...you can easily seize him
when he's in front of you...

698
00:44:37,598 --> 00:44:40,209
...but you can't chase him
if you let him turn back on you.

699
00:44:40,906 --> 00:44:45,156
That's why you can't
seize the opportunities already passed.

700
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:49,867
I'm just saying.

701
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:51,364
It just came across my mind.

702
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,283
There's your bus.

703
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:55,323
See you tomorrow.

704
00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:57,848
Oh, yes. Goodbye.

705
00:45:04,283 --> 00:45:05,242
Wait...

706
00:45:05,323 --> 00:45:07,948
How did he know that I take this bus?

707
00:45:14,656 --> 00:45:15,948
That was great!

708
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:18,700
Now I know why people ride motorcycles!

709
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,015
Maybe I should get myself a bike.

710
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:23,477
You're hooked already.

711
00:45:23,815 --> 00:45:25,919
Have a drink with me before you go.

712
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:28,448
No.

713
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:32,323
I have to go back,

714
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,156
to where I belong.

715
00:45:37,032 --> 00:45:39,489
Thanks to you, I feel so much better.

716
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:42,323
Thank you.

717
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:47,531
Wait!

718
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:52,005
I would appreciate it if you don't
tell Jackson about me for now.

719
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:54,244
I have my reasons.

720
00:45:57,438 --> 00:46:01,076
I don't want her to know
that I live in that hotel.

721
00:46:02,394 --> 00:46:03,936
Okay, I got it.

722
00:46:05,023 --> 00:46:09,078
A hotelier has to uphold
guest confidentiality.

723
00:46:09,448 --> 00:46:10,448
See you.

724
00:46:12,865 --> 00:46:13,900
Goodbye.

725
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:15,190
I'm going.

726
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:17,671
Bye!

727
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,374
Thanks for today.

728
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,592
To Sungjoon.

729
00:46:39,656 --> 00:46:43,755
How should I begin this letter?

730
00:46:47,185 --> 00:46:50,061
I chose to write you a letter...

731
00:46:51,212 --> 00:46:53,419
...because I don't think I can
get myself to tell you everything.

732
00:46:58,906 --> 00:47:01,517
Since he has only hair in the front...

733
00:47:01,796 --> 00:47:04,128
...you can easily seize him
when he's in front of you...

734
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:07,022
...but you can't chase him
if you let him turn back on you.

735
00:47:30,823 --> 00:47:32,865
"Honor Roll Certificate
for Story-telling"

736
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:39,156
"Honor Roll Certificate
for Fairy tale Writing"

737
00:47:51,984 --> 00:47:54,109
Miss Cha, I'm going to give it a shot.

738
00:47:54,823 --> 00:47:57,608
You know, the fairy tale concept

739
00:47:57,689 --> 00:48:02,024
that you wanted me to write about?

740
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:11,126
"Hyejin"

741
00:48:11,207 --> 00:48:12,427
Take this with you.

742
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,452
What's this?

743
00:48:15,533 --> 00:48:17,659
You'll have an idea of
how to develop your idea

744
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,573
if you look through that.

745
00:48:19,654 --> 00:48:22,677
I'm glad I kept it.
I thought you'd come around.

746
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:24,239
Miss Cha...

747
00:48:24,323 --> 00:48:27,653
I hate sentimentality.

748
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:32,335
If it's no good,
it's going into the trash.

749
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:33,931
Yes, I'll give it my best shot!

750
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:36,114
Thank you, Miss Cha!

751
00:48:36,197 --> 00:48:37,531
Call me Senior Cha.

752
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:39,609
Yes, Senior Cha!

753
00:49:03,906 --> 00:49:05,573
Come on, Jackson!

754
00:49:06,114 --> 00:49:08,125
Jackson, you've made the right choice.

755
00:49:08,206 --> 00:49:09,367
I heard that you're going to
write an article?

756
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:12,072
Yes, it sounds like a great opportunity,
so I'm giving it a try.

757
00:49:12,153 --> 00:49:15,529
If there's anything you need to know,
you can always ask me.

758
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:20,578
I may seem haphazard,
but I'm a very capable person.

759
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:24,609
Other competitors are trying to
scout me all the time!

760
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:29,448
You can't help yourself, can you?

761
00:49:31,948 --> 00:49:33,144
I did that on purpose.

762
00:49:33,463 --> 00:49:35,782
If I'm too perfect,
you'll probably hate me.

763
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,328
You can be clumsy and despicable
at the same time though.

764
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:41,784
You've really changed, Jackson.

765
00:49:41,865 --> 00:49:43,742
Your words are more abrasive now.

766
00:49:43,823 --> 00:49:45,205
You're like a different person.

767
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:49,201
Stop talking so we can go!
I have a lot to do!

768
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,323
-Jackson!
-What is it now?

769
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:52,823
-This.
-Okay.

770
00:50:03,894 --> 00:50:06,114
Jackson, why don't we go out
to grab some tteokbokki?

771
00:50:06,197 --> 00:50:07,485
I'm busy.

772
00:50:07,566 --> 00:50:08,909
It will only take 10 minutes.

773
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:10,677
Let's go and get some.
Can we? Can we?

774
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,538
Stop getting in my way!

775
00:50:13,362 --> 00:50:14,740
We can have some sausages, too...

776
00:50:14,823 --> 00:50:16,010
Senior Cha!

777
00:50:18,573 --> 00:50:21,239
She really changed.
She's no fun anymore.

778
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:28,073
But Jackson also has
a tendency to be great.

779
00:50:38,114 --> 00:50:39,370
On our family photo,

780
00:50:39,451 --> 00:50:41,526
I'll separate myself from
mom and my sister

781
00:50:41,607 --> 00:50:44,738
by wearing a magenta dress.

782
00:51:06,948 --> 00:51:08,709
I wasn't sleeping!

783
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:14,573
What's this?

784
00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:20,396
I don't know! Just drink it.

785
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,073
Is it going well?

786
00:51:41,323 --> 00:51:43,331
I'm going out to cover the story.

787
00:51:43,412 --> 00:51:47,486
Remember the fairy tale author who
likes to reinterpret old fairy tales?

788
00:51:47,567 --> 00:51:49,777
I'm interviewing that person today.

789
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:50,858
Really?

790
00:51:50,939 --> 00:51:52,125
That'll certainly be helpful.

791
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:53,617
Where are you holding the interview?

792
00:51:53,698 --> 00:51:55,587
I was invited to the residence.

793
00:51:55,668 --> 00:51:57,911
It's at the Yadong-dong
neighbourhood of Paju.

794
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:01,600
Yadong-dong?

795
00:52:02,113 --> 00:52:03,501
Isn't it funny?

796
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:07,652
I almost imagined it...

797
00:52:14,948 --> 00:52:16,573
Are you returning from the meeting?

798
00:52:16,656 --> 00:52:17,573
Yes.

799
00:52:18,032 --> 00:52:20,029
But what are you doing
in the parking lot?

800
00:52:20,323 --> 00:52:21,394
Do you have a new car?

801
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:23,421
I'm going to cover a story,

802
00:52:23,502 --> 00:52:25,611
and I was told driving is
the fastest way there.

803
00:52:25,948 --> 00:52:27,388
Miss Cha let me borrow her car.

804
00:52:28,615 --> 00:52:29,690
Are you going someplace far?

805
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,564
Yes. To Yadong-dong in Paju.

806
00:52:33,073 --> 00:52:36,221
Isn't this your first time
to interview someone?

807
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:37,953
Yes, it is.

808
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,113
I wish you luck.

809
00:52:43,448 --> 00:52:45,896
Yes, sir. I'll do my very best.

810
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:47,795
I'll see you when I get back.

811
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:57,073
Go for it!

812
00:53:04,197 --> 00:53:07,058
It's been a while.
Are you no longer busy?

813
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:08,255
Yes, Sungjoon.

814
00:53:08,656 --> 00:53:10,609
Let's meet for dinner.

815
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:14,698
Yes, then I'll see you there later.

816
00:53:33,531 --> 00:53:37,062
You have some creative ideas

817
00:53:37,143 --> 00:53:39,059
when it comes to your reinterpretations.

818
00:53:39,656 --> 00:53:41,681
That's really awkward!

819
00:53:41,762 --> 00:53:43,127
Again, more naturally.

820
00:53:45,531 --> 00:53:47,254
"Car Keys"

821
00:53:47,335 --> 00:53:48,698
I'm back from the field.

822
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:49,656
What are you eating?

823
00:53:50,032 --> 00:53:51,990
My car keys. Where are my keys?

824
00:53:52,073 --> 00:53:55,253
Goodness, you must've dropped
them somewhere again.

825
00:53:55,784 --> 00:53:56,951
No.

826
00:53:57,032 --> 00:53:59,992
I left my car in the company lot
and I didn't even drive for a few days.

827
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:02,037
Car keys don't just sprout legs.

828
00:54:02,118 --> 00:54:03,242
Look for them again.

829
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,281
Why?

830
00:54:06,114 --> 00:54:07,401
Why are my car keys here?

831
00:54:07,698 --> 00:54:09,163
Hyejin was supposed to take them.

832
00:54:09,615 --> 00:54:10,740
What are you talking about?

833
00:54:11,032 --> 00:54:12,119
Why would Jackson take your car?

834
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,575
She was heading to Yadong-dong in Paju

835
00:54:14,656 --> 00:54:15,531
so I let her borrow my car.

836
00:54:15,615 --> 00:54:16,698
But why...

837
00:54:16,781 --> 00:54:19,161
Did she take my keys by accident?

838
00:54:19,781 --> 00:54:21,718
But she shouldn't drive my car!

839
00:54:22,281 --> 00:54:25,576
Is it the same car that stalled in
the middle of the road a few days ago?

840
00:54:25,657 --> 00:54:27,032
Ahreum, you haven't fixed your car yet?

841
00:54:27,113 --> 00:54:29,865
I was afraid I'd get in an accident,
so I didn't drive for a few days.

842
00:54:29,948 --> 00:54:31,785
I was going to get a tow truck
to come by today.

843
00:54:31,866 --> 00:54:33,450
Let me try and call her.

844
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:34,809
No, I'm already calling her.

845
00:54:37,656 --> 00:54:41,073
Where do you get your ideas
for your interpretations?

846
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:43,906
What's this?

847
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,823
Why is it so hard to see all of a sudden?

848
00:54:46,865 --> 00:54:48,191
Do I have night blindness?

849
00:54:50,781 --> 00:54:53,498
I think you have some great ideas...

850
00:54:53,847 --> 00:54:55,156
...and I think it is...

851
00:54:56,477 --> 00:54:57,352
She's not picking up?

852
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:58,516
No, she's not picking up.

853
00:54:59,113 --> 00:55:02,302
Do you think something happened to her?

854
00:55:03,698 --> 00:55:05,373
Yadong-dong is in Paju.

855
00:55:05,656 --> 00:55:07,627
To get to Paju, you need to
get on the freeway.

856
00:55:08,113 --> 00:55:10,700
The average speed
on the freeway is 90 kilometers.

857
00:55:10,781 --> 00:55:13,492
If the car were to stall
in the middle of the freeway

858
00:55:13,573 --> 00:55:14,948
she'll lose control of the handle,
the breaks will fail...

859
00:55:15,032 --> 00:55:16,362
No way!

860
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:17,784
No, of course not!

861
00:55:17,865 --> 00:55:20,075
What do you mean, no way?
It's certainly possible.

862
00:55:20,156 --> 00:55:21,219
What's wrong with you?

863
00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:23,510
It's because I'm worried about her.

864
00:55:24,936 --> 00:55:26,103
Where's that lunatic going now?

865
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:30,823
Oh, I almost forgot.
I didn't check up on that.

866
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:35,781
Yes, Mr Ji.

867
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:37,032
Jooyoung,

868
00:55:37,113 --> 00:55:39,032
I wanted to discuss the pictures
we sent to the artists...

869
00:55:39,113 --> 00:55:41,433
Oh no, is Hyejin still not
picking up her phone?

870
00:55:42,531 --> 00:55:43,785
What's going on over there?

871
00:55:44,573 --> 00:55:45,573
What happened to Kim Hyejin?

872
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:49,200
Hyejin mistakenly took
Ahreum's car instead of mine.

873
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:50,531
But her car broke down...

874
00:55:50,615 --> 00:55:52,818
...so she was going to send it
to the repair shop later today.

875
00:55:53,865 --> 00:55:55,181
But we can't seem to get a hold of her.

876
00:55:55,406 --> 00:55:56,781
What are you saying?

877
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:07,114
"Car accident at Yadong-dong in Paju"

878
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:10,951
Are you going far?

879
00:56:11,032 --> 00:56:12,570
Yes, Yadong-dong in Paju.

880
00:56:18,197 --> 00:56:20,056
Sungjoon, Sungjoon!

881
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:12,574
If I ever go somewhere alone...

882
00:57:13,156 --> 00:57:15,281
...and I want to
write a letter to someone...

883
00:57:16,285 --> 00:57:17,850
I'll write to you.

884
00:57:18,406 --> 00:57:21,825
And if you need to borrow money,
you can call me anytime.

885
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:25,213
I'm fine.

886
00:57:25,906 --> 00:57:26,990
Thanks for lunch.

887
00:57:36,906 --> 00:57:39,407
Don't you know how to do anything right?

888
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,365
Are you sure you don't have any
other feelings for Kim Hyejin?

889
00:58:15,781 --> 00:58:18,374
The driver, where is the driver?

890
00:58:18,876 --> 00:58:20,208
How the driver's condition?

891
00:58:20,656 --> 00:58:21,860
And who might you be?

892
00:58:22,323 --> 00:58:24,334
How is that important right now?

893
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:27,573
How is the driver's condition?

894
00:58:28,531 --> 00:58:29,874
Mr Ji?

895
00:59:19,113 --> 00:59:20,281
"She Was Pretty"

896
00:59:21,698 --> 00:59:22,740
What are you?

897
00:59:23,698 --> 00:59:24,865
Kim Hyejin's guardian or what?

898
00:59:25,323 --> 00:59:26,628
Why do you keep following her around?

899
00:59:26,865 --> 00:59:27,781
Hey, Jackson.

900
00:59:27,862 --> 00:59:30,857
If things go back to the way it was,
will you go back to Mr Ji?

901
00:59:32,364 --> 00:59:33,787
Give it back to me!

902
00:59:34,114 --> 00:59:35,453
Then will you go out with me?

903
00:59:36,004 --> 00:59:36,962
What?

904
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:40,242
By tomorrow, it'll all be back to normal.

905
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:42,956
Really? Congratulations!

906
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,959
I went because it involved you.

907
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:49,848
In the beginning, you bothered me.

908
00:59:50,114 --> 00:59:53,670
But as of yesterday, I know why
I'm concerned about you.

909
00:59:54,214 --> 00:59:57,239
I like Sungjoon.
