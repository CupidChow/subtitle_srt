1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,175
1111?

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,518
Or 0000?

3
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:09,976
Of course not.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,810
It couldn't be that simple.

5
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:13,727
What is it?

6
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:20,011
Maybe...

7
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:22,598
♪ Happy birthday to you

8
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:25,485
But it's not my birthday today.

9
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:27,028
What? It's not?

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,360
But this is your locker
and bike lock combination.

11
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:33,153
If it's not your birthday,
what is that date?

12
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:35,861
My favourite day of the year.

13
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:37,986
World Left-hander's Day.

14
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,194
What? What kind of day is that?

15
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,527
What do you do on that day?

16
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:44,028
It's a day for left-handers like me.

17
00:00:56,028 --> 00:00:57,069
It's here!

18
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:59,028
World Left-hander's Day!

19
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:32,443
What's this? What are you doing here?

20
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:33,610
My goodness!

21
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:55,694
I'm asking you a question.

22
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:58,986
What are you doing in my house?

23
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,278
You left the company dinner early.

24
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:05,153
Then I went out for a phone call,
when you fell flat.

25
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:06,693
So I left the company dinner early...

26
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:09,902
and when you came out for a call,
I was knocked out.

27
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:15,361
And then you brought me back home.

28
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:16,610
By yourself?

29
00:02:16,694 --> 00:02:19,569
No, not by myself.
Lunatic... I mean, Mr Kim helped.

30
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:20,693
Where is Mr Kim?

31
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:21,777
He already left.

32
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:22,735
Then why are you still here?

33
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:24,526
I was on my way out.

34
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:27,777
How did you get into my home?

35
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:29,442
The card key!

36
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,069
Did you look through my wallet?

37
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,569
-Without permission?
-There wasn't any other way.

38
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,819
-You could've waited until I woke up.
-Right.

39
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:39,194
-Or call security to take care of me.
-Right.

40
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:41,861
I should get going.

41
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:45,486
Oh, let me help you clean this.

42
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,486
Don't touch anything.

43
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:50,735
Still, I should clean up this mess.

44
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,610
It's okay, so don't touch
anything and just leave.

45
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,736
The front door is over there.

46
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,694
I'll see you on Monday.

47
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:19,278
When did he wake up?

48
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:21,443
My liver!

49
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:22,777
Is it still there?

50
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:29,694
I'm going to lose my mind!

51
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:40,361
How am I going to go back in there?

52
00:03:40,736 --> 00:03:41,819
Gosh!

53
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,610
I took the wrong shoe by mistake.

54
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:52,569
Well...

55
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:01,569
And what kind of man knocks out
cold from a single drink?

56
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:03,902
Maybe he's the one with a bad liver?

57
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:34,361
You're so pretty.

58
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:38,028
I think I'm going to take you home.

59
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:39,817
Yes, Saehoon.

60
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:40,985
Let's hang out tonight.

61
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,028
No, I have someplace to be tonight.

62
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:45,694
You've never been to
my favourite place.

63
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,069
We'll hang out some other time.

64
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,610
I'll take these in a size eight.

65
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:59,442
We don't have any left in that size.

66
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:01,418
This is the only pair that's left.

67
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:02,963
It's a seven and a half.

68
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:05,194
-Is that so?
-Yes, ma'am.

69
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,294
But I really like this!

70
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:17,236
I'll take it.

71
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:20,986
But this shoe is smaller than normal...

72
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,568
so your feet might hurt if you wear it.

73
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:25,944
Are you really okay with that?

74
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:27,902
I'll break it in.

75
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:31,914
Whenever I see something I like,
I have to have it.

76
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:38,610
"Hyejin Print Center"
Yes, you need 2,000 more flyers?

77
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:40,944
Yes, it'll only take a day.

78
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:42,112
Okay, bye.

79
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,052
Hello, my daughter!

80
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:50,273
Have you been well?

81
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:52,557
Did you miss me?

82
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:00,403
This kimchi is really good!

83
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,569
You didn't make this yourself, did you?

84
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:04,986
I chopped the ingredients.

85
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:06,737
You do know that chopping is
important in making kimchi, right?

86
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:08,194
Of course I do.

87
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,237
Good chopping makes good kimchi.

88
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:11,488
That's right!

89
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:13,194
I'm home.

90
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:15,361
Hari, what color is this?
I've never seen it before.

91
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:17,236
I liked the pink one you
were wearing before.

92
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:19,275
Orange looks good on you, too!

93
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:21,442
Everything looks good on me.

94
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:22,777
I said I'm home.

95
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,319
I said I'm here!

96
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:28,401
-Welcome, my daughter!
-You're here.

97
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:29,736
Come, have a seat.

98
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:31,985
I thought this was my employment
celebration party!

99
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:34,028
Why did you start without me?

100
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,610
Where there are people like us...

101
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:39,236
there are also unattractive
people in the world.

102
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:41,944
Hey, are you talking about me?

103
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,153
Do you really need to ask me that?

104
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:45,694
Why, you little...

105
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:48,652
Yes, enjoy being pretty while it lasts.

106
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:51,319
I started to change about your age now.

107
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:54,610
Chances are,
you'll become like me soon!

108
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:56,361
How can you say such a thing?

109
00:06:56,652 --> 00:06:57,985
And you call yourself an older sister?

110
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,986
I'll never turn out like you!

111
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,777
Deny it all you want,
but you're Dad's daughter, too.

112
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:07,319
Look at you!

113
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:09,028
What's wrong with your dad?

114
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:13,194
I've never met someone
more handsome than your dad.

115
00:07:15,694 --> 00:07:17,610
If I ever turn into Kim Hyejin,

116
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:20,191
you'll have to sell the store
and get me plastic surgery!

117
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:21,649
Don't worry. You're pretty.

118
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:23,485
What if I end up like her?

119
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,236
You're pretty, you're pretty!

120
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:32,816
Baggy pants, where are you?

121
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:34,994
Here, baggy pants.

122
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:36,424
Maybe here?

123
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,236
There you are!

124
00:07:46,986 --> 00:07:47,940
Gosh.

125

"From: Ji Sungjoon"

"Awards"

127
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:31,153
My dream is to become
a fairy tale writer.

128
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,278
In fairy tales, it's possible
to fly without wings...

129
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:36,236
...explore the world in one day...

130
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:40,445
...or conjure up anything
you want like a magician.

131
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:44,069
I'd like to give people
a chance to imagine...

132
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:47,526
...that they're the leading character
in an adventure...

133
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:48,807
by becoming a fairy tale writer.

134
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:02,652
This is so cute.

135
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:13,236
What?

136
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:15,851
How do I still have this?

137
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:36,069
Thank you for being my umbrella.

138
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:39,527
Next time we meet, I'll be your umbrella.

139
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:08,069
I didn't imagine that
we'd actually meet again.

140
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,069
Hey!

141
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,569
You should have stopped me
from eating too much!

142
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:16,944
I've taken in too many calories!

143
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,442
I'm going to work out on our way back.

144
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:20,736
You're so annoying.
I hate you pretty people.

145
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:22,693
Yes?

146
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:24,818
It's me. You said
that you live close to work?

147
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:26,194
Who is this again?

148
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:28,194
Wait, don't you recognize my voice?

149
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:29,403
This is Han Seol!

150
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:31,235
You know, the slim and pretty...

151
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:33,736
...yet glamorous assistant
of the Beauty Department.

152
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:36,153
Oh, yes. How are you?

153
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:38,486
But why are you calling me
on the weekend?

154
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:41,153
Do you think I miss you?
I need you to do something for me.

155
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:45,861
I can't move right now because
I'm doing something really important.

156
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:48,153
I need you to go to the office
and shoot me a document by email.

157
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:49,861
-Right now?
-Yes.

158
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,194
The USB is on top of my desk.

159
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,652
The USB on your desk?

160
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:55,443
All right.

161
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:57,652
Remember not to tell anyone about this.

162
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:59,610
Yes, I won't tell anyone.

163
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,111
Thank you!

164
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,152
Let me off in front of the company.

165
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:05,694
Someone wants me
to do something for them.

166
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,068
What?

167
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:08,902
Why can't they do their own work?

168
00:11:08,994 --> 00:11:10,535
That's ridiculous. Who is it?

169
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:12,902
It's on the way anyway.

170
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:14,445
You should've refused!

171
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:16,319
You're too kind for your own good.

172
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:19,111
This is the song we used to like
when we were young.

173
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:30,812
Call back whoever that was
and tell them to do their own work!

174
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:32,986
Otherwise, they'll continue
to walk all over you!

175
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,819
Min Hari!

176
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:51,254
They're even prettier now, aren't they?

177
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:56,013
Sometimes I confuse you
for your daughter.

178
00:11:56,944 --> 00:12:00,028
Hyejung, you're doing well, right?

179
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:01,902
I miss you.

180
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:03,652
I'll contact you again soon.

181
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:21,402
Yes, I've just sent you the email.

182
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:22,736
Yes, I'll see you tomorrow.

183
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:30,278
What's that?

184
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:32,438
He must've left without
turning off the lights.

185
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,684
Someone is absent-minded.

186
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:50,077
Is this what he's clicking all the time?

187
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:58,181
This is really cool.

188
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:08,587
You've got three minutes!

189
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,921
You see, I don't like to waste time.

190
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:13,963
Top-notch cushions!

191
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,546
I guess the punk did well for himself.

192
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,754
He has nice things here.

193
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:27,754
This is nice.

194
00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:32,504
Give me my legs. Give me my legs!

195
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:34,963
What the...

196
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:44,391
Hello, this is Ji Sungjoon speaking.

197
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:57,463
"She Was Pretty"

198
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,921
Yes, I understand.

199
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,989
Absolutely not.

200
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:10,132
I'll do everything to reach that score.

201
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:14,879
The Most Korea will not be ceasing
publication after three months.

202
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:16,963
Yes, all right.

203
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:40,896
Is he coming this way?

204
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,272
Oh, no!

205
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,420
I think you have some explaining to do.

206
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:06,459
No, I...

207
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:08,459
I had some business to take care of,

208
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,710
but then I saw that your lights were on.

209
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:11,170
I didn't know that you were here.

210
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:12,636
And the mannequin...

211
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:15,170
Let me put this back for you.

212
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,163
Forget that.

213
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:18,895
How much of my phone call
did you overhear?

214
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,378
I mean, how much did you understand?

215
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:29,127
Is The Most Magazine...

216
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,710
...in danger of closing down?

217
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:39,903
Listen to me carefully.

218
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,446
If anyone on the staff
finds out about this...

219
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,446
I'm going to hold you responsible.

220
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:48,486
What?

221
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,403
If you keep your mouth shut,
that won't happen.

222
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:53,446
So I'm telling you to
keep quiet about this.

223
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:57,280
If you understand, you can leave now.

224
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:01,903
-Look here, Support.
-Yes?

225
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:04,468
Are you taking that home with you?

226
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:06,399
Oh!

227
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,468
I'll see you on Monday.

228
00:16:19,932 --> 00:16:22,890
One of my strong points
is my ability to keep secrets.

229
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:25,683
I won't tell anyone, so please let go.

230
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:42,635
Gosh, I think I overdid it...

231
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,219
I'm so tired.

232
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:49,093
Oh, Hyejin?

233
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,218
Hey, Sungjoon.

234
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:54,177
Are you done working out?

235
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:57,487
If I knew you'd be here,
I would've come here with you.

236
00:16:59,302 --> 00:17:00,215
No.

237
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:02,551
I just got here, too.

238
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,968
Let's go workout.

239
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:47,838
You look a little tired today.

240
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:49,557
Didn't you get any rest over the weekend?

241
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:51,621
I'm...

242
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,302
I'm not tired at all.

243
00:17:53,996 --> 00:17:57,413
I feel so fresh now that I've worked out!

244
00:17:58,205 --> 00:17:59,330
Where did you park?

245
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,955
I didn't bring my car today.

246
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,579
Then let me drop you off.

247
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:05,163
No, you really look tired today.

248
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:07,940
I'll find my way back,
so you go on ahead.

249
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:09,773
Are you used to people lying to you?

250
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:11,856
Really, I'm not tired at all.

251
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,149
You live in Seochodong, right?

252
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:14,732
It'll only take 15 minutes.

253
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,177
Wait, Hyejin.

254
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:20,529
You have an eyelash right there.

255
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:22,690
Here?

256
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:24,171
No, a little to the side.

257
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:26,274
Here?

258
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:28,947
Wait.

259
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:41,899
There we go.

260
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:43,564
Do you want to make a wish?

261
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:44,507
What?

262
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:47,107
What kind of wish?

263
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:50,107
You're supposed to make a wish
by blowing on your eyelash.

264
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,483
Remember that when we were young?

265
00:18:52,968 --> 00:18:55,508
It's kind of childish,
but you've got nothing to lose.

266
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,176
You don't have any wishes?

267
00:18:59,843 --> 00:19:00,968
I'm not sure.

268
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:02,343
Then I'll do it.

269
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:15,051
If my wish comes true,
I'll treat you to something nice.

270
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:18,260
You provided the eyelash,
so it's the least I can do.

271
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:31,093
Mr Ji had a girlfriend?

272
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,509
Sorry.

273
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:42,676
I'm a left-hander,
so we'll probably bump elbows often.

274
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:46,051
I ask for your understanding in advance.

275
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:49,633
Oh, I like this song!

276
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:53,538
Heath Ledger sang this song in a movie.
Have you seen that movie?

277
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:57,228
I think I have seen it.
What was the title?

278
00:19:57,313 --> 00:19:59,134
Gosh, what was it?

279
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,626
I can't remember.

280
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,108
Oh, my! You are such a bad singer!

281
00:20:23,193 --> 00:20:25,605
Hey, it's not that bad.

282
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:34,262
Hey, stop, stop.

283
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:37,055
Don't you think I'm quite a good singer?

284
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,259
Stop singing!

285
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:46,340
Gosh, stop that! Hey, my ears hurt!

286
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:48,546
I'm crying because I laughed so hard.

287
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:51,515
Whenever you're feeling down,
I guess I'll sing for you.

288
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:54,015
Go on, it's late.

289
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,057
Yes, see you.

290
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,973
Aren't you living in number 502?

291
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,231
You have a package from America.

292
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:03,858
Thank you, I'll stop by to pick it up.

293
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:07,098
Oh, your girlfriend is very beautiful.

294
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:09,474
But I'm not his girlfriend...

295
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,431
Then are you my boyfriend?

296
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:15,599
No, that's not what I meant.

297
00:21:16,912 --> 00:21:18,599
Go on home. I'm sure you're tired.

298
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:22,081
Yes, I'll be going now.

299
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:30,890
Bye!

300
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,098
Bye.

301
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:43,945
You're home?

302
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:48,486
Where are you coming from?

303
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,445
Have you been working out
this whole time?

304
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,903
Did I take that long?

305
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:55,403
When did you get home?

306
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:56,779
Right after the work.

307
00:21:56,945 --> 00:21:59,821
Hey, I went to work
and ran into Ji Sungjoon there.

308
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:03,570
We're not under any deadlines,
but I think he's working weekends.

309
00:22:03,846 --> 00:22:05,138
Oh, really?

310
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:09,862
I should wash up.

311
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,237
Okay, go ahead!

312
00:22:26,603 --> 00:22:28,603
He's here for the entire year,

313
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:30,904
but no one knows his real identity.

314
00:22:31,404 --> 00:22:35,902
We just assume
that he's a son of a wealthy family.

315
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:37,236
Here's the guest arrival list.

316
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,779
Yes, thank you.

317
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,362
It's you!

318
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,540
Right?

319
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:45,083
You treated me like
a homeless person the other day!

320
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:48,611
I'm so sorry about that!

321
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:50,195
I offended you, didn't I?

322
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:53,778
Of course, I was really offended.

323
00:22:53,863 --> 00:22:55,471
You thought I was homeless...

324
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:00,604
But smiling like that while you apologize,

325
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:02,572
I bet all the other men fall for it.

326
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:03,695
Sorry?

327
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:05,597
Because you're lean and pretty.

328
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,821
Well, since you found this for me,
I'll call it even.

329
00:23:11,112 --> 00:23:12,070
Bump!

330
00:23:12,612 --> 00:23:13,528
What?

331
00:23:13,612 --> 00:23:15,570
Fist bump!

332
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:18,909
Bump.

333
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:22,923
If we run into each other again,
let's say hello.

334
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:24,499
High five.

335
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,598
See you around.

336
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,267
He doesn't act like he's wealthy.

337
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:49,237
It's go time!

338
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:58,570
Support?

339
00:24:08,835 --> 00:24:09,897
How are you?

340
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,529
By any chance, the glass that day...

341
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:02,274
The glass?

342
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,361
Nothing, never mind.

343
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:09,278
Glass?

344
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,320
Is he asking me to repay him
for the glass frame?

345
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:20,278
Where's the puzzle piece?
Why don't I have it?

346
00:25:20,362 --> 00:25:21,695
I had it right here!

347
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,404
Don't tell me that I dropped it then!

348
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:39,028
Ma'am!

349
00:25:39,153 --> 00:25:40,320
Ma'am!

350
00:25:40,653 --> 00:25:44,112
Have you seen a puzzle piece
on the ground while cleaning up?

351
00:25:44,855 --> 00:25:45,897
A piece of what?

352
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:47,278
A puzzle piece.

353
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:53,152
It's about this big,
and shaped like this, and this.

354
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:58,917
Oh, this big, and shaped like this?

355
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:02,669
Yes! This big, and shaped like this!
Did you see it?

356
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:03,864
No, I didn't see it.

357
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:07,320
What am I going to do? I can't lose that!

358
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:19,902
What are you doing?

359
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:21,403
Are you friends with the floor?

360
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:22,854
No, it's not like that!

361
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,529
There it is!

362
00:27:11,324 --> 00:27:12,442
It's dirty down there. Get up.

363
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:15,779
Yes.

364
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:23,903
What the...

365
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:27,028
No, it's nothing.

366
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:29,151
What am I going to do?

367
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,902
What should I do?
How am I going to retrieve it?

368
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,945
I have to get in there somehow!

369
00:27:38,362 --> 00:27:40,112
Mr Ji Sungjoon, I have a delivery.

370
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,819
Is that for Mr Ji Sungjoon?
You can find him in there.

371
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:44,695
Give that to me!

372
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,679
You have a delivery.

373
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:55,733
You can leave it there.

374
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:04,278
Do you have any more business here?

375
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,487
Yes, I do! I've got serious business!

376
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:09,737
Would you like a cup of coffee?

377
00:28:11,945 --> 00:28:13,223
You've already got one.

378
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,903
Then, I'll leave you alone.

379
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,986
Oh, no!

380
00:28:20,945 --> 00:28:23,162
Oh, my, I've dropped it!

381
00:28:38,695 --> 00:28:40,445
-What are you doing?
-My goodness!

382
00:28:45,903 --> 00:28:47,015
I dropped this.

383
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,570
Excuse me.

384
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:55,362
Mr Ji?

385
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,611
Your shoes are a bit dirty,
so would you like me to shine them?

386
00:29:01,695 --> 00:29:03,570
I'm really good at fire-shining shoes.

387
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:05,278
If you take off your shoes...

388
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:07,570
I need your approval.

389
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:14,445
I don't want my shoes that shine.

390
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,445
Hyejin, are you good
at fire-shining shoes?

391
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:19,945
That's a great skill!

392
00:29:20,445 --> 00:29:22,445
Fire-shine my shoes, too.

393
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:24,320
What?

394
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:25,248
Fire-shine.

395
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,849
Oh no!

396
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:33,070
That was startling.

397
00:29:59,522 --> 00:30:02,272
Wow, Kim Shinhyuk is a certified lunatic.

398
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,653
What are you doing?

399
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:07,747
Wait, wait.

400
00:30:07,832 --> 00:30:08,843
What are you doing?

401
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:11,862
This doesn't feel right...

402
00:30:13,903 --> 00:30:17,361
I don't think we're this close.

403
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:19,320
I was working on a feature
about brotherly affection,

404
00:30:19,404 --> 00:30:22,112
but I have no idea what it is.

405
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,902
But this isn't going to work!

406
00:30:24,153 --> 00:30:26,552
I love women too much
to get to know what it's like.

407
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,278
But I'm willing to try
one more time to make sure.

408
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:35,394
I'm just joking.

409
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:38,778
We're not close enough
to play jokes on one another.

410
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:40,445
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely sure.

411
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:42,508
That's too bad.

412
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:00,933
Ta-da. Is this it?

413
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,529
You were looking for this all day.

414
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:07,570
But...

415
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:11,195
-how did you...
-Know you were looking for that?

416
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:14,069
I overheard you talking
to the cleaning lady.

417
00:31:14,153 --> 00:31:17,404
It's about this big,
and shaped like this, and this...

418
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:23,153
Oh, this big, and shaped this and this?

419
00:31:23,237 --> 00:31:25,616
Yes! This big, and shaped like this!

420
00:31:29,695 --> 00:31:33,112
Are you trying to hide that from Mr Ji?

421
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,798
Jackson, you're his childhood friend...

422
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,320
...and his first love, Kim Hyejin.

423
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:40,944
Wait, how did you...

424
00:31:41,028 --> 00:31:42,320
How did I know about that?

425
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,194
Hey, Ji Sungjoon!

426
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,404
Ji Sungjoon!

427
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,653
I'm Kim Hyejin.

428
00:31:47,737 --> 00:31:48,818
Kim Hyejin!

429
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:52,654
Why do you keep telling him your name?

430
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:54,695
Jackson, he hung up already!

431
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:58,777
I used to live next door to you,

432
00:31:58,862 --> 00:32:01,278
and we were classmates
in elementary school!

433
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:04,903
We had our first kiss together.
I'm your first love!

434
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:07,570
That's me!

435
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:10,903
It's me, Kim Hyejin! Kim Hyejin!

436
00:32:14,986 --> 00:32:16,320
Got it, punk?

437
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:29,112
You were talking on the phone
with no one else on the other line!

438
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:38,779
That hit the spot!

439
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,903
I think it's for the best.

440
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:45,986
I couldn't tell anyone,

441
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,821
and I thought I was going
to suffocate at work!

442
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:50,489
So it's good that you know.

443
00:32:51,195 --> 00:32:52,821
Why are you acting
like you're someone else?

444
00:32:53,343 --> 00:32:55,839
Because he's your superior
and you're his subordinate?

445
00:32:57,028 --> 00:32:58,083
No.

446
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:01,862
To be honest,

447
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:07,570
I'm not attractive like I used to be.

448
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:12,112
That's why I'm hiding like this.

449
00:33:17,903 --> 00:33:22,737
The Kim Hyejin that Ji Sungjoon
remembers was something else.

450
00:33:23,821 --> 00:33:28,612
She was popular and smart.
She won lots of awards...

451
00:33:29,695 --> 00:33:31,404
and she was loved wherever she went.

452
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,459
Oh, and it may be hard to believe,

453
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,195
but when I was young,
I was really, really pretty.

454
00:33:39,737 --> 00:33:40,903
You still are.

455
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:42,195
Excuse me?

456
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,976
You're still pretty.

457
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,976
What?

458
00:33:46,584 --> 00:33:48,500
Mr Kim, you're a nice person.

459
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,778
You know how to console people.

460
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,986
But I'm telling the truth.

461
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,986
Oh, my! Thank you very much!

462
00:33:55,237 --> 00:33:56,153
Oh, right.

463
00:33:56,445 --> 00:33:59,153
I need to apologize to you.

464
00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:05,278
I'm sorry for the mistake
I made to you last time.

465
00:34:05,737 --> 00:34:07,570
You've made so many mistakes.

466
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:09,195
I don't know which one
you're referring to.

467
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:10,639
Well,

468
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,902
for bringing up
your younger sister.

469
00:34:15,278 --> 00:34:18,237
You always seem so relaxed and carefree.

470
00:34:18,695 --> 00:34:21,902
I couldn't imagine you
had a deep scar like that.

471
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,631
I'm sorry again.

472
00:34:24,945 --> 00:34:26,404
It's water under the bridge.

473
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:30,779
Mr Kim.

474
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:34,821
You can consider me as
your younger sister from now on.

475
00:34:35,112 --> 00:34:36,653
-What?
-Yes, why not?

476
00:34:36,737 --> 00:34:39,653
I'll treat you like
my older brother from now on!

477
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:40,945
I'll be your younger sister.

478
00:34:41,404 --> 00:34:42,948
Come on now.

479
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,459
Then can you make me a wrap,
Little Sister?

480
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,069
-What?
-A wrap.

481
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:48,986
I thought you're going to
be my little sister?

482
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:51,369
Oh, yes.

483
00:34:51,944 --> 00:34:52,840
Big Brother.

484
00:34:54,244 --> 00:34:56,119
-A slice of garlic in there.
-Yes, sir!

485
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:57,994
-Put a perilla leaf in there.
-Yes, sir!

486
00:34:58,728 --> 00:34:59,935
Don't forget the sauce!

487
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:00,942
Yes, sir!

488
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:10,228
Stuff it in my mouth!

489
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:22,059
Why, what's wrong?

490
00:35:23,026 --> 00:35:24,851
Oh, no!

491
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:26,311
Seriously?

492
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:28,646
You had me startled!

493
00:35:43,562 --> 00:35:47,145
But what are you going to do
if Mr Ji recognizes you?

494
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,722
That will never happen.

495
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:56,903
Sungjoon takes another girl
for his first love.

496
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:57,889
What?

497
00:35:58,367 --> 00:35:59,297
What are you talking about?

498
00:36:00,103 --> 00:36:03,569
So Mr Ji thinks someone else is you?

499
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:05,852
Who?

500
00:36:05,936 --> 00:36:07,019
You don't know her.

501
00:36:07,978 --> 00:36:09,186
My avatar.

502
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,394
Avatar?

503
00:36:10,478 --> 00:36:11,854
There's someone else that looks like you?

504
00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:13,163
You can create copies of yourself?

505
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,895
It's a long story.

506
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:25,122
Maybe he's not coming tonight?

507
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:27,936
Is he busy with work?

508
00:36:40,395 --> 00:36:46,478
I'm short 40 cents,
so can you give me a discount?

509
00:36:46,563 --> 00:36:48,896
Of course not, what am I thinking?

510
00:36:57,103 --> 00:36:58,503
I'll pay for his as well.

511
00:37:03,228 --> 00:37:05,743
I'm one up on you now.

512
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:09,728
What? Then how about
you buy me some kimchi, too?

513
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,645
All right?

514
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:20,728
You could get room service
with a simple phone call at the hotel.

515
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:22,062
Why are you eating this here?

516
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:26,395
Cup ramen, eaten right
after you've had a drink.

517
00:37:26,837 --> 00:37:29,913
There's nothing better than that.

518
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:38,680
Is he really from a wealthy family?

519
00:37:39,812 --> 00:37:41,551
He's too simple of a man.

520
00:37:55,016 --> 00:37:56,061
Awesome.

521
00:37:58,352 --> 00:37:59,257
Hello, my wife!

522
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:00,770
Wife?

523
00:38:00,854 --> 00:38:01,977
Where are you?

524
00:38:02,061 --> 00:38:04,519
I'm still near the hotel.
I'll be home soon.

525
00:38:04,603 --> 00:38:07,359
Really?
I'm on the bus heading home, too.

526
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:09,370
Should I get off
so we can go home together?

527
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:12,103
Okay, come by the hotel.
We'll go home together.

528
00:38:12,895 --> 00:38:13,854
Okay!

529
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:20,311
I didn't know you swing that way!

530
00:38:20,395 --> 00:38:23,145
Because there are all sorts of people.

531
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,182
I respect all kinds of lifestyles.

532
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:28,935
Swing what way?

533
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,145
What the...

534
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:33,644
You're mistaken!

535
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,268
This is my roommate.

536
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:37,770
She's closer than a sister,
my lifelong best friend!

537
00:38:40,425 --> 00:38:42,657
Oh, that's a relief!

538
00:38:42,742 --> 00:38:47,826
With your looks,
I bet guys line up for you!

539
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:49,271
What?

540
00:38:53,241 --> 00:38:54,081
What's this?

541
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:55,313
I've lost my mind!

542
00:38:55,714 --> 00:38:58,631
Did I really eat this whole thing?

543
00:39:00,057 --> 00:39:00,928
I did?

544
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:04,854
You should've stopped me!

545
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:06,511
I'm insane!

546
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:08,770
Why did you have to eat that?

547
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:11,770
You only ate one cup ramen.

548
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:13,145
Anyway, I should thank you.

549
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:14,751
I'll be sure to repay you...

550
00:39:14,836 --> 00:39:16,919
...for what you've done for me tonight.

551
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:18,484
Good night.

552
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,073
-Goodbye.
-Bye!

553
00:39:25,478 --> 00:39:26,323
Hey!

554
00:39:30,353 --> 00:39:31,389
Dessert!

555
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:39,936
Who's he? Were you with someone?

556
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:41,103
Yes.

557
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:44,728
Remember the guest in the suite
that I mistook as a homeless guy?

558
00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:47,269
I wanted to see what he looks like...

559
00:39:47,353 --> 00:39:48,269
That's too bad.

560
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:50,228
You would've seen him
if you got here 10 seconds earlier.

561
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,311
What's this? Have you been drinking?

562
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,232
Do I smell?

563
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:57,978
-Want one?
-Yes.

564
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,520
Who did you drink with?

565
00:40:04,228 --> 00:40:05,395
A reporter that I work with.

566
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,875
Oh, the lunatic who
always makes fun of you?

567
00:40:10,311 --> 00:40:11,854
When did you get so close to him?

568
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:14,728
I know, right? We're awfully close now.

569
00:40:15,061 --> 00:40:16,478
Wow, it's chilly.

570
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:18,478
Let's go home. It's cold!

571
00:40:21,637 --> 00:40:23,010
Are you finished with the dry cleaning?

572
00:40:23,103 --> 00:40:24,058
Yes.

573
00:40:26,854 --> 00:40:28,561
-Here you go.
-Thank you very much.

574
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:32,227
Oh, I found this inside the pocket.

575
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:33,855
It's probably the receipt
so you didn't have to save it.

576
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:35,394
But there was something
written on the back,

577
00:40:35,478 --> 00:40:36,936
so I wanted to make sure.

578
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,806
"Bad drunk"

579
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,728
Drunk, bad drunk!

580
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:46,145
-Bad drunk!
-Hyejin.

581
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:53,931
You're here?

582
00:40:55,228 --> 00:40:57,019
Wow, I like your shoes.

583
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:01,876
Get in.

584
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:05,418
What do you feel like doing?

585
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,377
Should we eat something first?

586
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:09,418
Or do you want to go dancing?

587
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:12,875
I don't know.

588
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:15,145
I don't feel like anything right now.

589
00:41:19,835 --> 00:41:21,418
Should we head on
over to the Han River?

590
00:41:21,794 --> 00:41:22,752
Why the Han River?

591
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:24,502
Do you know what speedminton is?

592
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,959
Let's go to the Han River and play that.
It's really fun.

593
00:41:27,297 --> 00:41:29,168
Why, do you want to break a sweat?

594
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:32,180
I can think of other ways to do that.

595
00:41:34,043 --> 00:41:35,876
Why do you always
change the subject to that?

596
00:41:36,168 --> 00:41:37,251
What's the matter?

597
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:43,041
Why can't we listen to some
good music, eat some good food...

598
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:47,608
...and have a normal conversation
with each other?

599
00:41:48,335 --> 00:41:49,794
Are you even capable of that?

600
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,083
Hey, Min Hari. What's your problem?

601
00:41:52,168 --> 00:41:53,627
What do you mean?

602
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:11,886
I remember the scene where
Heath Ledger sang this song.

603
00:42:11,971 --> 00:42:15,861
The movie is,
"Ten Things I Hate About You".

604
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,784
You're listening to
"Can't Take My Eyes Off You".

605
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:22,979
That was the movie.

606
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,584
Hey, I'm getting off here.

607
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:37,634
What?

608
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:38,908
Hey, Hari.

609
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:41,530
Sungjoon.

610
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:43,837
Sungjoon.

611
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,585
True love?

612
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,710
What's that?

613
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:51,211
You miss him when he's not around.

614
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:52,508
Hey!

615
00:42:52,921 --> 00:42:53,838
Hurry up!

616
00:42:54,126 --> 00:42:55,105
There we go!

617
00:42:56,845 --> 00:42:58,470
And you want to be with him.

618
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:02,686
I didn't know there was
a mouse for left-handers.

619
00:43:02,851 --> 00:43:04,251
Where did you get that?

620
00:43:04,335 --> 00:43:05,691
Can you get one for me?

621
00:43:05,985 --> 00:43:07,459
You want to do everything for him...

622
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,133
...and you start acting out
of the ordinary.

623
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:16,918
And you keep seeing him
everywhere, you know?

624
00:43:17,502 --> 00:43:18,386
Sungjoon.

625
00:43:32,016 --> 00:43:33,626
But this shoe is smaller than normal,

626
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,644
so your feet might hurt if you wear it.

627
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:37,366
Are you really okay with that?

628
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,520
I wanted to let him know.

629
00:43:45,001 --> 00:43:46,293
The title of the movie was...

630
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:52,959
..."Ten Things I Hate About You".

631
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,543
Wait, who threw away
these perfectly good pair of shoes?

632
00:44:15,293 --> 00:44:16,543
My goodness.

633
00:44:19,502 --> 00:44:20,569
How do you do?

634
00:44:21,517 --> 00:44:22,356
Hey.

635
00:44:22,752 --> 00:44:23,705
Hey, how are you?

636
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,778
We're 2:1 right now, right?

637
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:29,251
I'll give you
a chance to even it up, 2:2.

638
00:44:34,168 --> 00:44:35,021
Fist bump?

639
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:36,605
Why?

640
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,148
Do you have a favour to ask of me?

641
00:44:38,668 --> 00:44:40,959
I need you to help me
curb my addiction...

642
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:43,668
...to things that don't fit me.

643
00:44:45,835 --> 00:44:47,502
Let's go and get some lunch!

644
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,126
-Yes, let's.
-Yes!

645
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:52,210
Is there anything that's good
to eat that's also not fattening?

646
00:44:52,377 --> 00:44:54,502
I have a meeting
with the art team, so I'll pass.

647
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:57,251
Hyejin, can you get me
a sandwich on the way back?

648
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:58,668
Yes, I'll do that.

649
00:45:03,731 --> 00:45:04,586
Well...

650
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:07,802
What about Mr Ji?

651
00:45:08,168 --> 00:45:10,293
Are you asking for indigestion?

652
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,875
-Let's go ourselves.
-We deserve to eat in peace, Hyejin.

653
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:17,085
-What should we eat?
-I don't know.

654
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:18,686
Shabu-shabu.

655
00:45:18,771 --> 00:45:20,329
-It's pretty good.
-Have some mushrooms.

656
00:45:20,806 --> 00:45:22,076
I don't like mushrooms,
so I don't eat them.

657
00:45:22,161 --> 00:45:23,961
-You don't?
-Seol, I love mushrooms.

658
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:24,970
Give it to him.

659
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,959
-No.
-You're unbelievable.

660
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,376
You're so mean.

661
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,752
Eat your food.

662
00:45:31,752 --> 00:45:33,835
Is he eating properly?

663
00:45:34,453 --> 00:45:35,833
He doesn't have many friends in Korea,

664
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:38,286
so he probably doesn't
have anyone to eat with.

665
00:45:39,168 --> 00:45:42,543
Have we found an outdoor location
for our upcoming photo shoot?

666
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:44,962
Yes, Miss Cha is looking into that.

667
00:45:45,293 --> 00:45:48,335
I think we'll know by early next week.

668
00:45:49,043 --> 00:45:50,085
Oh, right.

669
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,668
Did you know that Mr Ji has a girlfriend?

670
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,835
Really? Should we know about that?

671
00:45:57,085 --> 00:45:58,376
Wow, with his personality?

672
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,835
Crazy Joon has time for a woman?

673
00:46:00,126 --> 00:46:02,918
Oh my gosh. That's unbelievable.

674
00:46:03,335 --> 00:46:05,377
I saw him with his girlfriend
during the weekend...

675
00:46:05,835 --> 00:46:07,376
...and she was beautiful.

676
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,335
-She looked like a model.
-Come on.

677
00:46:09,794 --> 00:46:12,085
Being together doesn't
necessarily mean they're an item.

678
00:46:12,418 --> 00:46:16,210
Does this mean that Han Seol
and I are seeing each other?

679
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:19,001
Why are you bringing me into this?

680
00:46:19,168 --> 00:46:21,335
Don't take it so seriously.

681
00:46:21,627 --> 00:46:22,875
I don't like it!

682
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:25,835
The two of you look good together.
Both of you are slightly crazy.

683
00:46:26,543 --> 00:46:28,727
-What about you and me?
-No, absolutely not.

684
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:44,293
Yes, Hyejin.

685
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:47,668
Do you have time tonight?

686
00:46:49,293 --> 00:46:53,835
I mean, can you make some time for me?

687
00:46:55,251 --> 00:46:56,418
How are you?

688
00:46:56,918 --> 00:46:58,875
Can I have a sandwich?

689
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:02,875
No, give me two to go.

690
00:47:02,959 --> 00:47:04,001
Sure.

691
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,377
A colleague meeting?

692
00:47:07,126 --> 00:47:08,377
No, I can't go.

693
00:47:09,377 --> 00:47:11,335
I have too much work.

694
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:13,876
Hey, is Kim Joonwoo going to be there?

695
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:16,335
Really?

696
00:47:16,627 --> 00:47:17,794
Hey, I'll be there.

697
00:47:19,126 --> 00:47:21,502
There's a new pushover in the office.

698
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,167
I was about to work over the weekend,
but I got her to do the work.

699
00:47:25,251 --> 00:47:26,627
It's okay. I'll get her to cover me.

700
00:47:26,794 --> 00:47:28,043
See you later!

701
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:44,685
Hello.

702
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:23,833
Hyejin, I need you to separate this...

703
00:48:23,918 --> 00:48:26,041
-...and the make-up by concept.
-Yes.

704
00:48:26,126 --> 00:48:28,629
I need all of this done
by the end of the day.

705
00:48:28,714 --> 00:48:29,796
-I understand.
-Thank you.

706
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:31,006
-Sure.
-Thanks.

707
00:48:51,876 --> 00:48:54,126
I don't think I could do this myself,
so I need your help.

708
00:48:56,543 --> 00:49:01,043
Can you act like my fiance
in front of someone tonight?

709
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:03,335
And please don't ask why.

710
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:17,667
I'm leaving for the day.

711
00:49:17,752 --> 00:49:19,042
-Bye.
-Bye.

712
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,126
Bye.

713
00:49:24,714 --> 00:49:27,255
You need to complete that
by tonight, okay?

714
00:49:27,668 --> 00:49:28,710
Keep at it!

715
00:49:28,835 --> 00:49:29,876
Goodbye.

716
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:33,265
Yes, have you arrived?

717
00:49:33,543 --> 00:49:35,293
I'll be downstairs right away. Yes.

718
00:49:38,985 --> 00:49:41,262
Oh, no and I'm in a hurry!

719
00:49:41,418 --> 00:49:43,502
Miss Cha, you should get going.
I'll clean this up.

720
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:45,835
I'm sorry, Hyejin.
I'll leave this to you, then.

721
00:49:46,627 --> 00:49:48,377
-Goodbye!
-Thanks again!

722
00:49:58,502 --> 00:50:00,637
It burns!

723
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,418
Oh, are you leaving for the day?

724
00:50:13,683 --> 00:50:14,642
Look here, Support.

725
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:16,306
Are you an errand girl?

726
00:50:16,876 --> 00:50:17,710
Sorry?

727
00:50:17,794 --> 00:50:20,085
Why are you cleaning up after everyone?

728
00:50:22,457 --> 00:50:23,298
Forget it.

729
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:27,072
Are you going to touch
the products with your injured finger?

730
00:50:27,972 --> 00:50:29,930
Oh, my hands are filthy right now.

731
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:32,584
Go wash your hands...

732
00:50:32,668 --> 00:50:35,585
...and get a new bandage
before you touch the products!

733
00:50:36,022 --> 00:50:36,857
Yes.

734
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:39,668
But I don't have any bandages.

735
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:51,417
Goodness.

736
00:50:51,502 --> 00:50:52,751
Haven't you been here long enough?

737
00:50:52,835 --> 00:50:55,627
Don't you know where things are yet?

738
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:57,959
Is there anything you know?

739
00:50:58,293 --> 00:51:00,043
Here are the bandages, here.

740
00:51:03,337 --> 00:51:06,091
Oh, thank you.

741
00:51:18,794 --> 00:51:21,370
See, you hold it with both hands.

742
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:23,582
Then you open it.

743
00:51:24,066 --> 00:51:25,024
Do you get it now?

744
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:28,460
What's so hard about that?

745
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:32,834
Why aren't you putting it on?

746
00:51:32,918 --> 00:51:34,001
Oh, yes.

747
00:51:51,085 --> 00:51:52,585
My goodness.

748
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,293
If you do that,
the sticky ends will stick together.

749
00:51:56,585 --> 00:51:59,293
And why are you using
your mouth to put on a bandage?

750
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:01,835
You don't know how to do anything.

751
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:05,611
Take care of yourself first...

752
00:52:05,695 --> 00:52:08,355
...before you clean up after other people.
Got it?

753
00:52:13,486 --> 00:52:16,236
Why is he nagging me all of a sudden?

754
00:52:16,806 --> 00:52:18,514
Why did I get him a sandwich, anyways?

755
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:30,162
Why does it always rain
when I walk outside these days?

756
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,153
Mom.

757
00:53:22,653 --> 00:53:24,695
Mom, don't leave me.

758
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:28,528
Mom... Mom!

759
00:54:28,943 --> 00:54:30,402
My hair is all frizzy now!

760
00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:31,943
Why is there a traffic jam?

761
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:33,986
Who is that person?

762
00:54:35,236 --> 00:54:36,736
Oh, my!

763
00:54:37,156 --> 00:54:39,485
-I think he's insane.
-He's going to get hurt.

764
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:40,695
What's wrong with him?

765
00:55:14,862 --> 00:55:15,986
Mr Ji!

766
00:55:16,695 --> 00:55:18,236
Are you okay?

767
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:22,820
It's dangerous out here! Come with me!

768
00:55:35,653 --> 00:55:36,570
No.

769
00:55:38,236 --> 00:55:39,319
Mom.

770
00:55:41,695 --> 00:55:43,903
Mom, Mom.

771
00:55:44,381 --> 00:55:46,005
I'm afraid of the rain.

772
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,278
Mom, the rain!

773
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,820
Don't look over there and look this way.

774
00:56:13,445 --> 00:56:17,653
Nothing is going to happen.

775
00:56:19,862 --> 00:56:20,944
It's okay.

776
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:22,944
It's okay.

777
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:25,903
It's okay, it's okay.

778
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:28,153
Nothing is going to happen.

779
00:56:53,986 --> 00:56:55,139
It's okay.

780
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:04,027
I'm here with you.

781
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:08,778
I'll be your umbrella.

782
00:57:21,236 --> 00:57:22,319
Hyejin.

783
00:57:31,778 --> 00:57:33,652
"World Left-hander's Day"

784
00:57:33,736 --> 00:57:36,027
"And the day
I met my very first friend"

785
00:58:07,027 --> 00:58:08,361
"She Was Pretty"

786
00:58:08,445 --> 00:58:09,735
Did you buy that underwear in America?

787
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,694
Made in the USA?

788
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,611
Stop talking about underwear!

789
00:58:12,862 --> 00:58:16,527
Didn't we spend
the night together, Mr Ji?

790
00:58:16,611 --> 00:58:19,403
You have something to tell me,
don't you?

791
00:58:19,736 --> 00:58:21,611
Yes, I do.

792
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:24,944
I'll tell you everything later.

793
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:29,027
You!

794
00:58:30,778 --> 00:58:34,278
Could I have looked pretty to him?
