1
00:00:01,595 --> 00:00:04,262
I want to become a fairy tale author.

2
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:06,636
I want to write fun stories...

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,553
...that show that anyone
can become a hero.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,433
When you're young, people often ask you...

5
00:00:17,932 --> 00:00:19,683
"What's your dream?"

6
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:26,767
But as you get older,
less people ask you about your dreams.

7
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:32,350
The world makes it hard
for adults to keep their dreams.

8
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:39,516
And reality creates distance
between you and your dream.

9
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:44,849
The dream begins to feel insignificant
and then you forget about it altogether.

10
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:51,058
But before you completely
forget about the dream...

11
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:54,433
Hyejin, why don't you give it a try?

12
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:58,099
Then luckily, even as an adult...

13
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,433
...someone asked me about my dreams again.

14
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:03,890
What are we going to do without you?

15
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:04,890
It's too sad.

16
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:06,099
-It is, isn't it?
-Yes.

17
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:07,848
Hyejin, take care of yourself.

18
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:09,767
I'm going to miss you.

19
00:01:09,974 --> 00:01:11,433
Be well, Hyejin.

20
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:13,224
Bye.

21
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:16,391
Thanks for everything.

22
00:01:20,891 --> 00:01:22,808
-Goodbye.
-See you.

23
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:23,932
Go Hyejin.

24
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:28,641
-Let's go eat.
-I'm hungry.

25
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:30,475
I know a great place.

26
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:00,641
Let's get married, Sungjoon.

27
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:02,183
What? What?

28
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:04,600
I even prepared our rings.

29
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,391
This one is mine. Give me your hand.

30
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:11,141
This one is yours.

31
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,891
I'm proposing to you right now.

32
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:18,765
But instead of right now...

33
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:20,767
You want a year to yourself, right?

34
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,725
I'll come by often.

35
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:25,391
I'll come by, too.

36
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,308
You've got to give it
all you've got, okay?

37
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:38,099
I'm going to try really hard.

38
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:49,475
And so, I stayed here
in order to dream again.

39
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:55,932
Hello, everyone!

40
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,058
I'm here.

41
00:02:57,183 --> 00:02:58,140
Oh, hello.

42
00:02:58,224 --> 00:02:59,599
-Hyejin.
-It's nice to meet you.

43
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:01,266
Hyejin, welcome!

44
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:02,974
It's great to have you!

45
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,974
So I'm not the youngest anymore?

46
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:16,683
How can we make Chadol's
journey more exciting?

47
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:21,641
Instead of simply carrying
around that magic box...

48
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:23,641
...why not ride around on it?

49
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:27,266
-Maybe it could fly?
-That sounds fun.

50
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,183
It would make the story more spectacular.

51
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:31,350
We'd be able to expand
the scope of the journey.

52
00:03:31,932 --> 00:03:33,433
That was a great idea!

53
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:35,974
If a box like that exists,
I'd buy it right away.

54
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:39,599
Why don't we think of a spell?

55
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:40,558
Okay!

56
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:42,516
What kind of spell should we use?

57
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,683
Yes, are you working?

58
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:48,475
It's so nice over here.

59
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,932
The other writers are so nice,

60
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:53,600
and the story sessions are really fun.

61
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,391
What about you? Are things going well?

62
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:59,058
I'm on my way to another meeting now.

63
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:05,433
I can't handle
all of the love calls I get.

64
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:06,849
Wow!

65
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:09,974
"Success is never the final
December, 2015"

66
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:13,641
Kim Hyejin, I'm hungry. Hurry up!

67
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:17,349
Oh, my bad.

68
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:18,849
I couldn't find the sesame oil.

69
00:04:19,558 --> 00:04:20,641
Shall we eat?

70
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:22,683
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

71
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:33,433
Wow, you're having bibimbap?

72
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:35,266
That looks good.

73
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:37,183
Let me try some.

74
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:44,308
That's really good.

75
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:45,849
Sungjoon.

76
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:46,974
What?

77
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:50,183
I think you've gone crazy.

78
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:54,183
Right?

79
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:58,266
I miss you so much,
that I've lost my mind.

80
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:02,891
We won't be reunited
for another 11 months.

81
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:05,891
-This sucks!
-This sucks!

82
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,725
"Life is a long lesson in humility
January, 2016"

83
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:13,433
You're done with your meeting now?

84
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:16,849
Yes.

85
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:22,641
What about you? Getting ready for work?

86
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:27,391
Yes. But there was a snowstorm,
and there's going to be much traffic.

87
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:29,849
Is it snowing over there?

88
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,391
Hello?

89
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:39,183
Hyejin?

90
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,391
Sleep tight.

91
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:00,558
I really miss her.

92
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:05,016
"Love will find a way March, 2016"

93
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:08,683
Everyone's probably busy writing articles.

94
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:11,641
It's nice to see their names!

95
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:13,765
Customer number 140.

96
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:15,099
Yes.

97
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:21,767
-Good day!
-How are you?

98
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:27,558
1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000,
100,000, 1,000,000... 1000 dollars!

99
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:31,725
This should be enough.

100
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:38,725
Yes, Hyejin.

101
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:40,807
Were you asleep? You sound sleepy.

102
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:41,849
No.

103
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:44,641
Why are you coughing?

104
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:45,849
Did you catch another cold?

105
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:47,308
Have you taken medication?

106
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:49,224
It's not that bad.

107
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:51,141
I'm sure I'll get over it.

108
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,391
It might not get better.

109
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:56,848
I bet your fridge is empty,
and you're not eating properly.

110
00:06:56,932 --> 00:06:58,725
If you're not going to cook,
buy something to eat.

111
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:00,224
And don't forget to eat fruit.

112
00:07:01,308 --> 00:07:03,183
I should be there with you.

113
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:05,224
I told you that it's not serious.

114
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:09,099
Still, I want you to take medication
and get some rest.

115
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:13,058
Yes. I'll talk to you again soon.

116
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:19,016
Hello?

117
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:21,849
Really?

118
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:23,849
Did it arrive?

119
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:25,391
Yes, I'll be right there.

120
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,099
Hyejin, where are you going?

121
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,183
Someone's here to see me.

122
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,266
I'll be right back.

123
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:52,974
Hari!

124
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,641
Hey, you startled me!

125
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:16,391
Are you serious?

126
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,391
But, aren't you studying too hard?

127
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:24,848
Don't stop me,
I'm shooting for a scholarship.

128
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:26,599
When have I ever stopped you?

129
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:27,725
I hope you get it.

130
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:29,764
But what brings you here?

131
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:31,600
I thought you end classes late today.

132
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:35,058
My class was canceled,
so I came to see you.

133
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,475
Really?

134
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:40,974
Give me a second.

135
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:44,641
Hey, I told you not to call me.

136
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:45,724
I love you, Hari.

137
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:47,183
What the...

138
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:50,433
If you call me ever again, you're dead.

139
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:54,307
Kids these days are strange.

140
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:55,932
They just don't listen.

141
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:57,350
Who is he?

142
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:00,849
Just some college boy
who's following me around.

143
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,016
22 years old.

144
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:04,099
22?

145
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:09,349
Hey, I see the perks of
being a graduate student.

146
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:10,974
I bet you're having
a great time at school.

147
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:13,099
Hey, be quiet. Let's go eat.

148
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:18,432
♪ You are my woman
♪ You are my woman

149
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,641
Stop it.

150
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,058
♪ You're mine now

151
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:24,391
-♪ Whatever you say
-Stop it.

152
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:25,683
Stop.

153
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,767
-You'll see me as a man
-I said stop it!

154
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:30,099
Let's go.

155
00:09:32,683 --> 00:09:34,058
Aren't you going to do your hair anymore?

156
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:36,558
It's completely back to normal.

157
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,516
Oh, my hair.

158
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:41,641
It's grown back since I've been here.

159
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:43,308
I'm going to leave it as it is.

160
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:47,848
I guess it's more fitting
for you in a place like this.

161
00:09:48,475 --> 00:09:49,433
Right?

162
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:58,683
I guess you really love it here.

163
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:00,767
Why?

164
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,433
You seem relaxed.

165
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:06,808
You should've done this sooner!

166
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,474
If it wasn't for The Most team...

167
00:10:09,558 --> 00:10:11,057
...I wouldn't have had
the opportunity to come here.

168
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,141
What do you mean?

169
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:14,974
I met Author Lee
through The Most's interview...

170
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:19,391
...and she gave me a chance
to live out my dream.

171
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:26,683
I think I've finally found
the place where I belong.

172
00:10:30,516 --> 00:10:31,641
Why?

173
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,683
I'm happy for you.

174
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,968
It's true.

175
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:51,151
What is?

176
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:55,599
How could you disappear
without saying goodbye?

177
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:57,725
How could you do this?

178
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,099
And why...

179
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:03,558
Why didn't you leave me a message?

180
00:11:03,848 --> 00:11:06,807
That's why I came in person.

181
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:08,725
Do you know how worried everyone is?

182
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,725
Where are you staying?
Have you been eating?

183
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:13,433
Are you really okay?

184
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:16,475
You shouldn't have done this to yourself.

185
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,516
Mr Ji might get mad if it's too often...

186
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:56,350
...so just think of me every time
you see pickled radish.

187
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,683
It really reminds me of him.

188
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:12,141
What does?

189
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:14,767
It's nothing.

190
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:19,808
I was suddenly reminded
of Reporter Lunatic.

191
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:22,558
Oh, Mr 2024?

192
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:25,891
I hope he's doing well.

193
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:27,849
With his personality, he'd do fine...

194
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:30,558
...even if he was stranded alone
on a deserted island.

195
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:33,058
I guess you're right.

196
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:43,641
Make sure you drive safely.

197
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:45,600
Yes, I'll call you when I arrive.

198
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:03,683
"Sungjoon"

199
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:08,182
The device you have reached
is currently shut off...

200
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:09,558
His phone's turned off.

201
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:13,433
He never shuts his phone off.

202
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:15,516
Maybe his phone needs a charge.

203
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:32,558
"Calling Sungjoon"

204
00:13:47,808 --> 00:13:53,974
The device you have reached
is currently shut off...

205
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:55,224
What's going on?

206
00:13:57,391 --> 00:14:00,600
He was feeling sick.
I wonder if he's had his medication.

207
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:08,891
Why can't I get a hold of you?

208
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,350
Are you asleep?

209
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,141
Did your cold get worse?

210
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:37,433
Why isn't he responding?

211
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,849
What's going on?

212
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:31,016
The device you have reached
is currently shut off...

213
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:36,848
It's raining quite a bit.

214
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:38,641
I know.

215
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:40,266
It looks like it'll rain all day long.

216
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,058
Hyejin?

217
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:48,350
Hyejin?

218
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:51,183
Yes?

219
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:53,683
Oh...

220
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:55,848
I've made a mess.

221
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:57,891
Why are you so lost in thought?

222
00:15:58,308 --> 00:15:59,932
Is something the matter?

223
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:02,391
No, it's nothing.

224
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:31,516
The device you have reached
is currently shut off...

225
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,391
What's wrong with his phone?

226
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:37,016
I never had a hard time reaching him.

227
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:41,808
Did something happen to him?

228
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:45,016
No, I'm sure he's fine.

229
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:46,848
He's just busy, that's all.

230
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,641
Hyejin.

231
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:54,475
Hyejin.

232
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:56,433
Hyejin!

233
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:58,890
Yes?

234
00:16:58,974 --> 00:16:59,932
Oh...

235
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:03,350
You've been focused on
something else since this morning.

236
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:04,849
Is something bothering you?

237
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:06,683
No...

238
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,600
Can you stop by
the illustration team's office?

239
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,932
Their drawings are ready.

240
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:13,391
Yes, I will.

241
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:18,141
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

242
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:20,974
Where are you going?

243
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:23,475
-What?
-The door is that way.

244
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:27,433
Oh, I'll be right back.

245
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,567
I think she's having a hard time
getting a hold of her boyfriend.

246
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:34,599
She was staring at her phone all day long.

247
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:36,974
I know. She's been talking to him daily.

248
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,808
Long distance relationships aren't easy.

249
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:41,848
They're just going through a rough patch.

250
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,848
Goodbye, Author Kim.

251
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:49,016
Goodbye.

252
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:05,683
What's going on here?

253
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,808
I hope nothing's happened to him.

254
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:14,016
No, what could possibly go wrong?

255
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:20,683
Maybe his cold's gotten worse.

256
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,641
What if he's burning with a fever?

257
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,683
What if he passes out...

258
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:29,391
And with no one nearby to check on him?

259
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,016
Stop making up stories, Kim Hyejin!

260
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,558
He's just busy, that's all.

261
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:47,099
Or maybe he was driving at night
when he was caught in a rain storm...

262
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:49,570
...being reminded of his past again!

263
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,141
Stop being delusional, Kim Hyejin!

264
00:18:57,725 --> 00:19:00,433
Sungjoon overcame his trauma already!

265
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:16,224
It's ringing! It's ringing!

266
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:18,848
Yes, Hyejin.

267
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:20,848
What's the matter with you?

268
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,474
Are you okay?

269
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,141
Why didn't you pick up your phone?
Is everything all right?

270
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:27,266
Is everything okay? Are you ill?

271
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:30,350
I don't think so?

272
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:33,767
Then why didn't you pick up?

273
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:36,306
Do you have any idea how worried
I was about you?

274
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:39,350
I like your pink sweater.
It looks good on you.

275
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:41,391
Yes, I bought it not too long ago...

276
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,141
What?

277
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,391
How did you know
I was wearing a pink sweater?

278
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,932
I couldn't pick up because
I was on my way to see you.

279
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:03,308
Sungjoon!

280
00:20:05,516 --> 00:20:06,848
The rain, the rain...

281
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,516
It's raining.

282
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,516
Sungjoon!

283
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,099
Have you been well?

284
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:20,266
I was so worried about you!

285
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:22,932
You should've told me you were coming!

286
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:26,767
You weren't getting your phone,
so I was getting all sorts of ideas!

287
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:29,433
I just wanted to surprise you.

288
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:32,600
I missed you.

289
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,016
That's it? You missed me?

290
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:36,932
I was dying to see you!

291
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:39,767
Let me take a look at you.

292
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:43,891
I think I can breathe again.

293
00:20:58,141 --> 00:21:00,849
But how did you come here
all of a sudden?

294
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:06,641
I thought I could die of lovesick,
so I had to come.

295
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,350
You must be writing a lot.

296
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:15,308
No, seriously.

297
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:16,808
Are you on vacation?

298
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:19,058
No. I'm here for good.

299
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:21,848
I've taken care of my house,
my car, and my job.

300
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:23,266
What?

301
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:25,683
I thought I could do it...

302
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:28,433
...but I can't be away
from you for an entire year.

303
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,266
I can't afford to be parted from you.

304
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,725
Hey!

305
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:37,391
I thought I'd be a man
and wait for you...

306
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:39,808
...but I'm not as mature
as I thought I was.

307
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:42,350
I can't do it.

308
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:46,016
I'm going to stay with you until
you're done with your project.

309
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:50,475
Then what about your work?

310
00:21:51,683 --> 00:21:52,725
Well...

311
00:21:55,224 --> 00:21:56,932
You'll need to take care of me
from now on.

312
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:58,974
-Me?
-Yes.

313
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:02,558
Wait.

314
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:09,932
First, I'll have to cut down
on my living expenses.

315
00:22:10,183 --> 00:22:11,183
What are you doing?

316
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:12,350
Wait.

317
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,808
If I'm to take care of you now,
I'll need to calculate some things.

318
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:18,516
What else should I cut down on?

319
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:20,848
Seriously...

320
00:22:21,224 --> 00:22:23,683
Can't you tell I'm joking with you?

321
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:25,808
You know I'm a capable guy.

322
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:29,475
I've already found a place
to stay and a new job.

323
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,641
Already?

324
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:33,058
Where?

325
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:36,275
My dears, let me introduce you.

326
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:41,965
He's arrived as my replacement,
your new chief editor!

327
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,183
How do you do?

328
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,765
My name is Ji Sungjoon and as of today...

329
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:49,224
...I'll be serving
as your new Chief Editor.

330
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,558
He's so handsome.

331
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:57,724
Are you back for good from the States?

332
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:59,516
Yes. I'm back.

333
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,808
Welcome back!

334
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:02,350
Chief Editor Ji.

335
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:04,433
Welcome back!

336
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,558
Wait, wait!

337
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:08,516
What will happen to Chief Editor Rara?

338
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:09,683
Me?

339
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,475
My aunt is getting married.

340
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:15,641
What?

341
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:17,141
Really?

342
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:20,058
I feel so embarrassed.

343
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:22,308
Well, it's true.

344
00:23:23,932 --> 00:23:25,266
With whom, and when?

345
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:27,099
Well...

346
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:36,557
Rara.

347
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:40,958
My Most, Dario!

348
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:44,454
Have you heard of Dario?

349
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:47,183
The Italian model we booked
for our photo shoot last time?

350
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:48,307
Yes.

351
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:49,433
She's marrying him.

352
00:23:49,683 --> 00:23:50,974
He's 15 years younger than her.

353
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:52,974
Nonsense!

354
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:57,641
He thinks my auntie is the most
beautiful woman he's ever seen.

355
00:23:58,058 --> 00:23:59,308
I'm dizzy...

356
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,391
Rara.

357
00:24:06,932 --> 00:24:07,848
Oh, my goddess!

358
00:24:07,932 --> 00:24:09,641
Oh sole mio!

359
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:11,433
Oh, my love!

360
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:14,183
Oh, wait!

361
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:16,641
I think I've twisted my back!

362
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:19,141
Oh, no! Rara!

363
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:27,266
Oh, this looks new.
I'll take two of these.

364
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,350
Sure.

365
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:30,058
Here.

366
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,974
They gave me a diary for free.

367
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:34,932
You can have it.

368
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,141
Really?

369
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,641
It's pretty.

370
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:38,932
Thanks.

371
00:24:40,475 --> 00:24:43,432
Our chief really shocked everyone,
didn't she?

372
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,475
I know, right?

373
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,558
I envy her.

374
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:48,475
You do?

375
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:50,600
Of course I do.

376
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,266
What's going on with us?

377
00:24:55,016 --> 00:24:56,849
Are we going to...

378
00:24:57,725 --> 00:25:01,433
-Are we going to what?
-So you and I, are we going to...

379
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:03,891
You and I?

380
00:25:04,141 --> 00:25:06,168
Are we going to get married?

381
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:07,891
Of course we will.

382
00:25:08,016 --> 00:25:09,509
Really? When?

383
00:25:10,016 --> 00:25:11,058
Well...

384
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:13,558
-By the end of the year?
-By the end of the year.

385
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:15,058
Joonwoo.

386
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:17,141
I'm so happy right now!

387
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,683
Joonwoo.

388
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,224
I'm even happier than you are.

389
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:23,891
Joonwoo, where should we
have our wedding?

390
00:25:24,308 --> 00:25:25,391
Where do you want to have it?

391
00:25:25,475 --> 00:25:27,391
-Let's just find someplace cheap.
-No...

392
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:29,057
And we don't need to hire a photographer.

393
00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:30,433
That's a waste of money.

394
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,306
Hari, you'll learn to love me, too.

395
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:45,587
Hari, I love you!

396
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:54,516
I'm okay!

397
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:07,764
You're headed to your parents today?

398
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:10,848
Yes. I'll spend the night there
and be back early tomorrow morning.

399
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:13,308
Today is a really important day for me.

400
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:15,323
What kind of day?

401
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:21,600
I get to keep a promise
I made to myself today.

402
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:26,433
I'm here!

403
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,974
Why are you here?

404
00:26:28,058 --> 00:26:29,640
What brings you here, my daughter?

405
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,767
I just missed my mum and dad.

406
00:26:34,183 --> 00:26:37,056
And I wanted to see
my pretty little sister.

407
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:39,725
You'd better let go
while I'm asking you nicely.

408
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,848
You're so adorable!

409
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:46,891
What about dad?
It looks like he closed up early today.

410
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:51,058
He's gone to the sauna to take a bath.

411
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:53,308
I feel so fresh.

412
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:54,808
There he is now!

413
00:26:54,932 --> 00:26:56,683
Dad, I'm here!

414
00:26:56,808 --> 00:26:59,057
I've never been to a public bathhouse
before, but it was really refreshing.

415
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:00,516
Why don't we go again sometime?

416
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,516
Sure.

417
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:04,183
What are you doing here?

418
00:27:04,932 --> 00:27:06,683
What? You're here?

419
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:09,224
"You're here?"

420
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,016
Were you talking about here
when you mentioned that...

421
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:16,308
...you found a place?

422
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,391
Hey!

423
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:21,475
What's your problem with Sungjoon?

424
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,433
We told him to keep this from you.

425
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,974
What, why? Why would you do that?

426
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:31,475
Because you always nag us thinking
we give Brother-in-law a hard time!

427
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:33,891
When did I ever?

428
00:27:34,224 --> 00:27:36,558
-You did that all the time.
-You did every day!

429
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:42,433
We don't need gifts between
family members.

430
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:45,183
Of course not. We're family.

431
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:47,557
We're not a family!

432
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:49,474
He's busy and you're bothering him!

433
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:50,599
Welcome.

434
00:27:50,683 --> 00:27:52,099
Since you're here,
you should join us for dinner.

435
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:53,848
Busy people need to eat, too.

436
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:56,683
No, this guy is really busy!

437
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:57,891
Here's some bulgogi.

438
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,767
Be sure to chew!

439
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:02,683
Can you give him some space?

440
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,474
-Join us in the picture.
-Hurry up.

441
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,141
We can't leave our son-in-law out!

442
00:28:06,475 --> 00:28:09,848
Stop calling him your son-in-law!

443
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,058
Still, you should've told me.

444
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:20,183
I have a habit of listening to my elders.

445
00:28:26,932 --> 00:28:28,767
-Thank you.
-It's sweet.

446
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:33,308
Dad, here.

447
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:37,558
What's this?

448
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:42,058
I wanted to get you
some new equipment earlier...

449
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:44,516
...but it took longer
because I quit my former job.

450
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:46,141
Accept this.

451
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
No, no...

452
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:51,974
I can fix the equipment
if it breaks down.

453
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:53,350
Yes.

454
00:28:53,725 --> 00:28:56,433
We can't accept this.
We didn't do anything for you.

455
00:28:57,141 --> 00:28:59,266
Keep it for when you need it.

456
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:02,224
Yes. Use it as your wedding expenses.

457
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:03,932
No.

458
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:06,558
Hyejin needs to bring nothing else
with her when she marries me.

459
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:10,123
Not even a spoon. Just you, okay?

460
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:14,391
Take it!

461
00:29:15,141 --> 00:29:17,516
This was my goal.

462
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:20,641
It'll make me happy if you accept this.

463
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:22,475
Take it, Dad.

464
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:24,475
Please accept it.

465
00:29:50,932 --> 00:29:52,558
Why? Need something?

466
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:53,767
No.

467
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:01,974
You're pretty, Kim Hyejin.

468
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:21,016
-Let me help you.
-It's okay.

469
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:23,058
I want to help.

470
00:30:23,974 --> 00:30:25,808
Wait. What's this?

471
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:30,141
I feel like we're newly-weds.

472
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:32,848
Hey!

473
00:30:36,016 --> 00:30:37,224
Sungjoon!

474
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,015
You didn't need to drop me off.

475
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:47,266
You should've just gone to work.

476
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,725
I can drop you off on the way.

477
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:57,683
What's this?

478
00:32:04,141 --> 00:32:06,683
We couldn't even pay for your schooling.

479
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:12,516
Your father says that you'll
need money when you're married...

480
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:15,099
...so he's been saving up
for the last 10 years.

481
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:17,516
It's finally time to give this to you.

482
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:21,058
I'm thankful, and I'm sorry.

483
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:24,099
I love you, my daughter.

484
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:39,683
Are you crying?

485
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:42,600
Why are you crying?

486
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:46,350
Why are you giving this to me?

487
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,641
You should've gone
and replaced your equipment!

488
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:58,516
I'm so glad I'm going to be
a part of your family.

489
00:33:00,433 --> 00:33:01,849
Oh, sweetie.

490
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:07,099
Are you crying?

491
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,516
Good morning!

492
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,140
Good morning!

493
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:24,974
Good morning.

494
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:29,767
Chief Editor, Chief Editor!

495
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:31,183
Chief Editor!

496
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:37,099
You've entered the wrong office again.

497
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:43,641
You're right. I've done it again.

498
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:44,974
It's a habit... I'm sorry.

499
00:33:45,475 --> 00:33:46,849
Deputy Chief Editor Cha.

500
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:51,932
Well, you're jacket...

501
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:56,849
This is why everyone says you're clumsy.

502
00:33:58,767 --> 00:33:59,767
Oh, my!

503
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:02,099
What's wrong with this chair?

504
00:34:02,183 --> 00:34:04,641
I think we need to fix this chair.

505
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:05,848
Do we have a hammer?

506
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:06,848
A hammer?

507
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:08,308
We don't have a hammer.

508
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,641
Poongho, let me borrow this.

509
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:13,932
Are you going to polish it?

510
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:15,557
Okay, okay.

511
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:17,475
-Flip it over.
-What are you doing?

512
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:18,767
Here we go.

513
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:21,849
I'm the VP around here.
Give me the respect I deserve!

514
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,224
I'm the son of the chairman...

515
00:34:24,308 --> 00:34:25,558
Just hammer it in harder.

516
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:27,683
You really are hammering it harder.

517
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:30,308
-Thanks for letting me use this.
-Thanks.

518
00:34:31,141 --> 00:34:32,475
-But sir.
-Yes?

519
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:34,849
Was Ten really a part of this team?

520
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:37,391
Sure he was!

521
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:41,224
What kind of person was he?
He looks so cool in pictures!

522
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,350
She thinks that Lunatic Shinhyuk is cool.

523
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,848
Shouldn't we be laughing
in unison right now?

524
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:52,182
But I'm really curious.

525
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:53,600
I wonder how he's doing now.

526
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:55,099
I know.

527
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:56,516
I wonder about him.

528
00:34:56,974 --> 00:34:58,641
He's gone off the grid.

529
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:01,183
Ever since that day, he's stayed
away from social media, too.

530
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,308
That lunatic will always
survive somewhere.

531
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:07,641
But I admit that I miss him.

532
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:08,891
And his expressions...

533
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,932
We have a meeting in 10 minutes.

534
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:17,266
Yes, ma'am.

535
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,308
Hello.

536
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,725
-Are you traveling alone?
-Yes.

537
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:46,848
Where else have you been?
I'm just coming in from Switzerland.

538
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:51,016
Nice. Just here and there.
I have no affixed plans.

539
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:54,016
Oh, nice beanie by the way.

540
00:35:54,308 --> 00:35:56,433
Thank you. I got it from my friend.

541
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:00,932
Well? Do I look good?

542
00:36:01,641 --> 00:36:03,683
I guess. You look like a thimble.

543
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:05,641
How much?

544
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:06,641
10 dollars.

545
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:08,641
-Give him 10 dollars.
-What?

546
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:10,599
This is your present to me. Okay?

547
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:12,099
Thanks, I'll treasure it.

548
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,391
-Have a good evening.
-Wait, but...

549
00:36:19,391 --> 00:36:22,058
Wait. Aren't you Ten?

550
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:24,848
Yes, I am.

551
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,848
Really? Can I have your
autograph or photograph?

552
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:30,266
I'm kidding. I'm not. I wish I was.

553
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:32,475
-Dude, that's not funny, man.
-Hey.

554
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:40,224
It works every time.

555
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:45,808
Where should I go next?

556
00:36:53,891 --> 00:36:55,058
Author Kim?

557
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:56,974
Author Kim.

558
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:00,848
Author Kim Hyejin?

559
00:37:01,516 --> 00:37:02,848
Oh, hello!

560
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:05,558
-Didn't you hear me calling your name?
-Pardon?

561
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,641
Oh, I didn't know you were
calling for me.

562
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,765
Since the illustrations are complete,
we should have another meeting.

563
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,224
Would you visit our team
with the other authors?

564
00:37:15,308 --> 00:37:16,974
Yes, I'll let them know.

565
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,058
Sure. I'll see you soon, Author Kim.

566
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:20,767
Yes, see you soon!

567
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:25,891
Author Kim?

568
00:37:34,183 --> 00:37:36,848
-Number 180, Min Hari?
-Yes.

569
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:38,383
You're older than the average applicant,

570
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:40,058
but you lack any significant experience.

571
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:41,350
Oh...

572
00:37:41,974 --> 00:37:42,891
Yes.

573
00:37:43,266 --> 00:37:45,767
Didn't you work at the Ara Hotel?

574
00:37:46,852 --> 00:37:47,810
Excuse me?

575
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:51,397
I worked for the Ara Hotel
until last year,

576
00:37:51,848 --> 00:37:54,057
and I recall seeing you around.

577
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,266
Am I right?

578
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,641
Yes, that's right.

579
00:38:00,183 --> 00:38:02,891
Then why didn't you list it
as prior work experience?

580
00:38:03,308 --> 00:38:05,974
I didn't get that job on my own.

581
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:09,266
It's finally out!

582
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,141
Great work, everyone!

583
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:17,641
-It's been a long, hard year!
-I know, right?

584
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:19,516
-Great work everyone!
-Good work!

585
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:20,974
Hyejin!

586
00:38:23,808 --> 00:38:25,391
Thanks for your hard work!

587
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:29,391
Look at the color! Isn't it great?

588
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,724
I like the colors
they've used at the printer.

589
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:34,099
"The Hidden Girl's Story"

590
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:37,099
Wait. There was a girl
hidden in the background!

591
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,683
You found her.

592
00:38:40,558 --> 00:38:42,516
She's the hidden girl.

593
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:44,848
The hidden girl?

594
00:38:45,183 --> 00:38:47,308
Oh, I see her!

595
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,433
It's like she's a part of
a picture puzzle.

596
00:38:51,266 --> 00:38:53,183
A picture puzzle?

597
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:57,058
Look here. If you don't look closely,
you could miss her.

598
00:38:57,224 --> 00:38:58,641
Like she's hidden in the background.

599
00:38:59,558 --> 00:39:02,767
You're right. It's like a picture puzzle.

600
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,848
"The Hidden Girl's Story"

601
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:11,600
"Changjak Writers' Group"

602
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:19,974
"Authors: Lee Mieun, Kim Hyerang,
Kim Yijin, Yoo Limsun, Kim Hyejin"

603
00:39:30,974 --> 00:39:34,058
Did everyone work together to try
and lower our standards this issue?

604
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:41,558
There he goes again...

605
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:45,516
I want us to start over from square one.

606
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:49,600
Can't we take our work more seriously?

607
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:56,433
I knew he wouldn't like it.

608
00:39:58,433 --> 00:39:59,641
Well, Chief Editor.

609
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:02,600
That's not your office.

610
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:06,058
Oh.

611
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:09,099
Should we go ahead and change offices?

612
00:40:09,725 --> 00:40:11,099
That's not necessary.

613
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:15,516
He can't even find his room.

614
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:18,099
Please accept one of these.

615
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:20,849
-What's this?
-What is it?

616
00:40:21,224 --> 00:40:22,183
What's this?

617
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:23,808
Place it right there.

618
00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:27,974
What is it?

619
00:40:28,516 --> 00:40:29,433
Here you go.

620
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:31,308
Well...

621
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:35,474
-I'm getting married.
-What?

622
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,974
Did you meet someone overnight?

623
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:38,099
A wedding all of a sudden?

624
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:41,183
If you have the time,
please come by for some good food.

625
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:49,724
"Sungjoon and Hyejin
are getting married."

626
00:40:49,808 --> 00:40:50,932
Hye, Hye, Hye...

627
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:52,016
Jackson is?

628
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:55,765
Is this the same Kim Hyejin we know?

629
00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:00,266
This is the same Hyejin
that we know, isn't she?

630
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,016
When did the two of them hit it off?

631
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:05,974
I thought Hyejin and Shinhyuk...

632
00:41:06,558 --> 00:41:07,725
Oh, my...

633
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:10,808
Why couldn't they
make a better invitation letter?

634
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:12,808
So not Most-esque.

635
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:19,557
Wife, come out.

636
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:20,683
We have someplace to go.

637
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:22,557
Where could we possibly
need to go right now?

638
00:41:22,641 --> 00:41:26,058
Let's go someplace nice
for the last time...

639
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:28,141
...just the two of us.

640
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,599
The last time?

641
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:31,224
You're going to be married
after tomorrow.

642
00:41:31,516 --> 00:41:33,641
We need to celebrate.

643
00:41:36,433 --> 00:41:37,725
Ta-da!

644
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:40,641
Congratulations on your wedding, my wife!

645
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:45,974
Maybe I shouldn't call you that anymore?

646
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:49,932
I want you to have
a great life after marriage...

647
00:41:50,183 --> 00:41:52,641
...so I put a lot of effort into this.

648
00:41:53,141 --> 00:41:55,808
Thanks, Hari.
I've got no one else but you.

649
00:41:56,808 --> 00:42:00,016
There's one more thing
I've got to tell you.

650
00:42:00,391 --> 00:42:01,266
What?

651
00:42:05,558 --> 00:42:06,516
Ta-da!

652
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,683
"Congratulations Min Hari, you've been
offered a position with Q Hotel."

653
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,932
Then you're...

654
00:42:11,848 --> 00:42:13,099
Congratulations!

655
00:42:14,141 --> 00:42:15,848
Congratulations, Hari!

656
00:42:16,308 --> 00:42:17,808
That's great!

657
00:42:17,974 --> 00:42:19,391
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

658
00:42:19,516 --> 00:42:20,848
-Yes!
-Yes!

659
00:42:20,932 --> 00:42:23,015
For Kim Hyejin's happy marriage!

660
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,807
And for Min Hari's successful
career as an hotelier!

661
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:27,224
Cheers!

662
00:42:27,308 --> 00:42:28,391
Bottoms up!

663
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:33,475
This is so pretty.

664
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:39,808
What's taking this girl so long?

665
00:42:45,224 --> 00:42:47,015
-Ta-da!
-What's this?

666
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:48,350
There's more.

667
00:42:49,141 --> 00:42:50,266
Ta-da!

668
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:58,848
I wanted to make the bouquet
and flower crown for your wedding.

669
00:42:59,266 --> 00:43:03,433
I took a class in order to learn
how to make this!

670
00:43:05,641 --> 00:43:11,849
It's not perfect, but I really
wanted to make it for you.

671
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:14,141
Hari.

672
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:16,099
When did you find the time to...

673
00:43:17,974 --> 00:43:19,141
Thanks.

674
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:22,516
Hey.

675
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:25,433
No tears allowed!

676
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:28,725
I'm not going to cry today!

677
00:43:28,932 --> 00:43:30,016
Okay.

678
00:43:30,183 --> 00:43:31,475
I'm not going to cry.

679
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:41,725
Have a great life, okay?

680
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:45,433
I hope you're really happy.

681
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:47,848
Okay?

682
00:43:49,808 --> 00:43:52,891
Yes, I'll be happy.

683
00:43:59,308 --> 00:44:01,308
I don't care if you're married.

684
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:05,891
If I need a shoulder to cry on,
you'll have to be there for me.

685
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:14,475
Hyejin, you're so pretty.

686
00:44:17,183 --> 00:44:19,557
Now, now. I'm taking the picture!

687
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:21,767
One, two, three!

688
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:24,641
One more!

689
00:44:24,808 --> 00:44:27,058
One, two, three!

690
00:44:27,808 --> 00:44:29,391
Hari, come here. Let's take one together.

691
00:44:29,683 --> 00:44:31,767
-Wait.
-Hurry!

692
00:44:34,641 --> 00:44:36,558
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

693
00:44:38,224 --> 00:44:39,974
One, two, three!

694
00:44:52,433 --> 00:44:53,848
I'm so nervous.

695
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:03,849
Shall we?

696
00:45:06,475 --> 00:45:07,475
Yes.

697
00:45:56,058 --> 00:45:58,350
Hyejin, where are the nail clippers?

698
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:02,558
Look in the second drawer.

699
00:46:03,932 --> 00:46:04,891
Oh, right.

700
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:14,433
Yes, this is Kim Hyejin from
the Changjak Writers' Group.

701
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:18,808
Yes, Author Choi hasn't
sent us the illustrations yet.

702
00:46:19,725 --> 00:46:21,433
Yes, I understand.

703
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:24,475
It's not there.

704
00:46:25,475 --> 00:46:27,058
Did you look carefully?

705
00:46:27,974 --> 00:46:28,932
Yes.

706
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:31,099
-It's not there.
-It should be there.

707
00:46:31,683 --> 00:46:32,848
It's not.

708
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,183
Find it for me later
and trim my nails for me.

709
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:36,391
Okay.

710
00:47:03,308 --> 00:47:04,350
Give me a kiss.

711
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:13,433
What's going on here?

712
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:16,600
Kim Hyejin, you've changed.

713
00:47:17,058 --> 00:47:18,641
Weren't you a kissing maniac before?

714
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:20,183
I've got a deadline today.

715
00:47:20,391 --> 00:47:21,725
I'll make it up to you later.

716
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:25,932
I'm married, but I'm lonely.

717
00:47:27,725 --> 00:47:29,808
I'm so lonely.

718
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:35,266
I'm so very, very lonely.

719
00:47:37,725 --> 00:47:41,183
I've closed my laptop!

720
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:54,141
Hey, where are you taking me?

721
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,475
Hey!

722
00:47:57,848 --> 00:48:02,683
The wheel on my trunk is broken,
and I'd like it fixed.

723
00:48:05,308 --> 00:48:07,016
Are you the guest in room 701?

724
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:08,767
Yes, I am.

725
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:12,974
I've noticed that it was damaged,
and I already had it fixed for you.

726
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,641
Is that so?

727
00:48:15,016 --> 00:48:16,350
I'm so thankful.

728
00:48:16,641 --> 00:48:18,183
Thank you very much.

729
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:20,350
Don't mention it.

730
00:48:20,891 --> 00:48:23,224
Please enjoy the rest of your vacation.

731
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:25,725
Yes. Thank you.

732
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:37,183
"Ten's Latest Novel, the self-titled
"TEN" On Sale Now"

733
00:48:38,058 --> 00:48:39,558
He looks better in person.

734
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:02,891
"For Jackson, my best friend..."

735
00:49:09,932 --> 00:49:12,141
"For Jackson, my best friend..."

736
00:49:12,391 --> 00:49:13,725
I cancel what I said before.

737
00:49:14,433 --> 00:49:15,307
What?

738
00:49:15,391 --> 00:49:18,891
I want to cancel what I said
about not being friends with you.

739
00:49:19,308 --> 00:49:22,016
I've thought about it,
and we're just friends.

740
00:49:22,308 --> 00:49:25,266
Really good friends. Right?

741
00:49:47,932 --> 00:49:49,182
Jackson, where do you live?

742
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:50,224
Tell me!

743
00:49:50,308 --> 00:49:52,558
Let go of me, I can go by myself!

744
00:49:56,683 --> 00:49:59,058
-Stop pushing me!
-I didn't push you.

745
00:50:04,224 --> 00:50:06,015
I said stop pushing me!

746
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:07,266
I didn't touch you.

747
00:50:12,058 --> 00:50:14,600
Hey drunkard, green light.

748
00:50:20,516 --> 00:50:23,641
So the younger sister
who resembles me was a dog?

749
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:24,891
A dog that barks?

750
00:50:25,016 --> 00:50:25,932
Yes, why?

751
00:50:26,016 --> 00:50:27,391
You told me she was your sister!

752
00:50:27,475 --> 00:50:29,891
She is my little sister.
She was a member of our family.

753
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:34,849
Wait, did you think she was human?

754
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:38,058
You've got it all wrong.

755
00:50:38,433 --> 00:50:40,974
You're completely mistaken.

756
00:50:42,808 --> 00:50:43,848
Why you...

757
00:50:43,932 --> 00:50:44,974
Are you making fun of me?

758
00:50:45,058 --> 00:50:46,266
Come here!

759
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:48,848
I never told you that she was human!

760
00:50:48,974 --> 00:50:51,015
Do you want me to bite you?

761
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:52,808
Coco, don't bite people! Stay down!

762
00:50:53,308 --> 00:50:54,308
Jackson!

763
00:50:57,475 --> 00:50:58,641
Mr Kim!

764
00:50:59,058 --> 00:51:00,058
Want a taste?

765
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,266
Mr Kim, are you back for good?

766
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:04,266
Maybe?

767
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,725
Come on, Jackson.

768
00:51:29,848 --> 00:51:30,724
Wait, wait.

769
00:51:30,808 --> 00:51:31,891
I forgot the sesame seeds.

770
00:51:32,058 --> 00:51:34,767
We don't need any sesame seeds.

771
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:40,764
Let's get going before we hit traffic.

772
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:41,849
Yes, okay.

773
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,725
There we go.

774
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:48,683
-Slowly, slowly.
-All done?

775
00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:49,848
-We'll clean this when we get back.
-Okay.

776
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,391
-Let's go, let's go.
-Let's go!

777
00:51:53,266 --> 00:51:54,575
"One year anniversary picnic!"

778
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,767
I remember thinking to myself,

779
00:51:58,725 --> 00:52:02,725
that maybe heroes don't only exist in...

780
00:52:02,932 --> 00:52:04,099
...movies and dramas.

781
00:52:07,974 --> 00:52:10,475
Maybe people play the hero...

782
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:16,016
...and the supporting roles in real life.

783
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:28,848
You're so tone-deaf!

784
00:52:28,932 --> 00:52:30,475
You're helpless!

785
00:52:31,224 --> 00:52:33,600
No, my voice grows on you.

786
00:52:49,183 --> 00:52:50,391
What's wrong with you?

787
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,725
Are you having fun?

788
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:58,391
However, now I've realized something.

789
00:53:00,932 --> 00:53:07,224
Maybe I was the one who held myself back.

790
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:09,516
Write an article on fairy tales.

791
00:53:09,641 --> 00:53:11,599
You can make it a feature,
or fashion or beauty related.

792
00:53:11,683 --> 00:53:12,849
It's up to you.

793
00:53:13,016 --> 00:53:14,308
I couldn't...

794
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:17,308
I'm not ready for something like that.

795
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,767
Why don't you just give it a try?
Make it short, about two pages.

796
00:53:20,974 --> 00:53:22,433
No, no...

797
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:23,808
How could I?

798
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:28,141
Grounded by reality,
you tend to give up easily.

799
00:53:28,475 --> 00:53:34,808
I wonder if I was the one
who turned off my own spotlight.

800
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:46,600
People say that life is not a fairy tale.

801
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:47,765
It's so cute.

802
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:51,891
But sometimes, like a child or a fool...

803
00:53:52,808 --> 00:53:56,474
...maybe we should dream of fairy tales.

804
00:53:56,558 --> 00:53:57,848
Thank you for the meal!

805
00:54:05,808 --> 00:54:07,849
Why? Why?

806
00:54:08,308 --> 00:54:09,224
Why?

807
00:54:09,516 --> 00:54:10,848
My molar...

808
00:54:11,391 --> 00:54:13,016
I think I've cracked my jaw!

809
00:54:13,475 --> 00:54:15,266
Stop playing around!

810
00:54:17,725 --> 00:54:19,516
This is so good. Try some.

811
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:22,308
Try it.

812
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:23,891
How is it?

813
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:25,475
It's good.

814
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:27,683
-Is it good?
-It's good!

815
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:33,266
If we don't turn off our own spotlights,

816
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,558
if we never give up on our dreams,

817
00:54:36,808 --> 00:54:43,058
we may be able to create
our very own fairy tales.

818
00:54:45,141 --> 00:54:46,600
For example...

819
00:54:47,141 --> 00:54:52,475
"Doldol was happy to
find himself back with his family."

820
00:54:55,808 --> 00:54:59,516
"There was a bright red mailbox
in front of Sookhui's house."

821
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:04,516
"And at a very young age, Sookhui..."

822
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,725
Hey!

823
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:19,516
They say that first-loves
are impossible in real life,

824
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,308
but when they happen,

825
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:25,767
and when you recover dreams
from when you were a child,

826
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:30,516
you never know when miracles
will come and find you.

827
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,308
Give me your hand.
