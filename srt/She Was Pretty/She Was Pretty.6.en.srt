1
00:00:17,413 --> 00:00:18,657
Are you crazy?

2
00:00:18,737 --> 00:00:19,902
I'm so sorry!

3
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:22,391
Hurry, hurry!

4
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:24,814
Get up!

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,746
I'm so sorry!

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,413
What am I going to do? You're shivering!

7
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:35,246
Are you cold?

8
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,061
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

9
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:42,662
It's okay.

10
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:44,428
Just leave.

11
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:46,428
How can I just leave you?

12
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,617
Should I take you home myself?

13
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,546
Just go, I tell you.

14
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,945
I can't leave you in this condition.

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,728
Please.

16
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:02,261
Please, just go.

17
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:07,128
I'm asking you.

18
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:28,625
Yes, Mr Driver?

19
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:31,968
It's cold, so please bump up
the heater for him.

20
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,726
Please take him home safely.

21
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:35,917
Yes, thank you.

22
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:37,609
It's so cold!

23
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:50,653
Sungjoon, why aren't you coming?

24
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:53,495
Oh, I'm the driver.

25
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:55,795
My customer isn't feeling very well...

26
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:58,128
...so I'm driving him home now.

27
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:00,078
What?

28
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:03,602
I'm sorry, but I have to get going!

29
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:04,516
What?

30
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:06,418
I'll explain everything later.
Sorry again.

31
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:08,980
Hey, what?

32
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,552
I dressed up for nothing!

33
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:17,553
I should get some selfies.

34
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:36,900
Oh, I don't know his unit number.

35
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:40,556
Aren't you the guy from unit 502?

36
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,109
Sungjoon.

37
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,103
Sungjoon.

38
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:14,461
What?

39
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:17,728
Sungjoon.

40
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:29,036
It's so hot!

41
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:40,445
Why is it so noisy?

42
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:46,642
Should I put some vinegar in here?

43
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:50,077
Here goes nothing.

44
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:52,547
Hyejin.

45
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:54,161
Yes, Sungjoon.

46
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:56,295
How's your fever?

47
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:58,395
I'm feeling better now.

48
00:04:01,228 --> 00:04:02,395
How did you get here?

49
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:06,461
I called you, and the driver told me
that you're sick.

50
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:08,446
The soup's almost ready.

51
00:04:08,526 --> 00:04:09,639
Go and lie down some more.

52
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,376
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

53
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:13,482
I'm sorry. I didn't feel very well.

54
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:16,679
But why did you want to see me today?

55
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,244
Oh, well...

56
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,117
I had your jacket dry cleaned
and I wanted to return it to you.

57
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:26,557
I didn't want you
to walk around without a jacket.

58
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,697
I have a lot of clothes,
so I wouldn't have needed it.

59
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:33,067
I told you that I didn't need it
back right away.

60
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:37,485
I have a habit of quickly
returning borrowed things.

61
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:41,184
Go and get some more rest.
I'll call you when it's done.

62
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:42,423
Hurry, hurry.

63
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:43,835
Hurry!

64
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,458
Why did he behave like that?

65
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:06,362
It was pouring rain.

66
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:09,420
And I was looking at him like this...

67
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:14,295
...when he did this to me.

68
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:19,322
Could I have looked pretty to him?

69
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:23,236
Do you think
you're some kind of princess?

70
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,392
I'm sure he caught a cold.

71
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:28,227
I wonder if he took some medication.

72
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:38,412
I'd be going overboard
if I went over to his place, right?

73
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:39,832
Yes, completely overboard.

74
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,471
Leave it with the security guy?
Or have it delivered to him?

75
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:46,708
Yes, Mr Kim.

76
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:49,725
Hey, why do you still call me that?
Mr Kim?

77
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:51,437
We're not even at work.

78
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:54,469
It's raining, so I was wondering
what my little sister was doing.

79
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:56,675
Join me for some makgeolli
and onion pancakes?

80
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,420
But there's something
I have to take care of.

81
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:01,796
Well, Shinhyuk.

82
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,211
Can you do me a favour?

83
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:06,323
No, no, never mind.

84
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,470
Why are you having a hard time asking me?

85
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,032
Tell me, what is it?

86
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:15,636
Sungjoon was caught in the rain
earlier, and I was wondering...

87
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,251
...if you could deliver some medicine
and porridge to him for me...

88
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,792
-What?
-Never mind.

89
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,240
What am I talking about?

90
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,980
Don't worry about it, I'll go myself.

91
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:30,388
What?

92
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:32,317
You don't even have
the courage to tell him who you are...

93
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:34,294
...and you're going to get him porridge?

94
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:40,297
I would kill for some makgeolli...

95
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:42,312
...and some onion pancakes
on a day like this.

96
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:48,185
Jackson, even if you go,
it won't be pleasant.

97
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,307
Seriously!

98
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:03,629
-Yes?
-I'm sure, you know me by now.

99
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:06,446
I don't really run errands
or take care of sick people.

100
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,254
But who's asking me for a favour?
My little sister.

101
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:10,250
What?

102
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,905
Therefore, I'm willing
to deliver the porridge for you.

103
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:13,956
Really?

104
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:17,666
Thank you very much, Mr...
I mean, Shinhyuk.

105
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:21,446
But what will you do
for your big brother?

106
00:07:22,672 --> 00:07:25,079
-What?
-Haven't you heard of "Give and take"?

107
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:27,175
If I do this for you...

108
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:29,967
...you're going to have to grant me
three of my own wishes. Okay?

109
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,889
What, why do I have to do three?

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,984
We can forget the whole thing.
I have nothing to lose.

111
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:37,605
-I'm hanging up.
-Okay, okay!

112
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:39,850
Okay, I'll do three favours for you.

113
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,228
You better not forget
about this like you did last time.

114
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,252
Forget this, repeat as I say.

115
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:51,778
"I, Kim Hyejin, promise to
grant Kim Shinhyuk three favours."

116
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:54,667
Why are you making me take an oath?

117
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:56,776
I'm hanging up now.

118
00:07:56,856 --> 00:08:00,569
I, Kim Hyejin, promise to
grant Kim Shinhyuk three favours!

119
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:01,813
Good.

120
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:11,994
Sungjoon, it's finished!

121
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:19,695
Sungjoon.

122
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:22,562
He's fallen asleep again.

123
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,588
He can't take his medication
unless he eats first.

124
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,236
Goodness, I've seen women
come through here...

125
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:54,603
...but never a gigolo before.

126
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:01,686
What's this?

127
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:05,022
You abandoned me earlier
so what are you doing here?

128
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,896
I'm so sorry for earlier.

129
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:09,663
I know someone here
and there was an emergency.

130
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:13,762
Mr Suite 2024, what are you doing here?

131
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:18,995
I know someone here, too,
and I have some business here.

132
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,222
Oh, I'll tell you what happened
earlier at another time.

133
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:23,401
Okay.

134
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:25,693
-I'll see you at the hotel.
-Oh, yes.

135
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:29,591
Fire!

136
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,203
Mr Ji.

137
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,735
Mr Ji?

138
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:39,771
Ji Sungjoon?

139
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:42,480
Hey, Sungjoon!

140
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:45,829
I guess he's not home.

141
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,122
Maybe I should leave this with the guard?

142
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:53,506
Right.

143
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,929
I have this.

144
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:58,836
Open sesame.

145
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:09,457
What, he's here?

146
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:15,539
He's completely knocked out.

147
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:22,751
This must be the puzzle
that she was talking about.

148
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:26,299
Look, fellow.

149
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:34,463
Do you know that you're referring to
your first love as "Support"?

150
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:37,299
Do you have any idea?

151
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:45,659
Did he buy porridge for himself?

152
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:54,291
How can food smell like this?

153
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:56,389
Someone could die eating this!

154
00:10:58,562 --> 00:10:59,994
It's definitely spoiled!

155
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:18,240
He'll eat by himself when he wakes up.

156
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,436
Why is he sweating so much?

157
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,265
Gosh.

158
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:54,199
Oh, no.

159
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:06,332
Why do I have to do this?

160
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:23,719
Oh, Hyejin!

161
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:25,878
Hey, what the...

162
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:28,149
Did you wake up?

163
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:29,514
Did I wake up?

164
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:32,109
Mr Kim, what are you doing here?

165
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:34,834
I stopped by to make sure
you were still alive.

166
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,510
I heard that you were caught
in the rain last night.

167
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,670
Who told you that?

168
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:42,025
Oh, that Support
went running her mouth again.

169
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,691
But, did you sleep here last night?

170
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:50,336
Did you expect me to sleep
in the hallway with the crickets?

171
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,054
On such a cold night?

172
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,696
And you're wearing my gown?

173
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:55,781
That underwear!

174
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:57,637
That belongs to me!

175
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:04,008
I came here in a hurry,
so I didn't bring an extra pair.

176
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:08,938
So you wear my underwear?
Take those off right now!

177
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:10,533
-All right then.
-No, no. Keep them on.

178
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:12,299
Just keep them.

179
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:15,724
Don't give those back to me.
You'd better not give those back to me!

180
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:18,466
Okay! Yes, I scored some free underwear!

181
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:19,770
Hurry and wash up.

182
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:21,775
Let's have breakfast before we head out.

183
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,326
There was a party here all night!

184
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,130
Hurry and wash up.

185
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:40,026
You've caught a cold, too?

186
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:43,453
Maybe. I was fine until yesterday.

187
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,517
But is there someone else
you know who caught a cold?

188
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:48,728
No...

189
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:51,534
I've seen a lot of people
get sick lately.

190
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,697
We should have some medicine.

191
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,290
I think we're out of cold medication.

192
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,923
Wait here, I'll go and get you some.

193
00:14:01,111 --> 00:14:03,572
Hey, hey, hey, sit down, sit down.

194
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:05,997
The pharmacy isn't even open yet.

195
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,532
-Is it too early?
-Yes.

196
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:11,470
Stay here,
I'll prepare some fruit for you.

197
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,753
You can eat it in the office.

198
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,296
This is when you should
take in lots of vitamin C.

199
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:18,711
And after work, I'll bring home
some mushroom soup.

200
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,112
That'll knock the cold right out.

201
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,357
Forget it, I'm sure I'll get better soon.

202
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:25,766
You need to combat colds when they start.

203
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:28,658
And make sure you stop
by the hospital, okay?

204
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:29,814
Okay.

205
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:37,171
Your first love has downed
the bowl of porridge...

206
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,716
...and has completely recovered.
Mission completed.

207
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,088
That's a relief.

208
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:50,219
I fell asleep
and didn't even see you leave.

209
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,068
Thanks for the porridge,
and I'll call you later.

210
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:54,130
Porridge?

211
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,288
I guess porridge and soup
are the same thing.

212
00:14:59,204 --> 00:15:01,193
It feels so comfortable!

213
00:15:01,273 --> 00:15:03,499
Did you buy this underwear in America?

214
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,047
Made in USA? America?

215
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:05,997
Yes.

216
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:08,486
Maybe it's because it's from overseas...

217
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:10,327
...but the sensation
is completely different!

218
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:11,681
By any chance...

219
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:13,895
...can you give me like two more pairs?

220
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:16,252
Or can I find this brand somewhere here?

221
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,296
Stop talking about underwear!

222
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:25,765
Can you stop asking about underwear
and act like a normal person?

223
00:15:27,004 --> 00:15:29,952
Come on. Let's share the information.

224
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:31,979
Can you keep your distance from me?

225
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:32,960
Hey.

226
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:36,888
For having spent the night together,
you're being too distant.

227
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,285
-Come here.
-I said to get away from me!

228
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:41,302
Come on.

229
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:44,033
What kind of cologne is that?

230
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:45,874
I'm asking you
what kind of cologne you wear.

231
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:48,347
-Look at that line!
-Hey, what the...

232
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:49,668
-See, the line...
-Don't touch me!

233
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,607
-Come on.
-What's that I'm seeing?

234
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:54,170
That line is perfect.
How much did you get those pants for?

235
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:56,796
Were the two of them always that close?

236
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:58,831
Who cares if they're close?

237
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:02,168
Oh, my, Joonwoo!

238
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:05,211
-Hi!
-That's a new shirt!

239
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,010
I love the way you dress.

240
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,538
And what's that I'm seeing?

241
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:17,129
I'm here with you.

242
00:16:18,456 --> 00:16:21,680
I'll be your umbrella.

243
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:32,742
Hyejin.

244
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,239
Oh, good morning.

245
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,433
How are you feeling today?

246
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,706
Oh, well...

247
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:49,166
Look here, Support!

248
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:50,301
Yes?

249
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:55,681
Why did you tell Mr Kim
and get him to bother me?

250
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,658
Because of him,
my house is a complete mess.

251
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:05,693
What is that bizarre expression?

252
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:12,114
Oh, no!

253
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,612
I'm so sorry.

254
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,159
Forget it.

255
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:22,559
It sprayed all over here, too...

256
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:24,357
It's okay.

257
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:26,553
-I'll be all right.
-Here, too.

258
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,246
I said that I'm fine!

259
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:30,323
I'm really sorry.

260
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:41,731
I thought you were in a hurry
to get to the office?

261
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:43,672
Were you waiting for me?

262
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,790
Not a chance.

263
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,095
I'm going to have fun teasing him, too.

264
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,129
Underwear!

265
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,221
Here, Ms Cha...

266
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,695
Hyejin, did you catch a cold?

267
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:04,472
Hyejin, don't be offended
if we avoid you from now on.

268
00:18:04,963 --> 00:18:06,630
We have deadlines next week...

269
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,752
...and we'll be done for if we get sick.

270
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:11,721
You understand, right?
You have to be understanding.

271
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:13,524
Yes, I completely understand.

272
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:17,486
Isn't everyone going overboard?

273
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:19,687
How can you treat
a human being like a virus?

274
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:22,044
So Jackson, you've caught a cold?

275
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:24,120
Yes, I believe so.

276
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:26,408
I told you to leave!

277
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:28,725
What?

278
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:38,516
I said stop it!

279
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:41,173
Get your masks on
because this is serious.

280
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:42,739
Here are masks.

281
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:44,145
Eunyoung, here.

282
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,364
Hyejin, I don't have one for you.

283
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:48,760
So take it easy.

284
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,239
-Hyejin.
-Yes.

285
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:27,378
Can you review these translations?

286
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,709
Yes, I understand.

287
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:39,108
Jackson.

288
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,648
That's cold!

289
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:41,916
What is this?

290
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,109
Sit still.

291
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:46,344
Wait, what are you doing?

292
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:49,653
I'm trying to keep you
from being treated like a virus.

293
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,217
And take the medication.

294
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:53,697
If you don't take care of yourself,
who will?

295
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:55,336
See you.

296
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,477
Look here, Support!

297
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:16,522
Yes?

298
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:21,084
Why didn't I get
the meeting minutes today?

299
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:23,884
What notes?
We didn't have a meeting today.

300
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,885
I'm talking about yesterday.

301
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,455
But I gave you
yesterday's notes yesterday.

302
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:34,752
I didn't see anything.

303
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:37,245
I left it on your desk yesterday.

304
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:40,191
I'll print out another copy for you.

305
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:41,709
Do your job correctly!

306
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:42,754
Yes, sir.

307
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:46,181
I could've sworn
I gave it to him yesterday.

308
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:47,562
What's the matter with him?

309
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:49,983
The medication might make you drowsy.

310
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:52,374
You should take a nap
in the break room if you need rest.

311
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:54,349
-Okay?
-Okay.

312
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,176
-Jackson?
-Yes?

313
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,631
He really looks after me
like I'm his younger sister.

314
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:17,920
Wait for me, Mr Ji!

315
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,554
Wait!

316
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,728
Mr Ji!

317
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:31,468
What was that?

318
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,070
Seriously?

319
00:21:42,795 --> 00:21:45,385
Hey, what are you doing?

320
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:49,326
Yes, Hyejin.

321
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:51,894
Are you feeling better?

322
00:21:52,387 --> 00:21:53,587
Yes, thanks to you.

323
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:56,131
Thank you, and sorry about yesterday.

324
00:21:57,174 --> 00:22:00,139
Do you know the mushroom soup place
near the intersection?

325
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:02,377
You should have lunch there.

326
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:04,807
I go there whenever I'm sick.

327
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:06,223
Really?

328
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:08,385
Then let's go there
and have lunch together.

329
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,500
I want to pay you back
for making me porridge.

330
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,071
I'll pick you up at the hotel later.

331
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:15,025
No.

332
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:17,298
Let's meet at the restaurant.

333
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:20,395
I mean...

334
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:25,399
I really can't have visitors during work.

335
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:27,188
Okay.

336
00:22:48,286 --> 00:22:49,802
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

337
00:23:23,588 --> 00:23:24,599
Hyejin.

338
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:26,518
You're here?

339
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,588
It's raining all of a sudden.

340
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:30,721
I know.

341
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:32,600
It may be shower.

342
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:40,812
Why?

343
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:42,348
Well...

344
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:45,670
...I thought you used to hate the rain.

345
00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:50,055
I did, didn't I?

346
00:23:51,357 --> 00:23:53,729
But I'm okay with it now.

347
00:23:55,196 --> 00:23:56,169
I see.

348
00:23:59,749 --> 00:24:00,973
It's a green light.

349
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:07,649
It's go time!

350
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,324
Why do you always say that
at a green light?

351
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:13,126
Because it's telling us to go,
that's why.

352
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:14,443
Then what about red lights?

353
00:24:14,523 --> 00:24:17,566
Red lights? Red lights are red lights.

354
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:19,390
That's what my family says, anyway.

355
00:24:21,978 --> 00:24:22,961
Aren't you coming?

356
00:24:23,512 --> 00:24:24,985
Yes, I'm coming.

357
00:24:27,654 --> 00:24:29,662
Ten is publishing a book soon!

358
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:30,616
There's a new article.

359
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:31,704
"My dear readers,"

360
00:24:31,784 --> 00:24:34,373
"I would like to tell you that
my new work is at the finishing stage."

361
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:37,146
"I ask for a little more patience
before we meet again soon."

362
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,160
"From Ten."

363
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:40,589
So his new book is going to be out soon.

364
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:44,816
I'm excited already
at the thought of writing his review.

365
00:24:45,163 --> 00:24:47,526
By the way, did you hear the rumours?

366
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:49,279
They say that Ten is a Korean writer.

367
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,099
A woman in her forties.

368
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,339
A woman in her forties?

369
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:54,053
Joonwoo, here take this.

370
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:55,596
Scratch my back for me.

371
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,129
Harder.

372
00:24:57,302 --> 00:24:59,679
You said that she's French last time...

373
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,816
...some descendant
of Guillaume or something.

374
00:25:03,055 --> 00:25:06,497
And do you remember last year,
you claimed that she was American...

375
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:08,639
...and a descendant of Douglas Kennedy?

376
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:11,360
I've heard rumours
that she's Murakami Haruki.

377
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:13,040
She's hiding her identity.

378
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,503
Ten is Haruki?

379
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:17,487
That's nonsense.
They're completely different.

380
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:18,807
She's not Haruki.

381
00:25:18,888 --> 00:25:20,193
You never know.

382
00:25:20,274 --> 00:25:22,278
J K Rowling, after her success
with her Harry Potter novels...

383
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:24,171
...has written mystery novels
under a different pen name.

384
00:25:24,251 --> 00:25:25,752
No, that's not true.

385
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:28,744
According to reliable sources,
I'm sure she's Korean.

386
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:30,605
And she's a woman in her forties.

387
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:32,471
And who exactly is your source?

388
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:33,619
Can you tell me?

389
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,681
Ciao!

390
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:36,238
Hello.

391
00:25:40,194 --> 00:25:41,285
Attention everyone!

392
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:42,886
-Let's get back to work.
-Yes, ma'am.

393
00:25:48,662 --> 00:25:50,265
What's this onion?

394
00:25:52,993 --> 00:25:55,230
Does anyone know what this onion's for?

395
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,303
-I'm not sure.
-I have no clue.

396
00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:59,653
Oh, we're going to use
that in the photo shoot.

397
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:01,625
We've imported that from Italy.

398
00:26:01,705 --> 00:26:02,883
It costs a thousand dollars.

399
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:05,139
What? A thousand dollars?

400
00:26:05,743 --> 00:26:08,149
Wow, a thousand dollars!

401
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:11,407
You lied to me again, didn't you?

402
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,378
It took you long enough.
Even kids wouldn't fall for that.

403
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,155
How could you believe that?

404
00:26:17,517 --> 00:26:20,629
Then what's this onion for?
It's a mystery.

405
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:21,996
Can you separate the mail?

406
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:23,020
Okay.

407
00:26:24,155 --> 00:26:25,903
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

408
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:41,428
Yes, you've reached
The Most Editing Department.

409
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:45,328
He's not here at the moment.

410
00:26:46,361 --> 00:26:49,428
Yes, I'll tell him that you called.

411
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:51,310
Bye.

412
00:27:05,628 --> 00:27:07,266
"When you contract a cold..."

413
00:27:07,347 --> 00:27:13,672
"...keeping an onion nearby
supposedly weakens the virus..."

414
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,387
Then the onion came from...

415
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:43,798
How are you, Good-looking?

416
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:48,635
I've never seen you smile before.

417
00:27:49,056 --> 00:27:52,269
It was so beautiful
that I couldn't help...

418
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:54,715
...but to snap a picture of it.

419
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:57,694
You must be in a good mood.

420
00:27:58,714 --> 00:28:00,162
Did you find someone special?

421
00:28:00,773 --> 00:28:01,715
What?

422
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,101
Who's the girl?

423
00:28:04,461 --> 00:28:06,274
My love.

424
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,629
I didn't smile back there.

425
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:24,418
I hope you'll show me
that smile more often!

426
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,672
Sweet Mr Ji.

427
00:28:28,698 --> 00:28:30,685
Why did you have to smile back there?

428
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,167
Don't smile, you.

429
00:28:39,247 --> 00:28:40,380
The inventory log.

430
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,836
I wonder what Mr Ji is doing right now?

431
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,492
I'm not sure.

432
00:28:59,395 --> 00:29:00,595
What's the matter with me?

433
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:03,508
I'm leaving for the day.

434
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:04,681
I'm leaving, too.

435
00:29:04,761 --> 00:29:05,700
See you.

436
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,600
Good work, everyone. See you tomorrow.

437
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,703
-Good work everybody!
-Bye!

438
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:11,199
Good work today.

439
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,727
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

440
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,416
Feels good, right?

441
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,531
Hyejin, good work today.

442
00:29:23,182 --> 00:29:24,793
I need this by tomorrow.

443
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:27,516
Make me a transcript of the interview.

444
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:28,628
Oh, yes.

445
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,376
-Goodbye.
-And wear your mask.

446
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:32,427
Yes, sir.

447
00:29:35,662 --> 00:29:37,011
I didn't take my medicine.

448
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,321
I'm so sleepy.

449
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:04,118
The medicine is making me drowsy.

450
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:22,457
So tired.

451
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:25,391
This won't do.

452
00:30:26,294 --> 00:30:28,554
Let's chew some gum!

453
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:29,663
Where is it?

454
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:05,580
Mr Ji, you haven't left for the day?

455
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:12,226
What the...

456
00:32:13,544 --> 00:32:15,186
I'm sorry, did I startle you?

457
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:19,452
I wasn't startled.
I wasn't startled at all.

458
00:32:19,532 --> 00:32:20,622
Not even a little bit.

459
00:32:23,786 --> 00:32:25,296
-Well...
-Why?

460
00:32:29,403 --> 00:32:31,922
Who placed my bag here?

461
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:35,667
I'll see you tomorrow.

462
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,321
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

463
00:32:38,408 --> 00:32:40,992
He seems kind of off today.

464
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:43,706
Hyejin, aren't you leaving?

465
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:45,503
Oh, I'm leaving soon.

466
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:46,633
-Let's go.
-Okay.

467
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,232
Who is it?

468
00:33:36,045 --> 00:33:37,850
I hate this medicine!

469
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:39,379
Oh, no. My bus!

470
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:41,062
Mister, Mister!

471
00:33:41,142 --> 00:33:42,173
Mister, stop!

472
00:33:43,662 --> 00:33:45,755
Thank you, thank you.

473
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:27,174
Where am I?

474
00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:32,222
Mister, this is my stop!

475
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:49,650
Doesn't she know
it's dangerous to sleep anywhere?

476
00:35:53,038 --> 00:35:54,568
But where am I?

477
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:20,367
Here you go.

478
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:31,391
Oh, sorry.
It's probably early over there.

479
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:33,575
I had something to ask you.

480
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,091
If you experience extreme anxiety...

481
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:46,444
...it may be your trauma re-surging.

482
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:48,593
Try to stay away from stress...

483
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:51,029
...even if things are stressful,
try to work it out.

484
00:36:51,205 --> 00:36:53,011
Managing your stress
is what you need to do.

485
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:59,194
Someone random keeps reminding me
of someone I knew 15 years ago.

486
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,461
But I don't know why.

487
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:06,705
And the person I knew
seems unfamiliar to me now.

488
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,863
It feels like she's
not the person I knew.

489
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:12,630
Hey, listen.

490
00:37:12,807 --> 00:37:15,521
Fifteen years is long enough
for anyone to change drastically.

491
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,806
Did you think your friend
would defy time...

492
00:37:18,043 --> 00:37:19,792
...and still be exactly the same?

493
00:37:20,558 --> 00:37:22,451
The inability for you
to forget your first love...

494
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,384
...is part of the Zeigarnik Effect.

495
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:27,324
Zeigarnik Effect?

496
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:39,610
What are you doing out here?

497
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:42,195
I love the night air.

498
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:43,558
And I wanted to wake myself up.

499
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:47,495
I was drowsy all day
because of the cold medicine.

500
00:37:48,991 --> 00:37:50,189
But why did you come outside?

501
00:37:52,361 --> 00:37:54,276
I was thinking about working out.

502
00:37:56,662 --> 00:37:58,800
Did you get off work a little late today?

503
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:00,226
Yes.

504
00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:06,943
If it was as simple as letting go,
it would be easy.

505
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:10,701
But you're having trouble
letting go of the past.

506
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:13,295
The fact that you can't forget her...

507
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:17,404
...has nothing to do with
the fact that you truly miss her.

508
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:20,519
You never had closure...

509
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,559
...so it's difficult for you
to put it behind you.

510
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:26,695
So stop dwelling in the past
and live in the present.

511
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:32,526
You had it better in Management Support
when you finish at 6 PM.

512
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:35,640
Now, you're working late every day.

513
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,191
I'm used to it now.

514
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:46,728
But they say that the team
may be dismantled.

515
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:48,902
And The Most might be discontinued.

516
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:51,122
Discontinued?

517
00:38:52,256 --> 00:38:56,429
Are you saying that the magazine
might disappear?

518
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,136
I overheard it...

519
00:38:59,445 --> 00:39:00,839
...but it might happen
in the next three months.

520
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:04,181
No, now we have about two months left.

521
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,465
If we don't hit number one by then,
the magazine will cease.

522
00:39:09,261 --> 00:39:11,834
And the editing staff
will also be dismantled.

523
00:39:14,072 --> 00:39:15,128
Then...

524
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:17,537
...what about Ji Sungjoon?

525
00:39:17,961 --> 00:39:18,964
I don't know.

526
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,622
Once there's nothing left for him here...

527
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:24,961
...he might end up going back.

528
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:28,387
I don't know, either.

529
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:36,002
I wonder if my sister's feeling better.

530
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:38,029
Should I give her a call?

531
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:40,808
Wait, me first.

532
00:39:40,888 --> 00:39:42,686
What? Hey!

533
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:47,364
Sausage?

534
00:39:51,229 --> 00:39:57,534
Are you feeling down
because of that man from before?

535
00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:00,657
Why do you have to lie to him...

536
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:04,237
...telling him that
you're going to get married?

537
00:40:04,317 --> 00:40:05,315
Is he a stalker?

538
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:07,133
He's someone...

539
00:40:08,254 --> 00:40:10,038
...I mustn't meet.

540
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:15,204
But I'm slowly falling for him.

541
00:40:17,711 --> 00:40:19,029
The more I like him,

542
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:22,583
the more it feels wrong.

543
00:40:25,058 --> 00:40:26,781
I can't fall for him.

544
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:30,922
I can't.

545
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,070
-A married man?
-Of course not!

546
00:40:35,522 --> 00:40:37,323
A fugitive?

547
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:41,080
A minor?

548
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,345
I can understand since kids
are much more mature these days.

549
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:47,898
But still dating a minor is...

550
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,544
What do you take me for?

551
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:51,352
It's nothing like that!

552
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:53,477
Then what's the problem?

553
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:55,133
It's just...

554
00:40:58,328 --> 00:41:01,118
I should've stopped meeting him.

555
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:06,348
I didn't think I could do it alone...

556
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:09,735
...so I asked for your help instead.

557
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:14,541
So he's not married,
not a fugitive, and he's not a minor.

558
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:17,681
If you like him, go for him!

559
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,874
It's not that easy, okay?

560
00:41:22,225 --> 00:41:25,118
Everyone knows that love is crazy.

561
00:41:25,503 --> 00:41:27,347
You see it in the movies all the time.

562
00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:28,989
Be crazy.

563
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,718
Isn't everyone crazy to a certain degree?

564
00:41:33,153 --> 00:41:37,042
Stop complicating things
and just make it simple.

565
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:41,791
Instead of regretting it later,
just go for it now.

566
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,368
What are you looking for?

567
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:09,958
Oh, those shoes?

568
00:42:10,437 --> 00:42:12,946
They were perfectly fine...

569
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:16,190
...so I kept it for safekeeping.

570
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:23,395
This will come to an end
in two months whether I like it or not.

571
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,325
I don't care if I get hurt.

572
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:31,097
I want to go as far as I can.

573
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:57,680
Oh, and about the schedule
for the photo shoot.

574
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,454
We're looking at a place
in Gangwondo, near the ocean.

575
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,028
The concept will be
"Vacationing Alone"...

576
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:10,058
...and we'll show our model
having fun in the sun.

577
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:14,475
We've already found two
locations that fit our concept...

578
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:17,210
and we're awaiting your final decision.

579
00:44:18,592 --> 00:44:19,692
Mr Ji?

580
00:44:20,664 --> 00:44:21,562
Yes?

581
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:25,284
Oh, the business trip.

582
00:44:26,144 --> 00:44:27,487
Where are we with that?

583
00:44:27,738 --> 00:44:30,004
I've scheduled it
for the day after tomorrow...

584
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:32,485
...and I've secured a condo
for our company at the location.

585
00:44:32,565 --> 00:44:35,121
You'll have to be there...

586
00:44:35,201 --> 00:44:38,524
...and I was thinking that
Ahreum and I accompany you.

587
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:41,381
I'm sorry, but can I pass?

588
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:43,477
-Why?
-I need to work on a feature.

589
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:45,238
I think we'll have to
redo the photo shoot.

590
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:48,764
Seol, can you go in my place?

591
00:44:49,168 --> 00:44:50,177
Me?

592
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:52,388
But I'll get burned!

593
00:44:53,779 --> 00:44:55,336
Why don't we send Kim Hyejin instead?

594
00:44:56,577 --> 00:44:58,404
What? Me?

595
00:44:58,484 --> 00:45:01,582
We'll need to arrange
everything on set...

596
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:04,193
...so we'll take Joonwoo along, too.

597
00:45:04,626 --> 00:45:05,924
Yes, I'll go too.

598
00:45:06,098 --> 00:45:08,415
Then I'll just go.

599
00:45:08,495 --> 00:45:10,748
What will Kim Hyejin accomplish there?

600
00:45:10,828 --> 00:45:12,781
With so much things to do,
I'll have to be there.

601
00:45:14,051 --> 00:45:16,262
Yes, this is my chance!

602
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:17,557
Jackpot, Kim Joonwoo.

603
00:45:17,637 --> 00:45:20,905
I'm going to make you mine!

604
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:24,832
Where's the dryer...

605
00:45:38,657 --> 00:45:41,572
Do you remember the puzzle back then?
It was in the box, too.

606
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,587
Puzzle?

607
00:45:46,015 --> 00:45:48,668
Oh, the hidden girl?

608
00:45:48,748 --> 00:45:50,977
I had forgotten that I had it...

609
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:56,181
...but then remembered that
we used to put it together.

610
00:45:58,165 --> 00:45:59,623
I felt thankful.

611
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,224
I'm in front. I'll see you inside.

612
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:09,417
Hyejin!

613
00:46:10,508 --> 00:46:13,041
Sungjoon, did you wait long?

614
00:46:13,121 --> 00:46:14,373
Let's go inside.

615
00:46:18,363 --> 00:46:19,412
Hyejin?

616
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:28,728
I found this.

617
00:46:33,592 --> 00:46:34,528
This.

618
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,418
It's been so long, hasn't it?

619
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:42,207
I was looking for it, and I found it.

620
00:46:43,937 --> 00:46:45,216
Isn't it amazing?

621
00:46:50,877 --> 00:46:52,153
Yes, it is.

622
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:55,662
It's from back then.

623
00:46:58,924 --> 00:47:04,671
This is what I gave you back then.

624
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:24,551
So, we meet in a place like this?

625
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:26,384
Are you here to eat?

626
00:47:27,046 --> 00:47:28,442
What does it look like?

627
00:47:28,522 --> 00:47:29,900
It is a restaurant.

628
00:47:30,243 --> 00:47:33,566
I guess you lie about your name now
when you meet with men.

629
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,049
Well, if you're going to
meet that many men...

630
00:47:38,129 --> 00:47:40,042
...you'll need to lie here and there.

631
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:43,328
Is your name the only thing
you lied about?

632
00:47:44,657 --> 00:47:45,895
I don't think...

633
00:47:47,194 --> 00:47:48,431
...it's any of your business.

634
00:47:48,705 --> 00:47:52,014
I wonder what made you
lie about your name.

635
00:47:53,361 --> 00:47:54,909
Do you want to introduce me to him?

636
00:47:55,245 --> 00:47:56,269
Excuse me.

637
00:47:58,228 --> 00:48:00,231
I'm in a situation.

638
00:48:02,228 --> 00:48:03,666
Please look the other way.

639
00:48:04,235 --> 00:48:05,633
Why should I do that?

640
00:48:06,492 --> 00:48:10,215
Don't you meet with men just for fun?

641
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,496
And this looks...

642
00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:15,580
...so new to me.

643
00:48:19,234 --> 00:48:22,497
Please, I'm asking you.

644
00:48:22,982 --> 00:48:24,776
I could barely hear you.

645
00:48:25,341 --> 00:48:26,753
Can you ask me again?

646
00:48:30,403 --> 00:48:31,598
Please.

647
00:48:36,662 --> 00:48:38,112
Please look the other way.

648
00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:41,690
Sungjoon, let's go.

649
00:48:42,802 --> 00:48:44,791
What's the matter, is something wrong?

650
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,465
Let's just leave, okay?

651
00:48:47,072 --> 00:48:50,161
Hyejin, what's the matter?
What's going on?

652
00:48:51,115 --> 00:48:53,972
The two of you look great together.

653
00:48:54,536 --> 00:48:55,500
What?

654
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,027
I hope we meet again.

655
00:48:59,862 --> 00:49:01,292
I'll contact you later.

656
00:49:09,828 --> 00:49:12,334
Hyejin, Hyejin!

657
00:49:14,262 --> 00:49:16,218
What's wrong? Who was that person?

658
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,337
Hyejin.

659
00:49:20,073 --> 00:49:21,040
Stop...

660
00:49:24,352 --> 00:49:25,744
...calling me by that name.

661
00:49:27,061 --> 00:49:28,539
Look at me.

662
00:49:28,867 --> 00:49:30,323
First, look at my face.

663
00:49:34,795 --> 00:49:36,743
Can you hold me for a moment?

664
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:39,301
Don't ask me anything...

665
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,358
...just for today.

666
00:50:16,617 --> 00:50:19,321
You're late. Were you on a date?

667
00:50:20,045 --> 00:50:22,696
Yes, I guess.

668
00:50:22,776 --> 00:50:25,016
Did you eat?
Want me to fix you something?

669
00:50:25,274 --> 00:50:28,013
I've eaten,
don't you know what time it is?

670
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,763
Oh, and your blankets
seemed a little thin...

671
00:50:30,843 --> 00:50:32,736
...so I changed them with thicker ones.

672
00:50:33,395 --> 00:50:34,461
You did?

673
00:50:37,143 --> 00:50:38,128
Thanks.

674
00:50:38,477 --> 00:50:41,275
And hey, what's with your room?

675
00:50:41,355 --> 00:50:43,087
I thought it was burglarized,
so I almost called the police.

676
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:44,429
Clean your room, okay?

677
00:50:44,924 --> 00:50:48,054
The pretty ones only know
how to take care of their bodies...

678
00:50:48,134 --> 00:50:51,201
...and their rooms look like pigsties.

679
00:50:51,728 --> 00:50:53,800
Who's going to marry you?

680
00:51:03,742 --> 00:51:04,975
Let's sleep together.

681
00:51:05,277 --> 00:51:06,230
What?

682
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,899
Why would you leave your big bed?

683
00:51:08,552 --> 00:51:10,027
Oh, this is nice!

684
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,115
Hey, you're too big
to sleep with me in my bed!

685
00:51:17,495 --> 00:51:20,535
What if I curl up like this next to you?

686
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,695
You can't convince me
by flirting with me like that!

687
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,501
Tickle, tickle!

688
00:51:38,825 --> 00:51:41,296
What is it?

689
00:51:44,425 --> 00:51:45,490
What?

690
00:51:47,377 --> 00:51:50,863
You have something to tell me, don't you?

691
00:51:52,157 --> 00:51:53,240
Yes.

692
00:51:55,374 --> 00:51:56,527
I do.

693
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,349
I do.

694
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,419
But later.

695
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:15,189
I'll tell you everything later, Hyejin.

696
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:18,621
Can you...

697
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:23,221
...be patient until then?

698
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:31,261
Are you sure you're okay?

699
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:36,762
I want to be okay.

700
00:52:38,844 --> 00:52:40,008
I want to be.

701
00:52:42,271 --> 00:52:43,326
Hari.

702
00:52:45,053 --> 00:52:46,534
Oh, this is so nice.

703
00:52:47,276 --> 00:52:49,141
Should I sleep here from now on?

704
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,650
Dream on, I'm not allowing that.

705
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:05,168
I don't know what's going on with you...

706
00:53:08,032 --> 00:53:11,230
...but don't keep it to yourself
for too long.

707
00:53:12,371 --> 00:53:13,478
Yes.

708
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:17,748
Okay.

709
00:53:21,459 --> 00:53:22,818
Okay, Hyejin.

710
00:54:46,979 --> 00:54:48,371
Good morning.

711
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,110
Business trip team members,
meet me at 10 AM on the first floor.

712
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,335
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

713
00:54:55,044 --> 00:54:56,472
Bonjourno!

714
00:54:56,552 --> 00:54:58,240
Hello.

715
00:55:05,628 --> 00:55:07,026
Yes, come on in.

716
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:13,725
What is it, my dear?

717
00:55:13,955 --> 00:55:17,413
Oh, Ms Cha has asked me
to get this approved by you.

718
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:18,778
I wonder what it is?

719
00:55:18,953 --> 00:55:20,167
Go on, give it to me.

720
00:55:25,258 --> 00:55:27,034
But my dear...

721
00:55:27,946 --> 00:55:31,894
...I'm still waiting for you
to become Most-esque.

722
00:55:32,443 --> 00:55:33,352
Excuse me?

723
00:55:35,142 --> 00:55:37,612
I'm actually trying.

724
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,732
Oh, mama.

725
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:45,491
It's so frustrating!

726
00:55:45,571 --> 00:55:48,370
Your style is hopeless and absurd.

727
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:51,312
I'm sorry.

728
00:55:53,135 --> 00:55:54,492
Oh, I'm nauseous.

729
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:56,420
Nauseous again.

730
00:55:57,028 --> 00:55:59,735
Look at this.
I'm getting motion sickness.

731
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:04,510
Give me that Most-esque feel, okay?

732
00:56:04,851 --> 00:56:06,809
That Most-esque feel.

733
00:56:06,889 --> 00:56:08,567
And I'm talking about everything you do.

734
00:56:08,647 --> 00:56:10,435
Even in a signature.

735
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:12,869
Most-esque!

736
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:15,201
-How?
-Most-esque!

737
00:56:15,281 --> 00:56:17,181
Good. Now, get out.

738
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,839
Ouch, that hurts.

739
00:56:31,647 --> 00:56:33,156
It's okay, it's okay.

740
00:56:33,675 --> 00:56:35,001
Most-esque.

741
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:48,246
Okay, I have my first favour.

742
00:56:48,326 --> 00:56:49,312
First what?

743
00:56:50,371 --> 00:56:53,691
I, Kim Hyejin, promise to
grant Kim Shinhyuk three favours!

744
00:56:54,313 --> 00:56:56,386
You recorded that?

745
00:56:56,466 --> 00:56:58,087
Of course I did.

746
00:56:58,294 --> 00:56:59,862
I didn't want you to back out again.

747
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:02,384
I was going to ask
for something really harsh...

748
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:06,504
...but I'm a nice guy,
so I'm going to make it easy for you.

749
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:08,046
You're buying me dinner tonight.

750
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:09,506
Sea snails.

751
00:57:10,248 --> 00:57:11,701
With extra noodles.

752
00:57:12,427 --> 00:57:15,464
-Okay, I can afford that.
-Yes, sea snails!

753
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,481
Yes, I'll confirm it and get back to you.

754
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:21,615
Bye.

755
00:57:22,821 --> 00:57:24,278
I'm going to lose it.

756
00:57:27,274 --> 00:57:28,216
Hyejin.

757
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:29,512
Yes.

758
00:57:29,592 --> 00:57:30,664
I'm sorry...

759
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,049
...but you're going to have to
take my place in the business trip.

760
00:57:33,129 --> 00:57:34,070
Ma'am?

761
00:57:34,728 --> 00:57:38,036
I'm speaking with James Taylor,
and they want to send me pictures...

762
00:57:38,302 --> 00:57:41,321
...of their dress for our collaboration.

763
00:57:41,987 --> 00:57:44,664
I'll have to receive it
and give them feedback.

764
00:57:46,328 --> 00:57:47,617
You should go downstairs.

765
00:57:47,773 --> 00:57:49,727
Everyone is ready to leave soon.

766
00:57:49,807 --> 00:57:52,534
No, I didn't even pack anything...

767
00:57:54,862 --> 00:57:57,916
Just take my things.

768
00:57:58,197 --> 00:58:00,503
A change of clothes and some pajamas.

769
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:01,785
But still...

770
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:05,572
Now! Everyone's waiting downstairs!

771
00:58:06,257 --> 00:58:07,478
Move, move!

772
00:58:08,197 --> 00:58:09,441
I'll be back.

773
00:58:10,132 --> 00:58:11,632
Oh, the bag.

774
00:58:12,787 --> 00:58:14,696
Goodbye, I'll be back.

775
00:58:14,776 --> 00:58:15,922
Hyejin, have a good trip!

776
00:58:16,002 --> 00:58:18,245
Jackson! Sea snails!

777
00:58:21,186 --> 00:58:22,415
Sea snails...

778
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,368
Kim Joonwoo!

779
00:58:36,124 --> 00:58:37,236
What's this car for?

780
00:58:37,316 --> 00:58:38,656
You and I can go in this car.

781
00:58:38,736 --> 00:58:40,376
I thought we're all going in Mr Ji's car?

782
00:58:40,811 --> 00:58:42,762
He should be on his way now.

783
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,007
We've got a lot of stuff...

784
00:58:45,087 --> 00:58:48,004
...and it'll be more convenient
to have two cars on location.

785
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:50,123
I've already told Mr Ji and Ms Cha.

786
00:58:50,436 --> 00:58:51,427
So get in.

787
00:58:57,665 --> 00:58:59,916
I didn't know we were going separately.

788
00:59:00,068 --> 00:59:02,605
I'm telling you that
it's already decided!

789
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:06,643
What are you doing?

790
00:59:08,495 --> 00:59:09,763
I'm putting on your belt.

791
00:59:11,157 --> 00:59:13,198
Oh, my, what were you thinking,
Kim Joonwoo?

792
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:16,947
Oh, my!
What's wrong with you, Kim Joonwoo!

793
00:59:17,748 --> 00:59:21,858
What are you talking about?
I didn't think of anything.

794
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,693
Where is everyone?

795
00:59:50,043 --> 00:59:51,172
Well...

796
00:59:51,252 --> 00:59:54,613
Ms Cha can't make it
to the business trip.

797
00:59:54,693 --> 00:59:56,920
She wants me to go instead.

798
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:25,922
You've got a loose thread...

799
01:00:27,507 --> 01:00:28,870
Oh, it's okay.

800
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:30,911
I'll... I'll do it.

801
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:43,309
Why? What kind of text was that?

802
01:00:46,869 --> 01:00:48,366
Mr Ji.

803
01:00:48,668 --> 01:00:52,511
Joonwoo and I have some work to finish
so we'll be right behind you.

804
01:00:52,591 --> 01:00:54,600
Please go on ahead with Ms Cha.

805
01:00:55,324 --> 01:00:56,361
Then...

806
01:00:56,441 --> 01:00:57,444
Let's...

807
01:00:58,259 --> 01:00:59,295
...get going.

808
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:06,960
What?

809
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,395
Ji Sungjoon and I
have to go there alone together?

810
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,626
My goodness, what am I going to do?

811
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:33,282
Business trip?

812
01:01:33,362 --> 01:01:34,364
With whom?

813
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:35,683
Ji Sungjoon!

814
01:01:35,763 --> 01:01:37,857
It's the ocean!

815
01:01:38,089 --> 01:01:42,766
So Jackson and Mr Ji are there alone?

816
01:01:43,346 --> 01:01:45,628
Joonwoo, look at the stars!

817
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:46,860
Mr Ji.

818
01:01:47,105 --> 01:01:53,627
I'm going to tell you
something now that'll shock you.

819
01:01:53,959 --> 01:01:55,379
Tell me what?

820
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:57,109
To be honest, I'm...
