1
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:07,366
Why is there so much fog tonight?

2
00:00:19,246 --> 00:00:20,566
I don't think this is fog.

3
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:23,086
This is smoke.

4
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:27,286
What's going on here?

5
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:30,686
What's wrong with this?

6
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:52,686
It's raining now.

7
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:56,366
It's burning hot!

8
00:00:56,686 --> 00:00:58,966
I don't know how to fix this!

9
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:03,223
I need to know where I am
if I'm to call for help.

10
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:05,686
Where are all of the buildings?

11
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:08,939
It's so cold.

12
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:10,966
I've been walking for so long.

13
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:12,846
How's the driver's condition?

14
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:15,166
And who are you?

15
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,166
-Is there an accident...
-How is that important right now?

16
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,766
How is the condition of the driver?

17
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:23,686
Mr Ji?

18
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:50,126
Are you an idiot?

19
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:52,526
How could you take the wrong car?

20
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:54,886
What if you were involved
in a car accident?

21
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,166
Well...

22
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:00,886
Are you okay, Mr Ji?

23
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,366
It's pouring, so how did you drive?

24
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:05,206
How did you drive all the way here?

25
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:10,326
You're all soaked.

26
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:11,726
The umbrella.

27
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:19,526
You're soaking wet.
Did anything happen on the way here?

28
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:20,886
Are you really okay?

29
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:24,406
How did you come this far
through the pouring rain?

30
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:25,686
I didn't know.

31
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:32,726
I didn't notice that it was raining.

32
00:03:19,726 --> 00:03:20,966
Yes, Senior Cha.

33
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:23,686
I'm sorry that I made you worry
about me.

34
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:25,606
The car has been towed.

35
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:28,806
I've spoken with the author
and rescheduled our interview.

36
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:32,486
I've agreed to meet the author
at Heyri over the weekend.

37
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:33,926
Yes.

38
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,446
I'll see you tomorrow.

39
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,566
Cover yourself.

40
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:54,766
You're more soaked than I am.

41
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:57,526
-I'm okay, so why don't you...
-Forget it. Cover yourself.

42
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,646
-But I'm really okay.
-Just listen...

43
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:03,406
Listen to me, will you?

44
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:07,206
I've turned on the heat,
so the seat should get warm soon.

45
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:14,166
You've got smudge on your face.

46
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:17,086
I can do it myself.

47
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:39,686
May I turn on the radio?

48
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:43,886
Whenever I hold you close

49
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:49,286
I remember the hard times

50
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:53,686
Hold me close

51
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,126
Hold me close

52
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:02,526
Hold me close, I say hold me close

53
00:05:15,126 --> 00:05:16,886
Thank you for giving me a ride.

54
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,486
Kim Hyejin.

55
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,006
Get some rest.

56
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:33,646
I'll see you tomorrow.

57
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:36,006
Goodbye.

58
00:06:09,246 --> 00:06:10,286
Hyejin.

59
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:14,361
When it comes time
to reveal the truth...

60
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:17,824
...we lack the courage and we hesitate.

61
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:21,988
And the extended hesitation can end up...

62
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:26,486
...taking away our opportunity
to tell the truth.

63
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:24,686
Sungjoon.

64
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:26,726
Hyejin.

65
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:33,006
However, even if we find
the courage to tell the truth...

66
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:40,286
...the truth often makes us
more uncomfortable than the lies.

67
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,406
Did something happen to you?

68
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:47,566
Hari.

69
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:53,846
Why is Hari...

70
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:56,846
Are you okay?

71
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:02,497
I'm sorry that I couldn't keep my promise.

72
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:07,171
I've broken another promise with you,
Hyejin.

73
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:11,006
What's the matter?

74
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:14,286
Did something happen to you?

75
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:15,846
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:21,566
I'm really sorry.

77
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,366
Do you mind...

78
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:30,326
...if I just get some rest tonight?

79
00:08:41,406 --> 00:08:42,366
Okay.

80
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:46,726
You don't look so well.

81
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,486
Go on and get some rest.

82
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:09,201
I may end up hurting you more.

83
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:13,606
I know I shouldn't treat you like this.

84
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:17,846
I promised not to hurt you...

85
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:21,787
...but I'm not sure
if I can keep that promise.

86
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:32,630
But did you know that Mr Ji
has a girlfriend?

87
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:34,729
And she's really pretty.

88
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:40,338
Did anything happen
at the business trip?

89
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:41,846
Anything happen? Like what?

90
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:45,446
Was it uncomfortable with Ji Sungjoon?

91
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:48,036
Congratulations, the two of you!

92
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:50,726
"Sungjoon"

93
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,187
We've arrived at the final destination.

94
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,238
Miss, aren't you getting off?

95
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:43,853
This is the last stop.

96
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:46,886
Excuse me?

97
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,006
The last stop.

98
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:03,206
Where are you, Jackson?

99
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,606
I'm not sure.

100
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:11,606
I don't know where I am,
or what I'm doing.

101
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:15,206
I don't understand anything.

102
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:22,046
Where did the injured motorcyclist go?

103
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:23,686
I'm not sure.

104
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:47,526
What are you doing?

105
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:50,286
Why did you come all the way here?

106
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:52,926
Mr Kim.

107
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:55,846
Why...

108
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:00,788
Why is this happening to me?

109
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,446
So what are you going to do now?

110
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:14,746
Are you going to confront your friend?

111
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:18,966
Or will you begin
by telling the truth to Mr Ji?

112
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:24,326
No.

113
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:26,947
I think...

114
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:30,926
I'm going to wait a bit longer.

115
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:32,326
Wait for what?

116
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:35,700
Hari asked me to...

117
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:40,591
...give her some more time.

118
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,957
I'm sure that she has her reasons.

119
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:50,415
Like I had my reasons
for lying to Sungjoon.

120
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:56,175
I'm sure Hari has hers, too.

121
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:59,768
I'm sure of it.

122
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:03,126
I envy your friend.

123
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,554
You know how it should be.

124
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,362
"Hey! How could you do this to me?"

125
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:11,166
"And you call yourself my friend?"

126
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:12,726
"You evil witch!"

127
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:15,310
Most people would react like that.

128
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:21,584
I envy her for having such
a trusting friend like you.

129
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:24,624
I'm jealous.

130
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:28,086
She doesn't know how fortunate she is.

131
00:13:28,446 --> 00:13:31,766
It's because she's my Hari.

132
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:36,876
She's my best friend, Hari.

133
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,366
Let's leave now, Jackson.
It's getting late.

134
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:45,686
Oh, my leg!

135
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:47,286
What's wrong with your leg?

136
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,326
I've been squatting for too long!

137
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:56,806
But where did you get that car?

138
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:57,966
It looks expensive.

139
00:13:58,126 --> 00:13:59,126
Oh, that?

140
00:13:59,446 --> 00:14:00,726
I borrowed it from a friend.

141
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:03,206
And what about your motorcycle?

142
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:05,246
I know, right?

143
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:06,926
I wonder where it is.

144
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,206
Ouch.

145
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:18,926
Thanks to you, I'm not stranded
and I've made it home safely.

146
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,126
Thank you.

147
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:23,286
I'm pretty fortunate myself.

148
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:27,222
You're going off on a tangent,
so I don't know what you're referring to.

149
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,936
I have someone like you...

150
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:32,846
...who's willing to listen
when I need someone to talk to.

151
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,806
So I think I'm fortunate too.

152
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:37,846
If you know that,
you can always throw 10 dollars my way.

153
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,403
Talk is cheap.

154
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:40,884
There you go joking again!

155
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,206
You should go now.

156
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:45,806
Thank you again for today.

157
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:48,006
Hey, Jackson.

158
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:49,726
Yes.

159
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:51,406
If everything goes back to normal...

160
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:54,926
...are you going back to Mr Ji?

161
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,206
Yes, I want to.

162
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:01,766
I...

163
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:04,016
...like Sungjoon.

164
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,318
And I think he feels the same way
about me.

165
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:12,821
I see.

166
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:17,806
Go for it.

167
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:20,829
I'll see you tomorrow.

168
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:45,006
What are you doing?

169
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:46,966
Oh...

170
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:51,086
I came home
and found this falling apart.

171
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:53,966
I knew I couldn't convince you
to throw it away...

172
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:55,933
...so I'm gluing it together for you.

173
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:02,806
This won't do.

174
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:06,726
I think I'm going to have
to buy you another pair.

175
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,686
You'd better wear it
if I buy it for you.

176
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:11,046
Don't refuse again.

177
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:13,640
Okay, Hari.

178
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:15,286
Do that for me.

179
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:18,046
What's up with you?

180
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:21,126
You hate it when I get you things.

181
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:22,806
You're my friend.

182
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,046
I'd be grateful.

183
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:28,486
You're so pretty when you listen to me.

184
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:31,246
Let's go shopping together this time.

185
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:33,526
Okay, we'll do that.

186
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:36,206
I'll be waiting.

187
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:38,430
You're willing to wait now?

188
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:40,996
What if I never offered
to buy you a new pair?

189
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:56,766
Now that you mention it,
it was the first time.

190
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,537
It's the first time during a storm
that I wasn't reminded of that day.

191
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,966
It's the first time, Mum.

192
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:55,486
How am I supposed to face him?
What will I say to him?

193
00:17:57,846 --> 00:17:58,726
You're here early.

194
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:01,046
I'm off to buy some coffee
if you want to join me.

195
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:04,246
No, I've already had my coffee
this morning.

196
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:08,960
You can always have another one.

197
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:10,486
What?

198
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:11,846
Follow me.

199
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,566
Americano Ristretto
with triple shot for me.

200
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:17,006
And what would you like?

201
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:20,846
Well, I'll just have anything
that tastes sweet.

202
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:23,206
Since you've already had coffee
this morning...

203
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:24,549
...you should try something smoother.

204
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:26,406
A cup of cream latte, please.

205
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:28,766
Your order is ready.

206
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:32,486
Let's stay awhile.
We still have some time.

207
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,486
Did you sleep well last night?

208
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:51,846
Yes...

209
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:54,326
I didn't sleep well at all.

210
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:56,486
I kept thinking
about yesterday's events.

211
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:02,366
Oh!

212
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:03,486
It's Mr Kim.

213
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:06,846
I have something
to discuss with Mr Kim.

214
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:08,126
So if you'd excuse me.

215
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:09,646
Mr Kim!

216
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:13,806
Mr Kim!

217
00:19:13,926 --> 00:19:15,052
Jackson, why are you coming from there?

218
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,406
Act like we're talking
and keep walking. Be natural.

219
00:19:17,486 --> 00:19:18,406
What?

220
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:20,526
-What's the matter?
-Don't look back!

221
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:22,366
Ji Sungjoon is back there.

222
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:23,446
So what?

223
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:25,524
Well, I don't know what to say to him.

224
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:28,845
And after staring at him,
I don't even know how to act!

225
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:32,366
-So you want me to put on a show?
-Yes, yes.

226
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:34,926
And so?

227
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,286
What happened after that?

228
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:37,766
Oh, my, are you serious?

229
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,452
Congratulations!

230
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:40,826
Now give me some laughter.

231
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:44,366
That's good. Let's go now!

232
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:03,042
Kitae, I need to borrow your tie.

233
00:20:03,206 --> 00:20:04,886
-Ma'am?
-Hurry, it's urgent!

234
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:08,806
Thank you.

235
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:12,286
This coffee stain!

236
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:17,006
Mr David, I'm happy
to look around for more.

237
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:20,686
-You're so kind. Thank you!
-You're welcome, sir.

238
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:22,298
I really appreciate it.

239
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:25,046
I'll take this one.
You're so sweet.

240
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,605
Isn't he the long-term guest
in Room 2009?

241
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:31,654
The buyer from America?

242
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:36,246
He has to attend a meeting,
but he ruined his tie.

243
00:20:36,646 --> 00:20:38,806
I went to the office
and borrowed all of the men's ties.

244
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,886
My back hurts from running around
all morning.

245
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:43,724
Well, you've had your exercise for today.

246
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:45,205
Too much, if you ask me.

247
00:20:53,806 --> 00:20:55,630
-Why aren't you going inside?
-Ji Sungjoon is alone in there.

248
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:58,325
Does that bother you?

249
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,791
Yes, it drives me up the wall!

250
00:21:10,446 --> 00:21:12,006
For our 20th anniversary issue...

251
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:14,985
...we'll cover the celebration
we had across 12 pages.

252
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:18,406
Luckily, we were able to interview
some of the artists from that day.

253
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:21,246
Our readers are interested
in our backstory as well...

254
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:24,286
...so we can extend our coverage
and cover a few more pages.

255
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,166
Okay.

256
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:29,886
Shall we end our meeting
here for today?

257
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:33,246
Tomorrow is the beginning of a
well-deserved weekend, so rest well...

258
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:34,446
...and I'll see everyone next week.

259
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,766
Good work, everyone.

260
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:36,886
-Good work, everyone!
-Good work, everyone!

261
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:38,177
Good work!

262
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,027
-Kim Hyejin.
-Yes?

263
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:42,646
As soon as the meeting notes
are prepared, bring it to my office.

264
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:46,741
Good work today.

265
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:10,606
What are you doing?

266
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:13,006
-Are you a bubblehead?
-Sir?

267
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:15,136
No...

268
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:18,166
Here are the meeting notes.

269
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:19,406
If you'd excuse me.

270
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:21,486
Pull up a chair and sit down
until I'm finished reading it.

271
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:23,126
There may be some mistakes.

272
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:25,246
What?

273
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:28,886
Okay.

274
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,811
Can you raise your chair a bit?
You seem uncomfortable.

275
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:45,926
No, I'm really comfortable right now.

276
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,532
You may be comfortable...

277
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,206
...but you're making me uncomfortable.

278
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:16,646
There, all better now.

279
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:31,292
About yesterday...

280
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,484
Mr Kim wanted me...

281
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:37,765
...to get some documents
for him right away!

282
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:40,686
Finish reading that
and let me know if you find any mistakes!

283
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:55,846
It's this door.

284
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,882
Oh, excuse me.

285
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:11,726
Mr Ji, Mr Ji!

286
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:13,592
He's not here?

287
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,006
I'm right here.

288
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:16,993
Mamma Mia!

289
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,526
Why are you standing behind that door?

290
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:22,806
I was just thinking...

291
00:24:23,006 --> 00:24:24,000
Thinking?

292
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:26,419
-About me?
-No, not about you.

293
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,119
You're brutally honest.

294
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,726
You haven't forgotten
your meeting tomorrow...

295
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:34,206
...with the Valley representative,
have you?

296
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:35,726
The Ara Hotel, at 7 PM.

297
00:24:35,806 --> 00:24:39,046
Here. Be sure to wear this suit.

298
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:42,029
It's only appropriate
to wear their brand.

299
00:24:42,486 --> 00:24:43,406
Yes.

300
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:47,052
You know...

301
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:51,324
...the thought of meeting with you outside
of work and on the weekend...

302
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:54,725
...makes me excited for some reason.

303
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:57,865
I'll see you tomorrow.

304
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:13,326
Hello?

305
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:14,846
Am I speaking with Ji Sungjoon?

306
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:17,033
Who am I speaking with?

307
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,726
Gosh. Ten has updated his homepage!

308
00:25:20,806 --> 00:25:22,446
-Really?
-Where? Let me see!

309
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:25,366
"Finally, it'll meet the readers
in three weeks."

310
00:25:25,446 --> 00:25:27,686
"The title of the new novel is Memory."

311
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,524
He's releasing a new book in three weeks!

312
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:33,366
Then will it take a few more weeks
to reach Korea?

313
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:34,414
I would think so.

314
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:35,486
Memory?

315
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:37,566
The title doesn't give anything away.

316
00:25:38,126 --> 00:25:39,646
Ten's new book is titled Memory?

317
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:42,887
Then, is the main character a USB?

318
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:44,809
Are you being serious?

319
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,369
Oh, right! I've received a cal
from the publisher...

320
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:50,725
...and they'd like Shinhyuk
to cover the review.

321
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,206
They want Shinhyuk again?

322
00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:58,606
Well, all of his reviews
do become a hot topic.

323
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:01,444
But I'm not really
feeling Ten's works...

324
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:04,796
Why not? Ten is a world-renowned
author and already famous.

325
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:09,517
It's no fun reviewing famous authors.

326
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:12,295
It's fun reviewing new,
up-and-coming authors.

327
00:26:12,686 --> 00:26:15,326
You and your fun...

328
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:18,406
But who is Ten anyway?

329
00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:19,406
Haruki, I tell you.

330
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:21,006
-Maybe Guillaume?
-I have no idea.

331
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:22,315
No.

332
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:24,452
She's a Korean woman in her 40s.

333
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:25,453
Hello?

334
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:27,006
Yes?

335
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,126
Who is this please?

336
00:26:29,926 --> 00:26:35,526
Bonjour, Mr Jean-Pierre.
I'm doing very well.

337
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:37,166
What language is she speaking now?

338
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:38,766
I can never tell with her.

339
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:39,892
It's French.

340
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,661
I admire our chief editor!

341
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:45,966
He's making it so obvious
that she's his auntie.

342
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,926
Can he make it any more obvious?

343
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,406
Including the language
at the last event...

344
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:50,726
...how many languages does she know?

345
00:26:50,806 --> 00:26:53,406
I thought she was an airhead,
but she's actually quite smart.

346
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:56,126
What's our chief editor's true identity?

347
00:26:58,886 --> 00:27:00,265
Okay.

348
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:09,628
I'm so hungry.

349
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:11,086
Let's break for lunch.

350
00:27:11,326 --> 00:27:12,246
Okay.

351
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,286
-What should we eat?
-What do you feel like?

352
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,025
There's a new rice noodle place
across the street.

353
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:19,126
Really? Sounds good.

354
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:22,726
Wait, where's Shinhyuk?

355
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:24,364
Just leave that lunatic behind.

356
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:26,806
Everyone go on ahead.
I'll try and call him.

357
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:28,526
-Hyejin, we'll be waiting for you!
-Don't be too late.

358
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:29,886
Just leave Mr Kim.

359
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:33,659
Mr Kim, where are you right...

360
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,046
The patient has gone in for sterilization.

361
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:37,126
Excuse me?

362
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:38,686
What patient?

363
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:40,746
Where is he right now?

364
00:27:42,686 --> 00:27:43,766
The hospital?

365
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,206
Mr Kim!

366
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:51,886
Hey, Jackson!

367
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:53,206
Why did you go to a hospital?

368
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:54,806
Why were you being sterilized?
Are you injured?

369
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,286
It's nothing serious.

370
00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:57,731
Let's go and eat lunch.

371
00:27:59,406 --> 00:28:00,446
Where were you injured?

372
00:28:00,526 --> 00:28:01,506
Is it serious?

373
00:28:01,587 --> 00:28:03,286
I'm about to die of hunger.

374
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:05,043
Food, food, let's go already...

375
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:07,286
It's got to be serious
if you went to a hospital.

376
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:08,566
Are you seriously hurt?

377
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,886
Can we go and get some lunch?

378
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:13,366
I'm craving noodles!

379
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:16,858
-Tell me what's wrong, will you?
-Noodles, noodles...

380
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:23,272
You promised to buy me food anytime.

381
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:25,326
Well, today's that day.

382
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:28,446
Today's the last day of my mid-terms,
so I ended early.

383
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:29,966
Yes, good work.

384
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:31,486
Are you ready to order?

385
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:34,020
Do you mind if I order?

386
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:36,006
Yes, get whatever you want.

387
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:41,017
I'll begin with the Caesar salad
with balsamic dressing.

388
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:45,061
And I'll take the T-bone steak...

389
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:48,606
...but please make sure
you pick a meaty one.

390
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:51,526
I'll have my steak medium well-done.

391
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:52,566
Yes.

392
00:28:52,926 --> 00:28:54,126
Would you like a glass of wine?

393
00:28:56,006 --> 00:28:57,046
No.

394
00:28:57,526 --> 00:29:01,544
Then I'll take a lime mojito.

395
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:02,806
I understand.

396
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:13,726
But you really look like your sister
when she was young.

397
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,206
How can you be so identical?

398
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:22,086
I resent that statement!

399
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:24,966
You can't really compare
Kim Hyejin with me!

400
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:26,721
I'm much more attractive!

401
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:29,606
Kim Hyejin isn't pretty at all,
and all she's got going for her...

402
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:30,723
...is brute strength.

403
00:29:32,286 --> 00:29:34,966
Well, there's one other thing
she's got going for her.

404
00:29:35,446 --> 00:29:37,086
I don't know about anything else...

405
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:39,566
...but people compliment her
on her personality.

406
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:41,766
You're right.

407
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:45,097
Your sister is a really good person.

408
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,406
What did you say?

409
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:49,606
No, nothing. Let's eat.

410
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,846
How do you like working with my sister?

411
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:56,326
I'm sorry, but I think
I'm going to have to take this call.

412
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:59,180
Don't worry about me and take the call.

413
00:29:59,526 --> 00:30:00,490
Sorry about this.

414
00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:03,686
Yes, this is Ji Sungjoon.

415
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:06,726
Yes, I've checked the draft.

416
00:30:07,046 --> 00:30:09,819
But there's a bit of a conflict right now.

417
00:30:10,486 --> 00:30:11,446
Yes.

418
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:14,446
My arm! My arm!

419
00:30:14,686 --> 00:30:15,806
My arm...

420
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:20,846
This isn't going to work.

421
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:23,366
I think you're going to have
to spoon-feed me, Jackson.

422
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:28,646
Why won't you tell me
how you got injured?

423
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:31,619
You splashed it on me!

424
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:32,766
Wipe it for me.

425
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:33,934
Come on!

426
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:43,047
How did you hurt yourself?

427
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:45,254
Did you fall
while clowning around again?

428
00:30:45,526 --> 00:30:46,630
Did I?

429
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:49,926
Or did you get into a fight with someone?

430
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:50,966
Was that it?

431
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:53,507
Are you kidding? Stop playing.

432
00:30:57,326 --> 00:31:01,926
Must I pour myself
some broth in my condition?

433
00:31:03,646 --> 00:31:04,646
Are you serious?

434
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:06,446
Stay here, I'll go and get your broth.

435
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:17,012
I can't eat by myself.

436
00:31:17,446 --> 00:31:18,646
Can you give me a radish?

437
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:29,846
Tastes great, Jackson.

438
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:32,566
How did you injure yourself?

439
00:31:33,886 --> 00:31:36,606
I fell down, off of my motorcycle.

440
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,686
Really?

441
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,246
I knew it!

442
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:42,535
I knew it was dangerous when I saw
you zooming around on that thing.

443
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,166
Hand it over.

444
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:47,647
-What?
-What else? The motorcycle keys.

445
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:49,928
Hand it over, I'm confiscating it.
Don't ride it anymore.

446
00:31:52,366 --> 00:31:53,806
What are you doing?

447
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:56,846
Hand it over right now!

448
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,606
Then will you go out with me, Jackson?

449
00:32:00,046 --> 00:32:00,966
What?

450
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:02,526
If not, stop demanding so much from me.

451
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:04,346
You're giving me false signals.

452
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,670
Why are you joking again?

453
00:32:11,006 --> 00:32:12,338
Reporter Lunatic!

454
00:32:12,686 --> 00:32:15,602
-Why are you always joking around?
-It's not a joke.

455
00:32:20,446 --> 00:32:22,370
You should go inside
and get back to work.

456
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:23,726
Thanks for lunch.

457
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:24,966
Goodbye, mister.

458
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:26,726
Let's go together. I'll drop you off.

459
00:32:27,086 --> 00:32:28,428
I'm not a child, okay?

460
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,949
I can go back by myself,
so you go your way.

461
00:32:31,206 --> 00:32:34,846
Oh, and you can't tell my sister
that we met today.

462
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:35,926
Got it?

463
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,126
Okay.

464
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:39,846
I'm off now, mister. Bye.

465
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:41,340
Yes, be safe.

466
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:47,926
Outstanding hotelier?

467
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,166
The buyer you provided
a spare necktie to this morning...

468
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:53,086
...was impressed with your services.

469
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:56,194
He was able to finish
his meeting successfully...

470
00:32:56,406 --> 00:32:57,646
...so he nominated you.

471
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:59,434
It wasn't that big of a deal.

472
00:32:59,606 --> 00:33:03,286
It turns out that he's a director
for a fairly large IT firm.

473
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:10,606
He's already relocated his workshop
in Hong Kong over to our hotel.

474
00:33:12,646 --> 00:33:14,726
All thanks to you, Hari.

475
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:18,743
You can look forward
to being compensated.

476
00:33:22,686 --> 00:33:25,793
This, this child!
Why is this child still here?

477
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:30,526
Mr Ji is supposed to wear this
to the meeting with Valley tomorrow!

478
00:33:31,126 --> 00:33:32,766
I think he left it behind by accident.

479
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:33,966
He left it behind?

480
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:35,926
Give Mr Ji a call!

481
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:36,986
Yes, ma'am...

482
00:33:39,966 --> 00:33:42,779
I think he's in a meeting,
he's not getting his phone.

483
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:45,984
My dears!

484
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:51,566
Would anyone like to volunteer
and take this child over to Mr Ji?

485
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:53,766
I, I'm headed to the management team.

486
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:56,152
Hello? Yes, yes.

487
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:59,766
You dear, with the onion. Come here.

488
00:34:00,126 --> 00:34:01,086
Me?

489
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:03,446
Here.

490
00:34:03,526 --> 00:34:09,766
Now! Leave now and deliver this
child safely to Mr Ji's home, okay?

491
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,126
Wait, me?

492
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:12,916
Yes, of course, you dear.

493
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:18,766
No matter what happens,
you must convince Mr Ji...

494
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:23,544
...to wear this suit
to the Valley meeting...

495
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:26,334
...tomorrow night.

496
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:27,526
Okay?

497
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:31,806
What am I going to do?

498
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:37,546
You can deliver this
to the man of unit 502...

499
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:41,210
...and tell him that Han Seol from the
office stopped by to give him this.

500
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:44,762
Remember the name Han Seol, okay?
Han Seol.

501
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:47,006
Did you change your name?

502
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:55,686
I was told to deliver this to you.

503
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:57,766
I was already informed.

504
00:34:58,286 --> 00:35:00,276
Then I'll see you on Monday.

505
00:35:00,606 --> 00:35:01,686
Why don't you stay for some coffee?

506
00:35:02,286 --> 00:35:04,209
No, I'm fine.

507
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:07,551
Do I make you that uncomfortable?

508
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,366
Of course not.

509
00:35:10,438 --> 00:35:13,933
You can't stand
to have one cup of coffee with me?

510
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,086
It's not that I don't want to...

511
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,326
Then come on inside.

512
00:35:27,566 --> 00:35:28,987
It's late, so I made it light roasted.

513
00:35:34,806 --> 00:35:35,886
That...

514
00:35:37,086 --> 00:35:38,915
That should be really hot.

515
00:35:39,926 --> 00:35:42,806
No, I'm fine.
My digestive tract is indestructible.

516
00:35:42,926 --> 00:35:44,446
-Thank you for the drink.
-Sit down.

517
00:35:45,886 --> 00:35:47,086
I have something to tell you.

518
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:48,806
Okay.

519
00:35:50,446 --> 00:35:51,726
Have another cup.

520
00:35:52,406 --> 00:35:54,726
But sip on it this time.

521
00:36:02,406 --> 00:36:03,726
-Yesterday...
-I know.

522
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:06,006
You were worried about your co-worker.

523
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:08,032
If I knew one of my team members
were in danger...

524
00:36:08,113 --> 00:36:09,287
...I would've done the same thing.

525
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:11,262
You've got it all wrong.

526
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:16,566
I went there because it was you,
Kim Hyejin.

527
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:25,486
To be honest, you bothered me
in the beginning.

528
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:30,006
I don't know when it started to change.

529
00:36:31,886 --> 00:36:33,246
But I started to enjoy...

530
00:36:33,606 --> 00:36:35,792
...talking to you
and spending time with you.

531
00:36:37,846 --> 00:36:39,896
The more I became concerned about you...

532
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:42,102
...I felt myself becoming
more and more cruel.

533
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:45,867
So I really wanted to hate you.

534
00:36:49,326 --> 00:36:50,975
But as of yesterday...

535
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:55,145
...I've come to terms with my feelings.

536
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:59,006
I care about you.

537
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:01,926
Very much.

538
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,126
Goodness.

539
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:19,246
Doesn't it burn?

540
00:37:19,926 --> 00:37:20,886
I'm fine.

541
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:24,324
This won't do. Wait right here.

542
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:37,006
You should change into this.

543
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,564
No, I'm fine.

544
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:40,458
How are you going to go back
looking like that?

545
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:41,846
Change into this.

546
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:47,766
I'm back from my interview.

547
00:37:47,846 --> 00:37:49,606
-You're back?
-Welcome back.

548
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:51,646
Pizza, pizza.

549
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,966
But did Jackson leave?
I don't see her.

550
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:56,966
She's probably at Mr Ji's house by now.

551
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:58,006
What do you mean?

552
00:37:58,326 --> 00:37:59,486
Why would she go there?

553
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:02,726
The chief editor ordered her
to deliver something to him.

554
00:38:02,806 --> 00:38:05,726
If I had to go, I don't think
I could've handled it...

555
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:07,046
Don't even say that!

556
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:08,406
I don't even want to imagine it.

557
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,330
-My goodness.
-I'm about to lose my appetite.

558
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:11,366
I think I'll have indigestion.

559
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:37,926
Is something wrong?
Why aren't you coming out?

560
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:39,926
No. I'm coming out now.

561
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,486
The sweater is too big.

562
00:39:04,046 --> 00:39:05,526
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

563
00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:08,200
I'm not after anything.

564
00:39:10,926 --> 00:39:13,159
I just wanted to tell you how I feel.

565
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:15,686
In the beginning...

566
00:39:16,206 --> 00:39:19,246
...you resembled someone I used
to know, so I was drawn to you.

567
00:39:20,206 --> 00:39:21,446
Although it's impossible...

568
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:26,331
...it felt like we've known each other
for a long time.

569
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:34,448
I don't know why I feel like
being honest around you.

570
00:39:36,086 --> 00:39:40,766
It's like I want to tell you
about myself...

571
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:46,081
...and like I've finally found
someone I can talk to.

572
00:39:55,606 --> 00:39:56,686
What's the matter?

573
00:39:58,006 --> 00:40:00,278
Did I make a mistake?

574
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:05,532
No.

575
00:40:06,606 --> 00:40:08,086
Something is in my eye.

576
00:40:09,046 --> 00:40:10,606
I should get going now.

577
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:13,206
Wait, let me give you a ride.

578
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:14,366
I'll go and get my keys.

579
00:41:12,086 --> 00:41:13,341
Why did you leave without...

580
00:41:15,526 --> 00:41:16,646
Why are you here again?

581
00:41:16,805 --> 00:41:19,125
I know, right?
I was in the neighbourhood.

582
00:41:21,797 --> 00:41:24,037
I was in the area and I was thirsty.

583
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:27,086
I wanted to stop by and have a beer.

584
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:29,966
Is my beer still here?

585
00:41:30,326 --> 00:41:31,486
Oh, here it is.

586
00:41:38,086 --> 00:41:39,206
What are you?

587
00:41:39,926 --> 00:41:41,006
Are you Kim Hyejin's guardian?

588
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:43,028
Why do you keep following her around?

589
00:41:49,246 --> 00:41:52,340
I've agreed to be her older brother
so I guess that includes guardianship.

590
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:54,206
And what about you?

591
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:57,406
What are you to Kim Hyejin?

592
00:41:58,006 --> 00:42:01,046
Someone who comes through for her
on rainy days?

593
00:42:03,806 --> 00:42:05,513
You looked pretty cool that night.

594
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:08,406
I thought you were shooting a movie.

595
00:42:08,846 --> 00:42:12,166
At least I don't cover up my feelings
with ridiculous jokes.

596
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,607
Like a coward.

597
00:42:22,766 --> 00:42:24,606
I guess I'll go home and have a beer.

598
00:42:26,726 --> 00:42:27,886
See you next time.

599
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:55,606
I get that he doesn't want to flaunt
his wealth.

600
00:42:55,766 --> 00:42:57,732
But do we always have to eat
at these places?

601
00:42:58,006 --> 00:42:59,326
My nose is so runny.

602
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:03,549
You must not like spicy food.

603
00:43:03,846 --> 00:43:05,226
We shouldn't have come here.

604
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:06,397
I'm a regular here.

605
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:09,486
I guess I'll come here
with someone else.

606
00:43:09,806 --> 00:43:11,893
What?
They call me the capsaicin killer!

607
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,269
Watch me eat this.

608
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:15,766
I'm loving this!

609
00:43:17,046 --> 00:43:18,686
It's so good!

610
00:43:18,886 --> 00:43:20,486
I don't think so.

611
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:22,766
Your nose is all runny.

612
00:43:23,646 --> 00:43:25,926
My nose is normally runny.

613
00:43:26,806 --> 00:43:29,157
Watch me, the soup's the best part.

614
00:43:32,326 --> 00:43:33,486
Right? I can eat this stuff.

615
00:43:33,606 --> 00:43:35,006
So bring me here again, okay?

616
00:43:35,086 --> 00:43:36,166
Don't bring anyone else.

617
00:43:36,446 --> 00:43:37,366
Okay.

618
00:43:38,286 --> 00:43:39,406
Are you done?

619
00:43:39,766 --> 00:43:41,046
-Yes.
-Should we go?

620
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,086
Let's go.

621
00:43:43,326 --> 00:43:45,046
What are you doing? That's dirty!

622
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:47,199
It's not dirty...

623
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:49,686
It came from you.

624
00:43:52,486 --> 00:43:53,479
Let's go.

625
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:55,206
Thank you!

626
00:44:01,366 --> 00:44:02,886
Hey, what did you mean back there?

627
00:44:03,526 --> 00:44:04,726
Do you like me?

628
00:44:05,286 --> 00:44:06,286
Yes.

629
00:44:07,886 --> 00:44:08,966
You didn't know?

630
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:12,086
Then what does that make us?
Are we going steady?

631
00:44:13,926 --> 00:44:14,846
Okay.

632
00:44:16,206 --> 00:44:17,206
Then kiss me.

633
00:44:18,846 --> 00:44:19,806
Okay.

634
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:22,966
And hold my hand.

635
00:44:24,846 --> 00:44:25,886
Okay.

636
00:44:38,366 --> 00:44:40,606
Did you know that from far away,
you look like a loner?

637
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:44,090
I don't involve myself
in other people's matters...

638
00:44:44,686 --> 00:44:47,406
...but this will be the last time.

639
00:44:50,046 --> 00:44:51,366
She knows everything.

640
00:44:53,526 --> 00:44:54,726
I'm talking about Hyejin.

641
00:45:13,006 --> 00:45:14,446
She's willing to wait for you...

642
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:17,326
...until you're ready to tell him.

643
00:45:18,566 --> 00:45:20,486
She thinks that you must have
had your reasons.

644
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:49,206
What are you doing?

645
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,286
Nothing.

646
00:45:54,486 --> 00:45:55,846
Have you had dinner?

647
00:45:56,686 --> 00:46:01,552
Of course,
don't you know what time it is?

648
00:46:02,766 --> 00:46:03,806
Okay, then.

649
00:46:05,406 --> 00:46:06,545
Hyejin.

650
00:46:08,126 --> 00:46:09,246
Yes?

651
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:13,046
By tomorrow...

652
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:20,310
...things will be back to normal.

653
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:25,166
Give me until tomorrow.

654
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:27,686
Just one more day.

655
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:30,926
Then...

656
00:46:34,726 --> 00:46:37,149
...everything will be back to normal.

657
00:46:41,406 --> 00:46:42,686
Hyejin, thanks.

658
00:46:46,038 --> 00:46:47,718
Thanks for waiting for me.

659
00:46:51,446 --> 00:46:53,686
For letting me tell the truth myself.

660
00:46:56,366 --> 00:46:57,486
Thank you.

661
00:47:07,086 --> 00:47:09,126
That will conclude our interview.

662
00:47:09,886 --> 00:47:13,366
Thank you very much for your time.
It was really fun.

663
00:47:13,606 --> 00:47:14,926
I think I enjoyed it
even more than you.

664
00:47:15,046 --> 00:47:18,206
Starting with your questions,
you're really different.

665
00:47:19,526 --> 00:47:21,486
You're very well-versed
in your fairy tales.

666
00:47:21,726 --> 00:47:24,812
You must've prepared hard
for this interview.

667
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:29,235
To be honest, I've always wanted
to be a fairytale writer.

668
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,886
So I really envy you being
able to write such stories.

669
00:47:31,966 --> 00:47:32,966
Oh, my, is that so?

670
00:47:33,366 --> 00:47:35,486
Then you should pursue it.

671
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:36,886
I couldn't.

672
00:47:36,966 --> 00:47:38,086
It's too late for that.

673
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:40,486
I started after I had my first child.

674
00:47:41,366 --> 00:47:42,646
I'd like to give you a book.

675
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,206
-Really?
-It's not a bestseller.

676
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:47,526
But for the occasion.

677
00:47:51,406 --> 00:47:54,166
-Here.
-Thank you very much!

678
00:47:57,886 --> 00:48:00,046
"To Hyejin
In hopes that you keep on dreaming"

679
00:48:31,526 --> 00:48:34,206
"Exhibition of Auguste Renoir"

680
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:09,726
Are you here to see the artwork?

681
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:11,126
Yes.

682
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:13,036
I was on my way back from Heyri...

683
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,437
...and I remembered
seeing a poster about this.

684
00:49:17,446 --> 00:49:18,646
How was your first interview?

685
00:49:19,006 --> 00:49:20,006
Was it successful?

686
00:49:20,766 --> 00:49:21,806
I hope so.

687
00:49:22,366 --> 00:49:25,006
Anyways, I have plenty
of material for my article.

688
00:49:26,206 --> 00:49:29,686
That man has a scarf like us!

689
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:30,726
You're right!

690
00:49:30,806 --> 00:49:33,286
Mister, do you have a runny nose too?

691
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:35,766
No.

692
00:49:36,126 --> 00:49:38,726
Kids, you probably don't know.

693
00:49:38,806 --> 00:49:40,936
He's dressing in style.

694
00:49:41,086 --> 00:49:43,290
And not everyone
can pull off a scarf like him.

695
00:49:43,966 --> 00:49:46,446
Lady, why are you taking his side?

696
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:48,386
Do you love him?

697
00:49:49,734 --> 00:49:53,966
You must have a crush on him!

698
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,926
What do you know about love? Go away!

699
00:49:56,006 --> 00:49:57,086
Sorry about that.

700
00:49:57,446 --> 00:49:58,886
Let's go look at the next painting.

701
00:50:06,926 --> 00:50:10,006
People seem to laugh at you
every time you wear that.

702
00:50:10,606 --> 00:50:12,806
-Seriously...
-I was only joking.

703
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:13,926
It's nice.

704
00:50:14,006 --> 00:50:16,512
Excuse me,
can you take a picture for us?

705
00:50:17,046 --> 00:50:18,166
Yes, no problem.

706
00:50:20,406 --> 00:50:21,566
All right...

707
00:50:21,926 --> 00:50:24,998
One, two, three!

708
00:50:25,846 --> 00:50:27,316
One more.

709
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,526
One, two, three!

710
00:50:30,286 --> 00:50:32,101
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

711
00:50:32,246 --> 00:50:33,766
Why don't we take one for you too?

712
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:34,966
What?

713
00:50:35,085 --> 00:50:36,965
No, there's no need. We're fine.

714
00:50:37,446 --> 00:50:38,526
Here you go.

715
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:50,526
Get ready.

716
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:53,044
One, two, three!

717
00:50:55,206 --> 00:50:57,206
Why don't you smile some more?
I'm taking another one.

718
00:50:58,486 --> 00:51:00,406
One, two, three!

719
00:51:02,966 --> 00:51:04,766
If you're going home,
I'll drop you off.

720
00:51:04,846 --> 00:51:07,206
It's on the way anyway.

721
00:51:08,046 --> 00:51:09,126
You go on ahead.

722
00:51:09,206 --> 00:51:10,166
While I'm here...

723
00:51:10,246 --> 00:51:13,363
...I want to stop by the bookstore
before going back to work.

724
00:51:13,606 --> 00:51:15,326
I'll need to review
the interview tapes...

725
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,886
...and organize my thoughts.

726
00:51:18,246 --> 00:51:19,166
Okay, then.

727
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:20,406
I'll see you on Monday.

728
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:23,886
Mr Ji?

729
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:28,385
I'll see you tomorrow.

730
00:51:28,926 --> 00:51:29,846
Tomorrow?

731
00:51:30,806 --> 00:51:33,206
But it's Sunday tomorrow.

732
00:51:33,526 --> 00:51:34,806
I'm not at the office tomorrow.

733
00:51:35,006 --> 00:51:40,230
Still, I'll see you tomorrow.

734
00:51:52,966 --> 00:51:53,886
Hello?

735
00:51:54,089 --> 00:52:00,498
Sungjoon,
do you have time later tonight?

736
00:52:01,086 --> 00:52:02,126
Today?

737
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,117
I'm heading to a meeting right now.

738
00:52:04,566 --> 00:52:07,206
Then what time does your meeting end?

739
00:52:07,646 --> 00:52:09,806
I think it'll be pretty late.

740
00:52:11,486 --> 00:52:12,566
Why don't we...

741
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:16,310
No...

742
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,124
I should meet with you today.

743
00:52:20,326 --> 00:52:21,646
I have something...

744
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:24,117
...to tell you too.

745
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:32,766
Your new collection for this season
was so impressive.

746
00:52:32,846 --> 00:52:37,067
Thanks to your introduction,
the responses are good.

747
00:52:41,348 --> 00:52:43,253
We did put a lot of effort for that.

748
00:52:43,446 --> 00:52:46,526
I heard that you've already started
working on the new collection.

749
00:52:46,606 --> 00:52:47,734
Yes, that's true.

750
00:53:17,446 --> 00:53:18,486
Mr Kim?

751
00:53:21,006 --> 00:53:22,926
He must've been working this weekend.

752
00:53:29,526 --> 00:53:30,606
Poongho!

753
00:53:31,486 --> 00:53:33,286
How was your business trip?

754
00:53:33,966 --> 00:53:38,086
I almost died stopping
by all of those historic houses.

755
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:42,366
But what are you doing here
over the weekend?

756
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:44,406
I had my first interview today.

757
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:46,366
I wanted to review my tapes.

758
00:53:46,517 --> 00:53:50,094
Oh, the interview at Yadong-dong
that was postponed?

759
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:51,305
Yes.

760
00:53:51,726 --> 00:53:53,606
We thought you got into an accident.

761
00:53:53,686 --> 00:53:55,326
Do you have any idea
how much we worried about you?

762
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:57,806
Good thing that lunatic Shinhyuk
went after you.

763
00:53:58,086 --> 00:53:59,806
If you got into a car accident,
it would've been bad.

764
00:54:00,686 --> 00:54:05,366
He was gloating
and freeloading off you again, wasn't he?

765
00:54:06,006 --> 00:54:08,006
What are you talking about?

766
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,070
Where did Mr Kim go?

767
00:54:11,086 --> 00:54:14,006
He went to bring you back
from Yadong-dong.

768
00:54:14,566 --> 00:54:17,261
He thought you were in an accident
and darted out faster than Usain Bolt.

769
00:54:17,766 --> 00:54:18,926
Didn't you meet him?

770
00:54:20,086 --> 00:54:21,366
And what about your motorcycle?

771
00:54:21,526 --> 00:54:22,406
I know, right?

772
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:23,726
I wonder where it is?

773
00:54:24,046 --> 00:54:26,886
I just fell off my motorcycle.

774
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:30,046
Let's go and get some food.
This place is the best!

775
00:54:30,326 --> 00:54:31,326
Where are you going?

776
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:32,806
Aren't you hungry?

777
00:54:35,126 --> 00:54:36,166
Wait...

778
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:38,446
Mr Kim!

779
00:54:41,686 --> 00:54:42,766
What's up, Jackson?

780
00:54:42,926 --> 00:54:44,286
What are you doing here
on the weekend?

781
00:54:45,206 --> 00:54:48,446
Were you there that day?

782
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:52,006
I don't think I understand your question.

783
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:53,286
Yadong-dong!

784
00:54:54,926 --> 00:54:56,566
I heard that you were there.

785
00:54:57,486 --> 00:55:01,526
By any chance, did you get
into an accident on your way there?

786
00:55:03,006 --> 00:55:05,166
Did you get injured because of me?

787
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:09,206
Yes,

788
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,806
my meeting ended early,
so I was going to leave now.

789
00:55:12,686 --> 00:55:13,686
Where are you?

790
00:55:13,886 --> 00:55:17,566
I had to take care of something.

791
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:20,406
I'll see you there on time.

792
00:55:21,646 --> 00:55:23,686
Yes, see you then.

793
00:55:24,006 --> 00:55:25,686
Okay, I'll see you there.

794
00:55:30,846 --> 00:55:33,086
Answer me, were you injured
because of me?

795
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:34,206
Am I right?

796
00:55:41,246 --> 00:55:42,446
Yes, you're right.

797
00:55:44,486 --> 00:55:46,358
I got injured on the way to find you.

798
00:55:49,286 --> 00:55:51,286
Why? Does that burden you?

799
00:55:52,086 --> 00:55:53,293
Well, I hope it does.

800
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:55,886
I hope you feel bad about it.

801
00:55:56,526 --> 00:55:57,766
Because I...

802
00:56:00,606 --> 00:56:04,766
I want you to care about me, Jackson.

803
00:56:08,806 --> 00:56:10,101
Mr Kim.

804
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,646
I, Kim Hyejin, promise
to grant Kim Shinhyuk three favours!

805
00:56:16,886 --> 00:56:18,046
Oh, my...

806
00:56:23,006 --> 00:56:27,886
I guess I'll use my final wish today.

807
00:56:31,526 --> 00:56:32,886
My final wish is...

808
00:56:35,286 --> 00:56:36,326
This.

809
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:47,200
I don't want to be your friend.

810
00:56:48,686 --> 00:56:50,206
I will never be your friend.

811
00:56:56,486 --> 00:56:57,846
Goodbye. Thank you.

812
00:57:10,726 --> 00:57:14,055
Hari, thanks for coming
even though it's not your shift.

813
00:57:14,526 --> 00:57:15,686
Get home safe.

814
00:57:16,006 --> 00:57:17,339
Of course I should be here.

815
00:57:17,766 --> 00:57:19,246
-Good night.
-You, too.

816
00:57:24,366 --> 00:57:26,253
-Min Hari.
-Yes?

817
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:33,411
Sungjoon.

818
00:57:33,526 --> 00:57:36,247
When it comes time
to expose the lies...

819
00:57:37,006 --> 00:57:39,046
...we lack the courage and we hesitate.

820
00:57:40,326 --> 00:57:42,686
And the extended hesitation
can end up...

821
00:57:43,926 --> 00:57:49,206
...taking away our opportunity
to tell the truth.

822
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,086
Min Hari.

823
00:57:53,046 --> 00:57:54,167
Who are you?

824
00:58:18,486 --> 00:58:19,566
"She Was Pretty"

825
00:58:19,726 --> 00:58:22,130
Min Hari, who are you?

826
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,931
If you find it hard to leave...

827
00:58:26,646 --> 00:58:27,886
...just stay with me.

828
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:30,886
I was planning to meet you on that day.

829
00:58:31,126 --> 00:58:34,183
It would've been much better...

830
00:58:34,646 --> 00:58:37,024
...if I hadn't hidden from you.

831
00:58:38,686 --> 00:58:39,806
I really missed you...

832
00:58:41,326 --> 00:58:42,526
...Kim Hyejin.
