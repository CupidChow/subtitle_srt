1
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,310
Now that he's coughed up blood,

2
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,950
the remaining poison should be cleared from his body.

3
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,450
Sweating is normal.

4
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,910
Let him rest well.

5
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,950
Today is the last acupuncture session.

6
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,579
After today, Yuantuo will be fully recovered.

7
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,120
Really?

8
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,950
Is Yuantuo's illness truly completely cured?

9
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,040
You still don't believe me?

10
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,950
I do.

11
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,829
Yanran.

12
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,750
I'm so grateful that because of that iris hairpin,

13
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,810
I brought you back to the Zeng family.

14
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,079
Perhaps

15
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:51,200
this is the destiny that fate has arranged for us.

16
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh,

17
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,840
so it was because of the hairpin.

18
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,360
Not because I'm beautiful.

19
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,180
Of course it's also because you're beautiful.

20
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,620
In my memory,

21
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,560
my mother had a hairpin exactly like yours.

22
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,470
Again saying I'm like your mother.

23
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,670
This hairpin was given to me by my sister.

24
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,000
Perhaps her spirit in heaven

25
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,579
brought us together

26
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,579
to seek justice for our deceased loved ones.

27
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,200
Have you heard?

28
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,040
Mrs. Zeng

29
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,290
passed away a few days ago.

30
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,120
Mr. Zeng has been depressed for days.

31
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,250
He stays behind closed doors

32
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,750
and I'm afraid he's not doing well either.

33
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,610
The first madam also fell ill from excessive grief.

34
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,370
Ten years of mourning when an elder passes away.

35
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,079
They say Mr. Zeng is about to announce his heir.

36
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,329
Oh.

37
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,120
I got it.

38
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,790
Go over there.

39
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,409
Go to that pastry shop on East Street

40
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:52,670
and bring back the osmanthus cake I love.

41
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,870
Yes, madam.

42
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,620
Why are you here?

43
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,910
Yinyin.

44
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,540
Yinyin.

45
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,620
I heard you were sick again.

46
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,310
I was worried about you and the child,

47
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:19,910
so I just...

48
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,830
I'm fine.

49
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,120
But you,

50
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,040
barging into the Zeng family home so recklessly

51
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,250
without even consulting me.

52
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,250
What if someone finds out?

53
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,650
Wouldn't that put me and my child in danger?

54
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,950
Yinyin.

55
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,620
I'm useless.

56
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,750
I've checked all the estate accounts.

57
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,370
But I'm not sure about the metropolitan accounts.

58
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,120
Master! Something terrible has happened!

59
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,750
What's going on?

60
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,080
Why are you so flustered?

61
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,340
The mistress has fainted. She's unwell.

62
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,580
Quick! Get a doctor!

63
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,250
Because of Grandmother's situation,

64
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,409
you've been working day and night.

65
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,140
I'll go check on Mother myself.

66
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,250
Let's go with our elder sister.

67
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,000
Mother is too heartbroken about grandmother's matter.

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,120
She hasn't fully recovered yet.

69
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,660
Yan Ran and I are both worried.

70
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,950
No need. You should check your own accounts first.

71
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,370
Mother's health is more important.

72
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,100
Lead the way.

73
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,910
Go on.

74
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,160
I'll go check on mother.

75
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,040
Yin Yin, come with me.

76
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,180
Let's leave this troublesome place together.

77
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,500
Yin Yin.

78
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,409
Be good.

79
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,440
Go back and wait patiently.

80
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,370
Let me have the baby first.

81
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,630
Then we'll make plans.

82
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,250
The day will come when we can be together.

83
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,620
Will you trust me?

84
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,000
Alright.

85
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,520
You insolent scoundrel!

86
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,120
How dare you harass me!

87
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,450
Do you have a death wish?

88
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,659
Yuan Ying, Yuan Kai!

89
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,700
Take him away!

90
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,700
Yin Yin.

91
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,330
Guards!

92
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,870
Take this scoundrel to the woodshed immediately!

93
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,909
What are you standing there for?

94
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,040
Help the madam back to her room to rest!

95
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,409
Yin Yin,

96
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:48,950
come.

97
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,000
Let me go!

98
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,159
Yin Yin!

99
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,250
How did it go?

100
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,700
Father is furious.

101
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,870
Zeng Yuankai. It must be Zeng Yuankai.

102
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,500
It was both of them who plotted against me.

103
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:17,870
Otherwise,

104
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,070
how could Yang Fan just happen to show up at the Zeng house?

105
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,580
I want them dead.

106
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,250
I want them dead.

107
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:24,870
Mother.

108
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:25,910
No.

109
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,160
No.

110
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,750
Yuanying,

111
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,370
at this point,

112
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,030
only you can save me now.

113
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,250
What can I do?

114
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,700
For my sake.

115
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,510
For the sake of the child in my womb.

116
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,180
Yang Fan can't stay anymore.

117
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,750
Are you Miss Zeng Yuanying?

118
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,410
Who are you?

119
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,370
I'm Tong Hao's foster mother.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,660
Tong Hao can't come.

121
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,580
He disappeared a year ago.

122
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,500
Disappeared?

123
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,200
I've been making inquiries for a long time.

124
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,200
I wasn't home that day.

125
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,680
The Zeng family matriarch came with many people and took Tong Hao away.

126
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,790
He never came back.

127
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,040
He's probably no longer alive now.

128
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,890
The plain porridge Madam requested.

129
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,830
I wish I had met you earlier.

130
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,500
It's not too late now.

131
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,200
As long as we love each other.

132
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,200
It's never too late.

133
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,080
You impudent rascal!

134
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,160
How dare you flirt with me!

135
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,990
Do you have a death wish?

136
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,370
Yin Yin.

137
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,450
Whatever you want,

138
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,450
I will help you achieve it.

139
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,950
Yin Yin.

140
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,460
This life is too short.

141
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,250
I hope to meet you earlier in our next life.
