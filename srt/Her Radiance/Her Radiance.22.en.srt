1
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,039
Young Madam.

2
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,580
What are you doing here?

3
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,160
Manager Zheng.

4
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,910
Yuan Tuo.

5
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
Why aren't you surprised to see me?

6
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,650
I remember everything now.

7
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,120
My mother,

8
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,250
Jiang Shuwan,

9
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,000
and Chen Shulin,

10
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,829
it was all you.

11
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,700
I had my reasons.

12
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,000
Why?

13
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,540
What did they ever do wrong?

14
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,950
And my mother,

15
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,000
wasn't she the woman you loved most?

16
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,620
The woman I loved most...

17
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,540
I loved her so much back then.

18
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,450
But...

19
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,000
She only wanted to escape from me,

20
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,700
for a man who died on the battlefield with no remains,

21
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,120
crying every day,

22
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,540
and even gave birth to his child.

23
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,829
If it were you,

24
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,829
what would you do?

25
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,250
What are you saying?

26
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,329
Yuan Tuo,

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,079
you are the true bloodline of Manqing and me.

28
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,740
He is also my only son, Zeng Shaozong's only son.

29
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,290
Where are you taking your son?

30
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,540
Didn't I promise

31
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,600
to take him to see a play a few days ago?

32
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,829
If he doesn't get to see it,

33
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,490
he'll throw another tantrum.

34
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,000
You go ahead with your business.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,870
I can take him myself.

36
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
- Let's go, Yuankai.
-

37
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,290
Wait.

38
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,330
If you want to see a play,

39
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,290
just have the actors come perform at our house.

40
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,620
Right?

41
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,950
Okay, I'll take him to rest for a while.

42
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,050
You're going to see that man again, aren't you?

43
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,659
Please let me go.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm begging you.

45
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,870
Gu Manqing.

46
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,409
The battlefield shows no mercy.

47
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,159
That man's body is already buried in the ground.

48
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,200
Give up.

49
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,790
You're now carrying my child.

50
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,370
I won't hold it against you that you had Yuankai with someone else.

51
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,170
From now on...

52
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,870
I'll take good care of you and both children.

53
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,750
No!

54
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,870
Let go of me!

55
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,620
If you hadn't forced me,

56
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,620
how would I ever be carrying your child?

57
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,620
I will never acknowledge him,

58
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,870
nor will I ever love him.

59
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,330
Yuankai is my only child.

60
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,200
You want to leave me?

61
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,080
I'll make sure you can never leave me.

62
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,700
Don't you find it ridiculous?

63
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,700
You ignored me for all these years,

64
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,580
and now you tell me

65
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,750
that I'm your only son.

66
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,190
Zeng Shaozong,

67
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,790
what exactly do you want?

68
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,750
What do I want?

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,130
Father and son, we'll take over the entire Yong City.

70
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,370
From now on,

71
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,250
don't you want to taste what it's like

72
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,180
to hold your fate in your own hands?

73
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,700
My poor son.

74
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,410
Let me ask you.

75
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,650
How did the First Madam die?

76
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,080
I don't know.

77
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,480
You don't know?

78
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,300
The First Madam's corpse had flesh under her fingernails,

79
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,120
and fingermarks on her neck.

80
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,620
She was clearly strangled to death.

81
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,410
Young Madam,

82
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,110
what are you talking about?

83
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,120
I don't know.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,060
Then let me ask you another question.

85
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,830
How did Jiang Shuwan die?

86
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,659
I don't know.

87
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,120
I don't know.

88
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,260
It doesn't matter.

89
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,700
Soon it will be difficult for you to even tell lies.

90
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,580
Manager Zheng.

91
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,790
Don't come any closer.

92
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,200
Come down and keep me company.

93
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,460
Don't come any closer.

94
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,330
Don't come any closer.

95
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,660
I'm so lonely.

96
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,160
Come stay with me.

97
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Don't come any closer.

98
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,420
Don't come any closer.

99
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,080
I didn't kill you.

100
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,540
I didn't kill you.

101
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,040
I only dumped your body behind the mountain.

102
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,160
Please spare me.

103
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,000
Have mercy on me.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,930
Please let me go.

105
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,600
If you want to keep having nightmares

106
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,040
like you just did,

107
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,160
then keep your mouth shut

108
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,280
and stay loyal to your master.

109
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll talk.

110
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,660
I'll tell you everything.

111
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,660
Master,

112
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,580
I'm afraid it's not working.

113
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,750
This is already the third batch of test subjects.

114
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,620
The new doctor says

115
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,040
we need more test subjects

116
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,440
to develop the antidote.

117
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,130
Keep bringing them in.

118
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,500
Get as many as needed.

119
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,370
Yes, sir.

120
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,429
Make sure the antidote is developed.

121
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,250
Don't conduct any more tests in the mansion.

122
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,980
Understood.

123
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,830
Take care of him.

124
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,700
I'll handle her myself.

125
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,540
Master, please don't kill me!

126
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,080
Who told you to be so disobedient?

127
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,660
I'll be good, I promise!

128
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,660
It's too late for that.

129
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,580
Failed experiments must be discarded.

130
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,520
Gu Manqing was like this,

131
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,000
and so are you.

132
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,370
Help!

133
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,790
Please don't blame me.

134
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,200
Blame the one who killed you instead.

135
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,400
Please don't come after me.

136
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,950
Tell me quickly,

137
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,000
who cured you?

138
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,410
That Yan Ran.

139
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,660
Yuan Tuo.

140
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,580
You and your mother were poisoned with Fushou pills.

141
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,040
I have now perfected an improved version.

142
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,370
If you help me create an antidote,

143
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,000
we could take not just Yong City,

144
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,040
but even Xue City and Rong City would be within our grasp.

145
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,370
I'm not interested.

146
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,160
Fine.

147
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,580
So stubborn.

148
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,540
She's just a little girl.

149
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,950
I have ways to make her obey.

150
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,330
As for you,

151
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,450
after I complete my great work,

152
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,050
I'll find someone to properly discipline you.

153
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,080
You'll have to endure this place for a few days.

154
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Think carefully about what I've told you today.

155
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,790
Indeed,

156
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,510
the mastermind behind everything

157
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,830
is Zeng Shaozong.

158
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,050
But how should I tell Yuan Kai about this?

159
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:14,940
Yuan Kai?

160
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,420
What's wrong?

161
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,560
What's the matter?

162
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,160
Yan Ran,

163
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,170
let's get a divorce.

164
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,200
What?
