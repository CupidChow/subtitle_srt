1
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,250
If he hadn't known you were sick,

2
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,120
I wouldn't have caught him lingering outside our house.

3
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,720
How long were you planning to keep this secret?

4
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,000
But mother...

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,870
Why would you do this?

6
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,250
I know Father isn't exactly a good husband,

7
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,750
but you can't be pregnant with your lover's child.

8
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,830
Even if you don't love him anymore,

9
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,540
you could have gotten a divorce.

10
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,750
How could I?

11
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,290
If I divorce him,

12
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,380
what happens to all this wealth?

13
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,330
Should I just stand by and watch him

14
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,990
leave everything to Gu Manqing's two bastards?

15
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,410
Or should it go to

16
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,870
those disgraceful mistresses of his?

17
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,829
Besides,

18
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,500
if Zeng Shaozong can have mistresses,

19
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,250
why can't I have lovers?

20
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,620
What will happen to you if this continues?

21
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,540
Yuanying, listen to me.

22
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,450
Now that you know,

23
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,870
you and I are in this together.

24
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,829
This matter

25
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:38,450
cannot be revealed to anyone, not a single word.

26
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,540
Otherwise,

27
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,000
both of us, mother and daughter, will suffer terrible consequences.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,370
Do you understand?

29
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,500
Okay.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,329
Even if not for me,

31
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,500
not for yourself,

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,620
don't you care about Tong Hao's life anymore?

33
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,770
You're threatening me with Tong Hao again.

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,910
Yuanying.

35
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,080
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,290
Yuanying, I didn't mean it that way.

37
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,120
You're my child.

38
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,370
You're my flesh and blood.

39
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,830
Would I ever harm you?

40
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,290
But,

41
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,750
I want you to put yourself in my shoes,

42
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,750
to see things from my perspective.

43
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,700
Can you try to understand me?

44
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,040
Forget it.

45
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,380
Stop talking.

46
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,100
You should go back first.

47
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,790
Dr. Ars,

48
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,190
you finished so quickly?

49
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,079
Do you know that Master Zeng has a private condition?

50
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,680
And you asked me to treat him.

51
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,829
Private condition?

52
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,040
You're going to be the death of me, Yan Ran.

53
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
I've never heard of that.

54
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,830
Let me tell you.

55
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,330
He can't have children.

56
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,930
He came to me. What could I do?

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Did he specifically

58
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,080
mention anything else to you?

59
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,700
I don't know.

60
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,300
Or if there's any other ques-

61
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,750
Dr. Ars, is there anything else to discuss?

62
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,950
Why don't we talk in the study?

63
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,210
No, Young Master Zeng.

64
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,040
I'm terribly sorry,

65
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,700
but I have urgent matters to attend to today.

66
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,700
Please excuse me.

67
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,950
From now on, except for me,

68
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,010
don't stand so close to any other man.

69
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,220
Why are you being so jealous?

70
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,160
Why did Father suddenly stop Huosang

71
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
and ask for his medical help?

72
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,330
How would I know?

73
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,250
This wasn't part of the plan either.

74
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,710
You two were talking so closely just now.

75
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,230
Was that part of the plan?

76
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,320
I have something to report.

77
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,000
Our people followed the young miss all the way to Liyuan.

78
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,040
Liyuan?

79
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:58,450
I remember that day when we came back from the hospital.

80
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,250
I also wish to bear children for my husband.

81
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,120
I've consulted all the famous doctors in Yong City.

82
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,200
They all say I'm in excellent health

83
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,860
and should have no problem bearing children.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,730
Mother, I deserve punishment.

85
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,080
So clumsy.

86
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,580
Mother, let me help you change your clothes.

87
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,450
Are you saying...

88
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,200
Could the first madam and that actor...

89
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,910
Have someone keep a close eye on the young miss and Yang Fan.

90
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,700
They will definitely meet again.

91
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,250
Yes.

92
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,790
Miss.

93
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,540
No need.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,540
Let me escort you back.

95
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,830
If you don't return soon,

96
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,330
the Yue family will scold you again.

97
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,159
Juexi,

98
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,900
please leave me alone for a while,

99
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,200
would you?

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,660
Yes.

101
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,120
Even if not for me,

102
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,290
or for yourself.

103
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,820
Don't you care about Tong Hao's life anymore?

104
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,660
No.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,040
I can't be a burden to Tong Hao anymore.

106
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,120
How dare you seduce our Zeng family's young lady to elope!

107
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,750
Today I'll show you

108
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,830
the pain of a toad trying to eat swan meat.

109
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,080
You go first.

110
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,140
I'll come find you.

111
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,370
Do you trust me?

112
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,080
Go.

113
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,909
Mother,

114
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,370
I'll go home with you.

115
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,120
Please let him go.

116
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,700
Stop it! Stop it!

117
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:54,790
Mother.

118
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:55,950
Mother.

119
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,580
I'm begging you.

120
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,450
I beg you.

121
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,450
Please spare him.

122
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,290
I'm begging you to let him go.

123
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,120
I'll do anything you want.

124
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,870
Yuanying.

125
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,320
I'll go home with you.

126
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,080
If you want to save Tong Hao's life,

127
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,370
then be a good girl and marry into the Yue family.

128
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,500
You should know that

129
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,330
in this vast city of Yong,

130
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,580
no one would care

131
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,660
about the loss of one worthless life.

132
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,500
I'll marry.

133
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,290
I'll marry.

134
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,909
Elder, look.

135
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,790
It's getting late.

136
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,580
Yuanying.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,950
Don't cry.

138
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,120
Yuanying.

139
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,550
I know you're feeling terrible.

140
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,450
But no matter what you do,

141
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,410
you should do it for your own happiness.

142
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,040
If it's

143
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,540
If it's your closest family,

144
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,580
Even if it's someone you love dearly,

145
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,110
you shouldn't do it for them

146
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,630
if it goes against your own wishes.

147
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,830
Second Young Master of the Zeng family, Zeng Yuantuo.

148
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,160
What are you doing here?

149
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,950
I'm home.

150
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,580
Young Master, you should hurry back to the Zeng family.

151
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,910
Who says I'm going back?

152
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,450
This is your home.

153
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,410
Yes.

154
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,340
Alright then.

155
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,870
Let's go to your place instead.

156
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,790
What?

157
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:26,950
Why?

158
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,430
Let's eat.

159
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,450
I'll take you home after dinner.

160
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,660
I don't eat potatoes.

161
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,750
Then eat cabbage.

162
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,590
Cabbage tastes awful.

163
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,580
Eggs should be fine, right?

164
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,080
I'm allergic to eggs.

165
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,660
Then what do you want to eat?

166
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,290
I want to eat

167
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
candied haws,

168
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,410
sesame flatbread,

169
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,140
stinky tofu,

170
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,450
and snowflake pastry.

171
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,510
Take it or leave it.

172
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,080
You're so stingy.

173
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,910
Making four vegetarian dishes.

174
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,040
You should be grateful to have anything to eat.

175
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,790
Don't you have any meat?

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,930
I only cook meat when Yan Ran comes.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,660
Isn't that my sister-in-law?

178
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,450
Sister-in-law?

179
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,580
Don't be ridiculous. Sister-in-law!

180
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,040
She and I are family.

181
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,750
What's the difference who comes?

182
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,810
I'm really hungry.

183
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,750
I want meat.

184
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,130
Zeng Yuantuo,

185
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,250
I never thought someone who hasn't gone out for years

186
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,410
would talk so much.

187
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,910
It's precisely because I haven't gone out for years.

188
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,080
All the words I want to say need to come out.

189
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,280
It's suffocating keeping them inside.

190
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,830
Hey, you fraud.

191
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,700
Take off that fake beard.

192
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,740
What are you pretending to be?

193
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,290
You look more like a human without it.

194
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,950
I'm afraid my handsomeness might kill you, honestly.

195
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,480
Take off those glasses too.

196
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,620
Acting all proper and stuff.

197
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,900
Your disguise is pretty good, to be honest.

198
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,290
Not bad, right?

199
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,700
Alright,

200
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,200
stop eating.

201
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,880
Take me out for a drink.

202
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,910
Drinking?

203
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,330
I've never tried it before and want to.

204
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,190
I always see my brother drinking.

205
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,580
If I get you drunk...

206
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,410
Hey, come on.

207
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,250
Let's go.

208
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,250
Let's go.

209
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,500
Master Zeng.

210
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,100
This is your blood test report.

211
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,790
How is it?

212
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,380
Just tell me straight.

213
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,870
Master Zeng,

214
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,620
in your blood,

215
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,830
we've now detected multiple toxins.

216
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,790
To be frank,

217
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,090
you lost your ability to father children long ago.

218
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,080
Dr. Ares,

219
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,870
you can't just let him die!

220
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,160
Isn't that Miss Yuanying?

221
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,410
Miss.

222
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,480
Yin Yin, she...

223
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,870
I mean, your mother...

224
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,750
My mother is fine.

225
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,350
That's good.

226
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,700
That's good.

227
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,040
What about the baby?

228
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,700
Both mother and child are safe.

229
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,750
That's a relief.

230
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,670
I can rest easy then.

231
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,910
Don't worry.

232
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,750
You're still only concerned about your own peace of mind.

233
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,540
Do you realize

234
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,750
that your very presence

235
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,290
is a huge danger to my mother?

236
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,290
I'm warning you.

237
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,450
If there's nothing important in the future,

238
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,780
don't come to our house.

239
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,160
To avoid suspicion.

240
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,290
I understand, Miss.

241
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,950
As long as the mother and child are safe.

242
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,450
This is the last time I'll deliver messages for you.

243
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,710
Take care of yourself.

244
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,330
Sir.

245
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,830
Sir.

246
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,410
Sir.

247
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,950
These Western gadgets

248
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,080
can't be fully trusted.
