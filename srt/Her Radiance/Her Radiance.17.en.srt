1
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,160
The safety of your wife and the unborn child

2
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,890
depends entirely on you, Miss.

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,830
Miss.

4
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,539
It's fine.

5
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,500
Remember everything I told you today.

6
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,870
Sir.

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,329
Once you take this step,

8
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,410
there's no turning back.

9
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:24,910
Dr. Ars discovered I've had toxins in my body for years.

10
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,120
And at this very moment,

11
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,660
that whore gets pregnant by someone else.

12
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,210
But the first madam and you

13
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,940
have been married for over 20 years after all.

14
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,500
Such a vicious scheme.

15
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,370
When has she ever remembered our 20 years of marriage?

16
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,040
I'm just

17
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,829
protecting the Zeng family's reputation.

18
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,540
Yes, sir.

19
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,700
Paying respects to the first madam.

20
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,660
Madam, when you were sick last time

21
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,790
my father couldn't visit you due to business matters

22
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,160
and he feels very guilty about it.

23
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,700
This time

24
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,700
he specifically asked me to buy premium bird's nest from Renji Pharmacy

25
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,760
and bring it to you.

26
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,500
Please thank your father for me.

27
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,410
Madam,

28
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,540
my father said

29
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,200
that this bird's nest

30
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,329
is most nourishing when consumed hot.

31
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,200
I understand.

32
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,079
You may go now.

33
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,040
Yes.

34
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,370
I told you so.

35
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,350
The master still favors you.

36
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,950
What favor?

37
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,540
Take it away. It irritates me just looking at it.

38
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,160
Isn't that too wasteful?

39
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,500
You want to drink it?

40
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,330
I...

41
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,950
How come

42
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,450
now that you're a concubine,

43
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,180
you don't listen to me anymore?

44
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,870
Yes, First Madam.

45
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,200
What is this?

46
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,100
Bird's nest.

47
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,160
Bird's nest?

48
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,290
Why would you throw away bird's nest?

49
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,330
Madam said to throw it away.

50
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,040
Xingchun.

51
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,660
Mom.

52
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,790
Alright, I won't throw it away.

53
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,909
Take it to the old lady.

54
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,909
I'm still young. I don't need supplements.

55
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,909
Yes, madam.

56
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:42,540
Mom, who sent this bird's nest?

57
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,830
You're pregnant now.

58
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,870
Having some bird's nest soup would be good for you.

59
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,070
The doctor says I'm perfectly healthy.

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,250
Besides, I don't need him to provide supplements for me.

61
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,250
Out of nowhere.

62
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,620
Your father had Manager Zheng bring me bird's nest.

63
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,409
I suspect

64
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,450
it's that Jin Bao from the Metropolitan

65
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,540
manipulating him again.

66
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,790
He wants me to give in and let her into our house.

67
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,080
This bird's nest is from my father.

68
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,870
Isn't that so?

69
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,040
When someone's overly nice

70
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,370
they're up to no good.

71
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,830
Do you have any idea

72
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,430
how dangerous your existence is for my mother?

73
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,410
This is the last time I'll pass messages for you.

74
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,790
Don't come to my house unless necessary in the future,

75
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,390
to avoid raising suspicion.

76
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,330
Hey!

77
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,790
Where are you rushing off to?

78
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,700
You didn't listen to a single word I said.

79
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,750
Manners!

80
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,330
You have none at all.

81
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,090
Grandmother.

82
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,290
Yuanying, what's wrong?

83
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,200
That's good.

84
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,310
I'm glad you're alright.

85
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,700
Oh, Grandmother!

86
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,080
Call a doctor!

87
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,370
Hurry, get a doctor!

88
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,660
It wasn't me.

89
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,290
Yuanying.

90
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:10,910
I'm here.

91
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't bother finding a doctor.

92
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,410
I know.

93
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,040
I don't have much time left.

94
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,160
You'll be fine, Grandmother.

95
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,700
Yuanying.

96
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,620
You must live well.

97
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,830
If you ever have the means,

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,790
you must

99
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,790
leave the Zeng family.

100
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,720
Grandmother, please don't scare me.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,830
Don't

102
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,409
report this to officials.

103
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,300
Grandmother!

104
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:55,710
Grandmother!

105
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Grandmother!

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,830
Grandmother, don't scare me! Grandmother!

107
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,090
Doctor, come quickly!

108
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,750
Young master, young mistress,

109
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,150
something terrible has happened! The old lady is in trouble!

110
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,330
Mother!

111
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,130
Grandmother!

112
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,370
Grandmother!

113
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,170
Grandmother!

114
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,290
Mother!

115
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,620
Mother!

116
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:38,750
Mother!

117
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,330
Mother.

118
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,700
Yuankai.

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,870
The old lady has been laid to rest.

120
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,010
You need to pull yourself together soon.

121
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,640
After my mother passed away,

122
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,560
my brother Yuantuo and I became invisible in the Zeng family.

123
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,000
The first madam doesn't care about us.

124
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,050
Father is busy with his business all day.

125
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,280
Until Grandmother returned from her Buddhist pilgrimage.

126
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,620
In the Zeng family,

127
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,590
only Grandmother treated us well.

128
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,370
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,540
I never meant to involve the old lady in this.

130
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,500
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,540
It's not your fault.

132
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,330
Yan Ran.

133
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,200
Life is unpredictable.

134
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,750
Madam, you're here.

135
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,790
Madam, it wasn't me.

136
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,150
Really, it wasn't me.

137
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,670
Madam, you won't abandon me, will you?

138
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,200
The old lady's death

139
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,000
has nothing to do with me, Madam.

140
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,650
You won't turn your back on me, will you?

141
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,750
How could I?

142
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,410
I heard the master starved you for a day.

143
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,200
That's why I'm here to see you.

144
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,910
Don't worry.

145
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,200
You grew up by my side.

146
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,650
You're like half a daughter to me.

147
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,000
How could I leave you to suffer?

148
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Thank you, Madam.

149
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Xingchun will serve you from now on.

150
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you, Madam.

151
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Thank you, Madam.

152
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,450
All right.

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,600
Have something to eat first.

154
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,180
The old lady was just buried.

155
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,380
Why is she looking for Xingchun at a time like this?

156
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,620
What are you doing here?

157
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,080
Are you here to laugh at me?

158
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,540
Xingchun.

159
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,370
We know you don't have the courage to kill the old lady.

160
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,700
Think carefully about what's at stake.

161
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,580
Cooperate with us.

162
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,000
Help us identify Chen Shulin as the murderer.

163
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,400
Yan Ran and I might be able to save your life.

164
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,450
Save me?

165
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,830
Every single one of you.

166
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,870
You all just want to use me.

167
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,830
Once I'm no longer useful,

168
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,250
I'll be thrown back into the gutter like a rat.

169
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,330
Who will protect me?

170
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,290
The old lady was the only person in this house

171
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,790
who never hit me,

172
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,870
never scolded me.

173
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,870
And now I've killed her with my own hands.

174
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,500
I believe you didn't mean for the old lady to die.

175
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,160
She wouldn't blame you.

176
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,210
She's watching from heaven now.

177
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,660
If you truly feel remorse,

178
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,370
the best way is to tell the truth

179
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,330
so she can rest in peace.

180
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,080
Xingchun.

181
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,410
Xingchun.

182
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,580
Xingchun.

183
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,690
What's wrong, Xingchun?

184
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,790
It's too late.

185
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,120
Xingchun, you can't die.

186
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,250
She still didn't let me go in the end.

187
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,330
Xingchun, you can't die.

188
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:06,910
Xingchun,

189
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,250
you're the only one who can identify Chen Shulin as the murderer.

190
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,200
You can't die.

191
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,920
This is for the best.

192
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,830
It's time for me to atone for my sins.

193
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,620
Yan Ran.

194
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,460
Leave the Zeng family.

195
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,000
Leave this man-eating den of evil.

196
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,220
Xingchun.

197
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,470
Xingchun.

198
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,750
Yan Ran,

199
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,080
we'll definitely find another way.

200
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,500
Chen Shulin,

201
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,040
I will expose your true face.
