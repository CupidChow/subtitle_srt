1
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:35,370
Yan Ran.

2
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,410
Uh.

3
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,789
Let's get a divorce.

4
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,410
What?

5
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,289
Didn't you hear me?

6
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,120
I said divorce.

7
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,580
Seriously?

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,860
You're really clinging to me.

9
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,950
Yuantuo hasn't been found yet.

10
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,120
And you still have time to joke around?

11
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,780
My brother's affairs are none of your business.

12
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,790
I was nice to you before

13
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,290
because you're somewhat pretty.

14
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,220
You took it seriously, didn't you?

15
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,910
Well.

16
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,540
A poor girl like you,

17
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,510
if given the chance to enter high society

18
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
and become a rich man's wife,

19
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,750
would stick like glue,

20
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,040
right?

21
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,370
Huh?

22
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,620
Young master,

23
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,580
the master said

24
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,120
if you drink this,

25
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
it will relieve your suffering.

26
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,079
Yan Ran,

27
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,120
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,500
He's my father.

29
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,160
Everything that follows

30
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,620
shouldn't be faced by you.

31
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,580
Yuan Kai.

32
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,500
What's wrong with you?

33
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,190
Do you know that Zeng Shaozong is actually...

34
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,700
Why aren't you willing to face this with me?

35
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,290
Tell me,

36
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,680
what do you want?

37
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,700
I admire you, my lord.

38
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,950
I don't want anything.

39
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,560
As long as I can serve my master,

40
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,540
I'm willing to do anything.

41
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:43,500
Let me take you to a nice place, shall we?

42
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,580
Mm-hmm.

43
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,159
Master.

44
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,790
Take her to the testing chamber behind the mountain.

45
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,410
She's a perfect test subject.

46
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,140
Don't waste this opportunity.

47
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,950
While Yan Ran and Zeng Yuankai are separated,

48
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,620
send someone to capture her immediately.

49
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,410
Yes, Master.

50
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,950
My antidote.

51
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,310
I refuse to believe this.

52
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,540
I will have everything.

53
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,140
Since my mother passed away,

54
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,000
I've taken over this theater.

55
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,720
So there are no more performances to watch now.

56
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm not here for a show.

57
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,410
Do you want to know

58
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,470
how your mother really died?

59
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,370
As I thought.

60
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,120
Indeed.

61
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,740
So you've always known it was your father.

62
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,370
Besides that,

63
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,000
my sister Jiang Shuwan's death,

64
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,950
Zeng Yuankai's mother,

65
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,570
and now Zeng Yuantuo's disappearance,

66
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,480
along with the frequent disappearances of beggars in the city.

67
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,790
When they returned, they were either insane

68
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,920
or died tragically.

69
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,330
All because of him.

70
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,660
It's just that now

71
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,320
I haven't found concrete evidence yet.

72
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,060
I only know that

73
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,000
the killer has

74
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,890
an iris tattoo on his arm just like your mother's.

75
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,500
Why are you telling me all this?

76
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,580
Yuanying.

77
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,610
He is your biological father after all.

78
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,030
I have no ulterior motive in telling you this.

79
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,659
I just want to remind you of

80
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,080
what the old lady told you before she died.

81
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,610
Don't be controlled by the Zeng family anymore.

82
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,870
Go live your own life.

83
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,870
When you're capable enough in the future,

84
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,750
you must

85
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,790
leave the Zeng family.

86
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,410
Grandmother.

87
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,200
My own life.

88
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,700
Don't interfere with me.

89
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,030
I said don't interfere with me, any of you.

90
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,710
Your mother-in-law just passed away.

91
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,450
I know you're going through a hard time.

92
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,000
If you want to drink,

93
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,500
I'll drink with you.

94
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,120
You can't drink.

95
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,920
Your health is poor.

96
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,370
You can't handle alcohol.

97
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,620
You know what?

98
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,790
From today on,

99
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,370
I have no home.

100
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,830
I don't even have my closest family anymore.

101
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,830
I have no home left.

102
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,950
From now on,

103
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,030
the Yue family is your home.

104
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,380
What's wrong?

105
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,080
Yan Ran.

106
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,330
Let's get divorced.

107
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,540
Girls from poor families like you

108
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,510
if given the chance to enter high society

109
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,690
and become a rich man's wife

110
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,540
would stick like glue and never let go.

111
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,330
Zeng Yuankai, are you in there?

112
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,750
Zeng Yuankai!

113
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,500
Open the door

114
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
and let me see you.

115
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,540
Zeng Yuankai, open the door

116
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,370
and let me in.

117
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,050
Don't come in.

118
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,750
Yan Ran,

119
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:40,910
I'm fine.

120
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,200
Just go.

121
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,790
Qi Huan told me everything.

122
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,750
Please let me in to see you.

123
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,880
I don't want you to see me like this.

124
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
Please leave.

125
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,500
I've never cared about your appearance.

126
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,660
Zeng Yuankai!

127
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,500
Zeng Yuankai!

128
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,700
You've been poisoned.

129
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,410
Even tigers don't harm their cubs.

130
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,330
Your father...

131
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,660
Zeng Yuankai,

132
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,410
look at me.

133
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,160
Zeng Yuankai!

134
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,950
I'm Yan Ran.

135
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,950
Stab me.

136
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,870
Stab me.

137
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,750
Stab me.

138
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
Stab me.

139
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,830
Stab me.

140
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,830
It's me.

141
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,500
Zeng Yuankai, it's me.

142
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,830
It's me.

143
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,880
Zeng Yuankai!

144
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,290
That little beggar finally woke up

145
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,540
and drew some location features.

146
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,290
Look.

147
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,080
For convenience,

148
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,330
their testing lab must be located near the back temple.

149
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:30,950
Let's go.

150
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,950
We must find this place before dawn.

151
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,870
Hey.

152
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,970
Do you know who I am?

153
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,950
You're the boss's second young master.

154
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,060
Where are all the other guards?

155
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,280
I can't tell you that.

156
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,290
Go!

157
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,660
Why are there so many people?

158
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,870
Good thing we arrived in time.

159
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,130
Quick, save everyone!

160
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,920
Young Master.

161
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,460
Where is the Young Master?

162
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,910
Why don't I see the Young Master?

163
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,620
Don't worry.

164
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,410
Let's get everyone here to the hospital first.

165
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,740
So they can receive immediate treatment.

166
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,000
Don't move!

167
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,540
Get down!

168
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,410
Zeng Yuantuo
