1
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,700
How many times have I told you?

2
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,200
You need to knock before entering.

3
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,460
Where are your manners as the young lady of the Zeng family?

4
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,039
Yang Fan is dead.

5
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,750
Yang Fan is dead.

6
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,700
Mother.

7
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,910
Don't you feel any pain at all?

8
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,700
Tong Hao is also dead.

9
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,200
Isn't he?

10
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:29,660
Once,

11
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,620
you killed Tong Hao for the Yue family's assets

12
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,950
and forced me to submit.

13
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,540
Now for the Zeng family's assets,

14
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,600
you've killed Yang Fan who loved you.

15
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,450
I dare to ask you one question:

16
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,870
Am I just

17
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,930
a chess piece you can discard at will?

18
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,540
Look at yourself now.

19
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,780
Where is the elegance and dignity of the Zeng family's young lady?

20
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,610
I'll pretend I didn't hear what you just said.

21
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,450
You should know

22
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,870
everything I do is for your own good.

23
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,160
Don't ever

24
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,090
speak such disrespectful words in front of me again.

25
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,870
I understand.

26
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,890
I'm already married anyway.

27
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,300
I'll just go back to the Yue family.

28
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,450
Mother.

29
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,829
Take good care of yourself from now on.

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,529
What brings you back today?

31
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,079
I missed you, of course.

32
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,440
You're always so sweet-talking.

33
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,290
The medicine is very strong.

34
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,950
It's not good for your health.

35
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,560
Yan Ran, how could you be so careless?

36
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,500
Mother, I heard you were sick.

37
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,200
Let me take a look at you.

38
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,620
If Zeng Shaozong can keep a mistress,

39
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,200
why can't I?

40
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,909
What will you do if that's the case?

41
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,870
Why did you even come back?

42
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,870
Go back to your Yue family!

43
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,540
Don't ever come back!

44
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,870
Get out!

45
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,910
Get out.

46
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,000
Madam.

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,540
Madam.

48
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,720
All these years,

49
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,700
you've constantly reminded me

50
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,040
that everything I have now is thanks to you

51
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,700
and your family.

52
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,540
For over 20 years,

53
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,830
you've enjoyed the privileges of being the first wife,

54
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,700
but that's coming to an end.

55
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,830
Zeng Shaozong.

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,450
I should have replaced that sterilization drug

57
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,370
with arsenic,

58
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,080
so you could join your Gu Manqing in the afterlife.

59
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,870
Don't kill me.

60
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,410
Men's shoes.

61
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,540
Impossible.

62
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,330
Impossible.

63
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,330
Ah!

64
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,120
Yuan Kai.

65
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,290
You'll handle the funeral.

66
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,659
Keep it simple.

67
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,910
Xiao Kai,

68
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,330
come here.

69
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,000
Your Highness.

70
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,870
Mother.

71
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,090
The person who hurt you is dead now.

72
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,039
Are you at peace now?

73
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,809
Those who harm others end up harming themselves.

74
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,370
She hurt your mother

75
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,540
and my sister.

76
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,510
It also harmed Xingchun and the old lady.

77
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,250
Everything was her own doing.

78
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,830
I just never expected

79
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,590
that she would end up taking her own life.

80
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,750
Now that the scandal is exposed,

81
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,970
even if she hadn't killed herself,

82
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,860
Father wouldn't have tolerated her anymore.

83
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,910
Damn it!

84
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,950
They all deserve to die.

85
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,910
How dare they betray me.

86
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,830
Go!

87
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,000
Arrest them all!

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,750
The more the better.

89
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,950
Bring everyone to me.

90
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,500
I'll make them all obey me.

91
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,370
Sir, Madam.

92
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,660
I've searched the entire mansion,

93
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,450
but there's still no sign of the young master.

94
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,450
I told him

95
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,910
not to leave before he fully recovered.

96
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,510
He should be resting at home.

97
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,770
Where did he go?

98
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,080
Sir, Madam.

99
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,750
Many people have gone missing in town recently.

100
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,750
Something is very wrong.

101
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,880
Notify Qiyu to search the entire city.

102
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,410
Yes.

103
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,620
Father.

104
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,070
Let's go.

105
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,410
Sir.

106
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,810
I need to call the police.

107
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,750
Please help save my brother.

108
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,870
Go ahead and call the police.

109
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,200
Why are you grabbing me?

110
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,660
Captain Tu,

111
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,930
what's going on?

112
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,790
Little girl,

113
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,620
are you okay?

114
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,250
My brother was taken by bad people.

115
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,620
I saw it with my own eyes.

116
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,580
He knocked my brother out and put him in a bag.

117
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,790
You saw it yourself?

118
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,480
How many of them were there?

119
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,450
Two.

120
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,040
Enough.

121
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,410
Take her away and find out what happened.

122
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,660
This filthy beggar.

123
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,290
Little girl, tell me slowly.

124
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,660
What exactly happened?
