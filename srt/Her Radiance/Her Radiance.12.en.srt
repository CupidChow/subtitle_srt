1
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,930
Look at how much pain you're in.

2
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:43,000
Won't you let me take a look?

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,700
Yuantuo.

4
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,750
Yuantuo, are you okay?

5
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Yuantuo.

6
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,400
Yuantuo.

7
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:56,780
Yuantuo.

8
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,950
Calm down.

9
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,450
Take a deep breath.

10
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,370
Deep breaths.

11
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,150
Yuantuo.

12
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,080
Breathe deeply.

13
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,880
Zeng Yuankai.

14
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,790
Zeng Yuantuo.

15
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,540
Don't you know what condition your body is in?

16
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,940
How dare you run out here.

17
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,610
I just suddenly remembered something.

18
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,620
I came to tell you.

19
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,680
What did you say?

20
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,160
Don't kill me.

21
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,370
When I went in,

22
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,200
I saw that Yuantuo's condition

23
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,730
was different from before.

24
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,950
I did hear

25
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,160
a woman screaming.

26
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,040
But when I got there,

27
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,500
there was only a handkerchief on the ground.

28
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,370
So this means

29
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,980
the killer is very familiar with the Zeng family.

30
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,620
Otherwise, they couldn't have

31
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,820
taken my sister's body away so quickly.

32
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,690
Then it must be one of the Zeng family masters.

33
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,910
By the way,

34
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,160
the person who choked someone

35
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
seemed to have a tattoo on their arm.

36
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,520
Was that person male or female?

37
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,660
I don't remember.

38
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,250
Dr. Hao said

39
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,580
that blood from a sister can also save a life,

40
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,370
it can be used as a catalyst for medicine.

41
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,580
Our Yue'er

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,159
must be the best doctor in all of Yong City.

43
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,080
Sister,

44
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,010
what exactly did you experience when you were alive?

45
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,909
Who are you afraid of?

46
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,660
Young Master,

47
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,260
the young mistress entered your room tonight.

48
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,710
So she found out after all.

49
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,000
Young Master,

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,750
regarding Lao Liu's lead,

51
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,080
I've been following it.

52
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,910
I discovered that the leader of the Fuze Gang

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,130
is Commander Huang.

54
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,370
It's him.

55
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,450
Yes, Young Master.

56
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,200
Even if we were facing an ordinary person, we could fight them,

57
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,870
but our opponent is Commander Huang who controls an army.

58
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,270
If we continue like this,

59
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,890
we're certainly throwing eggs against a rock.

60
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,620
There's no need to rush this matter.

61
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,159
We need to plan carefully.

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,950
Yes.

63
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,500
Yan Ran.

64
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,950
I know.

65
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,160
Eyes are fragile.

66
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,250
I'll be careful.

67
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,080
What

68
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,580
are you doing?

69
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,120
I

70
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,790
will definitely help you find

71
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,080
your sister's killer.

72
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,340
Zeng Yuankai.

73
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,620
Why did you lie to me?

74
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,580
Why don't you admit you're Mr. Gu?

75
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,290
You had many chances before

76
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,450
to tell me the truth.

77
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,550
Why didn't you say anything?

78
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,660
Was it fun playing me?

79
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,120
You watched me in front of you

80
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,450
confessing my feelings.

81
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,410
Do you think I'm stupid?

82
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,140
Why am I brave enough to say it

83
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,190
but you're not?

84
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,500
I take back what I said before.

85
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,210
You're not a man at all.

86
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,370
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,159
No matter what happens,

88
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,500
just remember

89
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,910
I will always protect you,

90
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,790
regardless of who I am.

91
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,540
Yan Ran

92
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,500
Jingxin

93
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,970
He hasn't been honest with you yet.

94
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,350
Young Master

95
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,910
has almost fully recovered.

96
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,140
Don't worry.

97
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,309
However, since the Young Master left the hospital,

98
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,100
he must not overexert himself.

99
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,580
He still needs rest.

100
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,500
Both of you should be careful.

101
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,750
For example, regarding intimate relations,

102
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,660
it's best to exercise some restraint.

103
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,890
Thank you, doctor.

104
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,100
My wife and I will be careful.

105
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,040
Good.

106
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,660
Goodbye.

107
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Young master.

108
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,710
Young master.

109
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,580
Qi Yu has found out

110
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,380
that the person who hired someone to kill your wife

111
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,930
is the first madam.

112
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,730
It's her again.

113
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,720
Chen Shulin is getting more and more reckless.

114
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,670
She's tried to harm you more than once.

115
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,080
The assassin at the Metropolitan was also sent by her.

116
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,660
Young madam, you don't even know

117
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,620
that she was also responsible for the young master's mother's death.

118
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,410
What?

119
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,700
Is what he's saying true?

120
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,220
When I was young, I never questioned my mother's death.

121
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,830
It wasn't until I grew up

122
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,830
and met my mother's former loyal servant that I learned

123
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,760
my mother didn't die from illness,

124
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,750
but was poisoned.

125
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,660
According to my mother's former servant,

126
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,110
Chen Shulin is likely the real culprit.

127
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,040
I've been pretending to be a playboy all these years

128
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,900
just to make her let her guard down

129
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,860
so I could gather evidence.

130
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,620
If that's the case,

131
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,000
she's very likely

132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,060
the person with the tattoo on her arm.

133
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,950
Mother, I know.

134
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,450
Mother,

135
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,910
I know you've been having liver heat issues lately.

136
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,000
This white fungus and bird's nest soup can clear the heat.

137
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,660
It's nourishing for your skin. Please try some.

138
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,980
Mother, are you alright?

139
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,790
I'm so sorry.

140
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,980
Don't touch me.

141
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,250
Yan Ran, how could you be so careless?

142
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,580
So clumsy.

143
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,160
Mother,

144
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
let me help you change your clothes.

145
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,500
No need.

146
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,750
You may go now.

147
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,410
It's fine.

148
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,410
Have a seat.

149
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,120
Keep singing.

150
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,160
Then I'll take my leave.

151
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,910
Looks like I need to find another way.
