1
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,450
Father.

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,789
Father.

3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,910
Yan Ran,

4
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,240
what are you doing here?

5
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,329
Father,

6
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,620
I've brought you some ginseng soup.

7
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,579
Yuan Kai has already filed a report.

8
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:34,040
The police said they'll assign more officers to find Yuan Tuo.

9
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,600
Please don't make yourself ill with worry.

10
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
There are maids in the house.

11
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,410
Why deliver it yourself?

12
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,160
Taking care of your health is my duty as your daughter-in-law.

13
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,590
If you're just delivering soup,

14
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,500
why did you close my door?

15
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:58,829
Father,

16
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,330
drink the ginseng soup while it's hot.

17
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,620
Sir.

18
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,660
Sir,

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,730
Commander Huang has invited you to the teahouse.

20
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,200
Father has business to attend to.

21
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,500
I'll take my leave now.

22
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,040
If we follow Commander Huang,

23
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,540
we can definitely trace the connection today

24
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,450
and expose Fushou Wan as the mastermind behind everything.

25
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,660
Is the source reliable?

26
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,079
I planted a servant in his household

27
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,540
who personally heard him mention

28
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,910
Fushou Wan during a phone call.

29
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,700
Even if our Lu family can't deal with Commander Huang directly,

30
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,360
destroying Fushou Wan would still be a victory.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,790
We're here.

32
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,370
Sir,

33
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,510
could this be a coincidence?

34
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,120
Is the servant we placed in his household reliable?

35
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,080
Absolutely reliable.

36
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,910
How reliable?

37
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,450
We'd die for each other.

38
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,630
Let's head back first.

39
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,200
We've been working together for over a year.

40
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,700
If you don't tell me about the origin of this Fushou Pill soon,

41
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,160
it just wouldn't be right.

42
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,160
Commander.

43
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you know the infamous doctor Jiang Huandao?

44
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,000
This Fushou Pill

45
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,620
was developed from the formula he left behind.

46
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,120
After taking it, a person will

47
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,409
lose their mind for a long time.

48
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,630
Being manipulated.

49
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,330
I have devoted years to this research.

50
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,540
Recently, I've made significant progress.

51
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,580
If this antidote can be successfully developed,

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,200
the two of us can eliminate the other families

53
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,580
and control all of Yong City.

54
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,010
That would certainly be possible.

55
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,370
From what you're saying,

56
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,120
has this Fushou pill been used on enemy troops?

57
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,950
Of course.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,500
Sir,

59
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,540
we've received word

60
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,370
that the medicine is ready.

61
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,160
Commander.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,250
We've found a way to develop the antidote.

63
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,950
Just give me some more time.

64
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,159
Yong City will soon be ours for the taking.

65
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,450
Mr. Zeng,

66
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,830
don't you think this marriage between our families

67
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,409
should be put on the agenda now?

68
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,870
You're right, Commander.

69
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,200
We should indeed find an auspicious date

70
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,250
for me to marry your daughter.

71
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,700
Then

72
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,080
I should call you my

73
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,340
Father-in-law.

74
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,250
- Come, drink up.
- Come, drink up.

75
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,080
Coming.

76
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,580
Master.

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,250
I found this in the first madam's dowry.

78
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,650
It's a Mandarin Duck rotating incense pot.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,450
Mandarin Duck rotating incense pot?

80
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,120
Indeed.

81
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,500
I've already placed the newly developed Fushou pills

82
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,410
inside this lid.

83
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,330
Like this,

84
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,310
it's just ordinary white liquor.

85
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,160
But if you turn this mechanism,

86
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,040
the Fushou pill will drop into the wine,

87
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,020
turning it into poisoned wine.

88
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,330
Interesting.

89
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,830
Yuankai.

90
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,250
Come sit.

91
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,550
Young master.

92
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,409
Master.

93
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,120
Mandarin Duck rotating incense pot.

94
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,450
I went out today

95
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,590
and brought back some good wine.

96
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,610
We haven't had a drink together in a long time.

97
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,080
Here.

98
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,790
Try this fine wine I brought back.

99
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,810
Father always brings back good wine.

100
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,220
But last night I dreamed of mother.

101
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,230
She was crying, asking me

102
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,850
why I'd forgotten the wine she brewed herself.

103
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,330
Your mother did enjoy brewing wine when she was alive.

104
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,730
And it tasted quite good.

105
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,659
Such a pity.

106
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,980
We'll never taste it again.

107
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,700
Father,

108
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,950
how did mother really die?

109
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,000
I told you she was ill.

110
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,250
The same strange disease as Yuantuo.

111
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,910
Was it really just an illness?

112
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,830
Why do you ask that?

113
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,550
Father, have you considered

114
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,500
that mother might have been murdered?

115
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,700
Your mother is dead.

116
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,200
When people die, they're gone like extinguished lamps.

117
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,160
Let me give you some advice:

118
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,540
just forget about it.

119
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,750
How can I forget?

120
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,870
Remember this:

121
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,560
the Zeng family reputation is more important than anything.

122
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,080
Father.

123
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,000
Father.

124
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,750
Now I'm betting that

125
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,620
besides family reputation,

126
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,200
you still have love for your own flesh and blood.
