1
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,100
Madam is relieved.

2
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,000
The baby in her womb is fine.

3
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,539
Yan Ran is truly audacious.

4
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,000
How dare she deliberately scald you!

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,039
I think she wanted more than just to scald me.

6
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,580
This Yan Ran comes from humble origins.

7
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,910
But she's quite clever.

8
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
The ambush from a few days ago...

9
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,940
They must have found out about it.

10
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,660
A powerless country maid...

11
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,330
Who only knows underhanded tricks...

12
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,830
Is nothing to fear.

13
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,450
I heard...

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,750
Yuan Kai returned from the hospital...

15
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,350
And is watching her closely.

16
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,700
He cares about her more than I expected.

17
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,990
It seems I need to find a way...

18
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:25,160
To break up this false couple.

19
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,329
Mother.

20
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,530
Your pregnancy is stable now.

21
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,960
Why haven't you told Father yet?

22
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,540
Your father now has Little Jin Bao.

23
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,500
If news of my pregnancy gets out...

24
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,170
I'm afraid...

25
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,660
Besides...

26
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,530
I've been waiting for this child for many years.

27
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,540
Sister Xingchun.

28
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,290
The Madam has rewarded all the servants

29
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,750
with a new set of clothes each.

30
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,000
What color are you planning to choose, sister?

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,330
Pink is delicate

32
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,930
and suits me best, of course.

33
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,500
I've already told the steward anyway.

34
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,250
The Madam is so kind and generous,

35
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,660
she even had new clothes made especially for us.

36
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,920
Unlike some people...

37
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,950
What's the point of being a mistress

38
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,610
when you still look so shabby?

39
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,540
Why don't you bow when you see me?

40
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,750
I'm the Madam's head maid.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,750
Why should I bow to you?

42
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:39,200
Well, since you're the Madam's head maid,

43
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,329
you should be very familiar with the household rules.

44
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,870
Let me ask you.

45
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,160
What's your position now?

46
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,870
And what's my position?

47
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,200
Don't think you've made it big just because you're the young mistress now.

48
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,160
We all started as maids.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,790
Oh, so you do know I'm the young mistress.

50
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,410
You're just a maid.

51
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,950
Maid Xingchun,

52
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,120
you neither respect your masters

53
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,780
nor get along with your peers.

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,280
Today I'll teach you a lesson using the Zeng family rules.

55
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,450
Kneel down.

56
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,310
Slap your face.

57
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,200
By what right do you make me kneel?

58
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,660
Because I am the mistress of the Zeng family.

59
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,000
What?

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Not accepting it?

61
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,910
According to the rules,

62
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,370
those who defy will receive thirty strokes.

63
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,290
Kneel down.

64
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,100
I was wrong, Young Mistress.

65
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,330
Hit her.

66
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,250
Wipe her face.

67
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,450
Harder.

68
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,620
Madam,

69
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,910
I only said I was your maid,

70
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,790
but the Young Mistress didn't like it

71
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,870
and beat me.

72
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,300
Madam, please help me get justice.

73
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,410
Xingchun.

74
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,540
You should know.

75
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,670
I can help her become the young mistress,

76
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,159
I can certainly help you rise to power too.

77
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,290
Yes, Madam.

78
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,409
I kowtow to you.

79
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,450
Stop crying. Wipe your tears.

80
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,500
I heard from the butler that you and Yuankai went to the hospital.

81
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,370
I've been too busy

82
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,830
and didn't have time to ask you about it.

83
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,690
How did you end up in the hospital?

84
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,330
Mother,

85
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,540
I had just left the Metropolitan

86
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,040
when I ran into some thugs.

87
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,940
They tried to kidnap me as soon as they saw me

88
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,370
and even threatened to kill me.

89
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,500
Just sell that shipment at a discount.

90
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,780
Alright, let's leave it at that for now.

91
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,160
In broad daylight,

92
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,890
something like this happened.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,290
Yan Ran, are you okay?

94
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,450
I'm fine, Mother.

95
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,120
Fortunately, Yuankai arrived with Qi Huan just in time

96
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,980
and rescued me.

97
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,950
What about those thugs?

98
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,080
Yuankai has already handed them over to the police.

99
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,040
Why are you here?

100
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,659
A few days ago,

101
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,590
Tansi Manor brewed some good wine.

102
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,450
The mistress said you're the best wine connoisseur,

103
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,580
She specifically asked me to bring some for you to taste.

104
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,080
Fine. Just put it there.

105
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,450
You may leave.

106
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,659
Young master,

107
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,410
I shouldn't be bothering you,

108
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,450
but the mistress said

109
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,830
the manor's business hasn't been good lately,

110
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,330
perhaps there's something wrong with the wine.

111
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,190
If you don't help me by tasting it,

112
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,870
when the mistress asks,

113
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,330
what am I supposed to say?

114
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,500
Good that everything's fine.

115
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,790
Yes, fortunately.

116
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,500
No wonder you look so pale.

117
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,480
You should go back and rest early.

118
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,540
Yes.

119
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,230
This wine has a spicy taste.

120
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,540
Perhaps...

121
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,620
Young Master,

122
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,290
what's wrong?

123
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,900
You drugged my drink.

124
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,120
Young Master,

125
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,000
you must be drunk.

126
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,200
Young Master,

127
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,540
I have feelings for you.

128
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,370
How dare you!

129
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,330
Get out!

130
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,120
Young Master, I'm speaking from my heart.

131
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,040
As long as I can be with you,

132
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,570
I don't want anything else.

133
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,080
Young Master.

134
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,790
I really like you so much.

135
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,330
Zeng Yuankai,

136
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,040
what are you doing?

137
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,660
Yan Ran,

138
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,040
listen to me.

139
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,610
It's not what you saw.

140
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,200
Yan Ran, let me explain to you.

141
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,790
Yan Ran.

142
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,310
Yan Ran, please let me explain.

143
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,860
I really don't know what just happened.

144
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,870
Don't know?

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,330
You're a grown man,

146
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,750
are you going to

147
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,550
blame this on Xingchun, a woman?

148
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,120
I swear,

149
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,840
I didn't make the first move on her.

150
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,160
It doesn't matter.

151
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,000
Young Master,

152
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,910
whether you made the first move or she did,

153
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,160
I don't care at all.

154
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,540
You don't care.

155
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,410
In your heart,

156
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,410
what am I to you exactly?

157
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,850
You know very well how this marriage came to be.

158
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,950
Young master, you should be perfectly aware.

159
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,750
Or are you

160
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,550
trying to turn this pretense into reality now?

161
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,660
Are you sick?

162
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,830
Are you a beast?

163
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,810
Instead of pestering me,

164
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,040
you should think about how to take care of her.

165
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,450
Nonsense! Absolute nonsense!

166
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,670
You've just gotten married and already you're...

167
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,660
I just had one drink too many today.

168
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,290
How was I supposed to know?

169
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,950
You're still making excuses?

170
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,790
Tell me.

171
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,040
Now that things have come to this point,

172
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,840
what are you going to do about it?

173
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,120
Madam!

174
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,160
Xingchun has been with you since she was little.

175
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,020
Please help me get justice for what happened today.

176
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,410
The young master can't just say he was drunk

177
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,200
and refuse to take responsibility,

178
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,700
ruining my reputation!

179
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,620
Yuankai.

180
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,950
Although Xingchun is just a maid,

181
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,370
she's still an innocent girl.

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,330
What were you thinking?

183
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,700
If this gets out, it would be scandalous.

184
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
I think you should take her as your concubine.

185
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,000
You'll have someone else to serve you in your room.

186
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,870
Master, what do you think?

187
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,040
No.

188
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,880
I don't need to take a concubine.

189
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,290
If that's the case,

190
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,540
I might as well die,

191
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,170
rather than live to be gossiped about.

192
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,750
Stop her!

193
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,200
What a mess this is.

194
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,950
Master,

195
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,210
please say something.

196
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,370
Yuankai,

197
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,910
are you going to just watch her die?

198
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,160
How would that look to others?

199
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,250
Are the men of our Zeng family

200
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,160
unable to take even this small responsibility?

201
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,470
I don't want to live anymore!

202
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,790
Don't stop me!

203
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,790
Yuan Kai,

204
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,700
are you really going to drive her to death?

205
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,830
Fine.

206
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,450
I'll take.

207
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,730
Although it's a bit simple,

208
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,760
but you are Zeng Yuan Kai's woman now.

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,450
Drink this wedding cup,

210
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,830
and you'll be my concubine from now on.

211
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,480
Xingchun will always belong to the Young Master.

212
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,120
Young Master.

213
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,450
Ah, Young Master!

214
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,700
Young Master!
