1
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,370
This is freedom

2
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,200
Zeng Yuando.

3
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,039
You're awake.

4
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,870
Look at this.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,330
It's all your favorite.

6
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,660
These are all for me.

7
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,910
All for me?

8
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,000
Candied haws!

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,860
Snow pastries.

10
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,160
Take it.

11
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,620
You are really my good brother.

12
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,199
So cheesy. Take it.

13
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,200
Stop talking about my vegetables.

14
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,830
Let's go eat together.

15
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,620
Yuan Kai, you're awake.

16
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,370
Let me see.

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,750
It's okay.

18
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,330
Keep calm.

19
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,370
Yan Ran.

20
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,910
I was wrong.

21
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,450
You're wrong.

22
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,910
Since we are husband and wife,

23
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,410
we'll be together forever.

24
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,620
No matter what happens,

25
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,530
no matter what happens.

26
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,450
So you shouldn't push me away

27
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
like last night.

28
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,750
Yan Ran.

29
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,910
I love you.

30
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,750
The secret base has been destroyed.

31
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,040
How will you

32
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,250
to your father?

33
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,790
He is my father after all.

34
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,540
I hope he can stop.

35
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,040
Stop being stubborn.

36
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:39,710
Young Master.

37
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,350
There is something new about Commander Huang.

38
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,290
Madam.

39
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,450
I have something to deal with.

40
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,370
Okay. Okay.

41
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,700
Let's go.

42
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:40,580
Madam.

43
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,590
I need to take care of something.

44
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,330
Come in

45
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,060
Young Mistress

46
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,950
You

47
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,159
I know more about your sister.

48
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,500
What?

49
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,610
Zeng Shaozong.

50
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,870
You're awake, Jiang Yinyue.

51
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,620
You are much cuter than your sister.

52
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,950
You beast!

53
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,810
How dare you mention my sister?

54
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,240
Where are you taking me?

55
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:36,540
What's the rush?

56
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,120
When we get there,

57
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,409
when we get there.

58
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,510
Something happened to Young Master.

59
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,370
Young Mistress was taken away by Master

60
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,000
Where did she go?

61
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They're following us.

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,530
Let’s go.

63
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,740
Commander.

64
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,000
She's Kang Doo's daughter.

65
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,910
As long as she's here,

66
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,410
no matter where we go, we will rise again.

67
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,450
I hope so.

68
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,520
How do you know my father?

69
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,080
That stubborn Kang Do.

70
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,500
No matter how much I offer,

71
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,000
to buy him the formula of Fortune-Longevity Powder.

72
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,260
He didn't sell it to me.

73
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,450
So I...

74
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,790
So you were the one who hunted us down?

75
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,200
Do you know

76
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,800
why my father doesn't want to sell the formula?

77
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,450
Although it relieves pain,

78
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,500
but it's harmful to the human body.

79
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,409
My father doesn't want to harm others or himself.

80
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,740
so he wanted to destroy the prescription.

81
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:49,770
Zeng Shaozong,

82
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,180
You're so vicious.

83
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,860
Aren't you afraid of karma?

84
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,950
The Ghost Doctor

85
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,080
are just medics.

86
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,909
Do you really think you're a saint?

87
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:58,250
You...

88
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,200
Take him away.

89
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,410
My father is known as Ghost Doctor.

90
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,620
He saved countless lives.

91
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,580
Unlike you.

92
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,910
You killed so many people.

93
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,710
You're doomed to die miserably.

94
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,660
Let go of me!

95
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,450
I can't eat anymore.

96
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,080
Here.

97
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,120
Isn't this what you want?

98
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,980
You bought it but you don't eat it.

99
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,040
Why are you so naggy?

100
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,620
It’s worse than my toy.

101
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,250
Captain, bad news!

102
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,500
There will be news from everyone.

103
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,100
Young Madam Zeng is missing.

104
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,750
What?

105
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,450
Yuan Kai

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,500
Master

107
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,659
Yuan Kai

108
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,260
Don't move

109
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,260
Don't come over.

110
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,160
Father and Commander are leaving Yongcheng.

111
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,420
You can go by yourself.

112
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,600
What are you doing?

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,410
I told you not to come near me.

114
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,450
Or I'll kill her.

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,580
Father.

116
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,320
You killed my mother.

117
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,620
and Jiang Shuwan.

118
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,790
and so many innocent people.

119
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,580
Now you want to hurt Yan Ran?

120
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,750
What do you know?

121
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,700
They all died for my great cause.

122
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,160
They deserve to die.

123
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,980
Zeng Shaozong!

124
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,000
You deserve to be my wife. You deserve to be my wife.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,910
and a father.

126
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,040
Shut up!

127
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,020
Don't hurt her.

128
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,450
You're just like your mother.

129
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,790
You're a love lover.

130
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,370
Father.

131
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,370
Don't call me father.

132
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,500
I'm not your father.

133
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,000
You're...

134
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,250
Gu Manqing and that man.

135
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,200
You're not my biological child.

136
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,290
If I had known this,

137
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,630
I should have strangled you to death when you were young.

138
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,130
What did you say?

139
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,620
If you were my son,

140
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,830
would I allow you to marry an orphan who has no power?

141
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,120
Let her go.

142
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,160
Look! Let her go!

143
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,200
Let her go.

144
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,540
Hide in the back.

145
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,060
I told you not to come out!

146
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,040
But you...

147
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,910
Don't worry. Go now.

148
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,370
Nice to meet you.

149
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,950
Mr. Gu.

150
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,430
Nice to meet you.

151
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,290
Leader of Fuze Sect.

152
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,950
Second Master.

153
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,660
Let’s settle

154
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,330
for his revenge today?

155
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,360
Don't move.

156
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,580
Hands up.

157
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,660
Hands up!

158
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,790
Doctor Als.

159
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,500
You...

160
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,820
I should've run away.

161
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,200
Doctor Als!

162
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,830
Please spare Master.

163
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,450
Zeng Shaozong and Commander Huang

164
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,710
The scheming great cause will be ruined.

165
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,910
The obsession of my life is empty.

166
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,330
And Yongcheng finally

167
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,750
my light.

168
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,620
Yuan Tuo!

169
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:16,790
One.

170
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,620
How is it?

171
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,290
It's crooked.

172
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,380
It's crooked?

173
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,750
Why don't you do it yourself?

174
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,200
You're the most free one among all.

175
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,830
Hey.

176
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,850
I don't care. I'll eat first.

177
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,330
Hurry up.

178
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,470
Come on. Come on.

179
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,080
Slowly.

180
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,580
They...

181
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,790
Forget about them. Let's eat first.

182
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,290
Coming.

183
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,500
We're here.

184
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,200
Hurry up.

185
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,790
Don't waste time.

186
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,450
You're so greedy.

187
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:41,950
Come on.

188
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,620
Come on.

189
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,120
Come on.

190
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,040
Well, I...

191
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,370
Stop drinking.

192
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,620
You just recovered.

193
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,950
Come on, let's drink.

194
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,540
Cheers.

195
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,450
