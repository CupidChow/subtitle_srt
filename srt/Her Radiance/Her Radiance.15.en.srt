1
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,750
She's gone out. She's gone out. She's gone out.

2
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,280
Young Master, Young Madam.

3
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,550
What should we do next?

4
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,100
We should go find a doctor for Her Ladyship.

5
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,789
After all, this allergy

6
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,910
can't be cured by ordinary doctors.

7
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,330
Keep an eye on him.

8
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,830
Report to me at any time.

9
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,009
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

10
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,620
You

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,789
Yan Ran and Yuan Kai have been married for so long.

12
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,870
for so long.

13
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,560
I don't think she's a good nourisher.

14
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,370
This is your chance.

15
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,960
But Young Master...

16
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,370
Ever since then, you've never been

17
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,040
You're still young.

18
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:33,240
You have to create opportunities for yourself.

19
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:36,910
This is the Joy Powder Yan used last time.

20
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,329
Take it.

21
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Thank you, Mother

22
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,760
Find a chance to play it for Yuan Kai

23
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,250
Young Master

24
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,000
I miss you so much.

25
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,700
Hello. Hello.

26
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,200
Really?

27
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,950
Master

28
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,330
Sorry.

29
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,320
I didn't know you were here.

30
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,080
My brother's new concubine.

31
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,910
I thought it was you.

32
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,750
I didn't expect it was you.

33
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,680
You're the one who bullied Yan Ran.

34
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,700
No, no, no.

35
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,329
No.

36
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:19,829
Stop it!

37
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,760
Yuan Tuo! Let go!

38
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,450
Yuan Tuo!

39
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,890
Yuan Tuo! Yuan Tuo!

40
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,829
She hugged me.

41
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,790
It's dirty.

42
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,530
It's a mess. It's a mess.

43
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,290
Okay. Okay. Okay.

44
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,450
Is she okay?

45
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,040
She woke up in an hour.

46
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,130
Why are you here?

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,040
I'm bored.

48
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,180
I came out to play with someone.

49
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,620
I didn't expect this girl to be so naughty.

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,570
Yuan Tuo, this is not a game.

51
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,120
It's a life.

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
All right.

53
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,870
She has been punished.

54
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,610
Let's talk somewhere else.

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,380
She'll leave on her own when she wakes up.

56
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,030
Let's go.

57
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,750
So it was your plan

58
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,540
was your plan.

59
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,830
Zeng Yuantuo,

60
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,410
You're not that stupid.

61
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,910
But Her Ladyship has gone too far

62
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,120
has gone too far.

63
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,540
We need to be more careful.

64
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,000
What are you going to do next?

65
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,450
Next,

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,170
It depends on Huo Sang’s performance.

67
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,409
Hoissan.

68
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,330
Als.

69
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,000
"Look, look, look, look, look, look, look." "Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look."

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,330
We're still friends.

71
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,450
It can't be cured.

72
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,330
you'll pay for it.

73
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,580
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look

74
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,750
The symptoms you described

75
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,080
It's a song. It's a song.

76
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,370
Who is he?

77
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,620
How could you bring a man to my room?

78
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,290
Mother, I hired a western doctor.

79
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,700
I don't care.

80
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,620
Get lost!

81
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,159
Don't worry. Let's go. Let's go.

82
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,659
Madam,

83
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,000
has a very common disease in England.

84
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,590
Use the medicine and ointment I brought.

85
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,120
It will heal soon.

86
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,450
You've been treated?

87
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
Of course, Madam.

88
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,620
Mother.

89
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,290
Al has been abroad for many years.

90
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,580
and now he is a professor at Xijing University.

91
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,040
I asked that reporter friend

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,660
to invite this reporter.

93
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,040
Try it.

94
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,450
Okay.

95
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,910
Let him try.

96
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,909
Pull her clothes away.

97
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,350
What are you waiting for? Go.

98
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,290
It's so long.

99
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,830
Two times a day.

100
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,290
After breakfast and dinner,

101
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,410
for seven days in a row.

102
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,740
It will heal naturally.

103
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,250
Als!

104
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,560
Please wait.

105
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,870
Our master wants to invite you over.

106
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,250
He is not feeling well.

107
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,980
He wants you to check on him.

108
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,160
This way, please.

109
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,330
Master, Dr. Als is here.

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,500
Dr. Als.

111
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,790
This is Mr Zeng.

112
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,580
Hello, Mr Zeng.

113
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,500
Dr. Als.

114
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,620
I'm sorry to ask you to come.

115
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,620
to ask you something.

116
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,450
The foreign doctor left.

117
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,530
Yuan Ying! Yuan Ying!

118
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,300
Won Young!

119
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,750
What's wrong?

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,080
Say something!

121
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,290
The baby in your womb...

122
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,830
Mr. Zeng.

123
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,660
I wonder why you want to see me.

124
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,450
I have some

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,620
some hidden disease.

126
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,790
Ah...

127
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,660
To be honest,

128
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,870
I am one of the best people in Yongcheng.

129
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,450
It’s not easy to tell others.

130
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,330
You are from the Western.

131
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,830
Do you have any new treatment?

132
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,160
Mr. Zeng,

133
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,250
Our Western treatment technology

134
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,160
is not like the acupuncture pulse of Chinese medicine.

135
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,830
It needs a blood test.

136
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,970
Draw your blood.

137
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,660
Okay. Okay. Okay.

138
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,580
No problem.

139
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,370
Mr. Zeng, what a coincidence.

140
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,660
I have an appointment with another patient today.

141
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,790
I'll get going.

142
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,560
Please wait, Doctor Als.

143
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,830
How much do you need?

144
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,040
Zeng will do anything.

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,750
Dr. Als, please.

146
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,590
Don't worry, Mr. Zeng.

147
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,870
Leave the investigation to me.

148
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,930
Let's make an appointment for a test.

149
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,540
What do you mean?

150
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,500
The baby in your womb

151
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,410
is Yang Fan's.

152
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,070
What are you talking about?

153
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,430
I don't understand what you're talking about.

154
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,610
It really belongs to Yang Fan.

155
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,180
If he didn't know you were sick,

156
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,160
he came to Zeng family and got hit by me,

157
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,360
How long are you going to keep it from me?

158
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,040
But Mother,

159
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,870
Why are you doing this?

160
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,450
I know dad is not a good husband.

161
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,000
You can't get pregnant with your lover's child.
