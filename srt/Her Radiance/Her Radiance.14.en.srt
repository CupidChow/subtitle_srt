1
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,150
If Chen Shulin wants to discard me as her pawn,

2
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,900
she'll choose a new one to take my place.

3
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,539
Xingchun.

4
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:54,830
Yes.

5
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,700
Xingchun is her best option.

6
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,870
Someone raised by her side since childhood is most useful.

7
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,450
And since her plans have repeatedly failed,

8
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,390
placing Xingchun close to us

9
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,400
makes it easier for her to strike.

10
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,610
So you want me to go along with this and marry her?

11
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,760
This is my homemade hallucinogen.

12
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,000
This is the antidote.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,329
Colorless and tasteless.

14
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:18,060
Take the antidote beforehand.

15
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,370
As for this one,

16
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,760
just sprinkle it on the candles during your wedding night.

17
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,790
Chen Shulin is naturally suspicious

18
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,450
and difficult to get close to.

19
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,310
To confirm whether she's the one we're looking for,

20
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,470
I'm afraid I have to trouble you with this task.

21
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,790
For the sake of finding out the truth,

22
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,590
you've given up on your husband.

23
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,950
Isn't it livelier to have one more person taking care of you?

24
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,870
Am I really that unimportant to you?

25
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,000
Will you cooperate or not?

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,260
You still haven't answered my question.

27
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,340
We have a working relationship.

28
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,470
What are you doing?

29
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:37,460
Zeng Yuankai has found another woman.

30
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,360
He doesn't understand you at all.

31
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,620
He doesn't deserve you.

32
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,410
You're just a child. You don't understand

33
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,470
the price one must pay for growing up.

34
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,450
You.

35
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,810
What don't I understand?

36
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,130
I was the one who liked you first.

37
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,000
You should be with me.

38
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,750
It's not even a full moon today.

39
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,150
Why are you acting crazy?

40
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,080
Didn't I already give you the sachet?

41
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,870
Go back now.

42
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,620
I'm not having an episode.

43
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,050
I'm almost recovered.

44
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,900
This means the poison isn't fully cleared.

45
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,760
I am your sister-in-law now.

46
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,320
Your brother taking a concubine was a necessary measure.

47
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,030
You've misunderstood him.

48
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,750
Then why aren't you happy?

49
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,680
Sister-in-law.

50
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,909
Let me ask you a question then.

51
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,909
Who do you think

52
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,409
is more handsome, me or my brother?

53
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,750
What kind of question is that?

54
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,880
Who's more handsome, me or my brother?

55
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,870
What do you think?

56
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,620
You are. You are.

57
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,490
There are many things

58
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,950
Yuantuo will understand when he grows up.

59
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't mind him.

60
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,990
Yuantuo seems arrogant on the surface,

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,330
but he's actually quite naive and innocent.

62
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,000
You, on the other hand,

63
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,280
are the one who keeps things hidden, aren't you?

64
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,480
Have you consummated your marriage, young master?

65
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,620
Take a guess.

66
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,510
How would I know?

67
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,000
But you look really tired tonight.

68
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,230
You should go home and rest early.

69
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,620
You...

70
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,370
Yan Ran.

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,380
Don't you feel guilty?

72
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,330
What should I feel guilty about?

73
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,250
You're just pushing me toward another woman.

74
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,110
Don't you feel guilty about that?

75
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,330
Wasn't that our agreed plan?

76
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,480
How is that me pushing you to another woman?

77
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,660
No.

78
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,870
We have a contract marriage.

79
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,420
What should I feel guilty about?

80
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,250
Yan Ran.

81
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,670
I won't let anyone take you away.

82
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,330
Not even Yuan Tuo.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,200
You asked me last time

84
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,330
why I hid my identity.

85
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,080
I admit

86
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,750
I was a coward.

87
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,730
Because I was afraid of losing you

88
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,750
and even more afraid that if you knew,

89
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,480
you would be in greater danger.

90
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,500
Do you think I'm a coward?

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,860
Do you think I'm not willing to face things with you?

92
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,610
It's all about what you think.

93
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,120
Have you ever asked me?

94
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,370
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,880
It won't happen again.

96
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,660
This pocket watch was left to me by my mother.

97
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,460
She often stared at it and cried when she was alive.

98
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,070
Before she died, she told me

99
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,280
it contains a memento of someone very important

100
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,160
and would keep me safe.

101
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,330
Now I'm giving this protection to you.

102
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,750
Yan Ran,

103
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,220
do you understand my feelings now?

104
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,620
I...

105
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,660
I've had a bit too much to drink.

106
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,000
Let me think about it.

107
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,370
All right.

108
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,040
It's time.

109
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,000
Ah.

110
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,960
For the wedding night?

111
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,240
I pay my respects to the young mistress.

112
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,740
I pay my respects to the young mistress.

113
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,750
Oh, you!

114
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,750
Why are you so careless?

115
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,490
Go see a doctor quickly.

116
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,120
Young master, look at her.

117
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,410
I was careless just now.

118
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,880
Please don't take it to heart, sister.

119
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,950
Besides,

120
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,160
isn't water a symbol of wealth?

121
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,410
I know you don't like me, sister.

122
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,910
But since I've already joined the family,

123
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,640
please be more accommodating.

124
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,080
Don't always put the young master in a difficult position.

125
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,140
Indeed worthy of mother's teaching.

126
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,410
Xingchun is still the most sensible.

127
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,160
Xingchun,

128
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,540
don't bother with this tactless girl.

129
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:19,970
By the way,

130
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,580
have you prepared a gift for mother?

131
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,160
What should I prepare?

132
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,550
Mother loves it most when people give her clothes.

133
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,200
Madam, I pay my respects to you.

134
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,580
You may rise.

135
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,160
You look very beautiful today.

136
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,330
You've managed to establish yourself quite well now.

137
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,260
How are things going with Yuankai?

138
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,700
Have you both...?

139
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,750
Just as I thought.

140
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,910
His interest in Yanran's maid was merely a passing fancy.

141
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,910
All men are the same.

142
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,250
His father was like that,

143
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,330
and so is he.

144
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,910
You've done well.

145
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,040
Rest assured.

146
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,000
Sooner or later,

147
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,440
I will help you become the rightful young mistress.

148
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,410
Thank you,

149
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,540
Madam.

150
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,750
I bought you a shawl.

151
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,670
That's thoughtful of you. It looks nice, please accept it.

152
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,540
Why haven't we heard anything yet?

153
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,830
You need to be patient.

154
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,410
What if she didn't wear it?

155
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,400
She would have.

156
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,180
What if your medicine didn't work?

157
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,580
How could my medicine possibly fail?

158
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,910
You're that confident?

159
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,160
Of course.

160
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,500
It works every time.

161
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,950
Based on her pulse,

162
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,660
the madam is not seriously ill.

163
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,950
As for the cause of her illness,

164
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,950
forgive my limited medical skills,

165
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,610
I really cannot determine it.

166
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:08,950
Perhaps

167
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,950
we could examine the clothes the madam wore yesterday

168
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,860
to see if we can find any clues.

169
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,870
I'll go right away.

170
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,370
Doctor, please follow me.

171
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:32,910
Mom.

172
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,500
Mom.

173
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,000
I heard you're sick.

174
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Let me take a look.

175
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,300
Stop looking.

176
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,200
Both my arms are red and itchy.

177
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,950
That doctor wasn't good enough.

178
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,210
I'll find another one.

179
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,290
Stop right there.

180
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,250
But we need to find out what's causing this.

181
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,710
Do you really want everyone to know about this embarrassment?

182
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,160
What do you mean?

183
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,950
I, Chen Shulin, was born into nobility.

184
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,370
Now I'm sick and look terrible.

185
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,290
How can I let strangers see me like this?
