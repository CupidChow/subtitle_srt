1
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,710
What are you thinking?

2
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,660
Yuan Kai

3
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,900
How is your relationship with your father?

4
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,970
After my mother passed away,

5
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,250
my father blamed Yuan Tuo's birth for killing my mother.

6
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,900
So he never cared about him.

7
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,980
but he has always tolerated me.

8
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,750
Even if the rumor that I was unbearable,

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,329
he seldom punished me.

10
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,200
Why did you ask me that?

11
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,250
Nothing

12
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:32,200
I just saw my father in the hall today.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,930
Maybe he's worried about Yuan Tuo.

14
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,180
There's been many changes in the mansion lately.

15
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,579
You should spend more time with him.

16
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,540
Don't worry. We haven't found out the truth yet.

17
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,910
Don't let Yuan Kai know

18
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,010
so that he won't be troubled.

19
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,910
Mr. Gu.

20
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,760
Qi Yu followed him here and went missing.

21
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,470
There are traces of fighting here.

22
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,810
Did something happen to Qi Yu too?

23
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,840
Someone is here.

24
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,250
Over here! Over here!

25
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:38,829
Huo Sang.

26
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:40,620
Mr. Gu.

27
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,120
What are you doing here?

28
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,410
You know me?

29
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,620
Mr. Gu is famous.

30
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,630
Everyone in Yongcheng knows that.

31
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,910
But why are you here?

32
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,500
Is the disappearance of those beggars

33
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,890
are related to you?

34
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,960
I'm afraid there's some misunderstanding.

35
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,290
Zeng Yuan Kai

36
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,700
Huo Sang.

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
We’re here to find the missing guy.

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,000
Wait.

39
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,390
Someone is coming.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,910
Everyone here knows who you are.

41
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,620
Why are you wearing a mask?

42
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,000
Mr. Gu's face

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,329
let others see his face.

44
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,660
Who cares?

45
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,250
I don't even want to see the money.

46
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,120
Be quiet. The car is here.

47
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,120
He's alive.

48
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,870
Murder!

49
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,660
Murder!

50
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,880
Someone's dead!

51
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,650
Let me go!

52
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,450
Let me go!

53
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,500
Let me go!

54
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,370
Calm down.

55
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,290
Let me go!

56
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,130
His illness is similar to Yuan Tuo.

57
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,290
That's right.

58
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,620
There are many kinds of drug collision in his body.

59
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,350
Just like Yuan Tuo's symptoms.

60
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,810
I've already used acupuncture to stop him.

61
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,670
How did you get caught?

62
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,080
How did you get poisoned?

63
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,410
Is there anyone

64
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,200
is there anyone tall

65
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,250
and handsome?

66
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,720
I’m talking to you.

67
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,950
Huo Sang.

68
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,160
Ask him when he wakes up.

69
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,810
So many poisoned people.

70
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,350
so many poisoned people?

71
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,050
Could it be...

72
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,310
Someone's using the medicine. Someone's using it. Someone's here. Someone's here.

73
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,659
Send more men

74
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,370
to patrol the city.

75
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,000
Anyone who reported missing,

76
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,250
must be strictly questioned.

77
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,659
If you find anyone suspicious,

78
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,950
take him back to the police station.

79
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,010
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

80
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,290
The poison he was poisoned

81
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,290
is the same as Yuan Tuo and my mother.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,409
Yuan Tuo, my mother and your sister's death

83
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,070
may not be done by Chen Shu Lin.

84
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:08,950
Yuan Kai

85
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,740
Maybe we were wrong from the beginning.

86
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,860
The murderer is someone else.

87
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,290
I saved a medicine man in Jishi Clinic.

88
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,100
Later, including the method

89
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,290
and this little beggar

90
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,000
are the acupuncture therapy my father used when he saved me.

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,790
Your father?

92
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,080
Jiang Hu Dao.

93
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,620
Yue'er.

94
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,120
Father.

95
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,540
What did I buy for you?

96
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,620
Do you like it?

97
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,250
Yes.

98
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,290
Is Yue good at home?

99
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,790
Yes, it's great.

100
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,700
Yue, what are you eating?

101
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,870
Father is so bad.

102
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,950
You don't even let me eat so many beautiful candy.

103
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,330
There's no sugar at home, Yue'er.

104
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,750
That's not candy.

105
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,330
Yue, spit it out.

106
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,790
How dare you eat anything?

107
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,250
Yue, why are you eating everything?

108
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,290
You can't eat that.

109
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,410
Yue.

110
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,450
Spit it out!

111
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,450
Oh my god, Yue.

112
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,540
How many poisons did you take?

113
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,250
What should I tell your mother

114
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,650
when your mother and your sister come back?

115
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,870
Dad, I feel bad.

116
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,200
This detoxifying pill

117
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,660
I have only one pill in all these years.

118
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,620
You are so lucky.

119
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,410
Come, Yue.

120
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,830
Eat it.

121
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,610
How do you feel?

122
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,580
It hurts.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,620
Father.

124
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,660
Is there any poison that can't poison me?

125
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,500
My Yue is the smartest.

126
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,660
But don't eat anything else.

127
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,620
Got it?

128
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,620
Dad, I'm hungry.

129
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,000
I want meat buns and roasted hares.

130
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,830
I really owe you in my previous life.

131
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,540
You almost ate me.

132
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,330
Father.

133
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,660
When will sister and mother come back?

134
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,330
You'd better not come back for now.

135
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,000
Otherwise, seeing you make such a big trouble,

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,620
I'll be punished with you.

137
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,230
Okay, I'll get you some meat buns.

138
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,370
I didn't expect my father-in-law

139
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,120
is the famous Doctor Jiang.

140
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
According to you,

141
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,340
the medicine my father-in-law made has fallen into Fuze Gang’s hands.

142
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,450
Fuze Gang?

143
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,310
Young Madam.

144
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,330
Young Master has been investigating the medicine man for over a year.

145
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,160
It seems that Fuze Gang

146
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,830
with this medicine man.

147
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,500
It's just that the mastermind is hiding too deeply.

148
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,660
I still have no idea.

149
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,150
I don't know what my father has to do with this.

150
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,580
Since then,

151
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,370
my parents took me and my sister back to our hometown to worship our ancestors.

152
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,830
We met bandits on the way.

153
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,450
My parents died in the hands of bandits.

154
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,080
Only my sister took me out.

155
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,950
As long as the murderer is still alive,

156
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,350
you'll be in more danger.

157
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,950
Stay at home these days.

158
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,350
Don't go anywhere. Okay.

159
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,330
Then you...

160
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,910
I'll check the abandoned bodies

161
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,550
to see if there are any other clues.

162
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,040
Now Yuan Tuo is missing.

163
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,970
I must find him as soon as possible.

164
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,320
Be careful.

165
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,120
You too.

166
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,120
Qi Huan, get the car ready.

167
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,580
Yes.

168
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,540
Looks like I have to go and meet Mr Zeng.
