1
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,120
These are all the materials I've collected

2
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,330
from both domestic and foreign sources

3
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,120
about cases very similar to the second young master Zeng's condition

4
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,380
including reports and pulse diagnoses.

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,910
Thank you.

6
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,660
It must be difficult for you to get out these days.

7
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,080
How are the Zengs treating you?

8
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,960
Especially Zeng Yuankai.

9
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:57,200
Has he...?

10
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,580
Has he what?

11
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,620
Zeng Yuankai...

12
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,290
I can't figure him out yet.

13
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,790
But he treats me well.

14
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,600
Don't worry.

15
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,789
That's good.

16
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,410
You should head back now.

17
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,540
Send me a message if anything happens.

18
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,040
Stop!

19
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,160
Stop!

20
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,579
Stop!

21
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,040
Where is she?

22
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,870
I heard she went to the Metropolitan to deliver vegetables to the master.

23
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,790
Is this information accurate?

24
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,450
Yes, it is.

25
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,200
People from multiple places are asking about the young mistress.

26
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,060
They must be planning to harm her.

27
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,310
Young master, we couldn't find the young mistress.

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,000
Where is the young mistress?

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,160
Didn't she come to the Metropolitan?

30
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,080
The young mistress left

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,040
the Metropolitan 15 minutes ago.

32
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,790
Notify Qi Yu

33
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,579
and take the men from Lumen to find her.

34
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,110
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,660
I'll find Captain Huosang.

36
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,460
Zeng Yuankai.

37
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,920
Who kidnapped Yan Ran?

38
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,410
They said only you can go.

39
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,660
Follow behind me

40
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,430
and stay hidden.

41
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,950
Why don't you take more people with you?

42
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,290
More people would be more dangerous.

43
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:49,820
Let's go.

44
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,290
Wow.

45
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,950
Smells so good.

46
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,620
What a pretty little face.

47
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,330
Do you know why we kidnapped you?

48
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,150
Let me tell you the truth.

49
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,000
Someone paid us to kidnap you.

50
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,910
It's to lure Young Master Zeng into our trap.

51
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,540
I heard Young Master Zeng is quite the playboy.

52
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,830
He probably won't risk his life

53
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,230
for just one woman like you.

54
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,700
Who?

55
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,909
Who hired you?

56
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,500
How much did they pay you?

57
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,830
I can pay you double.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,460
How did you get kidnapped?

59
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,760
Always the same lines.

60
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:49,330
Your Young Master Zeng won't come to save you.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,159
Why not

62
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,120
join us brothers instead?

63
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,580
Do you agree, brothers?

64
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,830
Yeah!

65
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,450
How much allowance does Young Master Zeng give you?

66
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,120
I'll have our brothers chip in

67
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,180
to give you double. What do you say?

68
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:34,950
Back off!

69
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,290
Yan Ran.

70
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,660
I'm late.

71
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,830
Zeng Yuankai.

72
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,450
Zeng Yuankai.

73
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,370
Everyone down! Don't move!

74
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,580
Doctor.

75
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,660
How is

76
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,700
he doing?

77
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
The wound has been stitched.

78
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,950
He's lost a lot of blood

79
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,410
and is still unconscious.

80
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,150
Fortunately, the bullet was removed in time.

81
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,160
His body is quite strong.

82
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,120
Let him rest well.

83
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,390
Thank you, doctor.

84
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,160
Thank you.

85
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:51,910
Thank you.

86
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,380
Zeng Yuankai.

87
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,220
What's wrong, Zeng Yuankai?

88
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,790
How are you feeling?

89
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,750
Wake up.

90
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,620
Let go. Stop.

91
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't.

92
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,410
You...

93
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,370
Your wound is bleeding heavily.

94
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,130
It might split open.

95
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,370
I'm a doctor.

96
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Trust me.

97
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,080
Yan Ran.

98
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,370
You're awake.

99
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,500
Do you feel

100
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,080
uncomfortable anywhere?

101
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,580
I'll get a doctor for you.

102
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,140
Take it slow.

103
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,750
How do you feel?

104
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,080
Yan Ran.

105
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,040
Are you

106
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,710
still in pain?

107
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,500
How are you? Should I call a doctor?

108
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,580
Not as painful as when you poked me last time.

109
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,750
You...

110
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,750
Eyes are fragile.

111
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,910
Be gentle.

112
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Eyes are fragile.

113
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,910
Be careful.

114
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,200
The doctor says you've lost too much blood

115
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,180
and need to rest.

116
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,200
You should get some good rest first.

117
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll make you some ginseng soup.

118
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,090
Zeng Yuankai.

119
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,750
Zeng Yuankai.

120
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,160
Don't think you can fight evil spirits alone.

121
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,080
Be careful with your life.

122
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,000
Please, Master Gu, help me bury someone.

123
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,700
Alright.

124
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,540
I heard he's ruthless.

125
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,520
Aren't you afraid of him?

126
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,550
Are you looking for me?

127
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,290
There's a full moon tonight.

128
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,540
Why did you come out?

129
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,450
I came to see you.

130
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,160
You're so badly hurt.

131
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,770
Why did you come to see me?

132
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,880
Go back quickly.

133
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,880
Look how much you're suffering.

134
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,790
Won't you let me check on you?
