her talent is going to be wasted.

Once I get my deposit back...

367
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,260
Geez, I'm so pissed!

368
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,170
If only we knew, we would've stormed

369
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,910
into his wedding and did something.

370
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,240
We could've blocked his wedding car

371
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,600
so he couldn't go on his honeymoon. Right?

372
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,040
Sounds like her parents found out a while ago.

373
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,550
Must've been a huge shock.

374
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,660
For Hyeon Ju, too.

375
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,330
Listen to him. Of course.

376
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,950
Gosh, the whole family must've been down.

377
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,990
That's why she wants to go back to work sooner.

378
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,670
So she can go back to Seoul soon.

379
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,340
Probably.

380
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,860
Bong Seon Uk, you better repent.

381
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,680
W-Why are you picking on me?

382
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,020
You had no idea yet

383
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,230
you nagged her to quit
drinking and get it together.

384
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,140
You were the worst. Don't you feel bad at all?

385
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,320
Of course, I do.

386
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,100
I feel really bad.

387
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,740
Young Woong, watch Hwa Yeong later.

388
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,450
I need to go see a fortuneteller.

389
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,680
Fortuneteller?
Yeah, there's a fortuneteller

390
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,070
in Bochun, who's famous for being spot on.

391
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,890
People are swarming to see her.

392
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,070
I barely got an appointment.

393
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,670
I want to ask her

394
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,800
when my brother will get married.

395
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,100
Noona, can I go see the fortuneteller?

396
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,200
What? Why? You want to ask her directly?

397
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,340
Yes, I feel bad for Geum Ju.

398
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,610
I can't believe what happened.

399
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,250
If she says Geum Ju has bad luck,
I'll get her a talisman

400
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,140
and even host a ritual for her.

401
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,660
True.

402
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,940
Poor Geum Ju.

403
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,140
Fine, I'll text you the place and time.

404
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,190
But you better ask when
you're getting married, got it?

405
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,830
Got it.

406
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,010
Make sure you ask her.

407
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,370
Got it.

408
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,210
I'm leaving.

409
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,420
Hey.
Huh?

410
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,000
You'll really go to a fortuneteller?

411
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,400
You believe in that stuff?

412
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,750
Why? Seon Hwa said she's spot on.

413
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,980
Let's go.

414
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,180
No way.

415
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,060
So, if she says something bad,

416
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,490
and you get her a talisman and a ritual...

417
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,470
Yeah, Geum Ju will just love that.

418
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,360
Geum Ju.

419
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,970
Yes?

420
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,020
Why are you packing already?

421
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,500
It's not like you're leaving tomorrow.

422
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,820
I just want to be prepared.

423
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,390
Geum Ju.
Yes?

424
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,200
Make sure you pack this, too.

425
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,830
What's this?

426
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,600
[Deposit/Withdrawal Record]

427
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,160
[Deposit: 300,000 won]

428
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,830
It's the spending money you sent us.

429
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,050
We saved all of it.

430
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,100
Except for the 300,000 won

431
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,390
your dad secretly used to pay off a bar tab.

432
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,480
I got caught and got scolded badly.

433
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,290
So, I saved up my allowance
and paid it back in full.

434
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,740
You didn't have to do this.

435
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,170
I told you to spend it when you need it.

436
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,480
Why did you save it all up?

437
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,940
Don't worry about it.

438
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,710
Use it toward your new place.

439
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,440
Make sure it's close to work. Somewhere downtown.

440
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,420
Mom...

441
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,280
Dad...

442
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,260
Take this, too.

443
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,180
I've barely used it.

444
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,150
You work at a big company.
You should carry a big-name purse.

445
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,730
You always carry cheap ones.

446
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,920
But this is your favorite..

447
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,730
When things get tough,

448
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,650
put down your ego and tell us everything.

449
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:34,370
Yes, lean on us when you're struggling.

450
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,000
Totally agree.

451
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,060
What's with you guys today?

452
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,090
It's not like I'm leaving forever.

453
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,790
You're making me emotional.

454
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,210
Thank you, everyone.

455
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,490
My daughter...

456
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,290
My baby daughter. Fighting.
Geum Ju!

457
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,310
Han Geum Ju!

458
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,900
Huh? Hey, what are you guys doing here?

459
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,210
We thought we could

460
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,250
have a BBQ party before Geum Ju heads to Seoul.

461
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,530
You went to a fortuneteller about my fortune?

462
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,700
Don't freak out.

463
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,600
You paid your dues, and it's
all good luck from here.

464
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,270
You're about to enter a lucky streak.
You'll win big time.

465
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,390
Really?

466
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,180
Yes, that's what she said.

467
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,640
I don't believe in fortunetelling
and tried to stop them,

468
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,150
but they insisted on going.

469
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,650
I'm glad we didn't listen to you.

470
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,510
We almost missed out on
hearing all that good stuff.

471
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,380
Right? She even refused to take our money.

472
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,000
Right? But she said once you make it big,

473
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,280
you'd better pay her back in multiples.
Gosh, seriously...

474
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,860
Really?

475
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,830
Come on, don't believe in that stuff.

476
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,670
Yes, ma'am.

477
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,100
Pardon?

478
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,790
Really?

479
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,220
Okay. Thank you.

480
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,290
Yes.

481
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,750
I'm so relieved.

482
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,050
What was that?

483
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,360
It was my realtor. They found a tenant.

484
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,690
Gosh, I'll finally get my deposit back.

485
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,200
All of a sudden, after all this time?

486
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,620
See?
The fortuneteller was right.

487
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,610
Your luck's turning around!

488
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,310
Thanks for checking my fortune,

489
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,770
but don't overhype lucky timing.

490
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,090
Come on. Timing is divine power at work.

491
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,850
Of course. There's a reason why she's famous.

492
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,310
Gosh, hallelujah!

493
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,450
I thought you went to church.

494
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,790
If it means my baby's doing well,
I'm sure God will understand.

495
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,410
Isn't that right? No?

496
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,860
You're right.

497
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,580
Amen!
Hallelujah!

498
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,560
Gosh...

499
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,850
My charger…

500
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,580
What's this?

501
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,750
How are Woo Ri and Na Rah doing?

502
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,380
Thank you, Yeong Jun's mom.

503
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,040
Yes, I'll pick them up later.

504
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,730
Okay.

505
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,090
I-I'm sorry, Noona.

506
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,860
With everything going on with your family,
you must have a lot on your mind.

507
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,160
I called and talked your ear off
about what I wanted to say.

508
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,620
No...

509
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,380
Let's talk about us later.

510
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,280
What? Really? Then, we will talk later, right?

511
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,570
So, you didn't plan on never
seeing me again, did you?

512
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,700
Didn't you come here today because of Geum Ju?

513
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,560
Yes, of course.

514
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,730
Ui Jun did most of the work,

515
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,160
but I will try my best.

516
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,030
So that Geum Ju can go back
to Seoul in high spirits.

Wow, you look like you're having so much fun!

Good job. That was a feat. Drink this.

534
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,800
Wait. Coke won't do, right?

535
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,620
Gosh, I'm feeling generous today.

536
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,860

The liquor ban has been lifted!

538

What do you think, Ui Jun?

539
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,000
It's okay to have just one drink
on days like this, right?

540
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,700
But still...
No.

541
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,400
Regardless of what day it is,
I'm going to stay sober.

542
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,840
You said I'm entering a lucky streak.

543
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,440
I'm so happy without any booze.

544
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,240
Why would I need to drink?

545
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,610
Whoa.
