Right.

These are withdrawal symptoms.

These are typical symptoms

141
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,383
It can vary from person to person,

142

it can lead to hallucinations.

143
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,533

00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,693

00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:44,453
I think you're feverish, too.

No, I'm okay.

What else? What other symptoms might arise?

157
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:53,783
Other withdrawal symptoms are...

158
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:55,563
physical responses such as

159
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:59,803
chills, fever, and excessive sweating.

160

I knew it.

161
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:04,103
My body agrees completely.

162
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:07,783
Depending on the severity,
medication can be prescribed.

163
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:10,233
But the best remedy

164
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,683
is time.

165
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:15,623
Both the withdrawal symptoms
and the cravings

166
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:19,293
will pass if you patiently endure them.

167
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:21,123
Right.

168
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:23,523
I should've been patient.

169
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,023

Nope.

181
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:19,133
Then, why are you acting like this?

182

00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:39,563
Seriously...

189
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:41,763
Get yourself together, you crazy nut.

190
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:43,383
I said she's your sister's friend!

191
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:45,933
I told you you're married to a friend's sister.

192
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:47,233
There you go again.

193
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,933
Didn't you hear what your sister said?
To treat her like your own sister.

194
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:51,893
How dare you have a crush on her?

195
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:53,333
Didn't you hear what I said?

196
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,343
To treat her like your own sister.
And yet, you married her.

197
00:13:57,343 --> 00:13:59,733
Sure. You win.

198
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,153
You win, Bong Seon Uk.

199
00:14:01,153 --> 00:14:03,253
Thank you. Love you, brother-in-law.

200
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:04,963
Get off me.

201
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:06,953
Marriage.

202
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:10,203
Blooming... Blooming...

203
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:12,073
All right, all right.

204
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:13,823
Blooming...

205
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:18,563
What do I do with that guy?

206
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:21,763
No appetite. I don't even feel like eating.

207
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:23,373
Force yourself to eat.

208
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:25,553
You need strength.

209
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:27,743
Am I just wasting your time?

210
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,653
You are.

211
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:32,723
So eat, at least for my sake.

212
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:36,663
Porridge is here.

213
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:41,763
Enjoy.

214
00:14:43,543 --> 00:14:45,083
We didn't order these.

215
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,933
Bochun's one and only precious doctor came by.

216
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:50,013
How can I not do something?

217
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:53,673
It's on the house.

218
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:56,443
Let me dig in...

219
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:05,293
This porridge is...

220
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:08,683
killer*!
(Sounds like porridge)

221
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:10,893
Want some more?

222
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:12,873
Yes, I like fish.

223
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:14,303
I like...

224
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:17,413
Because I liked you so much...

225
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,113
Yes, Director.

226
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:26,933
Oh, the mobile clinic van?

227
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,633
Bigger the better.

228
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:32,343
The locals like larger cars.

229
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,673
Yes.

230
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:38,703
Yes, yes.

231
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:43,983
Because I liked...

232
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:48,413
Because I liked you so much...

233
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:54,193
He said auditory hallucinations might occur...

234
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:56,873
Withdrawal symptoms are no joke.

235
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,103
Got it.

236
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:01,513
What's wrong? Are you okay?

237
00:16:01,513 --> 00:16:02,723
Huh?

238
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:04,093
Yeah.

239
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:06,563
Let's eat.

240
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:13,833
Next,

241
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,463
the Chinese restaurant owner's
daughter's wedding gift.

242
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:20,443
She couldn't make it today
because she's picking up her gown.

243
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:24,283
Let's take care of this while she's absent.

244
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,163
Do we have any remaining funds?

245
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:29,233
Funds?
There should be.

246
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,923
Yes, there are.

247
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,703
Since Geum Ju's wedding got called off.

248
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:36,453
We have funds we collected for that.

249
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,693
But you know...

250
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:43,303
who could've guessed that the
Chinese restaurant owner's daughter

251
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,613
would marry before Geum Ju?

252
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:47,003
Well, you know.

253
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:50,563
Geum Ju was the one to speak first as a child.

254
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:52,753
Geum Ju went to college first.

255
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:55,773
Geum Ju got a job first.

256
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:58,973
But no luck in the marriage department.

257
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:00,753
Stop it now.

258
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:08,223
It's okay. So what if that's the case?

259
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:10,783
A woman need not marry if she's
competent to support herself.

260
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:13,403
That's true.
True...

261
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:15,303
You know my Geum Ju.

262
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:18,783
She is a recognized talent at a big corporation.

263
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:21,753
Her company awarded an extended vacation

264
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:23,283
for working there for ten years!

265
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:25,733
Extended leave...
My goodness...

266
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:29,833
But how could such a recognized employee

267
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,303
take such a long time off work?

268
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,763
Maybe it just means the company
runs fine without her.

269
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:39,393
Isn't that why she's been off so long?

270
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,903
What?

271
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,323
Gosh...

272
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:49,323
She clearly doesn't know since no one
in her family has a corporate job.

273
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,253
What?

274
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:55,213
Companies give extended vacations
to hold onto the employees longer.

275
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:58,733
They want her to rest hard so she can work hard.

276
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:02,203
That's how much the higher-ups love Geum Ju.

277
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:04,603
Love me? Bullshit.

278
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:07,333
I had a huge fight with Chief Kim.

279
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,413
Whatever.

280
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:11,073
He pissed me off so much last night
that I just went off on him.

281
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:12,323
Chief Kim didn't mention it?

282
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:14,443
He got wasted last night

283
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:16,413
and didn't show up to work today.

284
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:17,643
This is weird.

285
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:19,033
He's not the type to stay quiet.

286
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,233
And if he doesn't? What about me?

287
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,333
I've got nothing to lose.

288
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,993
I don't care anymore. I don't
care that he's my boss.

289
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:29,193
I'll come at him full force this time.

290
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:32,563
What was that?

291
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:34,133
Sorry, let me call you back.

292
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:37,383
Mom, I almost got hit.

293
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,963
And it wasn't enough.

294
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:42,503
Aigoo. Aigoo!

295
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:48,013
Scored! Daebak! Did you see that?

296
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:49,963
How dare you talk back?

297
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,523
Did you go off on your boss like this?

298
00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:53,523
Did you kick him?

299
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:55,883
No, I didn't.
I don't believe you.

300
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,703
You keep getting yourself into trouble.

301
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,253
Are you trying to get fired?

302
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:00,943
No one's getting fired.

303
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:02,113
Don't worry.

304
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:04,783
I didn't do anything wrong this time.

305
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:07,673
Do you mean it?
I said don't worry.

306
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,963
Hey, once you go back to work,

307
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:18,123
don't get a place in Seoul. Commute from here.

308
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,183
What?

309
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:20,823
It's a five-hour roundtrip commute.

310
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:22,773
Waste all my valuable time on the road?

311
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:26,793
Better than wasting your valuable time at bars.

312
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:27,913
I don't do that anymore.

313
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:29,433
You can't guarantee that.

314
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:31,353
You said it yourself.

315
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:32,933
Mom.

316
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:37,533
A drink after work is the
only joy for office workers.

317
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,883
Booze is all you can lean on

318
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:42,253
during tough times.

319
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:47,143
If you live alone once reinstated,
you'll start drinking again in no time.

320
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:49,263
You really don't trust your daughter.

321
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:51,043
I want to trust you.

322
00:19:51,043 --> 00:19:53,323
Shut up and commute.

323
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:56,013
If you keep this up, I'll start drinking again!

324
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:58,043
What?
You don't believe in me anyway.

325
00:19:58,043 --> 00:19:59,713
Might as well just drink.

326
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:01,603
How dare you threaten me?

327
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:03,743
So, don't ruin it for me.

328
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:04,923
You make me want to drink.

329
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:06,923
You make me want to go back to drinking!

330
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:08,083
What did you say?

331
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,303
I'm already suffering
from the withdrawal symptoms.

332
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:12,233
Please just let me be.

333
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,263
You're no help at all.

334
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:19,373
Seriously...

335
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:25,883
All right.

336
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:29,113
Let's take a deep breath.

337
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:32,473
This is all just a part of withdrawal.

338
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,893
The withdrawal symptoms will pass
if I endure patiently.

339
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:51,753
I got a two-week injury
diagnosis from your assault!

340
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:55,373
I'll press criminal and civil charges
and an official complaint to the company.

341
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:56,643
Brace yourself.

342
00:20:56,643 --> 00:21:00,413
Whoa, how dare he act like the victim?

343
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:02,883
This lunatic ****...

344
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:04,873
Look at this ****...

345
00:21:04,873 --> 00:21:06,643
That son of a...

346
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:09,293
Yes, I checked into a premium room.

347
00:21:09,293 --> 00:21:11,533
Figured I'd treat this like a retreat.

348
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:14,133
I'll make her pay big time.

349
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:19,823
I need to hang up.

350
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:24,473
Hello?

351
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:26,493
Yes, Ms. Han.

352
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,243
I'm in a lot of pain, so keep it short.

353
00:21:29,243 --> 00:21:30,753
Are you kidding me right now?

354
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:32,953
Why did I hit you in the first place?

355
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:34,503
Don't you remember what you did to me?

356
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,633
I don't remember at all.

357
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:39,073
What? What did I do?

358
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:42,073
I totally blacked out, and I only
remember getting beat up.

359
00:21:43,073 --> 00:21:47,203
Wow, you think that lie would fly?

360
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:49,533
The moment we pull the CCTV footage...

361
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:53,413
Too bad they don't have CCTVs.

362
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,463
W-What?

363
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:57,213
I thought we had no evidence,

364
00:21:57,213 --> 00:22:00,823
but turns out there is a witness.

365
00:22:00,823 --> 00:22:01,993
A witness?

366
00:22:01,993 --> 00:22:03,333
Turns out...

367
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:07,143
an employee there only saw you hit me.

368
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:09,853
So in other words,

369
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:12,803
you're screwed. Got it?

370
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:21,193
Shit!

371
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:25,273
No CCTV?

372
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:31,283
At this rate, I might be
the only one getting screwed.

373
00:22:53,803 --> 00:22:56,533
Did you enjoy the concert?

374
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:57,933
Pardon?

375
00:22:57,933 --> 00:23:02,173
While you were at the concert, I got drunk.

376
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:06,523
I drank so much that I blacked out.

377
00:23:06,523 --> 00:23:08,043
I'm sorry I made you go alone.

378
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:09,233
But it was fun, right?

379
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:11,473
Jang Beom June is an amazing singer, right?

380
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,863
Hyeon Ju.

381
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:16,643
You told me to speak casually to you.

382
00:23:16,643 --> 00:23:18,233
What?

383
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:21,733
When did I say that? I ran off while kissing-

384
00:23:24,063 --> 00:23:26,193
So, you do remember.

385
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:31,593
Hey, can we just pretend it didn't happen?

386
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,463
Look how far I'm going with this.

387
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:34,893
My lips remember.

388
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:37,273
How am I supposed to pretend?

389
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:38,583
What?

390
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,743
You know you're my first love.

391
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,973
I worked hard to let those feelings go.

392
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:47,203
The day I got your wedding invitation.

393
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:48,843
"Get yourself together, Bong Seon Uk."

394
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:52,093
"You're just a baby brother to her."
Telling myself this.

395
00:23:52,093 --> 00:23:55,133
Right. So, let it go again.

396
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,203
Why are you doing this now?

397
00:23:57,203 --> 00:24:00,523
Because I'm a man to you now.

398
00:24:01,263 --> 00:24:02,903
Seon Uk.

399
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,653
"Baekjeolbulgul."

400
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,773
"Bend a hundred times but never break."

401
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:12,893
This is one of the core values of Taekwondo.

402
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:14,983
I'm not saying let's start dating immediately.

403
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:17,083
I understand your position.

404
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:21,073
I'll wait.

405
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:23,223
Embodying baekjeolbulgul.

406
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,603
As a man, not as a little brother.

407
00:24:26,603 --> 00:24:28,353
Straight on ahead.

408
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,343
You must be crazy.

409
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:36,673
Yes, I'm crazy about you.

410
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,313
But don't worry. I'll keep it
professional during class.

411
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:44,853
Now, let's start with a warmup.

412
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,493
Gosh, seriously...

413
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:50,953
One.

414
00:24:50,953 --> 00:24:52,283
Two...

415
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:56,663
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get angry.

416
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,973
Your baby will get scared.

417
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:03,043
Your stomach just moved, right?

418
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,833
The fetal movement, right?

419
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:08,353
What are you doing?

420
00:25:11,753 --> 00:25:14,273
How did she get this?

421
00:25:17,513 --> 00:25:19,563
I will be the one pressing
criminal and civil charges

422
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:21,553
and filing an official complaint
to the company.

423
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,873
Brace yourself.
Let's see who's screwed now.

424
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:26,523
It's getting interesting.

425
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:28,213
Damn it!

426
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:30,713
Darn it...

427
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:32,063
Food is here.

428
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,283
I don't need to eat. I'm checking out.

429
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,463
Pardon?

430
00:25:35,463 --> 00:25:38,843
I'm fine. Why stay and waste
money on hospital bills!

431
00:25:38,843 --> 00:25:42,243
I didn't touch that, so don't charge me for it.
Please leave.

432
00:25:46,783 --> 00:25:49,473
Geez, that Han Geum Ju...

433
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:52,243
Just wait till you're back at work.

434
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:55,103
How dare he mess with me.

435
00:25:55,903 --> 00:25:57,233
What did he say?

436
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:59,223
What else? He read it and is ignoring it.

437
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:00,813
He has nothing to say.

438
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:04,443
He'd never imagine your
dashcam had it all recorded.

439
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:07,383
Thanks. I'm glad I talked to you.

440
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:10,193
Are you sure it's enough to just scare him?

441
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,253
What if he tries something again?

442
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:13,293
Don't worry.

443
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:15,193
If he does, I'll take him to court

444
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:17,613
and make sure he gets what he deserves.

445
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:18,883
You're really okay, right?

446
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:21,023
I said don't worry.

447
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:25,723
Wait, let me get you some water.

448
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:36,593
He got there at 7 p.m.?

449
00:26:36,593 --> 00:26:38,283
[Playlist: Date / List]

450
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:45,403
He waited two hours for me?

451
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,803
Why?

452
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:05,923
What?

453
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:08,613
Is something bothering you?

454
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:10,683
It's nothing.

455
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:12,223
No?

456
00:27:14,263 --> 00:27:17,123
Are you also suffering from...

457
00:27:17,123 --> 00:27:19,163
withdrawal symptoms, too?

458
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:20,663
Huh?

459
00:27:20,663 --> 00:27:22,743
Well, yeah...

460
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:23,963
Unni.

461
00:27:23,963 --> 00:27:26,313
Go get treated by Ui Jun.

462
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:29,793
Sure.
It really helps.

463
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:32,453
Okay.
I'm telling you, it helps.

464
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:33,913
You're going where?

465
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:35,603
To Seoul!

466
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:36,843
What?

467
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:38,793
Why are you suddenly going to Seoul?

468
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:40,933
To enjoy my life for once. Why?

469
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:43,663
I'm going to go shopping, meet friends,

470
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,713
and have as much fun as I want.

471
00:27:45,713 --> 00:27:47,263
What about the pension?

472
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:49,493
We have group guests booked.

473
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:50,823
Take care of it.

474
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:53,153
I'm on vacation starting today.

475
00:27:53,153 --> 00:27:54,603
Vacation without any notice?

476
00:27:54,603 --> 00:27:57,183
What are you doing? You keep
putting that thing on and off?

477
00:27:57,183 --> 00:27:59,883
It's the withdrawal symptoms.

478
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:01,393
I'm hot and cold nonstop.

479
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:02,893
Gosh, seriously...

480
00:28:02,893 --> 00:28:04,483
Let's just go and not see all this.

481
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,863
Mom, where are you going?

482
00:28:06,863 --> 00:28:08,473
We're all in bad condition.

483
00:28:08,473 --> 00:28:10,673
Look at Dad. He won't make it without you.

484
00:28:10,673 --> 00:28:12,623
What's this? You said I'm no help.

485
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:14,243
Do whatever you want.

486
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:16,213
I'll take care of myself first now.

487
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:18,333
Mom!
Gwang Ok.

488
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,183
Let me drive you to the terminal.

489
00:28:20,183 --> 00:28:22,853
Gwang Ok!
How could she?

490
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:25,353
What are we supposed to do?

491
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:30,643
Hello!

492
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:32,133
We booked for today!

493
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:33,613
Check out the view!

494
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:38,103
So beautiful!
Who booked this spot?

495
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:40,833
Welcome.

496
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:42,853
She's the owner...

497
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:44,853
What are you talking about?

498
00:28:50,493 --> 00:28:54,093
Gosh, my whole body aches.

499
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:57,603
Aigoo...

500
00:29:12,053 --> 00:29:13,803
Wow...

501
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:15,683
So cool.

502
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:20,623
Looks like it's saying something.

503
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:22,643
Step...

504
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:26,213
Aside...

505
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:27,723
Step aside.

506
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:29,663
I said, step aside.

507
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:33,233
Come on.

508
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:36,473
Of course, I run into you
when I made time to practice.

509
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:39,383
Wow, are you a part of a drone club, too?

510
00:29:39,383 --> 00:29:40,733
Yes.

511
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:42,583
"Fly Super Drone"?

512
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,423
Looking down on Earth from up above

513
00:29:44,423 --> 00:29:46,073
brings me so much happiness.

514
00:29:46,073 --> 00:29:48,923
Though, you shattered my happiness.

515
00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:50,713
Did you book this whole place or something?

516
00:29:50,713 --> 00:29:54,173
Did you book Dr. Seo's time or something?

517
00:29:54,173 --> 00:29:56,893
What?
Instead of coming in early to see him,

518
00:29:56,893 --> 00:29:59,733
you come at lunchtime and eat with him.

519
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:02,543
You lure him out, saying it's
booze hour, and work out together.

520
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,643
How dare you try to pull something?

521
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:07,473
W-What? Try to pull something? Me?

522
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,033
Yes, you.

523
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:10,443
No way.

524
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:12,633
Ui Jun suggested we have lunch together.

525
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:15,583
And he asked to work out saying it's booze hour.

526
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,873
Don't lie.

527
00:30:17,873 --> 00:30:21,383
Ask him yourself if you don't believe me.

528
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:25,003
Gosh, I was hoping to enjoy my alone time.

529
00:30:25,003 --> 00:30:28,003
Maybe I should tell her Seo Ui Jun
used to like me.

530
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:40,753
Don't come! Don't come near me!

531
00:30:51,503 --> 00:30:53,803
Gosh, I thought I was going to die.

532
00:30:53,803 --> 00:30:56,453
That was total overkill.

533
00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:58,873
Why is she so obsessed with hating me?

534
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:01,063
She's just super protective of Dr. Seo.

535
00:31:01,063 --> 00:31:04,353
She probably doesn't like seeing you close to him.

536
00:31:04,353 --> 00:31:05,943
What does that mean?

537
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:08,103
Of course, I respect you,

538
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:10,903
but older people might judge you.

539
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:12,973
It's true you get drunk and cause trouble.

540
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:15,793
Yeong Rong, stop. I'll cause trouble sober, too.

541
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:17,903
Got it, Unni.

542
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,633
Fine, let's say she's right.

543
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:25,463
But why? What? Who is she to him?

544
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:27,843
Who are they to each other?

545
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:30,583
He said she's special to him.

546
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:34,103
Doctor.

547
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:35,463
Yes?

548
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,933
Dr. Seo said so.

549
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:50,113
He survived the tough
hospital life, thanks to her.

550
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:53,693
She was the only one he could lean on.

551
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:57,513
She followed him to Bochun, too.

552
00:31:57,513 --> 00:31:59,773
She volunteered to come.

553
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:02,223
Really?

554
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,723
Daebak. They are something to each other.

555
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:14,173
Yes, Ui Jun. You're here?

556
00:32:17,743 --> 00:32:19,833
Hey.
Hey.

557
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,473
I don't need to run today. I've run enough.

558
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,673
What?

559
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:25,283
That's where we're at.

560
00:32:25,283 --> 00:32:27,283
Run alone if you want to.

561
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:29,933
Never mind, then.

562
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:33,183
Had I known this, I should've gone
to Ms. Baek's drone practice.

563
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:36,393
She said she'd buy me dinner.

564
00:32:36,393 --> 00:32:39,873
Some people treat others like their own kids.

565
00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:43,293
But someone treats her
own kids worse than others.

566
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:45,403
What? Who?
Who do you think?

567
00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:47,813
My mom, Ms. Kim Gwang Ok.

568
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:49,633
What about your mom again?

569
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:53,033
I mean, I'm suffering from withdrawal symptoms,

570
00:32:53,033 --> 00:32:56,233
but instead of helping, she's eating me alive.

571
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:58,593
She snapped and left for Seoul.

572
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:00,543
Really? When did she go?

573
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:02,163
This morning.

574
00:33:02,163 --> 00:33:04,673
She said she'll take care of herself first now.

575
00:33:04,673 --> 00:33:06,713
She left me to run the pension!

576
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:08,733
It was no joke.

577
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:12,153
How can she put that on me when I'm suffering?

578
00:33:12,153 --> 00:33:14,473
I told her to go.

579
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:17,233
What?
I told her to go.

580
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:19,483
Instead of thanking me at all,

581
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:22,063
she's telling me I'm no help.

582
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:26,133
I don't know what I'm living for anymore.

583
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:28,583
Children. What are they to me?

584
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,053
Sounds tough.

585
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:31,583
Why bother spelling it out?

586
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,833
I want to let it all go and get away.

587
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,693
You should get away, then.

588
00:33:37,523 --> 00:33:38,983
What?

589
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,173
Gosh, I can't do that.

590
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:43,133
She's suffering from withdrawal.

591
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:46,733
I'd better take care-
Take care of yourself first.

592
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:50,503
It's not healthy to let your mood

593
00:33:50,503 --> 00:33:53,943
depend so much on your kids.

594
00:33:53,943 --> 00:33:56,833
You should first care for yourself.

595
00:33:56,833 --> 00:34:01,133
You must be healthy and happy first
to care for someone else.

596
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:07,833
The caretaker suffers, too, not just the patient.

597
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,823
Your mom acts all brave in front of you,

598
00:34:11,823 --> 00:34:14,483
but she's suffering a lot inside.

599
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:19,053
I was a little worried about her.

600
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:21,593
That she might get depression.

601
00:34:22,463 --> 00:34:24,163
Depression?

602
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,723
Yes.

603
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:28,973
I saw many cases like that
when I worked at the hospital.

604
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:31,713
You're not the only one suffering.

605
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:35,163
So, be good to your mom.

606
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:12,453
Gosh, look at you.

607
00:35:12,453 --> 00:35:15,073
It's been so long since we saw you,
and you're so down.

608
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:17,283
This is how you'll act after visiting us in years?

609
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:19,953
Lighten up.

610
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:22,093
I want to.

611
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:24,383
I want to, but...

612
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:35,483
Mom, I'm sorry.

613
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:37,263
It's my fault.

614
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:39,483
Don't worry about me or the pension.

615
00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:42,683
I hope you enjoy this time to yourself.

616
00:35:48,953 --> 00:35:51,013
Thanks, daughter.

617
00:36:02,403 --> 00:36:03,713
Don't be stingy,

618
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,733
and do whatever you want to do.
[Mom's Happiness Fund: 500,000 won]

619

Buy some cute shoes.

620
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,673
I didn't ask her to do this!

621
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,263
What?

622
00:36:17,263 --> 00:36:20,253
I said I'm good,

623
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:24,163
but she insisted on sending me money.

624
00:36:24,163 --> 00:36:27,993
Gosh, she just doesn't listen.

625
00:36:27,993 --> 00:36:29,243
You're so lucky.

626
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:32,263
Of course. A daughter is the best.

627
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:34,723
I'm buying today.

628
00:36:34,723 --> 00:36:37,393
Let's go to karaoke. My treat!

629
00:36:37,393 --> 00:36:39,453
Really?
Of course!

630
00:36:39,453 --> 00:36:40,953
Let's go, let's go!

631
00:36:40,953 --> 00:36:42,363
Let's pay.

632
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:45,333
Where do I pay?
Your daughter's treating us today?

633
00:36:48,343 --> 00:36:49,803
Blood pressure is normal.

634
00:36:49,803 --> 00:36:51,543
How are your withdrawal symptoms?

635
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,243
Much better after the medication.

636
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:55,933
You are a great doctor.

637
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:57,003
I know.

638
00:36:57,003 --> 00:37:00,833
I should've been named Huh Jun*, not Ui Jun.
(Famous Joseon Dynasty doctor)

639
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:05,083
Just a second.

640
00:37:06,213 --> 00:37:07,963
Yes, Director.

641
00:37:09,123 --> 00:37:12,223
The mobile clinic van is ready?

642
00:37:12,223 --> 00:37:15,073
How long will the inspection take?

643
00:37:15,073 --> 00:37:16,893
What?

644
00:37:16,893 --> 00:37:19,983
We have to wait that long for them to come out?

645
00:37:20,923 --> 00:37:22,483
Got it.

646
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:23,993
Yes.

647
00:37:24,773 --> 00:37:26,713
I'll do it.

648
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:29,333
Really?
Yeah, I can do it today.

649
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,563
Whoa. Okay.

650
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:35,883
Yes, it's me.

651
00:37:35,883 --> 00:37:38,553
My friend can inspect it today. I'll bring her.

652
00:37:38,553 --> 00:37:41,323
Don't worry. She's Bochun's repair prodigy.

653
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:43,113
She almost got on the genius discovery show.

654
00:37:43,113 --> 00:37:46,023
Although she passed 30, waiting to get cast...

655
00:37:46,023 --> 00:37:48,923
Stop with the nonsense.

656
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,193
Gotcha.

657
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:52,893
I haven't called yet.

658
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:55,583
You think that's funny? Is that funny?

659
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:58,383
Yes, it's fun. So fun.

660
00:38:00,523 --> 00:38:02,483
I'm done seeing patients for the day.

661
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:05,303
Why don't we just go together?

662
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:06,743
Want to go to my car and wait?

663
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,513
I'll be right there after a phone call.

664
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:10,083
Sure.

665
00:38:12,603 --> 00:38:14,313
What's this?

666
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:16,203
My back was hurting so badly,

667
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:18,313
and I feel so relieved now.

668
00:38:18,313 --> 00:38:20,183
There's nothing like physical therapy.

669
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:22,483
It'll hurt again when it gets cloudy.

670
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:24,373
I wonder what the weather's going to be.

671
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:26,083
Thankfully, it's clear.

672
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,193
What?

673
00:38:27,193 --> 00:38:29,493
You can check the weather on your watch?

674
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:31,433
Of course. You don't know about this?

675
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:32,673
Cosmos Watch.

676
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:35,103
My future son-in-law bought it for me.

677
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:37,733
I'm jealous.

678
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:41,533
Right, you haven't invited Gwang Ok
to the wedding yet, right?

679
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:42,603
Since she's on vacation.

680
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:44,733
Do I really need to invite her?

681
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:46,533
What do you mean?

682
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:51,033
I'm worried Geum Ju will tag along
if I invite her.

683
00:38:51,033 --> 00:38:55,333
It's bad luck for someone who canceled her wedding
to show up at a wedding.

684
00:38:56,813 --> 00:39:00,133
That's absolute nonsense.
What?

685
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:04,233
What year do we live in to believe
in superstition like that?

686
00:39:05,673 --> 00:39:08,113
I was just...

687
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:09,353
I just...

688
00:39:09,353 --> 00:39:11,063
Can I pay for the treatment with Cosmos Pay?

689
00:39:11,063 --> 00:39:13,303
You can just hold this up to pay.

690
00:39:13,303 --> 00:39:16,133
You should pay with brass coins, not Cosmos Pay.

691
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:17,633
Brass coins?
Yes.

692
00:39:17,633 --> 00:39:20,393
You believe in superstition
from the Joseon Dynasty,

693
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:22,233
not even from the 80s.

694
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:25,333
What Cosmos Pay? Give me your brass coins.

695
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:31,823
So, don't hurt Geum Ju over
an outdated superstition like that.

696
00:39:31,823 --> 00:39:33,703
Okay...

697
00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:38,753
You scared me!

698
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:41,713
Unni, what are you doing here?

699
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:56,423
I'm okay.

700
00:39:56,423 --> 00:39:58,233
Stop staring.

701
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:00,693
Are you really okay?

702
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:03,003
Yes, I broke off the wedding.

703
00:40:03,003 --> 00:40:05,053
I braced myself for this much and more.

704
00:40:05,053 --> 00:40:06,833
At least, I called it off.

705
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,393
Thank God it wasn't him.

706
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:10,503
I would've been devastated.

707
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:18,053
You did the right thing by calling it off.

708
00:40:18,053 --> 00:40:19,363
That's what I'm saying.

709
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:22,923
So, stop worrying, and let's get to business.

710
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,703
As a man, not as a little brother.

711
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:39,263
Straight on ahead.

712
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:43,593
He must've lost his mind.

713
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:50,533
Come take a look. Hello...

714
00:40:53,043 --> 00:40:54,973
Hey, Hyeon Ju!

715
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:57,683
Han Hyeon Ju!

716
00:41:00,453 --> 00:41:02,623
Hey, Seon Hwa!

717
00:41:03,593 --> 00:41:06,143
What? You mentioned your mom went on vacation.

718
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:07,923
Grocery shopping alone?

719
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,743
Yes, that's right.

720
00:41:13,543 --> 00:41:15,013
Did you eat?

721
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:17,003
Yeah. Sort of.

722
00:41:23,473 --> 00:41:26,263
I hear the Chinese restaurant owner's
daughter is getting married, too.

723
00:41:26,263 --> 00:41:28,043
I hope Seon Uk finds his match, too.

724
00:41:28,043 --> 00:41:30,263
Hey. Do you know any decent woman?

725
00:41:30,263 --> 00:41:31,273
Huh?

726
00:41:31,273 --> 00:41:33,593
I don't expect too much.

727
00:41:33,593 --> 00:41:37,023
As long as she's younger than Seon Uk.

728
00:41:37,023 --> 00:41:39,933
I see...
Oh, and also,

729
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:42,343
as long as she has a decent job.

730
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:44,963
You said you don't expect much.

731
00:41:49,233 --> 00:41:52,933
You were quite old and didn't have a decent job.

732
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:56,933
How could you say that
after snatching away my precious son?

733
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,503
Stop bullying your daughter-in-law.

734
00:41:58,503 --> 00:41:59,783
What?

735
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,993
It's okay. She's right.

736
00:42:01,993 --> 00:42:04,533
Right. Don't have high expectations.

737
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:09,633
You make it sound like Seon Uk is
some standout husband material.

738
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:11,763
You're wrong about that, Mother.

739
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:12,863
What?

740
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,623
You can bully me and look down on me all you want,

741
00:42:15,623 --> 00:42:18,563
but don't mess with my Seon Uk.

742
00:42:18,563 --> 00:42:20,623
W-W-What did you just say?

743
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:21,713
Just wait and see.

744
00:42:21,713 --> 00:42:25,063
Watch me marry him off to an amazing woman.

745
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:26,603
T-T-That...

746
00:42:26,603 --> 00:42:29,013
Seon Hwa.
How dare she glare at me like that?

747
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,833
I'd better go, too.

748
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:34,053
Aigoo, my heart...

749
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:36,443
She raised him like her own child.

750
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:39,003
Of course, she won't take crap about Seon Uk.

751
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:41,383
You're in the wrong.

752
00:42:48,253 --> 00:42:49,773
With the medical van,

753
00:42:49,773 --> 00:42:51,693
patient visits will become much easier.

754
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:52,873
Yes.

755
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:56,203
Since it's already equipped
with basic medical supplies.

756
00:42:57,253 --> 00:43:00,333
But it's a used car
with some years under its belt.

757
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,783
I'm worried about it breaking down constantly.

758
00:43:01,783 --> 00:43:03,223
Don't worry about that.

759
00:43:03,223 --> 00:43:05,033
I'm a veteran mechanic.

760
00:43:05,033 --> 00:43:09,383
I'll clean it all up and make it
run better than a new car.

761
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:10,683
All right.

762
00:43:10,683 --> 00:43:12,223
Okay!

763
00:43:57,103 --> 00:43:58,443
Are you okay?

764
00:43:58,443 --> 00:44:00,103
Yes...

765
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:19,603
Yes, there was an accident.

766
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:21,783
We're on the mountain road into Bochun.

767
00:44:21,783 --> 00:44:23,953
Yes, near the tunnel.

768
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:26,943
Okay.

769
00:44:28,663 --> 00:44:31,513
Ui Jun, are you okay? Are you hurt?

770
00:44:31,513 --> 00:44:33,733
Huh? No...

771
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,653
What's wrong?

772
00:44:43,683 --> 00:44:46,883
That could've been really bad.

773
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:49,493
But that truck.

774
00:44:49,493 --> 00:44:52,553
Do you think they drove off,
not realizing the accident, or...

775
00:44:52,553 --> 00:44:55,193
do you think it just ran off knowing?

776
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,793
I'm not sure.

777
00:44:58,263 --> 00:44:59,813
Does it hurt?

778
00:44:59,813 --> 00:45:01,763
We should've gone to the clinic.

779
00:45:01,763 --> 00:45:04,243
It would've been better if the nurse did this.

780
00:45:05,073 --> 00:45:08,613
No, I don't want to worry her.

781
00:45:09,613 --> 00:45:11,313
True.

782
00:45:11,313 --> 00:45:14,333
She cares deeply about you.

783
00:45:16,343 --> 00:45:18,773
I heard from Yeong Rong.

784
00:45:20,953 --> 00:45:22,463
Yeah?

785
00:45:51,383 --> 00:45:52,913
Well...

786
00:45:53,913 --> 00:45:55,853
w-where are the scissors?

787
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,513
I have scissors in the study.

788
00:45:57,513 --> 00:46:00,493
Wait. I'll go get them.

789
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:19,683
Gosh, it's hot.

790
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:37,043
The call is not going through.
After the beep...

791
00:46:40,733 --> 00:46:44,433
It's class time. Why aren't you here, Noona?

792
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:47,963
[Let's have lunch together.
Whatever you want to eat.]

793
00:46:47,963 --> 00:46:49,063
[Are you so busy that you can't read the text?]

794
00:46:49,063 --> 00:46:50,363
[I didn't see you at pick-up.
You're coming straight here, right?]

795
00:46:50,363 --> 00:46:51,463
[It's class time. Why aren't you here, Noona?]

796
00:47:02,743 --> 00:47:05,033
Is something going on?
Huh?

797
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:08,393
No, I just can't get a hold of someone.

798
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:11,633
She won't pick up, won't read my texts...

799
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:12,733
What's going on?

800
00:47:12,733 --> 00:47:15,433
Sounds like she blocked you.
It's not like that.

801
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:18,333
I told you to wash the car.
Why did you come up here?

802
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:20,933
Oh, right. This.

803
00:47:23,393 --> 00:47:26,553
Woo Ri's and Na Rah's mom dropped this off.

804
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:28,553
She said she's quitting Taekwondo.

805
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:33,103
What?
Your ambitious plan failed.

806
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:35,633
But it was weird, now that I think about it.
[Han Hyeon Ju]

807
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:40,053
We're not a convenience store,
and 2+1 promotion mannequin?

808
00:47:40,053 --> 00:47:41,653
Mann...

809
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,833
It's marketing, not mannequin.

810
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:48,733
2+1 marketing.

811
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,933
Gosh, you're so stupid.
Just go finish the car wash!

812
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:54,453
Yes, sir!

[Han Hyeon Ju]

814
00:48:47,373 --> 00:48:50,093
Just thinking about it is terrifying.

815
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,333
If I ever catch that truck...

816
00:48:59,923 --> 00:49:01,903
Because I liked you so much.

817
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:11,463
Because I liked you so much.

818
00:49:18,553 --> 00:49:20,343
What's going on?

819
00:49:21,323 --> 00:49:23,273
Am I in shock?

820
00:49:24,413 --> 00:49:26,893
Is this also a withdrawal symptom?

821
00:49:28,743 --> 00:49:31,403
I even took the medication...

822
00:49:33,693 --> 00:49:36,193
This can't be it.

823
00:49:43,123 --> 00:49:44,993
Yes, Detective.

824
00:49:44,993 --> 00:49:47,443
Pardon? What do you mean...

825
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,453
We can't ID the plate

826
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,533
because of the dirt on it.

827
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,363
The traffic unit is investigating,

828
00:49:53,363 --> 00:49:55,593
and it'll take a while.

829
00:49:57,493 --> 00:49:59,663
So, you don't know where it went?

830
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,413
They turned down a road with no CCTV.

831
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:04,873
We're still tracking.

832
00:50:04,873 --> 00:50:08,663
Okay, call me the moment you find it.

833
00:50:10,103 --> 00:50:11,553
Yes.

Not at all.

00:51:51,923 --> 00:51:54,803
I made some for you while cooking for myself.

842

All right...

843
00:52:24,513 --> 00:52:27,623
Work is the best distraction for feeling anxious.

Oh, that day...

853
00:53:22,483 --> 00:53:25,793
That car was blocking the groom's car.

854

[010-0237-3987]
We kept calling,

858

but no one answered.

859
00:53:45,093 --> 00:53:47,963
I had no idea he knew everything.

Yes, I broke off the wedding.

I braced myself for this much and more.

863

At least, I called it off.

Thank God it wasn't him.
