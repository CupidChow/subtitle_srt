00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,030
Will you be okay? Won't it be too tough?

367
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,200
No.

368
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,450
I think it'd be tougher not to see you often.

369
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,990
Yes, that sounds tough.

370
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,220
I can be quite addictive.

371
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,410
Fine. I'll stop.

372
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,930
I'll stop.

373
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,510
I'll stop!

When did I fall asleep?

389
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,850
Wait, more importantly,

390
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,880
did I sleep alone?

391
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,960
If I said...

392
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,320
I was going to drink this coffee
but didn't drink it,

393
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,890
how do you think it would've felt? His heart...

394
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,090
probably burned to soot, right?

395
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,760
Like this color...

396
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,870
Huh?
That's how my heart feels.

397
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,830
Burnt to a crisp. I mean...

398
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,420
You said you wanted to be with me.

399
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,280
So, how could you let me sleep alone?

400
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,600
How could you just let me sleep like that?

401
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,620
Who left you to sleep?

402
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,160
You passed out cold.

403
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,530
You should've woken me up!

404
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,720
I was... I was...

405
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,290
fully prepared, emotionally.

406
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,100
So what if you were ready emotionally?

407
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,170
You looked so exhausted.

408
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,850
I felt guilty for even suggesting
we spend the night.

409
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,700
Yeah?

410
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,000
What?

411
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,570
You don't have to feel guilty anymore.

412
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,120
I'm...

413
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,850
fully rested now.

414
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,730
Huh?

415
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,550
You don't have to hold back anymore.

416
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,590
What...

417
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,300
Who's there?

418
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,010
What, what?
What is this?

419
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,460
A live octopus?

420
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,680
Are you okay?

421
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,750
Gosh, they probably saw everything, right?

422
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,880
Yeah.

423
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,720
They left all this here.
Of course, they saw everything.

424
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,970
Who is it? Who takes care of you like this?

425
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,890
Right. The head nurse?

426
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,160
She already knows about us.

427
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,160
Since she knows, she wouldn't
have made such a fuss...

428
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,280
Right...

429
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
Gosh, who could it be?

430
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,940
Wait.

431
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,950
Wait...

432
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,220
I've seen this somewhere before.

433
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,760
Delicious.

434
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,820
Thanks to you, we're feasting.

435
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,490
Sure.

436
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,750
If you've got something to say, just say it.

437
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,460
Well, I've been seriously debating

438
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,790
whether to say this or not...

439
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,350
You'll say it anyway, so just say it.

440
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,290
Don't be shocked, everyone.

441
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,940
This morning,

442
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,850
I went to Ui Jun's house. Guess what I saw?

443
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,830
Gosh, I feel too embarrassed to say.

444
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,620
What? What did you see?

445
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,710
It's just...

446
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,110
Like this.

447
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,220
She was seducing him with a sly look,

448
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,750
and pounced on him!

449
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,980
Who? Who did?

450
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,660
Geum Ju!

451
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,520
May I talk to her for a moment?

452
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,090
Enjoy the food!

453
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,960
What?
What was that?

454
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,320
Hey, hey. What's going on?

455
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,490
Let me go!

456
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,500
Let go! Why are you doing this?

457
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,120
Please keep it a secret.

458
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,550
Please?

459
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,710
I'm begging you, Ahjumma.

460
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,140
You should've stayed in your lane.

461
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,630
How dare you go after one and only one in Bochun?

462
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,220
The most precious thing!

463
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,650
Falling in love isn't a crime.

464
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,030
Look at you.

465
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,370
This is a crime, all right.

466
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,200
It's criminal!

467
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,570
Excuse me?

468
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,640
There's no need to call it criminal.

469
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,620
Sure, love knows no status.

470
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,130
But not in this case.

471
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,020
Status matters in this case.

472
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,850
You two are on different levels. Different levels.

473
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,060
Gosh, listen to this. Seriously?

474
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,210
Don't you think you're being too harsh?

475
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,210
What's harsh is not what I said

476
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,310
but your lack of shame.

477
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,190
Even if you're horny,

478
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,400
how dare a mutt try to mount a purebred Jindo?

479
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,300
What? What did you say? Horny? A mutt?

480
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,820
What's wrong with calling a mutt a mutt?

481
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,140
Dae Geun is a mutt!

482
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,450
Yes, Dae Geun is a mutt.

483
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,990
Huh?
And he had taste, apparently.

484
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,510
He tried to hump the one and only

485
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,400
purebred Jindo in Bochun.

486
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,970
He pounced on Jin Soon,

487
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,320
and I had to yank him off her with all my might.

488
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,070
Jin Soon was given to us as a gift when

489
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,970
Bochun and Jindo became sister cities.

490
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,530
Because of Dae Geun, our two cities

491
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,790
almost became enemies, not sisters.

492
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,660
How many times did I tell you
to keep him under control?

493
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,700
I had a bad feeling the moment
you named him Dae Geun.

494
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,750
Right, we really messed up naming him that.

495
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,980
And because of all that,

496
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,700
I couldn't even bring Ui Jun live octopus today.

497
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,910
Oh, I see. You couldn't go.

498
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,790
Then, who brought Ui Jun live octopus?

499
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,450
Why? Why are you wondering that?

500
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,360
Huh? No.

501
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,390
I'm not curious at all.

502
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,960
Then, who could've brought Ui Jun...

503
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,640
Whatever. As long as it's not her.

504
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,840
Gosh, what's this?

505
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,300
Who's smoking on the streets?

506
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,670
What?

507
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,090
Unni?

508
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,860
I thought you quit?

509
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,940
Yeah. Well, I started again.

510
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,160
Thanks to some psycho bitch.

511
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,630
What?

512
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,620
Who are you talking about?

513
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,700
You.

514
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,620
Me?
Yes.

515
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,030
You, psycho bitch.

516
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,270
Wait, what?

517
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,310
This bitch...
Aigoo, wait...

518
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,470
Unni, why are you doing this?

519
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,990
Why am I doing this? Why?

520
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,540
Hello, what are you doing here?

521
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,890
Hey, take this to Ui Jun's place. Quick.

522
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,900
Okay.

523
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,670
Dae Geun, get off her!

524
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,390
Who does Dae Geun take after?

525
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,970
Dae Geun takes after you, apparently.

526
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,200
Blinded by lust.

527
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,080
How dare you two-time both Seon Uk and Ui Jun?

528
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,280
I'm going to make you pay two times!

529
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,300
Wait, wait.
Come here!

530
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,660
Wait, what are you talking about?

531
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,670
I'm not two-timing! I swear I'm not!

532
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:31,060
Really? You're not?
No! I swear!

533
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,930
It hurts.
Sorry, sorry.

534
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,170
You thought I'd give up?
How dare you play ignorant!

535
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,690
Unni, wait.

536
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,320
Tell me the truth. Spill!

537
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,640
Tell you what?

538
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,810
I know everything already. Tell me the truth!

539
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,030
What truth?

540
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,960
Noona!
Stop!

541
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,120
What, what, what? What's going on?

542
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,020
What, what, what?

543
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,180
Why are you doing this?

544
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,230
Hey, Seo Ui Jun.

545
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,900
Bong Seon Uk.

546
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,410
Both of you, listen up.

547
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,940
That femme fatale who's been playing you both.

548
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,240
I'm exposing Han Geum Ju's real identity!

549
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,480
No, that's not true!

550
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,790
I'm only dating Ui Jun!

551
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,360
I love Ui Jun only!

552
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,090
Whoa.

553
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,720
You two are dating?

554
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,430
What?

555
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,500
Chills.

556
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,840
What?

557
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,130
What did you just say?

558
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,170
5 days, 15 hours, 23 minutes, and 7 seconds.

559
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,920
That's how long our
secret relationship lasted.

560
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,780
I'm drained. My blood sugar is low.

561
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,600
Why chocolate?

562
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,180
Isn't Ui Jun sweet enough?

563
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,140
Of course. Geum Ju,
why don't you change your name?

564
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,220
From Geum Ju to Geum Falls-in-Love-Easily!

565
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:51,850
Why are bad premonitions always right?

566
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,240
I'll change my name to Geum Falls-in-Love-Easily.

567
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
I fell in love with her first.

568
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,950
Whoa...

569
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,020
Now, what's this?

570
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,380
I became the female lead
of a romantic novel.

571
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,350
Gosh, Geum Ju, you've got skills.

572
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,670
How did you seduce Ui Jun?

573
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,420
Are you sure you didn't beg him to date you?

574
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,280
I begged her.

575
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,120
To date me.

576
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,600
And the exposition was a dazzling fantasy.

577
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,040
Geez Louise!

578
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,110
But just one thing...

579
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,890
If we can just cut out my mom,
Kim Gwang Ok, from the story...

580
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,030
Mom.
You missed the last train?

581
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,720
Sleeping over at Mi Yeon's?

582
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
How dare you...

583
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,400
lie like that?

584
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,300
I would've loved it if you were honest with me.

585
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,930
What brought you home today?

586
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,490
You can hang out with Ui Jun more,
and come home tomorrow.

587
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,420
Oh, my. Is this from Ui Jun?

588
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,360
Wow, so pretty.

589
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,900
Don't you meddle with my love life ever again.

590
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,650
If you do that again,

591
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,120
I'll leave Bochun.

592
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,140
I won't ever see you again. Got it?

593
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,240
He really sounded like he was ready to cut me off.

594
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,640
Gosh, I guess I need to step back.

595
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,800
Anyway, I feel so bad for Geum Ju,
you, and your parents.

596
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,110
I'm mortified.

597
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,380
Why did you have to grab her by the neck?

598
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Because I thought she was two-timing
them and lost my head.

599
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,090
I was holding back, even though
I thought Seon Uk was too good for her.

600
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,510
What?

601
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,350
Geum Ju broke off her engagement.

602
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,130
But if Seon Uk likes her,

603
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,530
I figured I'd let it go as long as they're happy.

604
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,790
It's not like she's divorced, I thought to myself.

605
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:44,130
Gosh, what am I even saying right now?

606
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,470
Hyeon Ju, I'm sorry if that upset you.

607
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,620
But...

608
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,560
please understand.

609
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Seon Uk is not just any little brother to me.

610
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,070
When our parents divorced and we got abandoned,

611
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,950
he was scared I'd abandon him, too,

612
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,810
as he held my hand tightly, so I made a vow.

613
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,580
That I'd raise him right.

614
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,770
That I'd make a life for him
that is the envy of others.

615
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,980
You know everything I went through for him.

616
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,050
I-I do know.

617
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:36,130
I really wanted to pair him with an amazing woman.

618
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,500
I'm so curious who this woman is.

619
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,190
If he said no to the credit union employee,

620
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,430
she has to be much younger and prettier, right?

621
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,300
Didn't you say you'd let it go?

622
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,460
Seon Uk has very high standards, you know.

623
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,820
Big scoop...
What are you smiling about?

624
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,370
Are braised ribs funny to you?

625
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,160
Wow...

626
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,140
No. Your daughter's the funny one.

627
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,420
She was determined to go to Seoul,

628
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,870
but now, she's not going because of Ui Jun.

629
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,210
Wow...

630
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,850
You're that happy?
Yes, I'm so happy. So happy I can die.

631
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,490
It's none other than Ui Jun we're talking about.

632
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,720
What do you think? You're totally on board, right?

633
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,710
No. I'm not.

634
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,690
I think our Geum Ju could do way better.

635
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,490
Whatever.

636
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,790
I'm heading out.

637
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,030
Mom, are you going somewhere?

638
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:40,170
Yeah, I'm taking some braised ribs for Ui Jun.

639
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,050
They say a mother-in-law's love
for her son-in-law...

640
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,590
Oh, my, my!

641
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:46,120
What did I just say?

642
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,500
See you later.

643
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,750
She's so happy. She's really on cloud nine.

644
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,710
Of course, she is.

645
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:59,300
So, I hope you find a nice partner soon, too.

646
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,590
It's okay. Don't be greedy.

647
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,490
Thanks for making time.

648
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,280
Of course.

649
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,590
What did you want to talk about?

650
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,780
Here.

651
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,700
Leonardo Tee Couple-io?

652
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,110
This is a real club?

653
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,270
I thought of you two with each stitch.

654
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,680
It made me so happy.

655
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,240
Thank you so much.

656
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,450
How could I ever repay you for this?

657
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:00,370
Just make sure you make Dr. Seo happy.

658
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,900
That's all I want.

659
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,630
Okay...

660
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,300
Yeong Rong told me

661
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,780
that you deeply care for Ui Jun.

662
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:22,080
Yes. And I plan to treat you the same.

663
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,660
Pardon?

664
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,460
It's okay. I'm good.

665
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,280
Yes, Rose in the Night?

666
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,890
Okay, I'm heading over.

667
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,390
Sorry,

668
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,400
I've got another club meeting.

669
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,900
I'll get going.
Okay.

670
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,740
Please...

671
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,130
make Dr. Seo happy.

672
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,400
Promise me.
Okay.

673
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,950
Wow, she switched up so quickly.

674
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,070
Whoa, what a character.

675
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:23,820
♪ If I were to list the reasons I like you ♪

676
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,360
♪ I would need all night to count them ♪

677
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,400
♪ Like star candy I loved as a kid ♪

678
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,280
I've only watched tourists in Bochun ride these.

679
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,760
I never thought I'd go on one.

680
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,190
How did you come up with such a romantic date?

681
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,820
Hey, seriously, is there anything you can't do?

682
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,160
There was one thing.

683
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,440
But that recently changed.

684
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,970
And what's that?

685
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,820
Making Han Geum Ju my girl.

686
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,310
My girl.

687
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,120
Wow, I can't believe we're wearing matching tops,

688
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,180
going full public with our relationship...

689
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,140
It all feels like a dream, right?

690
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,000
Look. Look at this sky.

691
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,910
This sunlight.

692
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,340
Wow, this air...

693
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,030
And you.

694
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,630
So unreal, don't you think?

695
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,100
I feel drunk, even though
I haven't had a single drop.

696
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,660
Right?

697
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,280
I feel drunk, too.

698
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,540
What?

699
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,540
Drunk on you.

700
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,870
♪ I saw you standing by the river ♪

701
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,570
♪ Something I believe inside you ♪

702
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:09,880
♪ You're a spark that appeared in thunder ♪

703
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:16,940

♪ If somewhere in the soil,

707
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,210
You should give up now.

708
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,570
I came to say that.

709
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,360
Yes, I'd better reject him firmly.

710
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,170
Be firm.

711
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,590
Wow, my heart almost exploded

712
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,800
b-because of how pretty you are.

713
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,010
Stop it.

714
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,250
Why did you dress up so much?

715
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,140
You rented a car, too?

716
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,210
Yes. I wanted to impress you.

717
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,050
What?
Today's round one. Our first date.

718
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,240
Better score some points.

719
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:53,030
Get in. You're in for a full-course date.

720
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,410
Huh?

721
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,310
Okay...

722
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,500
Byeong Jun!
Oh, no!

723
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,460
It's dangerous!

724
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,810
Let's go, let's go.

725
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,590
There... Let's go...

726
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:46,020

What about Seon Uk?

730
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,190
He's got plans.

731
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,720

We received a report about
inappropriate physical contact.

Which is why we asked you
to come to HR for confirmation.

00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:07,850

What?

846
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,090
That wasn't assault. That was clearly self-defense.

847
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,300
Shoving him during physical contact
can be considered self-defense.

848
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,570
But any additional violence
is classified as assault,

But once a report is filed,

852
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,870
it'd be hard to avoid disciplinary
action regarding an assault case.
