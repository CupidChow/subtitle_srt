1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Blind date

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:23,880
Jean Lee efficient

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,640
I'm going to go home after I sober up.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,540
Party?

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,180
You couldn't drink in Gocheon, so you went to Seoul in a hurry.

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,180
That's not it.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,980
Do you know how worried I was?

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,380
What are you doing? Let's go.

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,480
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,980
I have to go.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,440
Whatever it is,

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,340
I guess it was a good opportunity to drink.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,840
Let's go.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,380
Stop drinking.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,940
Gosh.

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,340
What is he trying to do?

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,000
I wouldn't have liked that much even if I liked to drink.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,340
What can I do?

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,640
You're an expert.

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,340
Seo Eui Joon killed someone.

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,840
He killed someone.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,680
How is he doing?

23
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,740
Hi.

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,580
What?

25
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,660
I heard everything.

26
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,740
You went to Seoul to drink yesterday.

27
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,380
Sun-young's son is very hungry.

28
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,220
Tell him I'm really sorry.

29
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,740
You have to tell Euijun about that accident.

30
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,740
I was wondering if it would be solved now that we're going to Wangjin together.

31
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:49,740
I guess he and I aren't meant to be.

32
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,740
Here?

33
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,740
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

34
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,740
Does it hurt a lot?

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
Yeah, I can't turn it around at all.

36
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,740
Oh, really?

37
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,740
Oh, someone dropped 50,000 won.

38
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,740
Hey, you.

39
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,740
You said it hurt.

40
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
Oh, it's working well.

41
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,740
What's this? What are you here for?

42
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,740
Geumju.

43
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,740
I don't know if she's reflecting on what she did yesterday.

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,740
Then I'll be angry.

45
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,740
I've never been angry.

46
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,740
I'm not the type to get angry.

47
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,740
I'm sorry you're doing this.

48
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,740
You were a really bad friend.

49
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
I'm not going to.

50
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,740
I'm not going to treat fake patients.

51
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,740
Please leave.

52
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,740
Geumju was just like before.

53
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,740
Taking care of you.

54
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,740
But why did they show all the engines?

55
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,740
It doesn't matter if it's an accident.

56
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,740
The short engines were all old.

57
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
I'm trying to change them.

58
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
It's going to be hard to supply this.

59
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,740
I've been in the repair business for years.

60
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,740
I got a snack from the water supply.

61
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,740
I decided to get it as a kick in the afternoon.

62
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,740
He's so poor at work.

63
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,740
It's probably because of your job.

64
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,740
That's what you think.

65
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,740
I guess you've been working hard for a few days to get that part.

66
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,740
I'm working from dawn today.

67
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
You've been taking care of it since a long time ago.

68
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,740
Think of it as paying it back and solve it.

69
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:25,740
Huh?

70
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
What?

71
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,740
Goodbye.

72
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,740
Have a good time with your memorial service.

73
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,740
Yes.

74
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,740
As soon as you were born, your mother left the world.

75
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,740
Even my father, who ran away from me.

76
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,740
I was the only grandmother in the world to rely on.

77
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,740
It's really hard.

78
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,740
I know.

79
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,740
It's been a year since I've been hurt by my grandmother and lived alone.

80
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,740
I brought it from home.

81
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,740
Hey, why are you coming now?

82
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,740
Hey, why are you here?

83
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,740
Why are you here?

84
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,740
I'm here to see my grandmother.

85
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,740
Here you go.

86
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
Did you buy soju?

87
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,740
Hey, grandma's makgeolli.

88
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,740
You're really good at studying.

89
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,740
So I'm glad I brought it home.

90
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,740
Grandma, I bought you makgeolli that you like.

91
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,740
Here you go.

92
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:47,740
Have a drink.

93
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,740
What are you doing?

94
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,740
Come on.

95
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:56,740
Yeah.

96
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,740
Is it snowing?

97
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,740
It's snowing.

98
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Wow, awesome.

99
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Wow, it's really pretty.

100
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
Grandma, can you see?

101
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,740
Isn't it the first snow?

102
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,740
Yeah, it's the first snow.

103
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:20,740
It's so pretty.

104
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:36,740
Why, what, again?

105
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,740
In a gentle way?

106
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,740
Yeah, do whatever you want.

107
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,740
But finally, I have to say this.

108
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,740
I'm not drunk.

109
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,740
I didn't go to Seoul to drink yesterday.

110
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:59,740
I was in a hurry and I drank.

111
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,740
I don't know why I'm explaining this to you.

112
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:10,740
Anyway, no matter how crazy I am with alcohol, I'm not going to push it to someone and go to the capital to drink.

113
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,740
If you don't believe me, you can't help it.

114
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
I'll believe you.

115
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
What?

116
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,740
I'll believe you're a kid who does what he has to do.

117
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,740
All right.

118
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,740
Instead, let's test alcohol addiction.

119
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,740
What?

120
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,740
Alcohol addiction?

121
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,740
Look at him.

122
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,740
What kind of patient treats a healthy person?

123
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,740
Hey, that's what addicted people who can't stop drinking do.

124
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,740
You can stop it if you want to.

125
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,740
There's no reason to stop it now.

126
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Yeah.

127
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,740
If you think so, I'm not going to be a strong man.

128
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,740
Hey, let's ask him since we've talked.

129
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,740
Why are you drinking?

130
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,740
Did you have a time attack yesterday?

131
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,740
I'm afraid I'll get sick while drinking like you.

132
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,740
Or make someone else sick.

133
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Come early tomorrow.

134
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:28,740
There's a lot of work to do in the morning.

135
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:47,740
What kind of alcohol addiction am I?

136
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Yeah, what?

137
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Yeah, Choi Su-seok told me to ask you something.

138
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:02,740
It's a problem that only you can solve.

139
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,740
No, when do you want me to quit my job and enjoy my vacation?

140
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,740
What?

141
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,740
A problem that only I can solve?

142
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
You're looking for a new car because you're sad?

143
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,740
Hey, just say yes.

144
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
All right.

145
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
I'll hang up.

146
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,740
Wait a minute.

147
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,740
What?

148
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
Let's hear what you have to say.

149
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,740
What do you want me to ask?

150
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Oh, the electric car in-ears motor application I analyzed in the lab?

151
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Or the electric car maintenance manual I saw again?

152
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
Hey, just before.

153
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,740
Wait until I get a job.

154
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,740
I can't tell you anything right now.

155
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
Hey, hey, hey.

156
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,740
It's not like that.

157
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,740
The hand-made beer restaurant you booked last time.

158
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,740
They asked me where it was.

159
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,740
It's so nice.

160
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,740
There?

161
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,740
There.

162
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,740
You can't tell me there.

163
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
Tell me there's no problem.

164
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Tell me you can't tell me.

165
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
Okay, I got it.

166
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
Tell me you forgot.

167
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
Okay, okay, hang up.

168
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,740
Hey.

169
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,740
What about the company?

170
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,740
How's it going?

171
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,740
How's the replacement job that came to my place?

172
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Hey, you're on vacation because you can't.

173
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
Do you want to worry about the company?

174
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,740
The replacement job is doing well, and the company is doing well.

175
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:30,740
I'm on vacation, so don't mind it and enjoy your vacation.

176
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,740
Yeah.

177
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,740
You're going to work well without me, right?

178
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,740
Just do the job.

179
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Of course.

180
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,740
We're the best car company.

181
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,740
Hey, do you know how much the company has been recognized?

182
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,740
I gave you a long-term vacation on purpose because you worked for me for 10 years.

183
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,740
Okay, I'll call you soon.

184
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,740
Hang up.

185
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Geumju.

186
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
Yes?

187
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I think that guy is going to change his job.

188
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
Ask me what's good.

189
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
Yongdal.

190
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
Yeah.

191
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,740
You said you were tired when you were overpowered.

192
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:18,740
Our neighbors can't let Geumju rest.

193
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:28,740
I'm tired.

194
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,740
Isn't it a great thing?

195
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,740
It's a real masterpiece.

196
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Yeah, it's Bocheon's pride.

197
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
I want to eat it.

198
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,740
What?

199
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,740
You crazy bitch, what did you just say?

200
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
Oh, my God.

201
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,740
Why are you screaming?

202
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,740
Can't you say you want to eat that?

203
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,740
Huh?

204
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,740
I can't drink and I'm going to be stressed out.

205
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,740
I didn't know you were talking about that.

206
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,740
What were you looking at?

207
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,740
It's coming.

208
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
Are you crazy?

209
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Are you crazy?

210
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,740
What are you talking about?

211
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,740
Have fun.

212
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,740
I'm going to be stressed out because I can't drink at this house.

213
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,740
Hello?

214
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

215
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
I'm going to the taxi.

216
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Let's go, too.

217
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Sister, would you like to relieve your stress with Taekwondo?

218
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,740
Taekwondo?

219
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,740
They're just playing with the academy fee.

220
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,740
You're going to be in trouble.

221
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:48,740
Oh, yes.

222
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
It's free.

223
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
If you don't learn, it's a loss.

224
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,740
What?

225
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Two plus one.

226
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,740
We're having an event at Taekwondo.

227
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
Korea is two.

228
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:07,740
My sister is one.

229
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:20,740
I'm going to the taxi.

230
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,740
Do you really want to meet?

231
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,740
I'm a lawyer.

232
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,740
He's a great man because he looks like me.

233
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,740
You look like my grandmother?

234
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
I'm not.

235
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
I'm not.

236
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Why?

237
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,740
If you look like my grandmother, I won't listen to you.

238
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,740
When did I tell you to come to the health center early?

239
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,740
I've never been there.

240
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,740
Okay, I'll just go.

241
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
Really?

242
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,740
Keep your promise this time.

243
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,740
Think about it. Think about it.

244
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,740
Take care.

245
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
Goodbye.

246
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,740
I think your right wrist has been bad since the last TA.

247
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,740
I've made a list of the list.

248
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,740
Yes.

249
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,740
I have a suggestion.

250
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,740
Let's stop here.

251
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,740
It's lunchtime after the meal.

252
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,740
Shall we?

253
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,740
See you again after lunch.

254
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:42,740
Yes.

255
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,740
It's really a mystery.

256
00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Why is the famous doctor from Seoul doing this here?

257
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:08,740
I didn't come down like a star.

258
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,740
What are you doing here?

259
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:23,740
I came out to get some air.

260
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,740
Let's be careful.

261
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,740
Take care.

262
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
You be careful, too.

263
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,740
You're a little...

264
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:05,740
Kim Sala.

265
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,740
I'll pack up, so please organize the gold bar.

266
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
What?

267
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,740
I saw it all.

268
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,740
A skin-ship caused by a coincidental accident.

269
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,740
Where did you get the role of a female lead in a local drama?

270
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:26,740
This is a cliché.

271
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:36,740
This is a cliché.

272
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,740
I think you're misunderstanding something from last time.

273
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,740
I don't have feelings for Euijun.

274
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,740
That line is also a cliché among the clichés.

275
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
What are you talking about?

276
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Who are you talking to?

277
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,740
Eat and fall.

278
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Why?

279
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,740
I'm afraid I gave you a money bag.

280
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,740
What are you talking about?

281
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,740
I'm not that kind of a friend.

282
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,740
A cliché anti-conversation in a local drama?

283
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,740
Where did I start because I'm this kind of person?

284
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,740
But didn't you say you were going to have a fight last time?

285
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,740
There's a lot of conversation.

286
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
Why?

287
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
Sir.

288
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,740
Yes, let's go.

289
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,740
Welcome.

290
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
Let's go inside.

291
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,740
What's wrong with you?

292
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,740
Can't you do anything?

293
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,740
I'm grateful that I'm learning for free, but why do you have to take me like this?

294
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,740
Of course I have to take you.

295
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:47,740
You're my birth mother, too.

296
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
But how is it?

297
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
It relieves stress when you exercise, right?

298
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,740
You don't think about drinking at all, right?

299
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Huh?

300
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
Uh, yeah.

301
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Nice.

302
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,740
It's worth teaching Taekwondo to my sister.

303
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,740
Yeah, thank you.

304
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,740
Yes.

305
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,740
Beer is the best you can drink without sweating.

306
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,740
Huh?

307
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:17,740
I just want one glass.

308
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,740
That's amazing.

309
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,740
I want to go out.

310
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
I want to drink.

311
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,740
I want to go out.

312
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
I want to drink.

313
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,740
I want to go out.

314
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,740
I want to drink.

315
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
I want to go out.

316
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,740
I want to drink.

317
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740
I want to go out.

318
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,740
I'm jealous.

319
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
Why isn't anything happening?

320
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,740
Eolli is gone too.

321
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
I'm going to the bathroom.

322
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,740
Yes, I got a refund.

323
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,740
I canceled the pre-sale not long ago, so I can't refund it.

324
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,740
Yes, the golden week.

325
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,740
Yes, it's not regular, but the CEO told me to do it for you.

326
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740
Oh, really?

327
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Yes, I see. Thank you.

328
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,740
Awesome!

329
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,740
Let's get it!

330
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,740
As expected, God didn't abandon me.

331
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,740
Thank you so much. I'll do really well from now on.

332
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,740
What should I do?

333
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,740
Why am I doing this all of a sudden? How did I change this?

334
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,740
I thought it was money that wasn't there.

335
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
I thought it was money that wasn't there.

336
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
I thought it was money that was lost.

337
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,740
It was exactly the same. Why is my life suddenly so funny?

338
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,740
Look at this.

339
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Look at this.

340
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,740
If you had this, you would have been in a bad mood.

341
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,740
I should be congratulating you when this happens.

342
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,740
Did you think of alcohol again today?

343
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
Did you think of alcohol again today?

344
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,740
When you live, you think of alcohol for countless reasons.

345
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,740
Okay, okay, okay.

346
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,740
Is it because I have money?

347
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,740
It's getting better.

348
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,740
Is there water?

349
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
Because I feel good.

350
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,740
About seven times a week?

351
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,740
Because I feel depressed.

352
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,740
Because I'm always waiting.

353
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,740
All of these things are a good reason to drink alcohol.

354
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,740
I'm here.

355
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,740
I'm back.

356
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,740
How did you guys come in together?

357
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
We met in front of here.

358
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,740
Did you three come in without drinking?

359
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,740
We didn't drink.

360
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,740
If you could endure all the temptation.

361
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,740
Really?

362
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
Of course.

363
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
It was hard.

364
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,740
You too?

365
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
I really wanted to drink, but I couldn't.

366
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,740
You are not an alcoholic.

367
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,740
It's so nice to start the morning with a fresh feeling because you don't drink.

368
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,740
The next day after drinking, you only have to stretch out.

369
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,740
I know. It's definitely refreshing.

370
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Clear head.

371
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,740
Light body.

372
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
It's not even a pension.

373
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,740
I just feel like I'm going to live.

374
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,740
I'm going.

375
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,740
I'm going to work out and come back.

376
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,740
Finish it well.

377
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,740
I'm going.

378
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
See you later.

379
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,740
See you later.

380
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Dad.

381
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Dad, do you want to eat something?

382
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,740
Just say it.

383
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
I'll buy everything.

384
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Geumju.

385
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
I'm sorry I'm your dad.

386
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,740
What?

387
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,740
What's wrong with you?

388
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,740
What's wrong with you?

389
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,740
What's wrong?

390
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,740
What's wrong?

391
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,740
What?

392
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,740
I went to the farmhouse.

393
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,740
What?

394
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
I heard about Changgyu there.

395
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
Changgyu?

396
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,740
The guy who stabbed my back?

397
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,740
Yeah.

398
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,740
He's living well in the Philippines.

399
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,740
All these guys are studying abroad.

400
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,740
What?

401
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
Really?

402
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,740
If I hadn't used the deposit back then,

403
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,740
I wouldn't have had to find a new one.

404
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,740
I would have raised him doing everything you wanted.

405
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
I'm sorry.

406
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,740
I couldn't come.

407
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,740
What's wrong?

408
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,740
Dad is so great.

409
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,740
You raised him without making a big sound.

410
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,740
That's right.

411
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,740
You listened to everything we said.

412
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,740
I did everything for him.

413
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,740
That's the hardest part.

414
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,740
People say we're not loved or raised by others.

415
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,740
Right?

416
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,740
Of course.

417
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,740
Here, Dad.

418
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,740
Let's all drink and cheer up.

419
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
Why aren't you answering your phone?

420
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,740
Aren't you going to comfort me?

421
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
You said you did a good job.

422
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,740
Here.

423
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,740
Hurry up.

424
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,740
Here.

425
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
Okay.

426
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,740
How can you not drink today?

427
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,740
Drink it.

428
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,740
Drink it and shake it all off.

429
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
Make it strong.

430
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,740
Make it strong from the beginning to the end.

431
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,740
I'm going to make you a big hit today.

432
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,740
Dad.

433
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,740
I'm so happy that you're my dad.

434
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,740
Me too.

435
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,740
Dad is the best.

436
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,740
Let's drink.

437
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,740
What if you fall down in front of alcohol?

438
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
Let's go.

439
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,740
I'm going to make you a big hit today.

440
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,740
Drink it.

441
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,740
Drink it.

442
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,740
Drink it.

443
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,740
Let's drink until we're drunk.

444
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,740
Drink it all up.

445
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,740
Enjoying drunk mood.

446
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,740
It's a good day.

447
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,740
If you couldn't stand it on your own will.

448
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,740
How did you guys get in here?

449
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,740
We met in front of here.

450
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,740
Did you guys not drink?

451
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,740
Did you guys drink?

452
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,740
We didn't.

453
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,740
You are an alcoholic.

454
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,740
Our acting was perfect.

455
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,740
We have to get drunk to be perfect.

456
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:51,740
Hey, let's go and get some hangover soup.

457
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,740
Where are you going?

458
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,740
If we drink hangover soup in the morning, we'll get a lot of rumors.

459
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,740
I'll make ramen.

460
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,740
Hangover soup is on the bottom of the stream.

461
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,740
It takes less than an hour to get there.

462
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,740
Let's go.

463
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
I'll buy it.

464
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,740
No, no, no.

465
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,740
You bought it yesterday.

466
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,740
I'll buy it.

467
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,740
I'll buy it.

468
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,740
Did you get hit by a money-bomb?

469
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,740
Yeah, I got hit. Let's go.

470
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
We don't have time.

471
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,740
I'll go before mom comes.

472
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,740
Let's go.

473
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
Let's go.

474
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
Let's go.

475
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
What is it?

476
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,740
No one drank and came in?

477
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,740
Yeah, everyone didn't drink a drink.

478
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,740
Really?

479
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,740
Really?

480
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,740
Yeah, maybe it's because everyone's busy.

481
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,740
I woke up early in the morning and got to the pension.

482
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
Oh, my God.

483
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,740
You're worth it for your drinking skills.

484
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,740
Yeah, that's right.

485
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,740
You must be worth it.

486
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,740
We're going to run out of business because the store is down.

487
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,740
What?

488
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,740
You're losing VIPs who raise their prices

489
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:55,740
for drinks and drinks, right?

490
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
Don't do that.

491
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,740
What?

492
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,740
It's okay. I didn't say anything wrong.

493
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,740
How could you all lose your VIP customers

494
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
who raised their prices for drinks?

495
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,740
I feel good.

496
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,740
Instead, I'm not going to shoot a single episode today.

497
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Really?

498
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
Of course.

499
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,740
Thank you.

500
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,740
Look at everyone.

501
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,740
Let's clap for the first place.

502
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,740
Let's go.

503
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,740
Let's go.

504
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,740
Let's go.

505
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,740
Oh, my.

506
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,740
How did you know I was coming out like this and clap in advance?

507
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,740
Then, let's start the exciting Gocheon Life Sports Day today.

508
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,740
Music, cue.

509
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,740
One, two, three, four.

510
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,740
Left.

511
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,740
That's right.

512
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,740
One, two, three, four.

513
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,740
One, two, three, four.

514
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,740
Can I really play it?

515
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,740
Yes, I don't think there's going to be any problems.

516
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,740
Be careful.

517
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,740
It's a relief that you're this small.

518
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,740
What would you have done if you were hurt more?

519
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,740
So, this kind of trouble is a problem.

520
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,740
It's my fault.

521
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,740
I should have been a little more careful when I drove at night.

522
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,740
No, it's all because of Geumju, who is drunk.

523
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,740
I guess the rate of attendance for life sports is good today.

524
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:34,740
Yes, thanks to you, the health center reopened and the life sports class opened.

525
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,740
The villagers are so happy.

526
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
What should I do?

527
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,740
I'm tired because I'm popular now, but if I get more?

528
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,740
I'm going to be a doctor.

529
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,740
Nurse.

530
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
Yes.

531
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
Wait a minute.

532
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,740
Yeah, why?

533
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,740
Look, how is it?

534
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,740
Doesn't it look like a new car?

535
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,740
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,740
I wish it hadn't broken in the first place.

537
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,740
Yeah, but can't you say a word of good work?

538
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,740
I didn't think about anything else yesterday and hung in your car.

539
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,740
If it hadn't broken in the first place, there wouldn't have been anything to hang on to.

540
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,740
I heard from Youngwoong.

541
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,740
He told me that you covered everything that had nothing to do with the accident.

542
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,740
Thanks.

543
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,740
No, you still have to say that.

544
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,740
The repair is supposed to be done by the test driver.

545
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
You have to ride it.

546
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
Try it.

547
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,740
Wait, wait, wait.

548
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,740
I'll drive.

549
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
I loosened the cast.

550
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
Wow, already?

551
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,740
Are you okay?

552
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
Is everything okay?

553
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
Yeah.

554
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,740
In the first place.

555
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,740
If it hadn't broken in the first place, there wouldn't have been anything to do.

556
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
I know, I know.

557
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,740
I'll drive in the first place.

558
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,740
I can't overdo it yet.

559
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,740
Oh, it's our Lizzy's song.

560
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,740
To me, to you.

561
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,740
I want to get closer.

562
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,740
I want to get closer.

563
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,740
Go!

564
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,740
No, why are we here?

565
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,740
Huh?

566
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,740
The awards ceremony is an award ceremony, but since we've come this far, I'm going to see some Nepoly.

567
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
Let's go.

568
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
Why are you so excited?

569
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,740
Hey, look at this.

570
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,740
What are you doing?

571
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,740
You don't know if you see it?

572
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,740
You can't choose.

573
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,740
So why are you putting this on me?

574
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,740
Because it's your gift.

575
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,740
My gift?

576
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,740
Well, it's not too much of a burden.

577
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,740
I'm using my heart because I'm here to shop for mine.

578
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,740
I'm sorry if I was uncomfortable because of you.

579
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,740
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise and went to Seoul.

580
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,740
I can't live without debt, so I'm trying to make it work.

581
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,740
Make it work?

582
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,740
Hey, you came to the cost house and drove yourself.

583
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,740
Isn't that a waste of money?

584
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,740
I got free money.

585
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
What? Free money?

586
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,740
I was wondering why you were so excited, and it was because of you.

587
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,740
So what money did you get?

588
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,740
You don't need to know.

589
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,740
Just take it.

590
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,740
Oh, I don't need clothes.

591
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,740
Why?

592
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,740
I don't need it.

593
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,740
I don't know.

594
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,740
Just wear your clothes and shop and call me.

595
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,740
I'll be waiting.

596
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,740
Hey, hey!

597
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,740
Where did he go?

598
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,740
He didn't even answer my call.

599
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,740
Here.

600
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,740
Where did you write it?

601
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,740
What's all this?

602
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,740
This is for our Korean nephews.

603
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
My sister's.

604
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,740
Long sky.

605
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,740
And this is for my dad.

606
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,740
My mom's.

607
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,740
The color is so different.

608
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,740
And this is for our Daegeun's toy.

609
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,740
How is it?

610
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,740
Hey, you picked it up really well, right?

611
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,740
I'm excited.

612
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,740
Did you get a lottery?

613
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,740
Yeah, I got a lottery.

614
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,740
So you should have picked one when you were paying.

615
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,740
Isn't it too late now?

616
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,740
You can go back and pick one.

617
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,740
I'm hungry.

618
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,740
Let's go eat.

619
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,740
Okay.

620
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,740
I'll buy the food.

621
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,740
Oh!

622
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,740
What's wrong?

623
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,740
I think I overdid it.

624
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,740
Are you okay?

625
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
It's okay.

626
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,740
I'll go get some food.

627
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,740
Okay.

628
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,740
I'll go get some food.

629
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,740
Okay.

630
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,740
I'll go get some food.

631
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,740
Okay.

632
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,740
I'll go get some food.

633
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,740
Okay.

634
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,740
I'll go get some food.

635
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,740
Okay.

636
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,740
I'll go get some food.

637
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,740
Okay.

638
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,740
I'll go get some food.

639
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,740
Okay.

640
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,740
I'll go get some food.

641
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,740
Okay.

642
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,740
I'll go get some food.

643
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,740
Okay.

644
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,740
I'll go get some food.

645
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,740
Okay.

646
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,740
I'll go get some food.

647
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,740
Okay.

648
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,740
I'll go get some food.

649
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,740
Okay.

650
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,740
I'll go get some food.

651
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,740
Okay.

652
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,740
I'll go get some food.

653
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,740
Let's go.

654
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,740
Okay.

655
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,740
It's so pretty.

656
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:15,740
Thank you.

657
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,740
Thank you.

658
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,740
Thank you.

659
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:30,740
Oh, hey.

660
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:45,740
I can't.

661
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:55,740
I can't be friends with you because my heart keeps beating.

662
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:03,740
I like you.

663
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:13,740
I'm sorry.

664
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:43,740
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:13,740
I'm sorry.

666
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,740
Hey, you're going to drool.

667
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,740
Hey, I'm so cheesy.

668
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,740
Are you going to lose to my mom just by drinking one glass?

669
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,740
Yeah, I'm going to lose.

670
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,740
Oh, my God.

671
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,740
Yeah, you're hanging up.

672
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,740
How do you stop drinking?

673
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,740
Hey, answer me seriously.

674
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,740
Why did you hang up?

675
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,740
I won't tell anyone.

676
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,740
I'm honestly really, really curious.

677
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,740
Why are you really curious?

678
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,740
I'm more curious about that.

679
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,740
Hey, don't make me feel uncomfortable about the expensive food.

680
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,740
Why did you hang up?

681
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
Yeah, why would you buy this expensive food?

682
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,740
What kind of trouble did you get?

683
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,740
Did you really get hit by a lotto or a bank?

684
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,740
Oh, my God.

685
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,740
You look so lucky.

686
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,740
I think I'll feel relieved if I spend all the money I have.

687
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,740
So enjoy it and eat it all.

688
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
I want you to cooperate well.

689
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,740
So what money is it?

690
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,740
I need to know to cooperate with you.

691
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:27,740
Oh, my God.

692
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:33,740
I got a refund from the wedding hall that canceled my wedding.

693
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,740
What?

694
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,740
I thought I wouldn't get anything at all.

695
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,740
But I got it all back.

696
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,740
I'm so excited.

697
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,740
Isn't it amazing?

698
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,740
Are you that excited?

699
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,740
Of course.

700
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,740
I can't turn back the broken marriage anyway.

701
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,740
I feel like I'm getting a reward.

702
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:56,740
I'm going to use it all up and start with a new heart.

703
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,740
You look like you've been dumped.

704
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,740
What?

705
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:08,740
Is it that exciting to get that money?

706
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:19,740
Don't you think about the people who got hurt because of you?

707
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,740
I'll pay for this.

708
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,740
I can't cooperate with you flexing with that money.

709
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,740
Did I hurt you?

710
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:36,740
Did I hurt you?

711
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,740
I like you.

712
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,740
I don't remember.

713
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,740
I remember wearing a perm at the wedding hall, but after that, I'm completely out.

714
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,740
How did you remember me yesterday?

715
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,740
How can I bring it in?

716
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,740
I took your boyfriend.

717
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,740
Boyfriend?

718
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,740
Isn't it just dating?

719
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,740
What are you talking about?

720
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,740
He's just a friend.

721
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,740
I never wanted to go out with him.

722
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,740
It makes sense.

723
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,740
But you're taking care of him?

724
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:29,740
There's no one else who can take care of him.

725
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,740
Oh, his grandmother died and he said he was alone.

726
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,740
No matter how much I do, I'm still calm.

727
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:46,740
No one would misunderstand me.

728
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:56,740
I'm sorry.

729
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:06,740
Don't you think about the people who got hurt because of you?

730
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:19,740
Hey, I left the shopping place in your car yesterday, so I'll find it later.

731
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,740
Hey, Han Geunju!

732
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,740
Why?

733
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,740
What is it?

734
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:46,740
What happened?

735
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,740
What pants are 220,000 won?

736
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,740
Not even a dollar, in this kind of chocolate?

737
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,740
Did you take the wrong 22,000 won?

738
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,740
Oh, my God, I don't know that.

739
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,740
Wait a minute.

740
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:08,740
The pants with a mouth.

741
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:14,740
Yes, my daughter must have bought pants there around 9 p.m. last night.

742
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:20,740
I'm not sure if my daughter will buy such expensive pants.

743
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,740
What? Pants?

744
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:32,740
We're not pants, we're pants.

745
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,740
What?

746
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,740
Pants with a mouth.

747
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:45,740
I'm confused with pants and pants.

748
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,740
220,000 won at 9 p.m.?

749
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:54,740
I think he came with his father and sister.

750
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,740
Father and sister?

751
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,740
Three of them came and ran.

752
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,740
I don't know if it went well.

753
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,740
Are you sure? Are you sure?

754
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:14,740
No, I don't forget even the guests I've never seen.

755
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,740
Hello?

756
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,740
What time is it?

757
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,740
Turn it off.

758
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,740
Oh, my God.

759
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:30,740
What are you going to do? What are you going to do?

760
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,740
I'm going to fall in love with the alcohol I like.

761
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:38,740
I'll fall into your life.

762
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,740
Where are you going?

763
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,740
Mom, mom, mom.

764
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,740
Where are you going?

765
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,740
Don't think about seeing me in the future.

766
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,740
It's over now.

767
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,740
I'll send you the divorce papers, so stamp it.

768
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,740
You guys aren't my children anymore, so don't look for me until you die.

769
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,740
No, mom, mom.

770
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,740
I'm sorry.

771
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,740
I'm sorry.

772
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,740
This isn't it.

773
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,740
Mom.

774
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,740
Hey, you.

775
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,740
Just once.

776
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,740
Please forgive me just once.

777
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,740
I'll never do that again.

778
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:12,740
I'll do everything I ask of you.

779
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,740
Anything you ask?

780
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,740
Yeah, anything.

781
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,740
We were so sure of the crime that we were so broken.

782
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,740
Mom, mom, mom.

783
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,740
Mom, mom, mom.

784
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,740
Mom, mom, mom.

785
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,740
Mom, mom, mom.

786
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,740
Mom.

787
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,740
This isn't it.

788
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,740
Mom.

789
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,740
Mom, mom, mom.

790
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:40,740
The price was very high.

791
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,740
I was so sure.

792
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:04,740
Even if you beat thousands of enemies in war, you can't beat yourself.

793
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,740
This is what the law says.

794
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:11,740
You're here to overcome yourself who can't stand alcohol.

795
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:16,740
You need to be careful with your inner self and your own self-control.

796
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:22,740
Put all your cell phones in the basket.

797
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,740
I'm a twin mother, so I have to talk to the kids.

798
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,740
I'll give you an hour to talk to them.

799
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:35,740
What if something really urgent happens?

800
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:41,740
For those of you who are here, Friday is the most urgent thing.

801
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,740
Why do we have to be like this here?

802
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,740
What are we going to do?

803
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,740
Your mom wants to get divorced right away.

804
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,740
I can't live without your mom.

805
00:45:54,740 --> 00:46:00,740
Yeah, well, we can't live without mom either.

806
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,740
So let's stop being mean.

807
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,740
Let's show them that we can stop drinking if we want to.

808
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,740
It's a natural help.

809
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,740
Yeah, let's do it.

810
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,740
Yeah, let's do it.

811
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,740
Let's go.

812
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,740
Let's go.

813
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,740
Let's go.

814
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,740
The customer's phone is turned off.

815
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,740
Why is your phone off?

816
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,740
I can't see your nose.

817
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,740
Didn't you hear that?

818
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,740
You went into the temple.

819
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,740
Temple?

820
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,740
Why?

821
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,740
I heard that you cut your hair and got a middle-class.

822
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,740
It's not that.

823
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,740
What?

824
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,740
A Friday camp?

825
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,740
Yeah, Friday camp.

826
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,740
I heard that the three of you were drinking together last night.

827
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:47,740
I heard that the gold-dweller in Pocheon went to the temple and drank.

828
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,740
I didn't get it.

829
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,740
I'm sure the gold-dweller was in the temple.

830
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:57,740
He said he liked drinking and got married, but he couldn't get married to the gold-dweller.

831
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:03,740
I don't know why he's so drunk and crazy.

832
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:11,740
But you didn't know that and you were excited about the gold-dweller.

833
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,740
We didn't even get a drink yesterday.

834
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:20,740
I'm sure he hit the three of you so fast.

835
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,740
Brother.

836
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,740
You want me to break your disc?

837
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,740
You're not gone yet?

838
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,740
He was sleeping, but he woke up because of the lady.

839
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,740
He heard everything in one word.

840
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,740
I'm going to close the champagne lid again.

841
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,740
Give me the key.

842
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,740
What?

843
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,740
I'm going to open the champagne lid.

844
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,740
I'm going to open the champagne lid.

845
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,740
I'm going to open the champagne lid.

846
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,740
I'm going to open the champagne lid.

847
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,740
Give me the key.

848
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,740
Brother.

849
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,740
Did you see it?

850
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,740
Did you see it?

851
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,740
No, brother.

852
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,740
Are you a slave?

853
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,740
You're good at it.

854
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,740
Brother.

855
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:13,740
If I'm not healthy, it affects my health.

856
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:20,740
If you bury your sick body in the ground because of alcohol, the ground and trees will get sick.

857
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,740
The ground and trees will get sick.

858
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,740
I think about it slowly.

859
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,740
Why do I want to drink?

860
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,740
Why do I want to drink?

861
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:43,740
I'm sorry.

862
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,740
Hey, Geumju.

863
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,740
Dad, do you want to eat something?

864
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,740
Just say it.

865
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,740
I'll buy everything for you.

866
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,740
Geumju.

867
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,740
I'm sorry I'm your dad.

868
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,740
I have the courage to say what I couldn't say when I got drunk.

869
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,740
What?

870
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,740
Why aren't you breathing?

871
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,740
No, don't do this to me.

872
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,740
You can do it.

873
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,740
Let's go.

874
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,740
Go.

875
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,740
Follow me.

876
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,740
Why do I want to drink?

877
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,740
We're all shining like those many stars.

878
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:29,740
I can lose that light with alcohol, but why am I looking for alcohol?

879
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,740
I'm always waiting.

880
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,740
I'm at the dojang.

881
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:40,740
You can come anytime and exercise when you want to.

882
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:50,740
Alcohol is the best energy drink that makes you feel depressed.

883
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:51,740
Why are you doing this to me?

884
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,740
Don't be weak.

885
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,740
You can do it.

886
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,740
Let's go.

887
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:03,740
Yeah, let's go.

888
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:10,740
If you know why you want to drink, look at yourself now.

889
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,740
I'm a man of my word.

890
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,740
I'm a man of my word.

891
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,740
I'm a man of my word.

892
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:25,740
I'm a man of my word.

893
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:29,740
I'm a man of my word.

894
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:35,740
I'm a man of my word.

895
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,740
You're thinking about makgeolli, right?

896
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:38,740
No.

897
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,740
You're making me go crazy.

898
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,740
I'm doing it on purpose.

899
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,740
That's why I'm doing it.

900
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,740
You have to let go of this.

901
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,740
Let's show them that we can do it if we want to.

902
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:49,740
Let's go.

903
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,740
One, two, three.

904
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,740
Let's go.

905
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:59,740
Let's go.

906
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,740
Attention.

907
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:02,740
Salute.

908
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:07,740
Salute.

909
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,740
Don't run anymore.

910
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,740
Follow Sang-wook and be careful.

911
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,740
Take your bags.

912
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,740
Slowly, slowly.

913
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,740
Don't run.

914
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,740
Mom, I'm going to take this bag.

915
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,740
Wait a minute.

916
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,740
This way.

917
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,740
Don't you miss your mom?

918
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,740
We talk on the phone for an hour a day.

919
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,740
Yeah?

920
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:32,740
Mom, aren't you going to talk about the director?

921
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,740
You're asking me how I've been.

922
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,740
About the director.

923
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,740
Yeah, about me.

924
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:41,740
I've never done it before.

925
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:51,740
Yeah.

926
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,740
Hello?

927
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,740
Hello, Kwang-wook.

928
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,740
Oh, I miss you.

929
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,740
You're doing great.

930
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,740
What about my Nara?

931
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,740
I'll change it for you.

932
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,740
It's my mother.

933
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,740
Mom.

934
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,740
It's us, Nara.

935
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,740
Mom, I miss you.

936
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,740
Mom, when are you coming?

937
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,740
I miss you, my babies.

938
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:21,740
Mom, I'll go to the house after I see my grandparents and aunt.

939
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,740
Nara.

940
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,740
Nara, you can't do that to your brother.

941
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,740
Don't fight.

942
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:38,740
What's this?

943
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:48,740
Did you three have a fight last night?

944
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:53,740
I don't know what's wrong with Geumju.

945
00:52:53,740 --> 00:53:03,740
I don't know what's wrong with her.

946
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,740
Yes.

947
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,740
Yes?

948
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,740
I'll be right there.

949
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:16,740
Yes.

950
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,740
You'll be okay.

951
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:25,740
We'll be there soon.

952
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,740
Thanks to the emergency treatment, I don't think there's going to be any problems with the three of us.

953
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,740
That's a relief.

954
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,740
Good luck.

955
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:38,740
Yes.

956
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:39,740
Are you okay?

957
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,740
I'm fine.

958
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,740
What does our love do?

959
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,740
He's growing well.

960
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,740
What a relief.

961
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,740
Look at the pictures.

962
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,740
Love.

963
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,740
It's so pretty.

964
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,740
It's pretty, right?

965
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,740
Yes.

966
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,740
You did a great job.

967
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,740
You look like yourself.

968
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,740
I think this looks like you.

969
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:10,740
No, I look like you.

970
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:23,740
You know that, too.

971
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:27,740
I can't turn back the broken marriage anyway, and I feel like I'm being rewarded.

972
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,740
You look like you've been dumped.

973
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,740
What?

974
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:48,740
Don't you think about the people who were hurt because of you?

975
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,740
I'll go shopping later because I have an appointment.

976
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,740
Take it quickly.

977
00:54:53,740 --> 00:55:03,740
Do you have to be so cold?

978
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:33,740
What is this?

979
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:48,740
What is this?

980
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,740
I'm sorry, sir.

981
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:59,740
I changed my name, but I couldn't change my contact number, so I...

982
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:20,740
So that's why Kim Jeop is getting married right now at the time and place where he was supposed to marry me.

983
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:30,740
Then what's the money I got in return?

984
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:36,740
Is it that exciting to get that money?

985
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:40,740
I know.

986
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:44,740
It wasn't that exciting.

987
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:51,740
I didn't know he had money.

988
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,740
You gave me that?

989
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:05,740
You're such a fool.

990
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,740
The money is gone?

991
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:22,740
No, I looked everywhere, but it's not here.

992
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,740
It's about to start.

993
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:34,740
Where did you go?

994
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:54,740
I heard you were betrayed by your loved one and suffered enough to die.

995
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,740
That's why you came down here like you were running away.

996
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:10,740
I can see you pretending to be okay and not doing anything.

997
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:18,740
What are you doing here?

998
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:24,740
Hey.

999
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:34,740
What are you doing here?

1000
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,740
Hey.

1001
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:44,740
How did you get here?

1002
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,740
Let's go.

1003
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:53,740
Don't stay here like this.

1004
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:58,740
Okay.

1005
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:03,740
Let's go.

1006
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:13,740
I have to go.

1007
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,740
Hey, Geumju, are you okay?

1008
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,740
You're not hurt?

1009
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,740
Look somewhere.

1010
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,740
Huh?

1011
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:29,740
No.

1012
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:36,740
I'm not okay.

1013
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:43,740
I can't go.

1014
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:44,740
It hurts.

1015
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,740
It hurts so much.

1016
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:56,740
It hurts so much.

1017
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:26,740
I'm sorry.

1018
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:39,740
Then let me introduce myself.

1019
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:40,740
What?

1020
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,740
You said you had no intention of dating him.

1021
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,740
I like him.

1022
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,740
Why?

1023
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,740
Can't I?

1024
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,740
You can.

1025
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,740
You can.

1026
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,740
All right.

1027
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,740
Call Geumju.

1028
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,740
Now?

1029
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:56,740
Yeah, now.

1030
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,740
But I don't think Woojun will go on a blind date.

1031
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:01,740
I said I was going to focus on studying and not dating.

1032
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:06,740
And Woojun likes cute, IU-like styles.

1033
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,740
Miyeon doesn't have that style.

1034
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,740
And what else?

1035
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:15,740
And you don't like it?

1036
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:16,740
Huh?

1037
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,740
No, I can't.

1038
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,740
How can you not know your heart?

1039
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,740
You like him, right?

1040
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:25,740
You like Yeol.

1041
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:35,740
Correct!

1042
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:59,740
Do you mean all three of you were cheated?

1043
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:01,740
Hey, you there!

1044
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,740
Hey, then tell me.

1045
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,740
You don't even remember that?

1046
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:07,740
What about this card?

1047
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,740
Don't you feel anything when you see someone who's drunk?

1048
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:10,740
Get up!

1049
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,740
Get up!

1050
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:12,740
Get up, Woojun!

1051
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,740
Don't be sick for a long time.

1052
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,740
I want you to get well soon.

1053
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,740
What kind of wound did you get?

1054
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:19,740
Hey, Hong Geumju!

1055
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,740
Why are you sorry?

1056
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:31,740
I'm cutting you off.
