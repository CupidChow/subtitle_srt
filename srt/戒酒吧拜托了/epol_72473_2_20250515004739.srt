1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,100
This family was integrated into one big league once.

2
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:48,400
Joker came back to where he belongs, and broke his vocal chords every time.

3
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,120
He couldn't live without his grandpa.

4
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,120
Don't do it!

5
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
Let go!

6
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
Let go!

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
You got it?

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
You're gonna die.

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
I'll follow you.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,120
You can follow me.

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
Are you okay?

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
I'm not okay.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
I'm not okay!

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
Run!

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Run!

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Run!

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Run!

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
Run!

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Run!

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Run!

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
Run!

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Run!

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Run!

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Run!

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Run!

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
Run!

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Run!

28
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
Run!

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
Run!

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
Run!

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
Run!

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
Run!

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Run!

34
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
Run!

35
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Run!

36
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Run!

37
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
Run!

38
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
Run!

39
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:48,120
I thought I'd be much better than now if we met again.

40
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,120
I thought you'd be okay.

41
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:04,120
I'm stuck with him for no reason.

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Oh, my.

43
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Makgeolli.

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
You're a bad girl.

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,120
You're not my daughter, you're a bad girl.

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,120
There's no place where I can get a bottle of makgeolli.

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Is that your problem?

48
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
The kid didn't come home all night.

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Do you want me to take the curtains off?

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,120
I want to take it off at the mansion because I'm a bad girl.

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,120
If you don't come in, give me my phone.

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Why don't you answer the phone?

53
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Come in.

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
Geumju, you're still not home?

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
Mind your own business.

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,120
If you don't come in, you'll die somewhere.

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Yes.

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Geumju is going to die.

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Geumju?

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Geumju!

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:36,120
What should I do?

62
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
So what happened was...

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,120
Last night.

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,120
I'm sure he was standing there.

65
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:56,120
I can tell it was Geumju.

66
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Come here.

67
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
What?

68
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Did you get paid by your parents?

69
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
You're not my son.

70
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Why are you...

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Stop it.

72
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:20,120
You bastard.

73
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,120
I'm sure he fell into the water.

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,120
I should have gone to the house when I heard the sound.

75
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,120
I caught him.

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,120
Geumju, I'm sorry.

77
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,120
What happened?

79
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,120
What happened, you bastard?

80
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,120
Geumju, you really need to quit drinking.

81
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,120
Don't talk nonsense and answer me.

82
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Who's talking?

83
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Don't you remember yesterday?

84
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Oh, my God.

85
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
You're like a dog poop.

86
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
What a shitty day.

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Let's see if I can win.

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:35,120
What's wrong with you?

89
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,120
What's wrong with you?

90
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:51,120
I'm going to kill you.

91
00:05:51,120 --> 00:06:01,120
I'm going to kill you.

92
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:11,120
I thought I was going to die.

93
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Excuse me.

94
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Are you all right?

95
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Hey, Geumju.

96
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Hey, Geumju.

97
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Hey, wake up.

98
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Are you all right?

99
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Hey, wake up.

100
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Oh, my God.

101
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Oh, my God.

102
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
What?

103
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
You can't go in the house.

104
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
You can't go in the house.

105
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Oh, my God.

106
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
No, no.

107
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
You can't go in the house.

108
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
This isn't your house.

109
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Oh, my God.

110
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
What?

111
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
You can't go in the house.

112
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Don't go, don't go.

113
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Someone just sprinkled makgeolli on me.

114
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Who is it?

115
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Who is it?

116
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
Hey, hey, hey.

117
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Oh, my God.

118
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
What happened to the car?

120
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Youngwoong dragged it to the wreck.

121
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Don't worry.

122
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
I'll fix it for you.

123
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
As you know, I'm a competent mechanic.

124
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Then what about this?

125
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
What are you going to do about this?

126
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
You don't even look like you can drive.

127
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
I have to go to Wangjin right now.

128
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
Hey, you're going to Wangjin?

129
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
That's great.

130
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Hey, forget it.

131
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,120
I'll pay the driver's fee for the car rental fee.

132
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
What?

133
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
Why?

134
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
If you feel pressured, you can drive your car.

135
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
What are you saying?

136
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
What's the pressure?

137
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,120
So, I spent my money on the cost of the fee.

138
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,120
I don't want to spend my precious time driving your driver's seat.

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Yeah, then you can do that.

140
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Yeah, Sunwoo.

141
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,120
What?

142
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Hey, Han Geumju.

143
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Why?

144
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
What?

145
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:47,120
I heard you fell into the lake and died.

146
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
Geumju.

147
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,120
Geumju.

148
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Geumju.

149
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Oh, my.

150
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Mom.

151
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Dad.

152
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Was he alive?

153
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
He was alive, of course.

154
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,120
Oh, my God.

155
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Oh, my God.

156
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
What's this?

157
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Stop!

158
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
I found the victim!

159
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Yes, he's alive.

160
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
But...

161
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
He's alive.

162
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,120
But where did he appear last night?

163
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
What?

164
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Where was he?

165
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Is that important?

166
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,120
What's important is that I'm alive here, right?

167
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Right?

168
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,120
Oh, we've gathered a lot.

169
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Right?

170
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Where are you going?

171
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
You live.

172
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
I'm going to die.

173
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
Oh, my God.

174
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
What's wrong with you?

175
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Oh, my God.

176
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
I'm going to die.

177
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
I'm going to die.

178
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
I'm going to die.

179
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
Let go of me.

180
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Let go of me.

181
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Oh, my God.

182
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Oh, my God.

183
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Oh, my God.

184
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
I'm going to die.

185
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
I'm going to die.

186
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Oh, my God.

187
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
I'm going to die.

188
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
I'm going to die.

189
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Oh, my God.

190
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Oh, my God.

191
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Oh, my God.

192
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Oh, my God.

193
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Oh, my God.

194
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Oh, my God.

195
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Oh, my God.

196
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Oh, my God.

197
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Oh, my God.

198
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Oh, my God.

199
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Oh, my God.

200
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Stop, stop, stop.

201
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Hey, what are you doing?

202
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
I don't have to do this.

203
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
No, I can go to work alone.

204
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
My friend got hurt.

205
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
How come you're not coming?

206
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Anyway, Han Geumju.

207
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Really.

208
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Oh, my.

209
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Hey, forget it.

210
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Tell Young-woong not to go anywhere.

211
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
He's a waste of energy.

212
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Okay, be careful.

213
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Check it out.

214
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,120
But Geum-ju really needs to quit drinking.

215
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
I'll go down after I get drunk and go home and look at my mom.

216
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Now I'm drunk and I'm breaking your leg.

217
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Didn't you?

218
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Oh, my.

219
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,120
What are you talking about?

220
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,120
It's a news.

221
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Geum-ju got drunk and broke her leg.

222
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:47,120
I became a nuclear insider in Bocheon and was swept away by a nuclear storm.

223
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I exchanged the bumper and the fender was gold.

224
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
The wire broke when I was going to sell it.

225
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
What should I do? I'm drunk.

226
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,120
How can I hurt Eui-jun?

227
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
I think I should look at the radiator.

228
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,120
What you need to look at is your drinking habits.

229
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,120
How can I break Eui-jun's leg?

230
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Oh, I'm shocked. The本 네트 is a little off.

231
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Hey, you're really off. What are you going to do with those people in Bocheon?

232
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Stop overreacting.

233
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Did I break a Bocheon bridge?

234
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
Why would I be off with the people in Bocheon?

235
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Then, after a year, Wang Ri-man made a precious doctor in our neighborhood, Seon-eun, and you think you're safe?

236
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Seon-eun?

237
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Is it a teacher?

238
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
It's a teacher.

239
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
If you're sick, please let me get better.

240
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
The first person to go and empty it is him.

241
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Then you touched someone you shouldn't touch.

242
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Eui-jun is a man of divine nature in Bocheon.

243
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Yes, Geum-ju, you'll have a hard time living in Bocheon for a while.

244
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,120
So please be strong.

245
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,120
It's hard to live anywhere now.

246
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Expected storage cost.

247
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Total 2.8 million won plus alpha.

248
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
What?

249
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
Here.

250
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,120
I paid off the public fee because you were fixed.

251
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
You're going to take all this?

252
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Yes, we take it like this.

253
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Wow, that couple fraud is really...

254
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
What?

255
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,120
You said you didn't want to be a driver at the beginning of your precious time.

256
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,120
No, well, I heard that there is no other way than to volunteer.

257
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,120
I just want to do something good.

258
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Grandma, please have a cup of water.

259
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,120
How did you make my doctor's leg like that?

260
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,120
So I lost my life, right?

261
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
You have a little blood pressure today.

262
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,120
And you have the energy to buy a body, so you can't work today.

263
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
What? I can't.

264
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
I have to do something today.

265
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Is there anyone who can do it for me?

266
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Me?

267
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,120
No, no. I can't do anything with this leg.

268
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Of course. I didn't want to make you do it.

269
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Right?

270
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
Instead,

271
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
that friend will do it.

272
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,120
That friend is here to do something good today.

273
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
What?

274
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
What is it?

276
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
I bought a horse.

277
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
It's better to buy one.

278
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Miss.

279
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Why?

280
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
Please help me with this.

281
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
Oh, it's too much.

282
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Oh, my God.

283
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
I can't do it anymore.

284
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
What are you doing?

285
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
I'm waiting for my turn.

286
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Do you really have a pack of packers?

287
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Yes.

288
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
It's small, but it'll be helpful.

289
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Don't be so rude. Get up.

290
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
I'm not rude.

291
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Where's Wang Jin-hee?

292
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Oh, my God.

293
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
I love it.

294
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
It's so refreshing and proud.

295
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
I love it.

296
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
Hey.

297
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
You're so considerate of me.

298
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Hey, hey.

299
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Tell me the truth.

300
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Is this really what you used to do?

301
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,120
You're taking revenge on me for breaking your car and your leg, right?

302
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
Revenge?

303
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
If you wanted to take revenge, you would have taken legal action.

304
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
You're not doing anything wrong.

305
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
I know.

306
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,120
I'm old enough to learn how to take responsibility for what you do.

307
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
Yes, yes.

308
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
Thank you very much.

309
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
I didn't know what you meant.

310
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,120
The whole neighborhood just hates you.

311
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Did you come down here to do this?

312
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
Are you going to be hated by the neighborhood like this?

313
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
I'm not doing it.

314
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,120
I'm not going to talk to you about this kind of trip.

315
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Hey.

316
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,120
What the hell is that?

317
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Why is a famous doctor in Seoul doing this?

318
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Why is a famous big company lawyer doing this here?

319
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Let's just stop caring about each other's private lives.

320
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Hey, that's what I want to talk about.

321
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Mr. D?

322
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
D?

323
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Why is a famous big company lawyer doing this here?

324
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
No way.

325
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
I thought you would be the one.

326
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Hey, isn't this wrong?

327
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
You work overtime every day.

328
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
You didn't even take a vacation that everyone else does.

329
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
You did this like a villain.

330
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,120
How could you leave someone else who even took a photo of you in the gym?

331
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Hey, hey, hey.

332
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Geumju was the first one to get promoted among her colleagues.

333
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,120
She was the first female official to get promoted.

334
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,120
There were so many rumors about her being a reverse-discriminationist.

335
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,120
But she got promoted first this time.

336
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,120
That sound will come out again.

337
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
I heard she's getting married.

338
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
What?

339
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,120
She's pregnant, giving birth, taking care of her child, and she's going to have a lot of blanks.

340
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,120
I think she thinks there's a risk of leaving her to the middle class.

341
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
That's what the rumor says.

342
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
How can you say that?

343
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
I'm about to cry.

344
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
Let's just move on.

345
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,120
No, it's okay.

346
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,120
I can't go any further because it's too late.

347
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,120
I don't want to go to this company anymore because of this unfair treatment.

348
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
So did you write a resignation letter?

349
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,120
No, I took a vacation.

350
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Vacation?

351
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Come to think of it, it's more self-righteous to quit like this.

352
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,120
The golden week that was so hard to endure, huh?

353
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,120
You're going to fall out of your own way after receiving such unfair treatment?

354
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Who wants to?

355
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Since it's like this, I've used up all the vacation I couldn't use, I recharged, and they felt my absence.

356
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Let's put an end to this.

357
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
I'm done.

358
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Look, now.

359
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,120
If I go to the welfare center, I'll definitely get my place back.

360
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Wow, you're like a golden week.

361
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,120
If you still can't stand it, you can hit your pride and neck anytime.

362
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,120
I'll feed you.

363
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Okay?

364
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Bad guy.

365
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:17,120
You should at least talk.

366
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Here.

367
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
Let's take a picture of this.

368
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Brother, this is a bit too much.

369
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,120
Thank you.

370
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,120
You were surprised a lot the other day, right?

371
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
I'm so sorry for misunderstanding.

372
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
It's okay.

373
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,120
But it's a relief that you're alive.

374
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
That's right.

375
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Right?

376
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
That's a relief.

377
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,120
That's a relief.

378
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Our precious doctor.

379
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Is it okay if Euijun's leg is untreated?

380
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,120
I'm really going to die.

381
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
I'm afraid Euijun will go back to Seoul.

382
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,120
Brother, I'm really going to rent a house this time.

383
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Otherwise, I won't stay still.

384
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,120
I'm not going to stay still?

385
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,120
I'm not going to let my son stay still?

386
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,120
I'm afraid the doctor in our town will disappear again.

387
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Don't worry about the gold.

388
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,120
You said you were the one who sold makgeolli to him.

389
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,120
That's not what I sold.

390
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,120
How scared the gold was.

391
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
I'm not going to let my brother go.

392
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
If he gets drunk, he'll be in front of me.

393
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Get out of here.

394
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Listen to me carefully from now on.

395
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,120
It's also publicized in the group chat room of the ancient bocheon.

396
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,120
From today on, the man who sells alcohol to my family is the end of the deal with me.

397
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Don't think about going to the gold market with me.

398
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,120
Okay?

399
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
No, I don't know.

400
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Why is the fire going to us?

401
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
I'm going crazy that I can't drink at home.

402
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Does the gold drinker even go to the neighborhood?

403
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Does it make sense?

404
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Why doesn't it make sense?

405
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:06,120
You were married to a man you hadn't even seen for a month after drinking and causing trouble.

406
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
You got divorced.

407
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Then you should have been more careful.

408
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,120
You got your kids drunk and had a drink.

409
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Is that what a mother should do?

410
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,120
I drank to live.

411
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,120
It was just alcohol that made the twins do it and comforted the tired woman.

412
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,120
That's why I brought you here so you don't have to do it.

413
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
So stop drinking.

414
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Then why me?

415
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Why?

416
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Did you forget that you drank with the carter you gave to your father and threw it away because of your friend?

417
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Did you forget that you almost hit me on the street?

418
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,120
Listen carefully.

419
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,120
He came here to give me a drink to be honest.

420
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Is that my fault or is it his?

421
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
It's his fault.

422
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,120
Then whose fault is this?

423
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Daebak's plan?

424
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,120
He grew up in a spicy soup shop to make up for the fire he threw away.

425
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
He ruined it by drinking more than the customer.

426
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,120
I drank a lot.

427
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,120
But why are you saying this?

428
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,120
I'm telling you one last time.

429
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Just drink on the floor.

430
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,120
You'll be ruined.

431
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
I'm sick of it.

432
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
I thought you'd be ruined.

433
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,120
My mom, Kim Gwang-ok's wife, was arrested for the gold bar.

434
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,120
I won't sell you alcohol.

435
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
I won't sell you.

436
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
What?

437
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm sorry.

438
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
You should have shown your power.

439
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
No!

440
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,120
I won't sell you alcohol.

441
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Here.

442
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,120
I've been choked.

443
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,120
How many people can sell their food in this alley?

444
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,120
This is a matter of survival.

445
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Did you make me, who is so important, a ghost who fell into the lake?

446
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
I'm sorry.

447
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,120
If you're sorry, give me a beer.

448
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,120
But I'll forgive you.

449
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,120
I'm here to check the alcohol.

450
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Really?

451
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
100 million won?

452
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
Yes, 100 million won.

453
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Where did you get it?

454
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:40,120
Do you need anything else?

455
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
No, I'm done.

456
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
No.

457
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
You have to drink all the bone broth.

458
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,120
That's how you get rid of your stomach.

459
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,120
You're drinking again after you've been drinking.

460
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:02,120
Wow, that's great.

461
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Wow.

462
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Wow.

463
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Is this something to be so careless about?

464
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,120
You're so mean.

465
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Hey, you said you were going to eat at home.

466
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,120
I guess you were going to do something about it.

467
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Nam Hee-sung, you said you were going to mind your private life.

468
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
But this isn't private life.

469
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
This is neighborhood life.

470
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,120
Everyone's working together to help you.

471
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Geumju, let's do it.

472
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
Let's do some work.

473
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,120
What?

474
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,120
What are you talking about?

475
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
You're more drunk than me.

476
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
You drink, too.

477
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Stop drinking.

478
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,120
I quit drinking, Yu Jun-hee.

479
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
What?

480
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,120
I heard you can't even drink a drop.

481
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,120
That makes no sense.

482
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work.

483
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Are you okay?

484
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
I'm fine.

485
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
I'm fine.

486
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:27,120
He's the best of the best.

487
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
But what?

488
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
He quit drinking?

489
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
He did?

490
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,120
I told you so.

491
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,120
I was surprised that he was doing all kinds of things while going to Wangjin.

492
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Why?

493
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Why is he living like that?

494
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
I was curious, so I asked.

495
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Why did you come down here?

496
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
He's from Myeongmun University.

497
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,120
He's the best doctor in Korea.

498
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,120
There are a lot of doctors like that in Seoul.

499
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Not here.

500
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Isn't it really cool?

501
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
Huh?

502
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,120
A great mind to spread this art where there are not enough medical staff.

503
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,120
They say that alcohol is cut for health, but it's all about stamina to go to Wangjin, right?

504
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,120
So I came down to live like a shu bai.

505
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
It's a different level from why you came down, right?

506
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
What?

507
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,120
I'm going to apply for it.

508
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
What do you want me to apply for?

509
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Get a serious consultation from Dr. Oh, a gold-plated bastard like a gold-plated person.

510
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,120
But can I go out as a gold-plated person at the age of going to school?

511
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
Oh, gold-plated person, no.

512
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
You can't hit your friend.

513
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Stop it.

514
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:38,120
I heard something different.

515
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
No, no, no.

516
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
Do it with something I didn't hear.

517
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
What do you mean you didn't hear?

518
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
You said it so loudly.

519
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
What is it?

520
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:50,120
No, our center's regular customer sent me this because his nephew was a college student.

521
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Let's see.

522
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Seoyeon Medical Community Graduation Lounge?

523
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Does anyone know the news of the death of the student who failed to graduate from high school?

524
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,120
A student who ran a solid road with excellent skills and was unfairly pushed out of the track of the Seoyeon Medical School professor.

525
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,120
A student who was abandoned because he was cheated on by a person who promised to marry.

526
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,120
He quit the hospital and fell into alcohol for a while and lived like a loser.

527
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Does anyone know the news these days?

528
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,120
There are still a lot of patients who want his treatment, but it's a pity.

529
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,120
I'm sorry, but who is the death of Si-yong?

530
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
Seo.

531
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Eui.

532
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
Jun.

533
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,120
When did I ever do something like this?

534
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
I'm the only one who wants it?

535
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
It's too dramatic.

536
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
That's why I told you to do something I didn't hear.

537
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
It's ridiculous, right?

538
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Why can't it make sense?

539
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Huh?

540
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,120
It's true that something worse than a drama happens.

541
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:57,120
Why are you suddenly so immersed?

542
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Hey, Seo Jun.

543
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Come here.

544
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
Why are you so slow today?

545
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Why?

546
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,120
What is it?

547
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,120
How is it?

548
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
I'm sorry.

549
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
I'm sorry.

550
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
I'm sorry.

551
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
I'm sorry.

552
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
I'm sorry.

553
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
I'm sorry.

554
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
How is it?

555
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
Isn't it cool?

556
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Wow.

557
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,120
You're all gone, right?

558
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Huh?

559
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,120
I've been depressed since my grandmother died, so I brought you here to cheer you up.

560
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:57,120
When I'm upset, it's weird that I'm comforted when I come here.

561
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
This is a healing spot that only I know.

562
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
I'm only revealing it to you.

563
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:09,120
If you're having a hard time, come again.

564
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:19,120
Isn't it amazing?

565
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Wow.

566
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,120
Here you go.

567
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Wow.

568
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Why are you eating it?

569
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
My big brother sent me to the female dormitory.

570
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
How is it?

571
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
It's delicious, right?

572
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
That's why I contacted you.

573
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,120
Why are we the only ones eating this precious thing?

574
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:09,120
Have a drink.

575
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
It's done.

576
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:19,120
No matter how precious it is, it tastes better with alcohol.

577
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
I can't drink, either.

578
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Enjoy your meal.

579
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
Oh, my God.

580
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Sit down.

581
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Sit down.

582
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Why can't I drink?

583
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,120
If you close your eyes, you'll see the top of the mountain.

584
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
What?

585
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Here you go.

586
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Enjoy your meal.

587
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
I'm sorry.

589
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
I'm sorry.

590
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
I'm sorry.

591
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
I'm sorry.

592
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
I'm sorry.

593
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
I'm sorry.

594
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,120
I'm sorry.

595
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
I'm sorry.

596
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
I'm sorry.

597
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Enjoy your meal.

598
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
Have a drink.

599
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,120
Even if you have a grudge against your wife,

600
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,120
I can't give up on drinking with you.

601
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
We work every night.

602
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
We live a simple life.

603
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Why would I give up on this?

604
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Huh?

605
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:20,120
You're the only ones.

606
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
It's sweet.

607
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
It's sweet, right?

608
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:39,120
It's sweet.

609
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:46,120
It's sweet.

610
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,120
But it tastes like...

611
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,120
It tastes like water.

612
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Oh, that's it?

613
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,120
That's it.

614
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,120
It's water.

615
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
That's right.

616
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
Oh, my God.

617
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
I'm fooled.

618
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
I'm fooled.

619
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,120
This is a cooking show.

620
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Are you crazy?

621
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Let's not do this.

622
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
It's fun.

623
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,120
I gave up on drinking with you.

624
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
I can't give up on drinking with you.

625
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Why would I give up on this?

626
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Come here, you bastard.

627
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
I'm dead.

628
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,120
Come here, you bastard.

629
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,120
I'll catch you.

630
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,120
I'll catch you.

631
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
I'm scared.

632
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,120
Where are you running away?

633
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
Let's take a bath.

634
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
Where are you running away?

635
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
Where are you running away?

636
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
What about that?

637
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
I caught you.

638
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Let's go.

639
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,120
You bastard.

640
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:55,120
I tried.

641
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:05,120
I'm going to die.

642
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
What are you doing here?

643
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,120
Yeah.

644
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,120
I just can't sleep.

645
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
You want a beer, don't you?

646
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
No, a soju.

647
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:28,120
No, it's a hard, normal drink at night.

648
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,120
I don't want to think about drinking.

649
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:39,120
I want to empty my head.

650
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
I totally agree.

651
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,120
I think it's a bad idea to quit drinking without drinking.

652
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,120
I think we should find another way.

653
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Right?

654
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,120
Have you heard of this?

655
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,120
It's not waiting for the typhoon to pass.

656
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:14,120
It's learning how to dance in the rain.

657
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:39,120
I'm crazy.

658
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,120
I'm crazy because I can't drink.

659
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,120
I think I'm going crazy.

660
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,120
I'm going crazy.

661
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,120
I'm going crazy.

662
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,120
I'm going crazy.

663
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,120
I think I'm going crazy.

664
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,120
I think I'm going crazy.

665
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:09,120
I think I'm going crazy.

666
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,120
A person who promised to marry in a wrong way.

667
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,120
Oh, my God.

668
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,120
So what?

669
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
It's okay.

670
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,120
He's already been single for 10 years.

671
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:28,120
Mind your own business.

672
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,120
What's all this?

673
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
What's that?

674
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
It's a lunch box.

675
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,120
You've been a meat lover for a long time.

676
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
You've been a meat lover.

677
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,120
Eat a lot.

678
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Why are you suddenly...

679
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,120
There's a sandwich I bought in line.

680
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,120
I followed Wangjin and I thought I should eat a lot of things and replenish my stamina.

681
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,120
I wanted to feed him something he liked.

682
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,120
Here, try it.

683
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Did you spit this out?

684
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,120
No, was there a shit on it?

685
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
What?

686
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,120
I told you to do some work.

687
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,120
No, I mean...

688
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Hurry up and eat.

689
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
No, it's okay.

690
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,120
Just eat it all.

691
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,120
Eat a lot.

692
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:19,120
Chew it up.

693
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:29,120
Even if you try to overcome it...

694
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:44,120
I know better than anyone how hard it is.

695
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:54,120
I wish I had someone to take care of me.

696
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,120
Hey, you know that, right?

697
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Steve Jobs was kicked out of the company.

698
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,120
How much money did he get?

699
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,120
I really wanted to die.

700
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,120
But if Jobs sat there and wrote,

701
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,120
would this smartphone that changed the paradigm of mankind have come out in this world?

702
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
I think so.

703
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:19,120
If anyone could one day sell their value and give up like Jobs.

704
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Why are you suddenly Jobs?

705
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,120
You're just a Jobs.

706
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,120
I've learned to look good as a hobby.

707
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,120
You just look at it.

708
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,120
You just take a KTX and just look at it.

709
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,120
You have a lot more luck on your face than Jobs.

710
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:40,120
Hey, your nostrils are really stretched forward.

711
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
Oh, I've never seen a nostril like this.

712
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
Hey, look.

713
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:49,120
Hey, you're just going to stretch out without any blockage.

714
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
Hey.

715
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,120
Hey.

716
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,120
You have a girl.

717
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Oh, really.

718
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,120
But the girl is a real country.

719
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:02,120
She's a really lucky girl who really recognizes your value.

720
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,120
It's going to show up soon.

721
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,120
Soon.

722
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,120
You're not.

723
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,120
I.

724
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,120
I.

725
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,120
You.

726
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,120
Did you drink all day?

727
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Huh?

728
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
No.

729
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
No, I'm not.

730
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,120
No, I'm not.

731
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,120
Why are you so random?

732
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,120
It's a cheer.

733
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,120
You can do it.

734
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,120
Cheer up!

735
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,120
Cheer up.

736
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,120
Hey, you got a call.

737
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,120
I think I need to answer this.

738
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:47,120
I got a call.

739
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Yes, hello?

740
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:04,120
As I said last time, I'm grateful for the offer, but I don't plan on working in Seoul.

741
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:10,120
No, I won't change even if you come all the way here.

742
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:20,120
I'm sorry.

743
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:30,120
Hey!

744
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:40,120
Wow.

745
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Did you see that?

746
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
I'm a fighter.

747
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Yes, but?

748
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
I'm warning you.

749
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,120
If you're going to be a pain in the ass to my teacher, you should give up on the love.

750
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,120
If you get caught, you'll be killed.

751
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
Okay?

752
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,120
What?

753
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Yes, Mr. Lee Dan.

754
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:10,120
Why aren't you on the news these days?

755
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:16,120
Wow, I'm the one who's really out of the ordinary.

756
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,120
Me.

757
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,120
What am I doing while being misunderstood by him?

758
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,120
You can't do anything else.

759
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,120
You really mind?

760
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,120
You go up to Seoul.

761
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,120
I heard you had something to say, but why are you saying it all of a sudden?

762
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,120
I heard you talking on the phone earlier.

763
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
Refusing the scout offer.

764
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
Don't do that.

765
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,120
Go to a big hospital and take care of the patients who are waiting for your treatment.

766
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,120
Did you forget?

767
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,120
We're going to stop being interested in private life.

768
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
I want to, too, but I can't.

769
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:49,120
That's why I'm saying it.

770
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,120
What are you talking about?

771
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,120
Haejun, I know everything.

772
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,120
You can't do whatever you want.

773
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,120
You were betrayed by your loved one and you suffered so much that you died.

774
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,120
That's why you came down here like you were running away.

775
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
What?

776
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:14,120
I can see you pretending to be okay, not to be okay, and pretending to be doing well.

777
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,120
I didn't talk about the magazine earlier.

778
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,120
Do you know how the magazine I made was chased out of the company?

779
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,120
The movie company invested a lot in Toy Story.

780
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,120
You can do that, too.

781
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,120
You can be the main character of such a great story.

782
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
Go to Seoul.

783
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,120
I'll find you this person.

784
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
It's not Euijun.

785
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,120
See, it's not Euijun.

786
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
You didn't tell Euijun, did you?

787
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,120
You didn't tell Euijun, did you?

788
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Geumju, Geumju.

789
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,120
Go and show your skills properly.

790
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,120
That's how you get revenge on that woman who abandoned you.

791
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,120
Hey, don't you think your skills are a waste?

792
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Why do you have to hide like a perpetrator?

793
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:57,120
Hey, what the hell are you talking about?

794
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Look, I'm not the only one who's sorry.

795
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,120
I'll show you how many people are rooting for you.

796
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
What is this?

797
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,120
What is Soju?

798
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,120
Ready for the first round of the competition.

799
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,120
One, two.

800
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,120
One, two.

801
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,120
One, two.

802
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,120
Hey, applause.

803
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,120
Ready for the first round of the competition.

804
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Oh, my.

805
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,120
It's not even a Korean name.

806
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,120
It's a Korean name.

807
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,120
Oh, my.

808
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,120
It's not even a Korean name.

809
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,120
Why would you say Geumju?

810
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,120
What kind of life is this?

811
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,120
I've been nagging all day,

812
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,120
and I've been drinking all day.

813
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,120
I'm the only one who's not happy.

814
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,120
I know.

815
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:01,120
It's just a fatigue recovery for a child like us.

816
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,120
How am I going to live now?

817
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
What do you mean?

818
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,120
Just drink coffee.

819
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,120
Oh, my.

820
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
Don't cry.

821
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,120
Good job, kids.

822
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,120
Did you have fun?

823
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,120
Yeah.

824
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,120
What did you learn?

825
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,120
Email.

826
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,120
What are you doing?

827
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,120
Huh?

828
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,120
Hey.

829
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,120
Huh?

830
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,120
Everyone, just leave Hwayoung alone and get in the car.

831
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,120
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

832
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,120
Let's go to Korea with Mom.

833
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,120
Yes, I'll take you.

834
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Get in together.

835
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,120
No, I have somewhere to go with the kids.

836
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,120
Where?

837
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:42,120
You have to get the shot.

838
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:48,120
Oh, shot.

839
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,120
I'll go play in the car.

840
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,120
Me too.

841
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,120
No, you have to go.

842
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,120
No, no, no, no.

843
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,120
What's wrong with you guys?

844
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,120
I'm going.

845
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,120
Are you sure you're going?

846
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,120
I'm going.

847
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,120
Let's go.

848
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
Okay.

849
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,120
Narae, Mom's hand.

850
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
I'll go.

851
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,120
I'll go first.

852
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,120
Yeah.

853
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,120
Let's go.

854
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,120
Let's go.

855
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,120
Get in.

856
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Get in.

857
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,120
Get in and go.

858
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,120
I was an idol in Bocheon in my prime.

859
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Now I'm a general with two children.

860
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
Sad.

861
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,120
Shall we go see Dad?

862
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
Let's go.

863
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,120
What are you doing?

864
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:54,120
Even though I have two children, I'm still an idol in Bocheon.

865
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,120
Hey, wait a minute.

866
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:03,120
I misunderstood for no reason.

867
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,120
It's okay.

868
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,120
It could be.

869
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,120
Right?

870
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,120
It was a situation that you'd be mistaken for.

871
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,120
I could be mistaken.

872
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,120
Sorry, shouldn't I apologize first?

873
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
What?

874
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:21,120
Even if that misunderstanding was true, I don't think you should be so concerned about it.

875
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:31,120
That's a waste of time.

876
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,120
Yeah.

877
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,120
You're right.

878
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,120
But I crossed the line again.

879
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,120
Anyway, I'm sorry.

880
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:52,120
I'll do my best from tomorrow.

881
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,120
Don't you think this is a mistake?

882
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:08,120
What?

883
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,120
It was fun.

884
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,120
I'm going crazy.

885
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,120
I really want to put my head down.

886
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:25,120
Then why are you looking at me like this?

887
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,120
I guess I just got some wind.

888
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:37,120
Stop it.

889
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:47,120
I really want to disappear.

890
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:27,120
I shouldn't have said that.

891
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,120
What are you doing in the morning?

892
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,120
Wangjin is a road that is not packed.

893
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,120
I'm going to check in advance because my back hurts when it's broken.

894
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,120
You've been packing lunch since dawn yesterday.

895
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,120
I guess you're finally getting a hold of yourself.

896
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,120
Yeah, get along with Woohyun like before.

897
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,120
What's the point of getting along?

898
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,120
I made a child like that, so I have to take him to the field.

899
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,120
I'll take care of it.

900
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,120
Go home.

901
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,120
You're so annoying.

902
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,120
Be careful.

903
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,120
Yeah.

904
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,120
Have a good trip.

905
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,120
Yeah.

906
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,120
What are you doing?

907
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,120
Hurry up.

908
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,120
I'm so weak.

909
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,120
I'm so weak.

910
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,120
I'll be in a bad mood if I drink.

911
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,120
What the hell?

912
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,120
No.

913
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,120
Oh, my God.

914
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:19,120
No.

915
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,120
Get in.

916
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,120
What are you doing?

917
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,120
I have to go to Wangjin.

918
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,120
So get in.

919
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,120
Get in.

920
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,120
What are you doing?

921
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,120
I have to go to Wangjin.

922
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,120
So get in.

923
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,120
I mean, I was wondering if something urgent happened in Seoul this week.

924
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,120
I think something bad happened.

925
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,120
I think it was very urgent.

926
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:02,160
Help me.

927
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,960
Ah.

928
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,720
What a

929
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,760
side

930
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,160
Oh Oh

931
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,960
Oh

932
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,060
Oh

933
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:28,740
The

934
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,120
Okay

935
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,500
So

936
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:53,880
No.

937
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:03,880
I'm glad he didn't get it.

938
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:33,880
I'm sorry.

939
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,880
It was a mistake the night before, but he had a child.

940
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,880
I was drunk and out of my mind.

941
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,880
Really?

942
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,880
Because you were drunk?

943
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,880
Did you ask me after you did that?

944
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,880
Do you like alcohol that much?

945
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,880
Am I an alcoholic?

946
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,880
Don't get me wrong.

947
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,880
It's not because I don't love you.

948
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,880
If you were going to break up and clean up after the wedding.

949
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,880
What?

950
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,880
You said you were going to break up.

951
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,880
Did you know everything?

952
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,880
I'm sure I'm the one who broke up this marriage.

953
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,880
I threw you out.

954
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:34,880
You're worse than alcohol to me.

955
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,880
I tried to keep my pride, but I couldn't do it.

956
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,880
I have nothing to say.

957
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,880
It's okay.

958
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:54,880
I think the sky helped me not to marry a guy like you.

959
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:04,880
Hey.

960
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,880
Happy birthday.

961
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,880
I shouldn't have been born a bastard like you.

962
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,880
Hey, Han Geumju.

963
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,880
What are you doing?

964
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,880
Shut up.

965
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,880
I want to kill you, but I'm sorry for your baby.

966
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,880
Please live right.

967
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,880
Even if you think about the baby.

968
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,880
Do you understand?

969
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,880
Hey.

970
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,880
What are you talking about?

971
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,880
What?

972
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,880
Don't cross the line and live right.

973
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:49,880
Don't hit me in the back like this.

974
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:59,880
You're still less hit.

975
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,880
Don't cross the line and live right.

976
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:20,880
Don't hit me in the back like this.

977
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,880
Don't you think this is crossing the line?

978
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,880
What?

979
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,880
Please live well.

980
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,880
Just mind your own business.

981
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:38,880
Don't worry about me if you're going to come.

982
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:46,880
Really?

983
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:58,880
You didn't say anything wrong.

984
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,880
Oh, be honest.

985
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,880
You came to the military base, right?

986
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,880
It's not that.

987
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,880
Why do you work hard as a candidate for the military?

988
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,880
Hey, don't talk.

989
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:25,880
I'm so tired.

990
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,880
Hey, hey, hey, hey, give me a pair of earphones.

991
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,880
No, I'm not.

992
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,880
It's annoying.

993
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,880
You should have just stayed home.

994
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,880
Wang Jin is always like that.

995
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,880
Are you sleeping?

996
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,880
Who is it?

997
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,880
There's no one to call.

998
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,880
Did you solve the urgent matter?

999
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,880
Geum Joo?

1000
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,880
Yeah.

1001
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,880
Why?

1002
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,880
Really?

1003
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,880
You solved a big problem.

1004
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,880
Yeah, yeah, you did a great job.

1005
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,880
Huh?

1006
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,880
Oh, yeah.

1007
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,880
I'm sorry.

1008
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,880
I'm sorry.

1009
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,880
I'm sorry.

1010
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,880
I'm sorry.

1011
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,880
I'm sorry.

1012
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,880
I'm sorry.

1013
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,880
I'm sorry.

1014
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,880
I'm sorry.

1015
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,880
I'm sorry.

1016
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,880
I'm sorry.

1017
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,880
I'm sorry.

1018
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,880
I'm sorry.

1019
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,880
I'm sorry.

1020
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,880
I'm sorry.

1021
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,880
I'm sorry.

1022
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,880
What did Geum Joo say?

1023
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,880
What's the big deal?

1024
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,880
Why Geum Joo?

1025
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,880
It's a hero.

1026
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,880
Huh?

1027
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,880
I was thinking about whether to order onions that I like or green onions that I like.

1028
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,880
I thought I'd get a fight if I ordered both.

1029
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,880
You solved a big problem, right?

1030
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,880
Hey, your friendship is really good.

1031
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,880
I'm not friends with you.

1032
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,880
I'm not.

1033
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,880
Why? Did you wait for Geum Joo's call?

1034
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,880
I'm curious.

1035
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,880
You said you were in a hurry.

1036
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,880
As you said, I'm worried about whether it's a bad thing.

1037
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,880
If you're so worried, you can call me.

1038
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,880
Thank you for your hard work.

1039
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,880
Thank you.

1040
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,880
Huh? Isn't that Geum Joo?

1041
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,880
What are you doing here?

1042
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,880
You, I'm going to go in when I sober up.

1043
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,880
What are you doing here?

1044
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,880
What time is it now?

1045
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,880
Party?

1046
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,880
Where did you go so urgently? Did you go to a party?

1047
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,880
You couldn't drink in Gocheon, so you went to Seoul in a hurry.

1048
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Oh, that's not it.

1049
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,880
Were you there too?

1050
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,880
Yeah, he was there too.

1051
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,880
Do you know how worried he was?

1052
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
Why?

1053
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,880
I was worried about him.

1054
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,880
I was worried about him.

1055
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,880
Hey, what are you doing? Let's go.

1056
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,880
Hey, sorry.

1057
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,880
It's a misunderstanding.

1058
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,880
But I have a reason to be angry.

1059
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,880
What?

1060
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,880
A reason to be angry?

1061
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:24,880
Hey, whatever it is, you must have been a good dog to drink.

1062
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,880
Hey, let's go.

1063
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,880
Hey, don't you feel anything when you're with him?

1064
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,880
Stop drinking.

1065
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,880
Be a good person.

1066
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,880
Oh, my God.

1067
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,880
Yeah.

1068
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,880
I wanted to be a good person, too.

1069
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,880
That's...

1070
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,880
I can't do it.

1071
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,880
I can't do it.

1072
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,880
I can't do it.

1073
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,880
I can't do it.

1074
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,880
I can't do it.

1075
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,880
Oh.

1076
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,880
Oh.

1077
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,880
Oh.

1078
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,880
Drink, drink, drink.

1079
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,880
Drink, drink, drink.

1080
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,880
Drink, drink, drink.

1081
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,880
Hey, I couldn't sleep last night because I was preparing for the car competition.

1082
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,880
If it weren't for that, you wouldn't have been able to sleep.

1083
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,880
Yeah, I know.

1084
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,880
Oh, really.

1085
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,880
How can you not win at once?

1086
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,880
Of course I have to win.

1087
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,880
That's how I take care of you.

1088
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,880
I'm going to be okay.

1089
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,880
I'm going to laugh without saying anything.

1090
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:41,880
No matter how bright the world is, I can only see you.

1091
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:50,880
The past that I couldn't sleep without knowing, it's gone.

1092
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,880
I'm going to be okay.

1093
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,880
I'm going to laugh without saying anything.

1094
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:02,880
A camp?

1095
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,880
Why should I go drinking?

1096
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,880
You can just drink if you want.

1097
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,880
There's no reason to drink now.

1098
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,880
Why are you drinking?

1099
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,880
Did you have a stomachache yesterday?

1100
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,880
I saw it all.

1101
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,880
I saw it all.

1102
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,880
Skin-sip caused by a accidental accident.

1103
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,880
What are you talking about?

1104
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,880
He's just a friend.

1105
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,880
It's so small.
