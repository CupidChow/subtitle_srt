3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
Where did he go?

4
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,400
I knew it.

5
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,900
I know.

6
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,200
He was so excited and drunk.

7
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
He wouldn't be drinking here.

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,600
Let's go.

9
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,200
Where could he be?

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Sir, one more bottle of makgeolli, please.

11
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,900
Hey!

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Hey!

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
What are you doing?

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,200
Why are you doing this?

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
He was drunk and was standing in front of the bar.

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,700
I mean, he was so drunk that he couldn't sleep at night.

18
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,200
That's what I thought.

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,800
I really...

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,200
like drinking.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,300
Why do I have to quit drinking when I'm so drunk?

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
I said I could drink in front of the bar.

23
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,300
I quit!

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,800
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,300
What do you mean?

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,500
I can't live without alcohol.

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,000
That's not what I meant.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,500
I like it!

29
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,300
Here.

30
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm already a grown-up.

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,100
So, you and Dad,

32
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,500
leave me alone and go back to camp.

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
Oh, my.

34
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,100
I can't go back to the broken marriage.

35
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,300
I feel so bad.

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
I feel like I've been compensated.

37
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,700
You look like someone who's been dumped.

38
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,300
Don't you think about the people who were hurt because of you?

39
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,300
Here.

40
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Mother.

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Yes?

42
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,300
Are you going somewhere?

43
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Yes.

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,300
I was worried that you were doing well at the camp.

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,100
I was going to go, too.

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,100
Good for you.

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,800
Get in.

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,300
Okay.

49
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,800
Okay.

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,300
But why are you there?

51
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
I'm going to the camp, too.

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
I'm going to the camp, too.

53
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
I'm going to the camp, too.

54
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,300
I'm worried, too.

55
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,300
So,

56
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
all three of you

57
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,300
were rejected?

58
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,300
Yes.

59
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,300
This is the first time in the history of the Golden Age Camp.

60
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,300
I didn't know you three would disappear at once.

61
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,300
I'm not interested in the Golden Age Camp.

62
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,300
Why are you drinking?

63
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,300
I'm the only one who drinks.

64
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,300
How can you drink alone?

65
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,300
It's the same for everyone.

66
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,300
How can you leave your precious youngest daughter alone?

67
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
What's wrong with you?

68
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
Drinking alone is the trend these days.

69
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Hey, we should drink together.

70
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,300
That's why, daughters.

71
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
I hope that

72
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,300
you can meet someone who can drink with you forever instead of me.

73
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,300
I'm so happy.

74
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,300
I don't want to get married again.

75
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,300
Me, too.

76
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,300
I just need her.

77
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
But I don't have her.

78
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,300
Hey, give me another bottle of makgeolli.

79
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Stop.

80
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,300
Geumju, let's go in.

81
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,300
If we go in until the evening,

82
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,300
nothing will happen.

83
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
Geumju.

84
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,300
Lee Makseul, the end.

85
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Lee Makseul, the end.

86
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,300
Lee Makseul, the end.

87
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,300
Lee Makseul, the end.

88
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Lee Makseul, the end.

89
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,300
What?

90
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Naldeura.

91
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,300
Hey, stop there.

92
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,300
Hey, Han Jungsoo.

93
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
Hey.

94
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Dad.

95
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Don't come.

96
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,300
Don't come.

97
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
I killed him.

99
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,300
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
I'm so pissed.

102
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
I'm so pissed.

103
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,300
Hey, you guys are all dead.

104
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
I'm so pissed.

105
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Hey, if you get caught, you're all dead.

106
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
Get out of here.

107
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Honey.

108
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,300
Honey.

109
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Honey.

110
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
Honey.

111
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Hurry up.

112
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Hurry up.

113
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:16,300
So, the day Kim Jeop was going to marry me, the time, the place, you're saying you're going to change your bride and marry her, right?

114
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Let's go.

115
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,300
Don't stay here like this.

116
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Yeah.

117
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
I'm going.

118
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
I'm going.

119
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,300
I'm going.

120
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,300
I'm going.

121
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
I'm going.

122
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
I'm going.

123
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
I'm going.

124
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
I'm going.

125
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,300
I'm going.

126
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,300
Hey, Geumju, are you okay?

127
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,300
No.

128
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
I'm not okay.

129
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,300
It hurts.

130
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
It hurts so much.

131
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,300
It hurts so much.

132
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Let's go.

133
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,300
Let's go.

134
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,300
Let's go.

135
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Let's go.

136
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,300
Let's go.

137
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Let's go.

138
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
Let's go.

139
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,300
Let's go.

140
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
Let's go.

141
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Let's go.

142
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Let's go.

143
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Let's go.

144
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Let's go.

145
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
Let's go.

146
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,300
Let's go.

147
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
Let's go.

148
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
Let's go.

149
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
Let's go.

150
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
Let's go.

151
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Let's go.

152
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,300
Let's go.

153
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Let's go.

154
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
Let's go.

155
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Let's go.

156
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Let's go.

157
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Let's go.

158
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,300
Let's go.

159
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Let's go.

160
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Let's go.

161
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Let's pray.

162
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:36,620
Habanem hahahahahahahaha

163
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,140
So who let him?

164
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,940
Brother!

165
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,340
Brother!

166
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,620
Brother!!!

167
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,640
How did you get here when Buddha didn't tells you about us?

168
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,940
I want to be hung by God.

169
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,440
I know,

170
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,440
the healing camp isn't it wonderful?

171
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,980
I hope your prayer comes true and the family gets back together.

172
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,980
Especially, we should get back together from that Shinhwa.

173
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,980
Amen!

174
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,980
I don't remember.

175
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,980
You don't remember?

176
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,980
Yeah. It's been a while since I drank wine.

177
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,980
But you said you brought it down.

178
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
Thank you.

179
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,980
Then what about what you told me?

180
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,980
You don't remember that either?

181
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,980
What did you say?

182
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
What about...

183
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
this card?

184
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Whatever.

185
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,520
I'm just drunk, so don't mind me.

186
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Thanks for bringing it. I'm going in.

187
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
What the heck?

188
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,520
What did you say?

189
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,060
What did you say?

190
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,060
Whatever.

191
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,060
It's nothing, so you won't remember.

192
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,060
Gye-ok, you're the best.

193
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,060
How did you know I had yours?

194
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
You're not going to remember?

195
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,600
But I want to return this to him and spray it on his face.

196
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Yeah.

197
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
It's not meaningful.

198
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Let's think of it as a chair.

199
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Here.

200
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Think of it as him and chew it.

201
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
And control it!

202
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
What is it?

203
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Geumju bought it for us.

204
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Yours?

205
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
All of a sudden?

206
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
I feel bad for everyone after I came down.

207
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
If you feel bad, you should quit drinking.

208
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
It's not a gift.

209
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Don't worry.

210
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
I realized it while looking back at myself,

211
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
who was so pathetic after drinking at Geumju Camp.

212
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,600
I can't live without alcohol.

213
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
What?

214
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,140
You should be honest.

215
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,140
So you should stop giving up

216
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,140
and stop me from drinking.

217
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
Yeah.

218
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
That's possible.

219
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,140
But

220
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
you change your mind.

221
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,680
I won't lose hope.

222
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,680
I believe my daughter will quit drinking.

223
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,680
You too.

224
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
I love you.

225
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
I love you.

226
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Hey.

227
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,680
What's wrong with your mom?

228
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,220
I know.

229
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,220
I thought she would throw a back smash.

230
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,220
Is she really our mother?

231
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,220
Isn't she Teresa?

232
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
You told me to love my enemy.

233
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,220
Amen.

234
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,220
Do I have to hate my family?

235
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,220
Above all, I have to treat them with love.

236
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,220
With love.

237
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,220
That's how they change.

238
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
With love.

239
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
With love.

240
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Ha!

241
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Ha!

242
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Right!

243
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Right!

244
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Right!

245
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Forward!

246
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
One, two!

247
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
That's right!

248
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Up!

249
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Down!

250
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Up!

251
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
Shoulder jump!

252
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Up!

253
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Shoulder jump!

254
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,300
I don't want to dance in the morning, but I'm not going to wake up.

255
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,300
But I'm going to lose my dance today.

256
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I'm going to lose my dance.

257
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Let's go together.

258
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Goodbye.

259
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
Ms. Yang.

260
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Yes.

261
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,300
Here you are.

262
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,300
A plate-sharing life.

263
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Wow.

264
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
You do plate-sharing?

265
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
How happy would you be

266
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
if you could complete a pretty plate

267
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,840
while spinning the wheel?

268
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Wow.

269
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,840
You are a happy counselor.

270
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
Yes.

271
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,340
I hope that happiness reaches Geumju's mother.

272
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,340
What?

273
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,840
She didn't come today.

274
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
She probably doesn't feel like exercising.

275
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
I know.

276
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,840
How can she go to Geumju's camp and drink?

277
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,840
I'm sure Geumju is the best.

278
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Of course.

279
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,380
Does Geumju have any thoughts?

280
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,380
Of course.

281
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,380
She only thinks about drinking.

282
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,380
Stop it.

283
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,380
I don't deserve to say this,

284
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,380
but let's stop blaming her

285
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,380
for not knowing what's going on.

286
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,380
What's going on?

287
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,380
She's taking Geumju's side.

288
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,380
I know.

289
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,380
I don't remember.

290
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,380
It's me.

291
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,380
I have something to say.

292
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,380
What is this?

293
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,380
Try it.

294
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,380
I told you to try it last time.

295
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
I've been treating myself like a patient since last time.

296
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
I told you I don't do this.

297
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,920
I can stop drinking if I want to.

298
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,920
Who drank at Geumju's camp?

299
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Did I do something wrong?

300
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Did I pee?

301
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Did I go to the police?

302
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
I didn't hurt anyone and I didn't...

303
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
It's not that you don't have a knife.

304
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
You don't remember.

305
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Say it without saying anything.

306
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
I'll do it at home.

307
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
In front of me.

308
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
Oh, really?

309
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,460
Really?

310
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Check it.

311
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,460
How often do you drink?

312
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,460
Merry Christmas!

313
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,460
You're so good at acting.

314
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
You're such a bad guy.

315
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,460
Drink it.

316
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:27,460
How often have you felt guilty or regretted drinking after drinking for a year?

317
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,460
It's really long if I drink again.

318
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,460
What are you?

319
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,460
Where are we?

320
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
It's long.

321
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,460
No?

322
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Why regret?

323
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Have you ever worried about your relatives or friends or doctors drinking or asked them to stop drinking?

324
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Shut up!

325
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Stop talking and go up there.

326
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Geumju, you slept like that to drink.

327
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
How did my daughter become like that?

328
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You should stop drinking.

329
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
How can you hurt Euijun?

330
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Stop drinking.

331
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Be a good person.

332
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Geumju, you really should stop drinking.

333
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Geumju, let's get treatment for your health.

334
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Forget it.

335
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The question itself is a mistake.

336
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Who would be the Korean employee who is not an alcoholic?

337
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm not an alcoholic.

338
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm not an alcoholic.

339
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm not an alcoholic.

340
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm not an alcoholic.

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm not an alcoholic.

342
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm not an alcoholic.

343
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,540
You're right.

344
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,540
But people don't know.

345
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Our country is too much into alcohol.

346
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,540
Yeah.

347
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,540
Korea is too much into alcohol.

348
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,540
I really love you.

349
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,540
What's addictive?

350
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:56,540
I'm a very common lover.

351
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,540
One!

352
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,540
You did so well.

353
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Two!

354
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Look forward.

355
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
One!

356
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
Two!

357
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
One!

358
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Here.

359
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
Thank you.

360
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
It's refreshing to work out after a long time.

361
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Yeah.

362
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
Thank you.

363
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
I'll drink it well.

364
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
Yes.

365
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Oh, right.

366
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Concert.

367
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
What should I do?

368
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
I forgot to buy a ticket.

369
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
What should I do?

370
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Wait.

371
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
What should I do?

372
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,620
I don't know.

373
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,620
The seat.

374
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,620
There's no way there's a seat.

375
00:20:42,620 --> 00:21:02,060
It was a

376
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
That's right.

377
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,040
It would be really awesome to hear it live.

378
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,060
I should have woken up.

379
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,060
I should have woken up.

380
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,060
I forgot something else.

381
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,060
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

382
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,060
Hey, this coffee.

383
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,060
How is it?

384
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,060
It came out well, right?

385
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
Yes.

386
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,060
What?

387
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,060
I saw it in the military.

388
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
I'm sorry.

390
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,060
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,060
I'm sorry.

392
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,060
Yes, well.

393
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
It's not like anyone's coming out of the military.

394
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,060
You're amazing.

395
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,060
It's the best visual.

396
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,060
The female employees in the military are very busy.

397
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,060
They're going to the lecture with the teacher.

398
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,060
Even female employees who can't drink.

399
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,060
Awesome.

400
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,060
This isn't even a fan meeting.

401
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,060
Teacher?

402
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,060
Teacher?

403
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,060
Yes?

404
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,060
What are you thinking about?

405
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,060
No, no.

406
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,060
Ha...

407
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
I'm having a lecture at the military today.

408
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,060
Come.

409
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,060
I'll check it out.

410
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,060
Oh, yes, mother.

411
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,060
What?

412
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,060
Where are you going?

413
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,060
Military office.

414
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,060
Woo-jun is giving a lecture on alcohol addiction.

415
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,060
I invited three people.

416
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,060
Ha...

417
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,060
At first, it's better to start with a free lecture.

418
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,060
It's okay.

419
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,060
Why should I go there?

420
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,060
What? Why?

421
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,060
I told you, Mom.

422
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,060
I'm not going to stop you from drinking.

423
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,060
I'm not going.

424
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,060
I'm not going.

425
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,060
With love.

426
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,060
My youngest daughter.

427
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,060
I'm going when you say nice things.

428
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,060
Okay?

429
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,060
You two are the same.

430
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,060
You already signed my divorce papers.

431
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,060
You forgot about it.

432
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,060
Okay?

433
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
I love you.

434
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
I love you.

435
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
Hey.

436
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,060
What's wrong with your mom?

437
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,060
I thought he was going to throw a smash.

438
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,060
That's important.

439
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,060
Why is it a lecture?

440
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Seo Hee-joon.

441
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,060
The film was cut off because of alcohol.

442
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,060
I don't remember.

443
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,060
If you like alcohol,

444
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,060
Have you ever said this?

445
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,060
The symptom of not remembering after drinking

446
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,060
It's called blackout.

447
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,060
Blackout is a pre-addiction of alcohol addiction.

448
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,060
It's a kind of warning that your body sends.

449
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
It's a kind of warning that your body sends.

450
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,060
I'm telling you to listen to me.

451
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,060
I thought it wasn't a lecture.

452
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,060
Why are you so strong?

453
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,060
What did I really say?

454
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
Did I say something important?

455
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060
I don't remember it.

456
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,060
I'm angry.

457
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,060
Jun-ah.

458
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,060
What?

459
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,060
Do you want to sleep with me?

460
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,060
No way.

461
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,060
No way.

462
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,060
Am I really an alcohol addict?

463
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,060
Blackout can solve many serious problems.

464
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,060
No, no, no.

465
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,060
No matter how drunk you are,

466
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,060
It would never have been like that to that kid.

467
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,060
And if it had been like that,

468
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,060
You'd have been cut off again.

469
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,060
But why did you quit drinking?

470
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,060
I don't know.

471
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,060
I just got hit by a typhoon.

472
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,060
Dad, please come.

473
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,060
Dad, please come.

474
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,060
Why would you do this to me?

475
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,060
Aren't you sleepy?

476
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,060
I'm sleepy.

477
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,060
Right?

478
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,060
Wow, you're good.

479
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,060
Thank you.

480
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,060
Are you okay?

481
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,060
Yes, yes, yes.

482
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,060
I loved your performance.

483
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,060
I loved your performance.

484
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,060
You're so handsome.

485
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,060
You're the best.

486
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,060
You're popular among women.

487
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,060
Are you from the military?

488
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,060
I think they're all here to see me.

489
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,060
Take a picture of us with that handsome face.

490
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,060
Mom told me to take a picture.

491
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,060
I'm sorry, but I don't know how to take pictures.

492
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,060
Take it without saying anything.

493
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,060
One, two, three.

494
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,060
Done. Let's go.

495
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,060
Hey, come here.

496
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,060
Did I say something bad that day?

497
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
What?

498
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,060
So my mom called Kang Hyeon-woo from the same school to stop drinking.

499
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,060
If I did, I wouldn't have called you Kang Hyeon-woo.

500
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,060
I would have called a lawyer.

501
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
Then why are you doing this?

502
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,060
When you hear my famous lecture,

503
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,060
I can't live like this.

504
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
It means a lot to me to feel the deep echo coming from the edge.

505
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
Well, it's done.

506
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,060
Hey, dad, let's go.

507
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,060
Kang Hyeon-woo is no longer a dictionary.

508
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,060
You're good.

509
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,060
You're really going to say that?

510
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,060
Yeah.

511
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,060
When my mom gets this soft, I'm gonna push her.

512
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,060
I can't live like this.

513
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,060
It's totally agreeable.

514
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
It's a great timing.

515
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Me too. Okay.

516
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,060
Let's go.

517
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,060
Wait a minute.

518
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,060
So, did you all enjoy the lecture?

519
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,060
Of course.

520
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,060
Good job.

521
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,060
It's a month's course, so don't miss it.

522
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,060
Listen carefully and stop drinking.

523
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,060
I love you, everyone.

524
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,060
Mom, do you really love us?

525
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,060
Of course.

526
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Of course.

527
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,060
We hope you'll be happy.

528
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,060
Mom, don't you want us to do what we don't want to do?

529
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,060
I don't want to do what I don't want to do.

530
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,060
I don't want to do what I don't want to do.

531
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,060
I don't want to do what we don't want to do.

532
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,060
Right.

533
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,060
But...

534
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,060
What are you talking about?

535
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,060
God changed mom.

536
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,060
He gave us courage.

537
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,060
I'm not going to listen to the lecture.

538
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Yo.

539
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,060
What?

540
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Love.

541
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,060
Love.

542
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Love.

543
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,060
Really?

544
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,060
You don't want to listen, right?

545
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,060
But I won't listen to what you say.

546
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,060
I love you, everyone.

547
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,060
Mom's change gave us more courage.

548
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,060
Honestly, I'm embarrassed.

549
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,060
I'm really embarrassed to be treated like a patient by Woo-joon.

550
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,060
I don't know.

551
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,060
I'll never go.

552
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,060
I'm not going either.

553
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,060
I'm more nervous to listen to the lecture.

554
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,060
Honestly, I'm embarrassed.

555
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,060
Love.

556
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,060
Love.

557
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,060
Love.

558
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,060
I can't do it.

559
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,060
I can't do it.

560
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
I'm going to fall into hell.

561
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Eventually,

562
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,060
I caused a big disaster.

563
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,060
You're not love.

564
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,060
You're not me.

565
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,060
What?

566
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,060
Wait.

567
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,060
Don't you feel anything when you see a person who's in a hurry?

568
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,060
Live like Woo-joon.

569
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,060
I'm sorry.

570
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,060
What is it from dawn?

571
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,060
Is there anything complicated?

572
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,060
Oh, my God.

573
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,060
Oh, my God.

574
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,060
Oh, my God.

575
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,060
Oh, my God.

576
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,060
Oh, my God.

577
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,060
Oh, my God.

578
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,060
Oh, my God.

579
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,060
Damn it.

580
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
Oh, my.

581
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
Seriously.

582
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,180
Can you help me with the car repair?

583
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,060
I have to go on a business trip with my colleagues.

584
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,060
I have to go now.

585
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,220
Okay.

586
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,220
The seat belt is different from the one on the car.

587
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,220
Did you change it?

588
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
What?

589
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,220
I think it's because I used it too harshly.

590
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,220
Did you get the fuse box?

591
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,220
I used it too harshly, so I put it in a cheap way.

592
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
This is the car that was submerged.

593
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
What?

594
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
The car that was submerged.

595
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,220
What?

596
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,220
The car that was submerged.

597
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
What?

598
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
The car that was submerged.

599
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,220
What?

600
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,220
The car that was submerged.

601
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,220
What?

602
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,220
What?

603
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
Right?

604
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,220
This isn't the car that was submerged.

605
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,220
I almost got in trouble.

606
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,220
If you liked it without any accident,

607
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,220
let's say there was no deal.

608
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,220
Boss.

609
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,220
Boss.

610
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,220
Boss.

611
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,220
Boss.

612
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,220
What?

613
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,220
You should be honest.

614
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,220
How could you cheat like this?

615
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,220
Cheat?

616
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Hey, say it again.

617
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,220
Hey, you're going to buy this.

618
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,220
Are you going to take it?

619
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,220
What?

620
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,220
What?

621
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,220
What?

622
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,220
Hey!

623
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,220
Hey!

624
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,220
Oh, my.

625
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Oh, my.

626
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,220
Oh, my.

627
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,220
You didn't even hit me.

628
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,220
It's broken.

629
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,220
Help me.

630
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,220
Let go of me.

631
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,220
You're a loser.

632
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:27,220
I think it's broken here.

633
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,220
Please take a closer look.

634
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,220
I'm going to cut the diagnosis and feed you a lot of rice.

635
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,220
You should eat the rice.

636
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,220
Oh, my.

637
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,220
Oh, my.

638
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,220
Why?

639
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,220
Did you go somewhere?

640
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,220
How many days will the exhibition be?

641
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,220
Don't even talk.

642
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,220
How did you fall down like this?

643
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,220
Are you okay?

644
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,220
Look.

645
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,220
I'm fine.

646
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,220
I'm totally fine.

647
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,220
I...

648
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,220
What?

649
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
What?

650
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,220
Are you okay?

651
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,220
Yes.

652
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,220
I'm fine, but I'm so fine.

653
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,220
Even if I go to the hospital, I'll only get a diagnosis fee.

654
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,220
No.

655
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Oh, my.

656
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,220
Oh, my.

657
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,220
Oh, my.

658
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
Oh, my.

659
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,220
This...

660
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,220
Hey, I'm going to have to cut the diagnosis here.

661
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,220
It's not going to be a waste of money.

662
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,220
What?

663
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,220
Yes.

664
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,220
Please, please, please.

665
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,220
Please.

666
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,220
Ha...

667
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,220
I think I can do it.

668
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,220
Ta-da.

669
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,220
This is a ticket I got from Gwang-Kr.

670
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,220
I can't go because of an emergency.

671
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,220
It's free.

672
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,220
I'll give it to whoever wants it.

673
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,220
Thank you.

674
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,220
I'm the one who wants it.

675
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,220
What's this?

676
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
Son Heung-min, please give it to me.

677
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,220
I wrote the prelude.

678
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,220
My wife is a big fan of Jang Beom-joon,

679
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,220
so I have to buy a ticket.

680
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,220
Wife?

681
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,220
Son Heung-min is married.

682
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,220
I'm going to confess to my first love after I watch the concert.

683
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,220
Please let me get married.

684
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,220
Please.

685
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,220
Son Heung-min.

686
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,220
Where do you get stories from, Bong Joon-ho, a parasite?

687
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
Please give it to me.

688
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,220
There's not much time left until the wedding anniversary.

689
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,220
I want to repay my wife's kindness.

690
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
You selfish bastard.

691
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,220
Hey, workers in Bocheon.

692
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
It's a waste of time.

693
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,220
I'm going to give it to the person who arrives first.

694
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,220
The place is the sports field of Bocheon Elementary School.

695
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
I'm going to go.

696
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,220
Go after you eat.

697
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,220
I'm going to go.

698
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,220
Oh, my.

699
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,220
My wife is in trouble.

700
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,220
Oh, my God.

701
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,220
What?

702
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,220
Sir.

703
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,220
Mr. Kim.

704
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,220
Hey.

705
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,220
What's going on?

706
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
What are you doing here?

707
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
What are you doing here?

708
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Is it you?

709
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,220
Sorry?

710
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,220
You bastard?

711
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,220
Oh, it's not Heung-min from Bocheon.

712
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,220
He's married.

713
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,220
You bastard.

714
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
What are you doing here?

715
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,220
Sorry?

716
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,220
Are you a bastard?

717
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
Oh, I'm a bastard.

718
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,220
I'm a bastard.

719
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,220
He's not a Korean, right?

720
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,220
He said he's married.

721
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,220
Bo-chan, Bong-jun-ho?

722
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,220
Right?

723
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,220
Who's the first one?

724
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,220
Who's the first person you met again?

725
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,220
Hey, forget it.

726
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,220
Give it to me.

727
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,220
I'll do it for free.

728
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,220
Just give it to me.

729
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,220
What's wrong with you?

730
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
That's private.

731
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,220
And I'm asking you to be careful with your mouth.

732
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,220
Only you know the story of Bo-chan and Bong-jun-ho.

733
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,220
Okay?

734
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,220
Well,

735
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,220
next month's salary,

736
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,220
and next month's driving.

737
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,220
I'll see what you do.

738
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,220
No, don't look.

739
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,220
What?

740
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,220
You don't have to look at it.

741
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Wait, wait, wait.

742
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,220
Wait, wait.

743
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,220
Actually, I really want you to make a confession.

744
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
I really want you to make a confession.

745
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,220
Take this,

746
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,220
have a good time,

747
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,220
and pretend you didn't hear what you heard.

748
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,220
I'm going.

749
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,220
I'm going.

750
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,220
Go!

751
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,220
Thank you.

752
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,220
Okay.

753
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,220
Ha...

754
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,220
What's going on?

755
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,220
The light was on.

756
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,220
Hey, why are you working overtime

757
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,220
when you're fixing Bo-chan's car?

758
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,220
I want to do it.

759
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,220
So,

760
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,220
you said you were going to feed the beans,

761
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,220
but why did you say you were fixing the car?

762
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,220
Oh, I'm afraid it's going to be a bad rumor.

763
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,220
You can't avoid me if I can't help you.

764
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,220
How did Young-hong and Seon-woo

765
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,220
lose their memory center?

766
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,220
Ha...

767
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,220
Oh, I didn't

768
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,220
tell them,

769
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,220
so don't tell them.

770
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,220
Okay.

771
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,220
You can have this.

772
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,220
What's this?

773
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,220
Oh, Wendy, you know this, right?

774
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,220
The owner of the store gave me

775
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,220
a lot of service.

776
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,220
It's a waste to throw it away.

777
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,220
Oh, thank you so much.

778
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,220
Thank you so much.

779
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,220
What kind of service did you give me so quickly?

780
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,220
Oh,

781
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,220
I'm the type who likes it.

782
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,220
I want to spread it out.

783
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,220
Give me abalone,

784
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,220
flatfish and sea bream.

785
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,220
Just put in a few more eels.

786
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,220
Yes, sir.

787
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,220
I'll pay with this.

788
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,220
Oh, there are the most eels I like.

789
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,220
Mm.

790
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,220
It's good.

791
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,220
Eat slowly.

792
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,220
Wow.

793
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,220
If this is alcohol, it would be perfect.

794
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,220
Geumju.

795
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,220
Will you just hold back from nagging?

796
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,220
I'll be pathetic if I say this,

797
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,220
but I can't quit drinking.

798
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,220
Hey, look at me today.

799
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,220
The world is bullying me like this.

800
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,220
How can I live without alcohol?

801
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,220
Just live.

802
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,220
Seonwoo, who is loved everywhere,

803
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,220
will live every day because it's a bright day.

804
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,220
I live every day

805
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,220
because I have to have alcohol

806
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,220
and an umbrella

807
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,220
on a rainy day.

808
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,220
Go now. I have to work.

809
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,220
Oh, I'll eat well.

810
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,220
Ah.

811
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,220
Does it hurt a lot?

812
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,220
Uh.

813
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,220
Oh, it's just a lot of scars here and there.

814
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,220
Don't be sick for a long time.

815
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,220
What?

816
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,220
I want you to get well soon.

817
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,220
Whatever the wound is.

818
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
What?

819
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,220
Thank you.

820
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,220
What? Where did it go?

821
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,220
Hey, hey, hey.

822
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,220
What?

823
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,220
Jang Beom-joon concert?

824
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
R-Suk H-R-1213?

825
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,220
Oh, my God.

826
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,220
What?

827
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,220
What?

828
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,220
Was it you?

829
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,220
Bo-cheon Bong-jun-ho?

830
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,220
Hyun-ju.

831
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,220
I felt it the moment I first saw you a long time ago.

832
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
You are my destiny.

833
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,220
I want to be a man

834
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,220
who is no longer a brother.

835
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,220
No, you're too cheesy.

836
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,220
You're too cheesy.

837
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,220
Ahem.

838
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,220
Hyun-ju.

839
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,220
You know, right?

840
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,220
That you're my first love.

841
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,220
I was born to love you.

842
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,220
Please accept my heart.

843
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,220
Sun-ok.

844
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,220
Hey.

845
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,220
Oh, my.

846
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,220
What's that?

847
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,220
Oh, that's...

848
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,220
Hey, sister.

849
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,220
You heard from Sun-ah.

850
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,220
My wedding news.

851
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,220
What?

852
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,220
No wonder.

853
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,220
Why did you suddenly ask to see me?

854
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,220
Thank you.

855
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,220
Oh, this card.

856
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,220
I told you I like buffet.

857
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,220
The buffet at the hotel is really good.

858
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,220
Come and eat a lot.

859
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,220
What?

860
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,220
No, I don't like buffet.

861
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,220
What?

862
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,220
I don't like buffet.

863
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,220
I just didn't like it.

864
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,220
Why did you choose buffet?

865
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,220
You didn't give me a chance.

866
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,220
Why did you choose buffet?

867
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,220
What did he say?

868
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,220
Don't you feel sorry for the galbitang?

869
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,220
You're the only one who's been looking at it.

870
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,220
What's wrong with the galbitang?

871
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,220
Galbitang could be better.

872
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,220
Galbitang is more important.

873
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,220
Why did you choose buffet?

874
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,220
Okay.

875
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,220
I'll ask you to prepare galbitang.

876
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,220
I don't like it.

877
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,220
I don't like buffet.

878
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,220
Hey!

879
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,220
Hey!

880
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,220
Hey!

881
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,220
You're not a good boyfriend.

882
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,220
You're already in love.

883
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,220
What the hell are you doing here?

884
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,220
What?

885
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,220
Are you crazy?

886
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,220
Hyun-ju is...

887
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,220
Does this make sense?

888
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,220
Why not?

889
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,220
She's your friend.

890
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,220
She's my friend.

891
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,220
If you know her, you'll be in trouble.

892
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,220
You met her knowing I'd be in trouble.

893
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,220
We didn't have a child.

894
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,220
My sister raised me like a son.

895
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,220
Are you fighting with me?

896
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,220
Why don't you say anything?

897
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,220
Hey!

898
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,220
I'll take care of it.

899
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,220
You can pretend you don't know.

900
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,220
Okay?

901
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,220
I'm not eating.

902
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,220
Seol-ah will be in trouble.

903
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,220
Don't be sick for a long time.

904
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,220
I want you to get well soon.

905
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,220
No matter what kind of wound it is.

906
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,220
What?

907
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,220
What do you mean?

908
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,220
Don't tell me you know everything.

909
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,220
I'm actually...

910
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:38,220
I'm not going to break up with you because I like you.

911
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:44,220
He likes another woman.

912
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,220
He's so cute.

913
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,220
He's so cute.

914
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,220
I'm so embarrassed.

915
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,220
I was abandoned.

916
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,220
I wanted to be with you.

917
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,220
I wanted to be with you.

918
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,220
No.

919
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,220
No matter how drunk I am,

920
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,220
I shouldn't have looked down on him.

921
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,220
Yu-joon.

922
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,220
What did I say that day?

923
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,220
I'm sorry.

924
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,220
I'm sorry.

925
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,220
I'm sorry.

926
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,220
Wow.

927
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,220
It smells delicious.

928
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,220
You must have made doenjang-jjigae.

929
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,220
Where's Geum-joo?

930
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,220
She's not in her room.

931
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,220
I think she's out.

932
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,220
Wow, your mom's doenjang-jjigae is amazing.

933
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,220
It's so delicious.

934
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,220
It's amazing.

935
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,220
I'm eating.

936
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,220
I'm sorry.

937
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,220
I'm sorry.

938
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,220
I'm sorry.

939
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,220
I'm sorry.

940
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,220
Just eat.

941
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,220
Don't worry.

942
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,220
You're not getting any better.

943
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,220
Mom.

944
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,220
Geum-joo.

945
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,220
You were like a gift to me.

946
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,220
But you're giving me a son today.

947
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,220
Ju-yeop.

948
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,220
I'm counting on you.

949
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,220
My daughter, who had a hard time

950
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,220
meeting her ugly dad,

951
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,220
will only be full of happiness

952
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,220
and laughter from now on.

953
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,220
I'm sorry.

954
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,220
I'm sorry.

955
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,220
Congratulations on your wedding.

956
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,220
Yes, Geum-joo.

957
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,220
What?

958
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,220
Okay, I'll go now.

959
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:45,220
Wow, the bus is so pretty.

960
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,220
The food and drinks are all so pretty.

961
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,220
Geum-joo, let's go to Seoul

962
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,220
in this bus.

963
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,220
What?

964
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,220
We're going to the wedding anyway.

965
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,220
Sir, we can go to the Han River.

966
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,220
You're talking too much.

967
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,220
Geum-joo made a reservation.

968
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,220
Why didn't she tell me?

969
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,220
The wedding is so boring.

970
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,220
I know.

971
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,220
Why are you so worried?

972
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,220
What happened?

973
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,220
Mom told you to cancel everything.

974
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,220
No, that's...

975
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,220
Get in.

976
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,220
What?

977
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,220
Get in and leave.

978
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,220
And don't come back.

979
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,220
I'll make sure your daughter doesn't have a baby.

980
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,220
I'm sorry, mom.

981
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,220
You don't want to hear it?

982
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,220
Get in and leave.

983
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,220
Oh, my.

984
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,220
Wait a minute.

985
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:47,220
I told you not to cancel the bus.

986
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,220
What?

987
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,220
I told you not to cancel the bus.

988
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,220
I'm going to take the elders of the mountain village

989
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:57,220
to have a little chat.

990
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:01,220
Hey, I told you to tell me, but you forgot.

991
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,220
Let's go.

992
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,220
You said you'd come with me.

993
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,220
I'll be back.

994
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,220
I'll be back.

995
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,220
What's going on?

996
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,220
It's not because of you, it's because of your mother.

997
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,220
I was worried you'd fall.

998
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,220
Oh, my God.

999
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,220
What's all that?

1000
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,220
If it weren't for the wedding partner,

1001
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,220
everyone would be in trouble.

1002
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,220
I'm sorry.

1003
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,220
I'm sorry.

1004
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,220
I'm sorry.

1005
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,220
I'm sorry.

1006
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,220
I'm sorry.

1007
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,220
I'm sorry.

1008
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,220
I'm sorry.

1009
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,220
I'm sorry.

1010
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,220
I'm sorry.

1011
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,220
I'm sorry.

1012
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,220
I'm sorry.

1013
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,220
I'm sorry.

1014
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,220
I'm sorry.

1015
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,220
I'm sorry.

1016
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,220
I'm sorry.

1017
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,220
You're right.

1018
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,220
Huh?

1019
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:42,220
I told you not to think about the people who were hurt because of me.

1020
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,220
It's cheap to hear that.

1021
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,220
I'm sorry.

1022
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,220
I said something I shouldn't have.

1023
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,220
Don't put it in your heart.

1024
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,220
I did.

1025
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,220
Why are you sorry?

1026
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:05,220
I'm sorry.

1027
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,220
Driver, please stop the car.

1028
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,220
Why?

1029
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,220
Why are you getting off all of a sudden?

1030
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,220
Where are you going?

1031
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,220
I'm sorry.

1032
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,220
I have somewhere to go.

1033
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,220
Please go to where you were supposed to go.

1034
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,220
Hey, Geumju.

1035
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,220
Han Geumju.

1036
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,220
Hey, Han Geumju.

1037
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,220
It's not a flower.

1038
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,220
It's not a flower.

1039
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,220
Give me a flower.

1040
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,220
Wait until it's full.

1041
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,220
Oh, right.

1042
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,220
The concert ticket at the end of the day.

1043
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,220
I guess it's hard for you to recognize it.

1044
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,220
I was going to go with you if I got it.

1045
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,220
Oh, I'm done.

1046
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,220
Oh, yeah.

1047
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,220
I'm going to go with you.

1048
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,220
I'm going to go with you.

1049
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,220
I'm going to go with you.

1050
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,220
I'm going to go with you.

1051
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,220
I'm done.

1052
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,220
It's like a small party in my house.

1053
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,220
Do you think you're going to go to the concert?

1054
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,220
It's all my fault.

1055
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,220
What?

1056
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,220
What are you talking about?

1057
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,220
When the kids are in trouble,

1058
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,220
they're going to be patient at first.

1059
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,220
If you do that again, you'll be angry.

1060
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:51,220
If I hadn't gotten divorced and lived well,

1061
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:55,220
I could've just moved on to Geumju's family.

1062
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:04,220
I think Geumju was cursed at for getting on my bad side.

1063
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,220
So I'm so sorry about that.

1064
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,220
To Geumju.

1065
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,220
What are you talking about?

1066
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

1067
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,220
Geumju.

1068
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,220
Yes?

1069
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,220
It's not your fault.

1070
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,220
What are you looking at so deeply?

1071
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,220
You'll be in big trouble if you get caught by Seonhwa.

1072
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,220
Here.

1073
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:54,220
What? Why are you giving this to me?

1074
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,220
Go with Yuna.

1075
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,220
I'm going to the concert.

1076
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,220
I'm going to the concert.

1077
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,220
I'm going to the concert.

1078
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,220
I'm going to the concert.

1079
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,220
I'm going to the concert.

1080
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,220
What's wrong with her?

1081
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,220
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

1082
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,220
Geumju, answer the phone.

1083
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,220
Geumju.

1084
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,220
Geumju.

1085
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,220
Geumju.

1086
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,220
Geumju.

1087
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,220
Geumju.

1088
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,220
Geumju.

1089
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,220
That can't be.

1090
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,220
That can't be.

1091
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,220
Geumju.

1092
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,220
Geumju.

1093
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,220
Here are the photos of your colleagues.

1094
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,220
Geumju.

1095
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,220
Geumju.

1096
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,220
Geumju.

1097
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:16,220
I don't remember.

1098
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,220
Why isn't she answering her phone?

1099
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,220
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

1100
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,220
Oh, my God.

1101
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,220
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

1102
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:44,220
What kind of crazy bastard is he?

1103
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,220
It's time for the plane.

1104
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,220
Let's just take the luggage and go.

1105
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,220
Oh, my God.

1106
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,220
Oh, my God.

1107
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,220
Oh, my God.

1108
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,220
Oh, my God.

1109
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,220
Oh, my God.

1110
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,220
Geumju.

1111
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,220
Geumju.

1112
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,220
Oh, my God.

1113
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:45,220
I'm still in love

1114
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:48,220
I can't stop now

1115
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:52,220
I run to you

1116
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:56,220
I miss you when I call your name

1117
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:00,220
The nights I couldn't sleep

1118
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:03,220
I won't go back again

1119
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:11,220
Cause I still love you

1120
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,220
It was you

1121
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,220
I

1122
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,220
I remember

1123
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,220
Eujoon

1124
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,220
I

1125
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:08,220
I want to quit drinking

1126
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:15,220
I thought I could do it if I just had my heart

1127
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:20,220
I thought I could do it

1128
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:27,220
But I wasn't

1129
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:32,220
I'm so embarrassed

1130
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:36,220
I can't live like this

1131
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:52,220
So that's why you wrote it

1132
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:56,220
That's what you wrote

1133
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,220
Yeah

1134
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,220
I wanted to help

1135
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:06,220
I thought that was your true heart

1136
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,220
That's right

1137
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:16,220
I want to quit drinking and live a good life

1138
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,220
So

1139
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,220
Help me

1140
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,220
Eujoon

1141
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:28,220
I'm still in love

1142
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:33,220
I can't stop now

1143
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:38,220
I run to you

1144
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:43,220
I miss you when I call your name

1145
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:47,220
The nights I couldn't sleep

1146
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:51,220
I won't go back again

1147
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,220
Cause I

1148
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:56,220
Blackout is a symptom of alcohol addiction

1149
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,220
It's a kind of warning that your body sends

1150
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:04,220
You can take a social issue later

1151
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:08,220
To understand the cause of blackout

1152
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,220
First, alcohol is an influence on the brain

1153
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,220
I found it

1154
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,220
Seo Eujoon, you bastard

1155
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:25,220
I'm sorry

1156
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:52,220
What? Seo Eujoon?

1157
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,220
You're not trying to avoid me, are you?

1158
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:56,220
No way. I'm guilty

1159
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,220
Han Geunju

1160
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,220
Dating?

1161
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:02,220
It's so hard to quit drinking

1162
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:04,220
Just hold on for a week

1163
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:06,220
I'll do whatever you want

1164
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:09,220
He must have completely fallen for you

1165
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,220
Why didn't you contact me when you said you would

1166
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,220
Why did you break up with me?

1167
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,220
I still don't understand

1168
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,220
Why we had to get away from each other

1169
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,220
I can only see you
