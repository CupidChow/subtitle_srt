But instead, he got a reduced sentence

You're so pretty.

183
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,760
Come on... It's like I put a spell on you.

184
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,510
Yeah, I'm under your spell.

185
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,880
You're so pretty right now, too.

186
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,700
Right now?

187
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,350
I don't even have much makeup on right now...

188
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,380
Geum Ju.

189
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,500
Your mom wanted me to bring you this.

190
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,350
Oh, thanks.

191
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,070
Thank you.

192
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,080
Why are you right next to
each other in this big room?

193
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,540
What?

194
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,580
We're not.

195
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,470
Well, we just happened to be standing together.

196
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,520
Oh, you're looking at a photo album! My gosh!

197
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,100
Right, you two took a photo together back then.

198
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,500
Dad, you want to look with us?
Yeah, let's.

199
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,710
You've already seen all these photos.
You can go down now.

200
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,070
There's nothing to do downstairs.

201
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,910
You have lots to do. Dishes, for example.

202
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,770
It's fine. Are you two going to
do something once I leave?

203
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,490
What are you talking about?

204
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,860
Wouldn't it be nice to look at the photos together?

205
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,240
Dad, you've seen them all before. Look at them later.

206
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,120
Gosh, I have nothing to do...

207
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
You need to do laundry, Dad! Woodworking, too.

208
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,550
What's with you?

209
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,430
What am I doing?

210
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,910
What is this?

211
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,940
What's wrong with the car?

212
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,920
This is the road CCTV and black
box footage from the accident.

213
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,220
As you can see, the car didn't
stop at the red light,

214
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,820
sped through, then crashed.

215
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,080
The bumper and bonnet were damaged and the airbags were deployed.

216
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,130
The driver is claiming sudden
unintended acceleration.

217
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,120
He wants to file a damages lawsuit,

218
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,180
so the vehicle was transferred from Myeongju Center to headquarters for analysis.

219
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,350
This could affect the company's image.

220
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,200
Manager Han, review thoroughly without error.

221
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,220
Yes, I'll review it thoroughly

222
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,010
and discuss with the analysis and legal teams.

223
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,970
Anything?
Not yet.

224
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,730
How about now?
Let me try.

225
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,350
Look. In the Seohae Bridge incident,

226
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,480
all signs pointed to sudden acceleration.

227
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,520
So, I think there might be some kind of error.

228
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,560
Step on it.

229
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,580
Stepping on it now.

230
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,410

He goes wild whenever he's conscious.

239
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,400
First, sedate him.

Yes.

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,650
She took care of my father
while he was incarcerated.

258
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,770
She said she hadn't heard
anything since his release.

263
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,730
do you really need to keep searching for him?

264
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,440
If he were to come back,
he would've done so by now.

265

If he could be found, you'd have found him already.

266

I told you already. You should let it go now.

Maybe you know her.

I looked into her background, and you were college classmates.

Please convince her to stay.

291
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,640
Why are you asking Seon Hwa to convince her?

292
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,820
Because she won't take my calls!

293
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,530
That's why you-
Why should I convince her?

294
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,330
They can quit a sport whenever they want.

But they love it, and they're really good.

296
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,240

the sight of him. Let's just eat.

305
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,080
He was too drunk to remember anything from that day.

306
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,930
If I get involved now, I'll just end up reigniting it.

307
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,500
Better to let it die out.

308
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,600
Will it die out? It's life or death for him.

309
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,100
I said leave it. It takes two to tango.

310
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,350
I told you. I'm done with Hyeon Ju for good.

it wasn't a vehicle defect,

so I'll go and deliver the news in person.

318
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,720
Is that standard?
Not necessarily.

319
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,630
But that driver's livelihood depends on it.

320
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,410
If I don't explain it clearly in person,

321
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,470

I overheard his drunk friends saying

Yeah. She already knew about you and Hyeon Ju.

you and cut ties with her.

As you'll see in the report,

00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,280
there was no problem with the brakes.

573
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,400
But if you check the CCTV
footage from the accident,

574
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,390
you'll notice the brake lights never turned on.

575
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,490
The analysis shows

576
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,240
the driver was only pressing
the accelerator, not the brake.

577
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,180
What?
It seems the driver mistook

578

the accelerator for the brake
