00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,030
Will you be okay? Won't it be too tough?

367
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,200
No.

368
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,450
I think it'd be tougher not to see you often.

369
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,990
Yes, that sounds tough.

370
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,220
I can be quite addictive.

371
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,410
Fine. I'll stop.

372
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,930
I'll stop.

373
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,510
I'll stop!

When did I fall asleep?

389
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,850
Wait, more importantly,

390
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,880
did I sleep alone?

391
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,960
If I said...

392
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,320
I was going to drink this coffee
but didn't drink it,

393
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,890
how do you think it would've felt? His heart...

394
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,090
probably burned to soot, right?

395
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,760
Like this color...

396
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,870
Huh?
That's how my heart feels.

397
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,830
Burnt to a crisp. I mean...

398
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,420
You said you wanted to be with me.

399
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,280
So, how could you let me sleep alone?

400
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,600
How could you just let me sleep like that?

401
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,620
Who left you to sleep?

402
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,160
You passed out cold.

403
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,530
You should've woken me up!

404
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,720
I was... I was...

405
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,290
fully prepared, emotionally.

406
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,100
So what if you were ready emotionally?

407
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,170
You looked so exhausted.

408
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,850
I felt guilty for even suggesting
we spend the night.

409
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,700
Yeah?

410
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,000
What?

411
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,570
You don't have to feel guilty anymore.

412
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,120
I'm...

413
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,850
fully rested now.

414
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,730
Huh?

415
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:33,550
You don't have to hold back anymore.

416
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,590
What...

417
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,300
Who's there?

418
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,010
What, what?
What is this?

419
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,460
A live octopus?

420
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,680
Are you okay?

421
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,750
Gosh, they probably saw everything, right?

422
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,880
Yeah.

423
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,720
They left all this here.
Of course, they saw everything.

424
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,970
Who is it? Who takes care of you like this?

425
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,890
Right. The head nurse?

426
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,160
She already knows about us.

427
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Since she knows, she wouldn't
have made such a fuss...

428
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,280
Right...

429
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,980
Gosh, who could it be?

430
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,940
Wait.

431
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,950
Wait...

432
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,220
I've seen this somewhere before.

433
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,760
Delicious.

434
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,820
Thanks to you, we're feasting.

435
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,490
Sure.

436
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,750
If you've got something to say, just say it.

437
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,460
Well, I've been seriously debating

438
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,790
whether to say this or not...

439
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,350
You'll say it anyway, so just say it.

440
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,290
Don't be shocked, everyone.

441
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,940
This morning,

442
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,850
I went to Ui Jun's house. Guess what I saw?

443
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,830
Gosh, I feel too embarrassed to say.

444
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,620
What? What did you see?

445
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,710
It's just...

446
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,110
Like this.

447
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:28,220
She was seducing him with a sly look,

448
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,750
and pounced on him!

449
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,980
Who? Who did?

450
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,660
Geum Ju!

451
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,520
May I talk to her for a moment?

452
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,090
Enjoy the food!

453
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,960
What?
What was that?

454
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,320
Hey, hey. What's going on?

455
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,490
Let me go!

456
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,500
Let go! Why are you doing this?

457
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,120
Please keep it a secret.

458
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,550
Please?

459
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,710
I'm begging you, Ahjumma.

460
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,140
You should've stayed in your lane.

461
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,630
How dare you go after one and only one in Bochun?

462
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,220
The most precious thing!

463
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,650
Falling in love isn't a crime.

464
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,030
Look at you.

465
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,370
This is a crime, all right.

466
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,200
It's criminal!

467
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,570
Excuse me?

468
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,640
There's no need to call it criminal.

469
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,620
Sure, love knows no status.

470
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,130
But not in this case.

471
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,020
Status matters in this case.

472
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,850
You two are on different levels. Different levels.

473
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,060
Gosh, listen to this. Seriously?

474
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,210
Don't you think you're being too harsh?

475
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,210
What's harsh is not what I said

476
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,310
but your lack of shame.

477
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,190
Even if you're horny,

478
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,400
how dare a mutt try to mount a purebred Jindo?

479
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,300
What? What did you say? Horny? A mutt?

480
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,820
What's wrong with calling a mutt a mutt?

481
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,140
Dae Geun is a mutt!

482
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,450
Yes, Dae Geun is a mutt.

483
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,990
Huh?
And he had taste, apparently.

484
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,510
He tried to hump the one and only

485
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,400
purebred Jindo in Bochun.

486
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,970
He pounced on Jin Soon,

487
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,320
and I had to yank him off her with all my might.

488
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,070
Jin Soon was given to us as a gift when

489
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,970
Bochun and Jindo became sister cities.

490
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,530
Because of Dae Geun, our two cities

491
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,790
almost became enemies, not sisters.

492
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,660
How many times did I tell you
to keep him under control?

493
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,700
I had a bad feeling the moment
you named him Dae Geun.

494
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,750
Right, we really messed up naming him that.

495
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,980
And because of all that,

496
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,700
I couldn't even bring Ui Jun live octopus today.

497
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,910
Oh, I see. You couldn't go.

498
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,790
Then, who brought Ui Jun live octopus?

499
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,450
Why? Why are you wondering that?

500
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,360
Huh? No.

501
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,390
I'm not curious at all.

502
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,960
Then, who could've brought Ui Jun...

503
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,640
Whatever. As long as it's not her.

504
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,840
Gosh, what's this?

505
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,300
Who's smoking on the streets?

506
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,670
What?

507
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,090
Unni?

508
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,860
I thought you quit?

509
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,940
Yeah. Well, I started again.

510
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,160
Thanks to some psycho bitch.

511
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,630
What?

512
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,620
Who are you talking about?

513
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,700
You.

514
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,620
Me?
Yes.

515
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,030
You, psycho bitch.

516
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,270
Wait, what?

517
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,310
This bitch...
Aigoo, wait...

518
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,470
Unni, why are you doing this?

519
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,990
Why am I doing this? Why?

520
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,540
Hello, what are you doing here?

521
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,890
Hey, take this to Ui Jun's place. Quick.

522
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,900
Okay.

523
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,670
Dae Geun, get off her!

524
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,390
Who does Dae Geun take after?

525
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,970
Dae Geun takes after you, apparently.

526
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,200
Blinded by lust.

527
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,080
How dare you two-time both Seon Uk and Ui Jun?

528
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,280
I'm going to make you pay two times!

529
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,300
Wait, wait.
Come here!

530
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,660
Wait, what are you talking about?

531
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,670
I'm not two-timing! I swear I'm not!

532
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,060
Really? You're not?
No! I swear!

533
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,930
It hurts.
Sorry, sorry.

534
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,170
You thought I'd give up?
How dare you play ignorant!

535
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,690
Unni, wait.

536
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,320
Tell me the truth. Spill!

537
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,640
Tell you what?

538
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,810
I know everything already. Tell me the truth!

539
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,030
What truth?

540
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,960
Noona!
Stop!

541
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,120
What, what, what? What's going on?

542
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,020
What, what, what?

543
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,180
Why are you doing this?

544
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,230
Hey, Seo Ui Jun.

545
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,900
Bong Seon Uk.

546
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,410
Both of you, listen up.

547
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,940
That femme fatale who's been playing you both.

548
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,240
I'm exposing Han Geum Ju's real identity!

549
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,480
No, that's not true!

550
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,790
I'm only dating Ui Jun!

551
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,360
I love Ui Jun only!

552
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,090
Whoa.

553
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,720
You two are dating?

554
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,430
What?

555
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,500
Chills.

556
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,840
What?

557
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,130
What did you just say?

558
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,170
5 days, 15 hours, 23 minutes, and 7 seconds.

559
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,920
That's how long our
secret relationship lasted.

560
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,780
I'm drained. My blood sugar is low.

561
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,600
Why chocolate?

562
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,180
Isn't Ui Jun sweet enough?

563
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,140
Of course. Geum Ju,
why don't you change your name?

564
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,220
From Geum Ju to Geum Falls-in-Love-Easily!

565
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,850
Why are bad premonitions always right?

566
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,240
I'll change my name to Geum Falls-in-Love-Easily.

567
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
I fell in love with her first.

568
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,950
Whoa...

569
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,020
Now, what's this?

570
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,380
I became the female lead
of a romantic novel.

571
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,350
Gosh, Geum Ju, you've got skills.

572
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,670
How did you seduce Ui Jun?

573
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,420
Are you sure you didn't beg him to date you?

574
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,280
I begged her.

575
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,120
To date me.

576
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,600
And the exposition was a dazzling fantasy.

577
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,040
Geez Louise!

578
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,110
But just one thing...

579
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,890
If we can just cut out my mom,
Kim Gwang Ok, from the story...

580
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,030
Mom.
You missed the last train?

581
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,720
Sleeping over at Mi Yeon's?

582
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
How dare you...

583
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,400
lie like that?

584
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,300
I would've loved it if you were honest with me.

585
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,930
What brought you home today?

586
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:54,490
You can hang out with Ui Jun more,
and come home tomorrow.

587
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,420
Oh, my. Is this from Ui Jun?

588
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,360
Wow, so pretty.

589
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,900
Don't you meddle with my love life ever again.

590
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,650
If you do that again,

591
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,120
I'll leave Bochun.

592
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,140
I won't ever see you again. Got it?

593
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,240
He really sounded like he was ready to cut me off.

594
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,640
Gosh, I guess I need to step back.

595
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,800
Anyway, I feel so bad for Geum Ju,
you, and your parents.

596
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,110
I'm mortified.

597
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,380
Why did you have to grab her by the neck?

598
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Because I thought she was two-timing
them and lost my head.

599
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,090
I was holding back, even though
I thought Seon Uk was too good for her.

600
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,510
What?

601
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,350
Geum Ju broke off her engagement.

602
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,130
But if Seon Uk likes her,

603
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,530
I figured I'd let it go as long as they're happy.

604
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,790
It's not like she's divorced, I thought to myself.

605
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,130
Gosh, what am I even saying right now?

606
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,470
Hyeon Ju, I'm sorry if that upset you.

607
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,620
But...

608
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,560
please understand.

609
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Seon Uk is not just any little brother to me.

610
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,070
When our parents divorced and we got abandoned,

611
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,950
he was scared I'd abandon him, too,

612
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,810
as he held my hand tightly, so I made a vow.

613
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,580
That I'd raise him right.

614
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,770
That I'd make a life for him
that is the envy of others.

615
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,980
You know everything I went through for him.

616
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,050
I-I do know.

617
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:49,130
I really wanted to pair him with an amazing woman.

618
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,500
I'm so curious who this woman is.

619
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,190
If he said no to the credit union employee,

620
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,430
she has to be much younger and prettier, right?

621
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,300
Didn't you say you'd let it go?

622
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,460
Seon Uk has very high standards, you know.

623
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,820
Big scoop...
What are you smiling about?

624
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,370
Are braised ribs funny to you?

625
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,160
Wow...

626
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,140
No. Your daughter's the funny one.

627
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,420
She was determined to go to Seoul,

628
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,870
but now, she's not going because of Ui Jun.

629
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,210
Wow...

630
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,850
You're that happy?
Yes, I'm so happy. So happy I can die.

631
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,490
It's none other than Ui Jun we're talking about.

632
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,720
What do you think? You're totally on board, right?

633
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,710
No. I'm not.

634
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,690
I think our Geum Ju could do way better.

635
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,490
Whatever.

636
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,790
I'm heading out.

637
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,030
Mom, are you going somewhere?

638
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:53,170
Yeah, I'm taking some braised ribs for Ui Jun.

639
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,050
They say a mother-in-law's love
for her son-in-law...

640
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,590
Oh, my, my!

641
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,120
What did I just say?

642
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,500
See you later.

643
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,750
She's so happy. She's really on cloud nine.

644
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,710
Of course, she is.

645
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:12,300
So, I hope you find a nice partner soon, too.

646
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,590
It's okay. Don't be greedy.

647
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,490
Thanks for making time.

648
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,280
Of course.

649
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,590
What did you want to talk about?

650
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,780
Here.

651
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,700
Leonardo Tee Couple-io?

652
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,110
This is a real club?

653
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,270
I thought of you two with each stitch.

654
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,680
It made me so happy.

655
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,240
Thank you so much.

656
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,450
How could I ever repay you for this?

657
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:13,370
Just make sure you make Dr. Seo happy.

658
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,900
That's all I want.

659
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,630
Okay...

660
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,300
Yeong Rong told me

661
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,780
that you deeply care for Ui Jun.

662
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,080
Yes. And I plan to treat you the same.

663
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,660
Pardon?

664
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,460
It's okay. I'm good.

665
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,280
Yes, Rose in the Night?

666
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,890
Okay, I'm heading over.

667
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,390
Sorry,

668
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,400
I've got another club meeting.

669
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,900
I'll get going.
Okay.

670
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,740
Please...

671
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,130
make Dr. Seo happy.

672
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,400
Promise me.
Okay.

673
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,950
Wow, she switched up so quickly.

674
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,070
Whoa, what a character.

675
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:36,820
♪ If I were to list the reasons I like you ♪

676
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:42,360
♪ I would need all night to count them ♪

677
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,400
♪ Like star candy I loved as a kid ♪

678
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,280
I've only watched tourists in Bochun ride these.

679
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,760
I never thought I'd go on one.

680
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,190
How did you come up with such a romantic date?

681
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,820
Hey, seriously, is there anything you can't do?

682
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,160
There was one thing.

683
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,440
But that recently changed.

684
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,970
And what's that?

685
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,820
Making Han Geum Ju my girl.

686
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,310
My girl.

687
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,120
Wow, I can't believe we're wearing matching tops,

688
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,180
going full public with our relationship...

689
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,140
It all feels like a dream, right?

690
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,000
Look. Look at this sky.

691
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,910
This sunlight.

692
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,340
Wow, this air...

693
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,030
And you.

694
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,630
So unreal, don't you think?

695
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,100
I feel drunk, even though
I haven't had a single drop.

696
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,660
Right?

697
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,280
I feel drunk, too.

698
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,540
What?

699
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,540
Drunk on you.

700
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,870
♪ I saw you standing by the river ♪

701
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,570
♪ Something I believe inside you ♪

702
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:22,880
♪ You're a spark that appeared in thunder ♪

703
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:29,940
♪ My love, I'll be here ♪

00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,530

♪ If somewhere in the soil,

707
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,210
You should give up now.

708
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,570
I came to say that.

709
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,360
Yes, I'd better reject him firmly.

710
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,170
Be firm.

711
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,590
Wow, my heart almost exploded

712
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,800
b-because of how pretty you are.

713
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,010
Stop it.

714
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,250
Why did you dress up so much?

715
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,140
You rented a car, too?

716
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,210
Yes. I wanted to impress you.

717
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,050
What?
Today's round one. Our first date.

718
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,240
Better score some points.

719
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,030
Get in. You're in for a full-course date.

720
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,410
Huh?

721
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,310
Okay...

722
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,500
Byeong Jun!
Oh, no!

723
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,460
It's dangerous!

724
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,810
Let's go, let's go.

725
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:55,590
There... Let's go...

726
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,020

730
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,190
He's got plans.

731
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,720

to come to HR for confirmation.

What?

846
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,090
That wasn't assault. That was clearly self-defense.

847
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,300
Shoving him during physical contact
can be considered self-defense.

848
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,570
But any additional violence
is classified as assault,

But once a report is filed,

852
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,870

action regarding an assault case.
