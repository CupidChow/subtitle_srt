They'll go all out drinking.

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,230
The hell will unfold...

184
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,770
What are you doing tomorrow?

185
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,320
It's the weekend. To encourage Geum Ju,

186
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,470
how about we all go and get fresh air?

187
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,860
What's with this guy?

188
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,620
Where are we going?

189
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,620
Somewhere there's no booze.

190
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,340
What's he saying?

191
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,620
Where in this country could we not find booze?

192
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,900
There is. A place we're not allowed to drink.

[Drinking Prohibited]

194

[Wild Flower Habitat: Drinking Prohibited]
There is a place you're not supposed to drink.

195
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,570
What do you think?

196
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,940
It's a perfect place for Geum Ju,
who decided to be sober, right?

197
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,510
Not sure...

198
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,670
she even drank at a sobriety camp.

199
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,780
Hey, you really can't drink here.

200
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,960
If you do, you'll be arrested immediately.

201
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,010
That'll never happen.

202
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,270
I'll hold out for a week, no matter what.

203
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,370
A week?

204
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,310
Yeah. If I stay sober for a week,

205
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,210
he said he'd grant me anything I wanted.

206
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,050
A week? Anything you want?
Yup.

207
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,440

Daebak.
What do you mean?

210
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,890
Hey! Why do you think he's making
such an empty promise?

211
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,060
There's no way he'd keep his word.

212
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,980
I'm sure she's determined now.

213
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,440
But how long could our drunkard Han Geum Ju last?

214

Hey! Come on! Just wait and see.

215
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,480
I'll really show you.

216
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,370
And you! You can't take it back.

217
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,860
You'd better not say, "No, no, I'm not doing it."

218
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,230
"No, no." I'm not doing that.

He says he'd grant you anything

I'm just curious.

252
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,600
If it was that easy, why did he
ghost you all this time?

Why did you guys cut ties, anyway?

Yes. Hello.

How neat.

290
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,440
I thought she was a helper.

291
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,480
I almost didn't recognize her.

292
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,140

She was an ace of all aces

She was super successful.

After the meeting...

298
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,710
She got promoted first out of our colleagues.

299

CEO.

300
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,470
And she got married first, too.

301
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,120
Although she divorced first, too.

302
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,620
Divorced?
Yeah.

303
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,500
I guess it was a total scam.

304
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,180
Her husband made tons of money in stocks

305
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,130
and got arrested for corporate crime.

306
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,200
I heard he took out tons of loans
under Hyeon Ju's name, too.

When you're making it so obvious?

320

What are you going to do?
She's my sister's friend.

321
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,460
Your wife is your friend's sister.

322
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,620
That's not the same.

I almost killed you, too,

325

but you're still alive like this.

Are you preparing for "Show Me the Money"

It's also about my sister.

What are you going to do about it?

Hey!
They're here.

339
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,100
You got all cocky and passed us. You only got this far?

340
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,970
Wow.
How can we pass this beautiful view?

Wait.

352

Yeah. I'm at the peak...

So, Geum Ju, let's stay sober.*
(Geumju means "no drinking" in Korean)

361
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,150
You can do it. Fighting!

362
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,840
Fighting! You can do it.

363
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,530
So, cheer up.

364
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,420
It's too bad you didn't win twice in a row.

365
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,360
But you can win again next year.

366
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,900
I got it.

367
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,890
Hey, the DIY car competition
doesn't end this year. Right?

368
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,100
Did you come all the way here to say that?

369
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,290
No.

370
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,550

It is. It's amazing.

375
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,590
As good as your healing spot, Lake Bochun,

376
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,310

377
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,100
It is.

378
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,080
It's totally amazing.

379
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,610
Let's cheer up here while we're in Seoul.

380
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,290
Sure. Let's do that.

381
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,940
Thanks.

382

388
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,230
Huh?

389
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,370
The day I was upset about not winning
the DIY car competition.

390
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,410
I just thought of that day.

391
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,300
Yeah. I remember that.

392
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,440
It was so amazing there, too.

393
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,060
Did you go there again?

394
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,170
Since that time while you were in Seoul?

395
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,400
Yeah.

396
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,200
Well, at times?

397
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,320
Hey, you'll catch a cold as you cool down.

398
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,120
I have many patients at the clinic besides you.

399
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,020
So, hurry up and zip up.

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,300

The reason I felt comforted there

414
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,850
wasn't because of the night view.

We're going to a concert,
but I have nothing to wear.

Hey, how about this one?

Wow!

It totally brightens your face.

432
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,560
Your husband will fall for you again.

433
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,040
What?

434
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,620
Gosh, that can't happen.

435
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,660

You have it so good, girl.

445
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,690
Go and try it on.
Okay.

446
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,560
You should test your liver like me.

447
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,160
I bet your liver numbers are no joke.

448
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,160
Try some.

449
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,980
An uncle in Byeongcheon

450
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,500
made it himself and sent it to us.
Wow!

00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,730
Wow! The liver is melting in my mouth!

452
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,810
Not this liver. Worry about your liver.

453
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,540
You'll be in big trouble. You'll regret it.

Gosh, come on!

455
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:40,380
Hyungnim, I don't want to live long.

456
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,450
I'll just eat and drink like this and die.

457
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,620
How much longer would I live anyway?

458
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,900
Hyungnim, I think you're the one regretting.

459
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,600
You look like you're regretting
more than when you lost

460
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,650
your junkyard and the restaurant.

461
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,700

Hyungnim will start drinking in a month.

What else?

466
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,160
Looks like you have a lot of money.

467
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,700
Why do you waste your money on daily interest?

468
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,230
What do you mean it's nonsense?

469
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,260
He must be rolling in dough to sit around at a store,

470
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,650

00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,900
G-Gwang Ok, why are you doing this?

472
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,940
Why?

473
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,510
Don't you have money to throw away?

474
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,080
Instead of helping someone trying to quit,

475
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,550
you encourage him to drink?

476
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,290
A-A-Aigoo... that wasn't it...

477
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,940
Hey, there's a good eel place nearby.

478
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,340
That's great. Let's get some. It's my treat.

479
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,600
Why would you buy?

480
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,430
What do you mean why?
You all made time today for me.

481
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,300
I should repay.

482
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,500
This is how great a person I am.

483
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,450
Put that great person away for now.

484
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,630
Gosh, I'm tired. I just want to go home and rest.

485
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,160
Why? Let's eat and go.

486
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,210
Wow, this place has awesome eel.

487
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,340
We're about to die from exhaustion.

488
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,540
This guy. The driver, Ui Jun, must be exhausted.

489
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,460
Let's go get some eel.

490
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,430
What? "No, no, I don't want to."

491
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,580
You would've said that repeatedly.

492
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,900
What do you mean? She wants
to eat because we're tired.

493
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,000
The chondroitin sulfate found
in eel is good for joints.

494
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,420
And carnosine is excellent
for reducing muscle fatigue.

495
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,480
It's good to eat on days like today
when we walked a lot.

496
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,690
It's my assessment as a doctor.

497
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,470
I-Is that right?

498
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,260
It must be. He's Dr. Seo.

499
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,920
Yeah!

Hey, wake Young Woong up.

501
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,980
He'd wake up right away
when he hears we're eating eel.

502
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,520
Geez, seriously.

503

Huh? What are you saying?
What?

Hey,

519
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,660
you should've checked your passengers
before you drove off.

520
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,290
Am I an express bus driver?
To check the number of passengers?

521
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,240
You said you'd be resting in the car first.

00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,610
What did you do?

523
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,040

C-Chestnuts? What are these?

525
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,230
There was a chestnut picking
event, so I did. So what?

526
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,260
You know how much Hwa Yeong likes chestnuts.

My goodness.

If it weren't for those chestnuts,

529
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,090

00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,100
Tell them off and say, "Will you
be responsible if I die like this?"

712
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,800
Hey. Who's going to die, anyway?

713
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,120
Did you forget about your liver?

714
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,200
If it gets worse, it's really dangerous.

715
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,730
You should take this situation seriously.

716
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,010
Gosh! I got it, I got it.

717
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,360
I'll take this seriously. Aigoo...

718
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,800
You wanted to meet,
so you can nag, huh? Aigoo...

719
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,670
I have to go now.

720
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,590
Hey, let's go together. I'll drive you.

721
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,360
I have to go to Seoul, too.

722
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,280
You go to Seoul often.

723
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,540
Like when I bumped into you at Han River.

724
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,640
Right. So, let's not go separately like last time

725
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,280
and waste gasoline. Let's go together.

Hey!

730
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,450
What are you thinking?

731
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,010
Pardon?

732
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,390
Just...

733
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,980
You're so pretty, Noona.

734
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,590
Really?

735
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,450
It was worth getting dolled up, then.

736
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,920
But what do I do? I feel bad for Seon Hwa.

737
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,870
Why should you? She gave them up voluntarily.

738
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,600
Just enjoy it.

739
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,220
Okay.

You're here for the concert, too.

744
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,730
Yeah.

745
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,820
We came to Bochun for this concert.

746
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,340
Since we missed his Seoul concert.

747
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,150
I see.

748
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,550

753
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,420
He just said, "Noona"...

754
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,060
Oh, he's younger by five years.

755
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,210
Say hi, babe.

00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,090

So, he's a divorcee, too?

00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,550
No way.

We'll go ahead.

765
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,540
Enjoy the concert.

00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,170
Bye now.

00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,510
Shall we go in, too?
Sorry for lying.

768
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,100
Don't be sorry. Noona, it's okay.

769
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,360
You go in first. Let me...

770
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,520
go to the restroom.

I thought she was a helper.

776
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,580
I almost didn't recognize her.

What can you do?

Why did you come here?

782
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,440
How about the concert?

783
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,230
That's no big deal.

784
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,520
I couldn't stand it without drinking.

785
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,610
I was so embarrassed.

786
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,820
About what?

787
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,980
You saw, too.

788
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,540
I guess I wanted to be
pretentious even to that extent.

789
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,710
Because I'm so shabby.

790
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,230
What do you mean shabby?

791
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,100
You're not shabby, Noona.

792
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,720
You were the prettiest out
of all the people at the concert.

797
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,660
And you have such a great personality.

What?

about wanting to quit.

Don't worry.

He insisted that I call you to come
since you're on his side now.

831
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,010
Is he trolling you when you took leave
for not getting the promotion?

832
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,600
Honestly, I was so nervous that you'd quit your job.

833
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,860
No way. I'd never make them happy by quitting.

834
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,090

00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,540
I'm in front of the hospital.

895
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,010
What?

896
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,580
What brings you to Seoul?

897
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,830
I came to see you, Sunbae.

898
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,190
Huh? You came to see me?

899
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,190
That makes no sense.

900
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:18,570
You came for something else
and are trying to kill time.

901
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,340
Gosh, how can you say that...

902
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,000
so exactly correctly?

903
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,530
Are you a doctor or a shaman?

904
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,080
How are you doing these days?

905
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,860
You're doing well, right?

906
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,590
Let's meet and talk.

907
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:32,360
Yeah.

908
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,360
Hurry up. I'll be waiting.

909
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,940
I saw Dr. Seo Ui Jun.

910
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,070
What? Dr. Seo Ui Jun?

911
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,250
Didn't you say he works outside of Seoul?

912
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,150
Yeah. I thought he'd be stuck in the countryside.

913
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,440
I wonder what he's doing in Seoul.

914
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,740
He's not trying to come back here, is he?

915
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,760
Gosh, no way. After what he did?

916
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,500
He's afraid of that, and that's why he's in hiding.

917
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,680
Okay, take this starting with this side this time.

918
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,270

921

All right, let's call it a night.

922
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:00,100
I think you're drunk. I'll call a driver.

923
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,860
No, no... I'm still perfectly fine.

You can't even drink a glass, huh?

929
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,160
Yes.

930
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,240

942

Excuse me?

944
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:20,770
Why else would you quit drinking, Ms. Han?

945
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,350
Because you couldn't get the promotion,

946
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,490
I thought you left out of anger.

947
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,330
I guess that wasn't it. Why?

948
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:29,360
Did the hospital tell you to take it easy?

949
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,430
No-
You can fool a ghost, but not me.
