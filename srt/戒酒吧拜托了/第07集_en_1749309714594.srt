her talent is going to be wasted.

Once I get my deposit back...

367
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,260
Geez, I'm so pissed!

368
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,170
If only we knew, we would've stormed

369
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,910
into his wedding and did something.

370
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,240
We could've blocked his wedding car

371
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,600
so he couldn't go on his honeymoon. Right?

372
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,040
Sounds like her parents found out a while ago.

373
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,550
Must've been a huge shock.

374
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,660
For Hyeon Ju, too.

375
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,330
Listen to him. Of course.

376
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,950
Gosh, the whole family must've been down.

377
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,990
That's why she wants to go back to work sooner.

378
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,670
So she can go back to Seoul soon.

379
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,340
Probably.

380
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,860
Bong Seon Uk, you better repent.

381
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,680
W-Why are you picking on me?

382
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,020
You had no idea yet

383
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,230
you nagged her to quit
drinking and get it together.

384
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,140
You were the worst. Don't you feel bad at all?

385
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,320
Of course, I do.

386
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,100
I feel really bad.

387
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,740
Young Woong, watch Hwa Yeong later.

388
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,450
I need to go see a fortuneteller.

389
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,680
Fortuneteller?
Yeah, there's a fortuneteller

390
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,070
in Bochun, who's famous for being spot on.

391
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,890
People are swarming to see her.

392
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,070
I barely got an appointment.

393
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,670
I want to ask her

394
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,800
when my brother will get married.

395
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,100
Noona, can I go see the fortuneteller?

396
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,200
What? Why? You want to ask her directly?

397
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,340
Yes, I feel bad for Geum Ju.

398
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,610
I can't believe what happened.

399
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,250
If she says Geum Ju has bad luck,
I'll get her a talisman

400
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,140
and even host a ritual for her.

401
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,660
True.

402
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,940
Poor Geum Ju.

403
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,140
Fine, I'll text you the place and time.

404
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,190
But you better ask when
you're getting married, got it?

405
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,830
Got it.

406
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,010
Make sure you ask her.

407
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,370
Got it.

408
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,210
I'm leaving.

409
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,420
Hey.
Huh?

410
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,000
You'll really go to a fortuneteller?

411
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
You believe in that stuff?

412
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,750
Why? Seon Hwa said she's spot on.

413
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,980
Let's go.

414
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,180
No way.

415
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,060
So, if she says something bad,

416
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,490
and you get her a talisman and a ritual...

417
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,470
Yeah, Geum Ju will just love that.

418
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,360
Geum Ju.

419
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,970
Yes?

420
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,020
Why are you packing already?

421
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,500
It's not like you're leaving tomorrow.

422
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,820
I just want to be prepared.

423
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,390
Geum Ju.
Yes?

424
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,200
Make sure you pack this, too.

425
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,830
What's this?

426
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,600
[Deposit/Withdrawal Record]

427
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,160
[Deposit: 300,000 won]

428
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,830
It's the spending money you sent us.

429
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,050
We saved all of it.

430
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,100
Except for the 300,000 won

431
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,390
your dad secretly used to pay off a bar tab.

432
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,480
I got caught and got scolded badly.

433
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,290
So, I saved up my allowance
and paid it back in full.

434
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,740
You didn't have to do this.

435
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,170
I told you to spend it when you need it.

436
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,480
Why did you save it all up?

437
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,940
Don't worry about it.

438
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,710
Use it toward your new place.

439
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,440
Make sure it's close to work. Somewhere downtown.

440
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,420
Mom...

441
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,280
Dad...

442
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,260
Take this, too.

443
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,180
I've barely used it.

444
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,150
You work at a big company.
You should carry a big-name purse.

445
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,730
You always carry cheap ones.

446
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,920
But this is your favorite..

447
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,730
When things get tough,

448
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,650
put down your ego and tell us everything.

449
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,370
Yes, lean on us when you're struggling.

450
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,000
Totally agree.

451
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,060
What's with you guys today?

452
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,090
It's not like I'm leaving forever.

453
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,790
You're making me emotional.

454
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,210
Thank you, everyone.

455
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,490
My daughter...

456
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,290
My baby daughter. Fighting.
Geum Ju!

457
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,310
Han Geum Ju!

458
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,900
Huh? Hey, what are you guys doing here?

459
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,210
We thought we could

460
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,250
have a BBQ party before Geum Ju heads to Seoul.

461
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,530
You went to a fortuneteller about my fortune?

462
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,700
Don't freak out.

463
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,600
You paid your dues, and it's
all good luck from here.

464
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,270
You're about to enter a lucky streak.
You'll win big time.

465
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,390
Really?

466
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,180
Yes, that's what she said.

467
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,640
I don't believe in fortunetelling
and tried to stop them,

468
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,150
but they insisted on going.

469
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,650
I'm glad we didn't listen to you.

470
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,510
We almost missed out on
hearing all that good stuff.

471
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,380
Right? She even refused to take our money.

472
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,000
Right? But she said once you make it big,

473
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,280
you'd better pay her back in multiples.
Gosh, seriously...

474
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,860
Really?

475
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,830
Come on, don't believe in that stuff.

476
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,670
Yes, ma'am.

477
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,100
Pardon?

478
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,790
Really?

479
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,220
Okay. Thank you.

480
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,290
Yes.

481
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,750
I'm so relieved.

482
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,050
What was that?

483
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,360
It was my realtor. They found a tenant.

484
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,690
Gosh, I'll finally get my deposit back.

485
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,200
All of a sudden, after all this time?

486
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,620
See?
The fortuneteller was right.

487
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,610
Your luck's turning around!

488
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,310
Thanks for checking my fortune,

489
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,770
but don't overhype lucky timing.

490
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:09,090
Come on. Timing is divine power at work.

491
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,850
Of course. There's a reason why she's famous.

492
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,310
Gosh, hallelujah!

493
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,450
I thought you went to church.

494
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,790
If it means my baby's doing well,
I'm sure God will understand.

495
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,410
Isn't that right? No?

496
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,860
You're right.

497
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,580
Amen!
Hallelujah!

498
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,560
Gosh...

499
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,850
My charger…

500
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,580
What's this?

501
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,750
How are Woo Ri and Na Rah doing?

502
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,380
Thank you, Yeong Jun's mom.

503
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,040
Yes, I'll pick them up later.

504
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,730
Okay.

505
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,090
I-I'm sorry, Noona.

506
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,860
With everything going on with your family,
you must have a lot on your mind.

507
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,160
I called and talked your ear off
about what I wanted to say.

508
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,620
No...

509
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,380
Let's talk about us later.

510
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,280
What? Really? Then, we will talk later, right?

511
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,570
So, you didn't plan on never
seeing me again, did you?

512
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,700
Didn't you come here today because of Geum Ju?

513
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,560
Yes, of course.

514
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,730
Ui Jun did most of the work,

515
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,160
but I will try my best.

516
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,030
So that Geum Ju can go back
to Seoul in high spirits.

Wow, you look like you're having so much fun!

Good job. That was a feat. Drink this.

534
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,800
Wait. Coke won't do, right?

535
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,620
Gosh, I'm feeling generous today.

536
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,860
You may all take a drink!

537

The liquor ban has been lifted!

538
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,600
What do you think, Ui Jun?

539
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,000
It's okay to have just one drink
on days like this, right?

540
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,700
But still...
No.

541
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,400
Regardless of what day it is,
I'm going to stay sober.

542
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,840
You said I'm entering a lucky streak.

543
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,440
I'm so happy without any booze.

544
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,240
Why would I need to drink?

545
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,610
Whoa.
