1
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,450
Nozaki, you haven't back home yet?

2
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,440
Ah, yeah.

3
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,700
Are you waiting for someone?

4
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,600
Eh?

5
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,390
Well, yeah.

6
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,100
Oh, yeah.

7
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,560
See you tomorrow then.

8
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,850
She is really coming up.

9
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,720
Nozaki, it's better if you stop putting your shoes in the locker.

10
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,720
I hate it.

11
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,050
No way.

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,710
What is she going to do tomorrow?

13
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,710
I'm sure that won't work.

14
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,710
That's impossible.

15
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,800
Be careful on the way.

16
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,990
Shit, that's filthy.

17
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,630
What are you looking at, ugly?

18
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,680
Nozaki, why don't you go back to Tokyo?

19
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,950
We will miss you.

20
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,330
I can't believe Aiba was taken away by an ugly girl like you.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,320
Have you ever thought about Taeko's feeling?

22
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,140
That's terrible.

23
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,800
Taeko, let's go home.

24
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,800
That's not cool.

25
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,110
Shut up!

26
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,440
Hey, let's make it clear.

27
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,060
I have told you, it's nothing to do with Aiba.

28
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,510
But ...

29
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,680
We already know it, right?

30
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,160
Yeah.

31
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,510
Let's go.

32
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,050
Ah, I found you, Sis!

33
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,340
Shou.

34
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,370
Shou!

35
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,020
Shou, don't cry.

36
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Don't cry.

37
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,770
Don't cry.

38
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,370
Don't cry.

39
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,400
Then why did you indicate

40
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,180
my students are bullying her?

41
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,580
Ms. Minami, Haruka is also one of your students, right?

42
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

43
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,910
Why you ...

44
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,870
Mr. Nozaki.

45
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,940
This school is going to be closed this year.

46
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,770
In these critical final days

47
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,610
it's better to keep things are in peacefully.

48
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,660
In this small-rural town.

49
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,030
Including me, just a mare ten odd students who will graduate this year.

50
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,880
Except me, they have been mixed up since childhood.

51
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,880
The future is also the same

52
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,370
they would always be together until they die.

53
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,800
(Go back and die!)

54
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,240
We are going to graduate in two months.

55
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,870
Liverleaf.

56
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,200
Let's go!

57
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,140
He deserve it.

58
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,250
Ms. Minami ...

59
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,720
There is something terrible in Nozaki's drawer desk.

60
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,770
Wow, disregarded!

61
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,600
Why did you do something so stupid?

62
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,490
Hey you, can you stop it?

63
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,750
It was not her who did it.

64
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,420
It was me, I'm the one who did it.

65
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,820
Brat.

66
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,970
What?

67
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,410
Brat!

68
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,360
What?

69
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,520
Ms. Minami!

70
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,390
Miss!

71
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,570
Gross!

72
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,330
Today, Kyon threw up again.

73
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,750
Kyon is a puke teacher.

74
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,060
She is throwing up!

75
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,170
Then she cleans it up by herself.

76
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,930
I'm home.

77
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,320
Welcome home.

78
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,880
Dad!

79
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,690
What happened to you?

80
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,060
He got kicked at school today.

81
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,460
Haruka.

82
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,130
Don't go to that school anymore.

83
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,320
You don't have to force yourself.

84
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,920
Because due to my job we had moved to this town.

85
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,690
I'm really sorry.

86
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,080
The graduation day will come soon.

87
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,120
Just stay at home and live safely.

88
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,670
I'm sure you will find good friends in high school.

89
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,670
Okay?

90
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,170
Hello, Grandpa?

91
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,260
Sister?

92
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,460
She's got a fever.

93
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:51,920
Let me see.

94
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,560
You still have a fever, just take a rest today.

95
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,310
Good girl.

96
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Sis, are you okay?

97
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,550
Yeah I'm okay, what about you?

98
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,700
Me? Of course, I'm okay.

99
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,060
Be careful on the way.

100
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,610
Well, it's getting interesting.

101
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,710
It looks like we are professionals.

102
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,990
You can get a job with this.

103
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,900
Hey Taeko

104
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,800
Nozaki hasn't come for three days.

105
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,100
Maybe she won't come to school anymore.

106
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,400
Who knows?

107
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,290
Let's send somebody to check on her.

108
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,670
We really like her, right?

109
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,650
Rumi!

110
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,710
Don't look this way.

111
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,710
That grin of hers, so disgusting as always.

112
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,000
You should convince her to come back to school tomorrow.

113
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,050
If you fail, you will be promoted to a target again.

114
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,820
Hurts!

115
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,600
Disgusting.

116
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,480
It's so disgusting.

117
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,860
Don't forget to take the loot.

118
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,770
First you tell her not to come then you tell her to come.

119
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,880
You girls are really terrible.

120
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,500
Shut up!

121
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,340
Do you really have a fever?

122
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,930
Yeah.

123
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,900
A-Are you feeling better?

124
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,160
Yeah.

125
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,990
That's a relief.

126
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,460
I'm sorry.

127
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,480
What a beautiful song, can I borrow it?

128
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,460
Sure.

129
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,280
Ah, I almost forgot.

130
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,160
Stop it!

131
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,110
What are you going to do with the pictures of me?

132
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,910
It's for my report.

133
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,910
I'm sorry.

134
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,320
Nozaki, you have already recovered, right?

135
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,540
Please come to school tomorrow.

136
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,640
I might be in trouble if you don't come.

137
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,500
In trouble?

138
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,810
I will be in trouble, troubled.

139
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,490
But, I'm not going to go to school anymore, so ...

140
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,170
Are you kidding me?

141
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,470
No way.

142
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,600
Nozaki, if you don't come to school ...

143
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,750
They will be targetting me.

144
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,450
This CD, does it really belong to her?

145
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,920
Yes, I borrowed it from her.

146
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,560
If it's yours, I will kill you.

147
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,120
Did she say anything?

148
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,450
She said we were pissing her off.

149
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,290
With the sick face she had, she wanted me to get out of her house quickly.

150
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,010
You didn't get lots of loots.

151
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,400
This can't be counted as evidence, right?

152
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,250
I thought you were taking pictures.

153
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,160
If that the case ...

154
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,440
Rumi, you will be the target.

155
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,380
Congratulations.

156
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,650
Taeko, what should we do with this CD?

157
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,720
Sis, who is he?

158
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,210
Your friend?

159
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,900
What are you taking pictures of?

160
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,830
Liverleaf.

161
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,830
Liverleaf?

162
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,940
These weeds, after surviving a harsh winter

163
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,920
they bloom and push away the snow.

164
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,740
When spring comes, this area will be covered in liverleaf.

165
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,640
Then, I can take good pictures.

166
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,760
You are so cool, Big bro!

167
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,340
Is she your sister?

168
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,850
Yes.

169
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,040
My name is Nozaki Shouko.

170
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,750
This town has nothing.

171
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,910
You also transferred school like me, right?

172
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,290
Since my granma lives in this town, so I ended up here.

173
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,360
I see.

174
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,390
Brother, will you like to take a picture of us?

175
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,530
Hey, don't mess around.

176
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,630
Sure.

177
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,630
Then, please stand over there.

178
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,650
It's the first time I take the human's picture.

179
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,170
I feel really nervous.

180
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,600
Get ready!

181
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,510
Taeko is going to be a beautician, right?

182
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,480
It's a good deal, that she's giving you a free haircut.

183
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,650
That's not the case either.

184
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,440
Your dull hairdo makes you looks gloomy.

185
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,040
Ah, I see.

186
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,740
What do you think, Rumi?

187
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,360
Are you relieved?

188
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,730
It feels nice and light.

189
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,070
I guess.

190
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,860
Don't give me that shit!

191
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,470
All you have to do is bring Nozaki back.

192
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:28,640
Okay.

193
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,250
Don't you just hate that girl, too?

194
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,320
What do you think?

195
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,730
I want to kill her.

196
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,170
What?

197
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,270
I want her to die.

198
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,050
Whoa, It's really a nice photo.

199
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,910
I want to go, too.

200
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,170
You can't go, you still have homework to do.

201
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,460
Come on! Dad will be home soon.

202
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,380
Sister!

203
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,950
I made this at school.

204
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,950
I thought I would give it to you.

205
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,010
It's so cute.

206
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,770
Actually, I wanted put in the cloverleaf, but

207
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,440
Thank you.

208
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,720
You two looks perfect together.

209
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:47,900
You little fool!

210
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,780
I'm leaving.

211
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,780
Have a nice day.

212
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,840
It's so beautiful.

213
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,840
If the snow comes, the view will be more beautiful.

214
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,050
I wonder when will the snow come.

215
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,120
The snow will come soon.

216
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,880
I'm sorry.

217
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,160
It's okay.

218
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,980
Nozaki!

219
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,610
Thank you for today.

220
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,600
You are welcome.

221
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,450
When spring comes, let's go to see the liverleaf.

222
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,040
Well, when spring comes, we will go.

223
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,530
Ah, aren't they ...

224
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,280
Nozaki!

225
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,360
I think there are still people inside.

226
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,430
- Danger, stand back! 
- Does she live here?

227
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,380
They are still there.

228
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,440
What are you guys doing? you two will die.

229
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,000
Nozaki!

230
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,030
Shouko!

231
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,030
Dad!

232
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,030
Mom!

233
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,340
Aiba!

234
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,140
Aiba!

235
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,830
What are you doing? go back!

236
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,750
Everyone, it's dangerous, back off!

237
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,800
Please step back.

238
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,910
She is still breathing.

239
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,150
Call an ambulance! Hurry up!

240
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,170
Nozaki!

241
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,810
Kazuo ���

242
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,970
your dad

243
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:10,990
in order to protect Shouko, he held her tightly in his arms.

244
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,440
Do you want me to help you move these up?

245
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,420
Put it over there, please.

246
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,130
Okay.

247
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,180
Taeko, your lunch box.

248
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,240
Thank you, mom.

249
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,950
The fire other day

250
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,170
looks like it was in your classmate's house.

251
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,420
I heard both her parents burnt to death.

252
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,220
That's so pathetic.

253
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,400
If you don't have a class today, visit her and give the condolences for me.

254
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,490
What's wrong?

255
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,000
Nothing, I'm leaving.

256
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,480
If they find out, we are over.

257
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,070
We are going to get caught.

258
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,540
It's okay, nothing to worry about.

259
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,930
No one see, there is no evidence.

260
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,360
Didn't your fingers burn?

261
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,520
It can be the evidence, right?

262
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,610
What kind of evidence is this?

263
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,760
What happened, are you guys scared?

264
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,930
Of course.

265
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,970
We fucking killed people.

266
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,940
Oh yeah, this all is Kuga's fault.

267
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,850
Don't say that.

268
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,740
I only planned to scare her a bit, I didn't think it goes that way.

269
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,800
But while they burned up, I can't bear to look them in the eyes.

270
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,000
However ...

271
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,640
Taeko, she wouldn't say that to anyone, right?

272
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,000
She absolutely wouldn't say that to anyone else.

273
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,580
I'm more worried about these two than her.

274
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,260
Hey, don���t cry.

275
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,220
If my parents know, I ...

276
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,410
I will die.

277
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,520
Hey Taeko.

278
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,480
Have you heard it?

279
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,910
Too bad, you went home other day

280
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,210
something awesome was happened.

281
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,260
I wish I could show you.

282
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,120
Could you please not touch my desk?

283
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,970
I want you to stop hanging out with Taeko before the graduation.

284
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,400
I thought you were disgusted by her, weren't you?

285
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,720
I want you to graduate with the happy feelings.

286
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,700
Don't get in any troubles.

287
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,120
I want to ask something to you.

288
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,430
Yes, what's it?

289
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,040
For you ...

290
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,300
what is Taeko to you?

291
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,720
What is she to me?

292
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,470
She is my friend, of course.

293
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,670
Why do you ask?

294
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,850
Taeko!

295
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,450
I want to dye my hair too.

296
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,940
There's no one in my house today, can you dye it for me?

297
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,740
Hey!

298
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,390
I'm home.

299
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,930
I heard it from your mother.

300
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,440
I won't let you go to school in Tokyo.

301
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,250
But there is no beautician's school here.

302
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,510
After you graduated from school

303
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,200
it's up to me to decide your future.

304
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,150
You are the one who decides my future?

305
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,690
Then, what about my dream?

306
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,950
Come on honey.

307
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,170
She even hasn't graduated from middle high yet.

308
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,910
Listen to me.

309
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,980
I'm not going to let you to live on your own.

310
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,630
When are you coming back this time?

311
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,880
I will call you when I know.

312
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,940
You are awful.

313
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,190
You couldn't even make a single hit.

314
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,930
I'm only interested in the transformation skills.

315
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,980
Just build up with things and not using them is kind of a waste.

316
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,650
You will end up unsatisfied and frustrated.

317
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,300
I have always been unsatisfied, Mamiya.

318
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,180
Because it's a damn town.

319
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,460
There is no karaoke studio, no game centers, and even no video rental shops.

320
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,090
There is no entertainment here.

321
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,680
How come everyone is not getting bored, huh?

322
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,920
Even so, you know Mamiya ...

323
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,230
It might be twisted to say this

324
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,020
but that day my heart was beating so fast.

325
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,220
It feels like all of the backlogs in my heart were released in just a moment.

326
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,010
Your existence is twisted in itself.

327
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,370
I said no sparkling wine, stupid!

328
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,800
Dad...

329
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,200
Buy it again.

330
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,020
But it's already late.

331
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,070
I don't have any money ...

332
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,000
Enough, just go and buy it!

333
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,630
Nozaki!

334
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,340
You don't have to force yourself to come to school.

335
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,560
Maybe it's not my business.

336
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,790
But I ...

337
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,400
might be able to do something for you.

338
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,130
Say something.

339
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,250
I'm sorry.

340
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,610
Your voice?

341
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,290
What's going on?

342
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,730
That's disgusting.

343
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,820
Where's Rumi?

344
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,090
She ran away.

345
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,320
Forget her.

346
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,780
Anyway, she is so disgusting.

347
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,430
Let's do it.

348
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,540
Nozaki ...

349
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,120
You must be in a lot of pain, right?

350
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,840
I ...

351
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,380
What are you talking about?

352
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,010
It has nothing to do with us.

353
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,470
Hey Nozaki ...

354
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,690
kill yourself.

355
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,130
Tachibana, what are you talking about?

356
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,360
Look at her, she knows what we did.

357
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,370
Are you serious?

358
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,580
You two, come over here.

359
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,980
I ...

360
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,770
I had thought about dying every day.

361
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,740
But after I saw your mother burnt to death

362
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,730
I knew I definitely didn't want to die.

363
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,500
For the first time in my life, I felt alive!

364
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,890
Because it looked so painful.

365
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,820
What a pain in the ass!

366
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,500
Hurry up, just tell me you want to die.

367
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,260
It hurts.

368
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,970
What is this?

369
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,810
Isn't it better if I don't touch it?

370
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,140
You bitch!

371
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,690
Nozaki!

372
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,340
Dad ...

373
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,610
Hold on!

374
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,570
Please wait! Listen to me!

375
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,740
It was Kuga's fault!

376
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,410
Didn't you see Kuga's wound, right?

377
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,530
He's got a burn in his hand.

378
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,620
He set the fire up on your mother.

379
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,460
It had nothing to do with me.

380
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,500
Please listen!

381
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,780
It's been snowing a lot lately.

382
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,940
Yes, class might be cancelled tomorrow.

383
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,730
I heard that Tachibana, Mishima and Katou

384
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,550
the three of them have been missing since yesterday.

385
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,020
Gross!

386
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,460
Maybe three of them left home together.

387
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,360
Maybe.

388
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,830
Ah, the police car is coming.

389
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,340
Oh, really?

390
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,430
- Really? 
- Wow, that's cool.

391
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,640
What are you guys freaking out about?

392
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,960
They probably came to investigate the three missing girls.

393
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,870
I think so, too.

394
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,970
It's so cold, I'm going home.

395
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,090
Nozaki?

396
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,880
What are you doing here?

397
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,380
Did you skip school today?

398
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,040
Then do you have business with me?

399
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,800
What's your problem?

400
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,890
How could this be ...

401
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,050
Hurts.

402
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,090
It hurts ...

403
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,420
Don't come over, don't come over here!

404
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,490
It hurts.

405
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,500
Hurts ...

406
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:24,060
Go back! Go back home!

407
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:11,000
I'm not the only one who set the fire up ...

408
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,650
I know.

409
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:36,810
Because the snow gotten worse, the school will be closed tomorrow.

410
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:39,910
Excuse me, is anybody there?

411
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,110
Yes!

412
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:45,850
I'm coming.

413
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,480
Ah, come in.

414
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,450
Although I have been calling her

415
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,850
she doesn't want to get out of the bed.

416
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:02,830
It's okay.

417
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,180
I just came to visit her.

418
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,160
It's almost there.

419
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,230
It's just a little while.

420
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,370
After she graduated

421
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:37,520
I'm going to take Haruka and Shouko back to Tokyo.

422
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,940
Aiba ...

423
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,670
until the graduation ceremony

424
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,980
I would like to ask you to please take care of her.

425
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:52,910
Sure.

426
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,370
We have to shovel up the snow tomorrow.

427
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,130
Could you give me a hand?

428
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah, sure.

429
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,910
What's wrong with you?

430
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,120
It's pretty rare, you staying in the living room all this time.

431
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,680
Did something happen?

432
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,250
No, I just have a request.

433
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,300
What's it?

434
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,850
I would like to sleep with you tonight.

435
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:31,790
What's going on?

436
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,010
Nothing's happened.

437
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,210
Rumi, you are still a spoiled brat, aren't you?

438
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,810
Okay, go take the quilt.

439
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:43,770
Okay.

440
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:11,850
Hello?

441
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,880
Hey Rumi!

442
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,040
What's up?

443
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,060
Don't what's up me! Idiot!

444
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,930
Kuga's disappeared.

445
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,990
It seems he hasn't come home yet.

446
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:28,010
After that three girls went missing, and it was his turn.

447
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,160
And I have already confirmed it.

448
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,490
There's no doubt, it's Nozaki.

449
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,530
Nozaki snuffed out and killed them.

450
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,220
Eh?

451
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,920
She killed them?

452
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,480
Maybe the next one is you, the mastermind.

453
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,750
Don't be ridiculous.

454
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,170
We have to make move before she comes at us.

455
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,600
We are going to do it tomorrow.

456
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,890
Well just wait and see.

457
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,340
Is it okay if you go all alone?

458
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,220
Be careful on the way.

459
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,500
There she is.

460
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:59,480
I didn't think you'd miss it with just that distance.

461
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,730
You are nervous targeting human, huh?

462
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,510
Shut up!

463
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,900
She ran away so fast.

464
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:18,570
But don't you think it's feels more like a hunt now?

465
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,020
I have never hunted humans before.

466
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,400
What about if we split up?

467
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:30,350
You know, I'm starting to get excited, Mamiya.

468
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,800
In this damned backwater town

469
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,610
your existence is like poison.

470
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,600
Because you are too beautiful.

471
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,310
Nozaki!

472
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,890
I threatened your father with this bow.

473
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,140
I was the one who set your house on fire.

474
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,590
Don't you want to avenge your family?

475
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,920
Nozaki.

476
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,630
I never thought I could see you so close.

477
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,320
You damn bitch girl!

478
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,440
Get out of the way.

479
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,070
You are getting in the way, asshole.

480
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,200
Ikegawa ���

481
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:44,380
Nozaki, I love you.

482
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,650
I have been

483
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,400
Hey wait!

484
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:48,970
loved her.

485
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,170
Nozaki, I love you!

486
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,510
Let go of me!

487
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,420
Go away freak!

488
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,740
Time out! Time out!

489
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,320
I said, time out, bitch!

490
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,000
Ms. Minami.

491
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,240
My son, Hidetoshi, he has not returned home yet.

492
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,680
I'm sorry, please stay calm Ms. Kuga.

493
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,140
There is nothing we can do about it ���

494
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,090
But, vice principal, the three other students
 from the same class haven't come home yet.

495
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,460
Ms. Minami, you are their homeroom teacher, right?

496
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,600
Don't you have any ideas?

497
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,040
What are you laughing at?

498
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,340
This woman is insane.

499
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,720
You are the insane ones here, right?

500
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,160
Ah, my bad.

501
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,000
I said it out loud.

502
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,140
Would you please stop?

503
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:07,740
Hey please stop!

504
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:34,460
You are so late, I was a bit worried.

505
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,510
What happened?

506
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,590
You must be felt cold.

507
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,480
Go take a shower.

508
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:29,130
Excuse me, is anyone there?

509
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,410
Nozaki?

510
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,410
I thought ...

511
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:44,000
I wouldn't ever to see you again.

512
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,240
I have always wanted to see you.

513
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,120
I really want to see you.

514
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:17,360
Nozaki?

515
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:54,060
I will protect you.

516
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:13,660
Thank you.

517
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,920
When the snow stops.

518
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,380
And after you graduated.

519
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,510
Let's go back to grandpa's house in Tokyo.

520
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:48,990
We will transfer your sister to the hospital over there too.

521
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,600
Let's get out of here as soon as we can.

522
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,820
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

523
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,460
Shouko, I'm sorry.

524
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:19,230
Haruka, do you want to stay here?

525
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:33,130
Shouko's referral procedure is already in process.

526
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,380
But ...

527
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:42,720
It's okay.

528
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,610
Take it easy.

529
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,580
Tokyo?

530
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:58,250
Are you going to Tokyo?

531
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,960
What about the school here you were planning to go to?

532
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:04,540
I won't go to local high school in this town.

533
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,130
I'm going to school at night and working in Tokyo.

534
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,040
There is someone I want to live with there.

535
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,420
Because she ...

536
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,250
she has nobody to count on.

537
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,530
Rumi, it's time for breakfast.

538
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,090
I don't want it.

539
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,000
Tell me if you want to eat.

540
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,630
I will make it for you anytime.

541
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,950
I want to kill her.

542
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:20,820
What?

543
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,180
I hope she dies.

544
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:32,090
Hey Rumi, did you just say you want to kill someone?

545
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,610
I heard that too.

546
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,480
She just said it.

547
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,920
I heard it, too.

548
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,290
She said she wanted to kill her.

549
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:43,040
Even you have no guts.

550
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,230
Don't to be so arrogant.

551
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:49,210
I can kill her.

552
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,300
I can do it, I can do it.

553
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,610
I'm gonna kill her.

554
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,390
I will pour kerosene over her house.

555
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,300
And make it look like a fire.

556
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:03,640
Burn her to death.

557
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,190
Why are you getting so excited, idiot!

558
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:36,160
Hey you, how many phone calls are you going to make?

559
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:41,510
Taeko, I'm going to be killed.

560
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:43,700
I'm going to be killed by her.

561
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,040
You reap what you sow, right?

562
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:48,980
Teako!

563
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:49,770
I'm hanging up.

564
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,620
Hang on, wait! wait!

565
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:52,950
What's it now?

566
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,730
Tachibana and the other two, I found them were lying dead on the back hill.

567
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:59,200
They have been killed.

568
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:00,490
Liar!

569
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:03,480
I told the truth, please believe me.

570
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:10,060
Maybe you are going to get killed as well, and I will be the next one.

571
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:13,990
Have I done anything that would make her want to kill me?

572
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,990
It's your fault!

573
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:17,170
What?

574
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:22,430
Taeko, don't you hate her so much, do you?

575
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:27,090
She snatched Aiba Mitsuru from you.

576
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:29,560
You got the wrong idea.

577
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,560
There's no way I could ever be able to like that guy!

578
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,370
Then why?

579
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:37,900
Why did you let everyone bully her like that?

580
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,300
Taeko, could it be ...

581
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:46,370
What are you guessing?

582
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,590
Don't talk to me like you know me.

583
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,590
Go to hell.

584
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,380
Are you really want to do it?

585
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,730
What a riot!

586
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:39,920
Hey Rumi.

587
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,890
If you do it halfway, you are going to have rough days.

588
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:48,680
Those who are afraid just go back home.

589
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,520
Get your ass back in there before you regret.

590
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,940
What are you talking about?

591
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:57,440
Oh, that's so brave.

592
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,170
You are pretty brave.

593
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,260
If that's the case, we will work with you.

594
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,300
On the contrary, as a mastermind

595
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,000
if you shrink back, I'm going to kill you.

596
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,260
What does that mean?

597
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,380
We have to try her guts.

598
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,270
Taeko, you should go too.

599
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,970
That's so boring.

600
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:26,950
I'm going home.

601
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,450
Teako, just wait and see.

602
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,320
Well, good luck.

603
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:39,290
Hitori de aruku michinori ga

604
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:39,290
On the way while I was walking on by myself

605
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:51,240
Sabishi monoda to kanjita toki

606
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:51,240
I could feel the loneliness

607
01:11:52,180 --> 01:12:03,020
Nukumori o motsu ikimono tachi wa

608
01:11:52,180 --> 01:12:03,020
The living creatures are bringing the warmth up

609
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:13,840
Tagaini te o tori hajimeru

610
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:13,840
They started holding hands

611
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,050
Excuse me.

612
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,710
Is anybody there?

613
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,220
Ah, thank you.

614
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:33,920
I'm sorry, grandpa.

615
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,240
Can you go back first?

616
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,610
Okay, stay safe.

617
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:10,150
I thought I'd give it back to you.

618
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:12,290
I always carry it with me.

619
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:18,490
When listening to this song, it's like I come back to the past.

620
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:30,500
It's been a while since we haven't been like this.

621
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:35,100
Taeko, are you not sleeping last night?

622
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,000
What are you asking about?

623
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:44,050
Why are you so scared?

624
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:49,070
You are weird.

625
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,160
Don't you are weird too?

626
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,200
I'm a weirdo, right?

627
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,000
Is that because your family has been killed?

628
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,920
Maybe because of it.

629
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:19,340
I ...

630
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:28,420
What am I supposed to say to you?

631
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:38,400
I ...

632
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:47,330
I'm not the kind of person

633
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,520
who makes people have to apologize.

634
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:57,890
Are you an idiot?

635
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,940
I remember when I first came to that school.

636
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:13,540
You were the first person that talked to me.

637
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:20,690
I was the only one that you told how much you wanted to go to Tokyo and you dream of becoming a beautician.

638
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:22,940
Nozaki, do you have a minute?

639
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:25,370
Even so ...

640
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,960
I still hurt you.

641
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,500
It's not like that.

642
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:38,370
I was never jealous of you and Aiba.

643
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,890
It because ...

644
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,480
Because what?

645
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:58,000
Nothing.

646
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,550
Nozaki, do you have a minute?

647
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,460
I just couldn't forgive you for leaving me because of that guy.

648
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,180
I just wanted you to look only at me.

649
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:54,400
Why was everything turned out like this?

650
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,040
I'm glad I got to talk to you.

651
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,650
Taeko!

652
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,050
Hold your head up high and live on.

653
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,430
Nozaki!

654
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:52,110
Please forgive me.

655
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,270
Rumi!

656
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:46,610
You disgusting bitch!

657
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,870
You are screaming up!

658
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,230
Did you just scream?

659
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,550
The cool Taeko, she screamed!

660
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:12,090
What have you done to Nozaki? Idiot!

661
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:14,540
She screamed!

662
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,540
You are crazy bitch!

663
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,660
Taeko!

664
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:41,680
Taeko!

665
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:48,770
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

666
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:08,820
Because something stupid you did.

667
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:11,210
Why don't you just go to hell stupid bitch?

668
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,990
I don't understand what you are talking about.

669
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:15,750
It's really annoying.

670
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:20,660
You all cling on to me, then decided to lose it and go crazy.

671
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,220
I'm sick of you all!

672
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,650
Why did you go to her house?

673
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,400
You have always looked at me with your lewd eyes.

674
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:31,670
Did you think if you killed her, you will get my attention?

675
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,460
I did it for you.

676
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:37,100
Disgusting!

677
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:37,720
Taeko ...

678
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,420
You are fucking disgusting murderer!

679
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:41,810
I did it for you!

680
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:23,120
I admired how fearless you were.

681
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:24,440
I liked you.

682
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:30,300
All I see now is that you are dirty rag to me.

683
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:57,380
How come with this hands

684
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:02,500
I could hold scissors?

685
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:15,710
Yes.

686
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:18,950
Haruka!

687
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,460
Aiba is calling.

688
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:29,570
Hello!

689
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:33,340
I've heard from your grandpa.

690
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,940
You are going back to Tokyo after graduation.

691
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:40,220
Yeah, but ...

692
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:41,850
I know.

693
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,940
I just convinced my granny about that.

694
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,540
I'm not going to high school here.

695
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:51,730
I want to go to Tokyo with you.

696
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:52,900
Eh?

697
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:56,990
I will find a place for us and I will work.

698
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,700
You don't have to worry about anything.

699
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:02,530
But ...

700
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:05,040
I might not be able to live with you.

701
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,530
Why?

702
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,830
If spring comes, you will understand.

703
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,750
Then, why don't you go to the school you wanted?

704
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:18,470
Didn't I promise you?

705
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,200
I said I would protect you.

706
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:29,450
Isn't that what we agreed on?

707
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:44,280
You didn't choose me at the end

708
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,260
but you chose your family over me.

709
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:20,170
Grandpa, you don't ask me anything?

710
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:26,410
You can tell me when you are ready.

711
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:29,810
I will listen.

712
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:37,530
I think it's almost done.

713
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:46,640
Granny?

714
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:48,750
Granny?

715
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:53,350
Granny?

716
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:56,220
Why are you still sitting here?

717
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
If you sleep here, you will catch a cold.

718
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:04,530
Mitsuru ...

719
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:12,000
I have always believed that you wouldn't do that.

720
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:20,000
Did you stab your father like this before?

721
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,280
That's not the same.

722
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:32,390
Dad used to beat up mom every day.

723
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,100
I just stopped him.

724
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,300
Then what about your mother?

725
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:42,530
No, it was not like that.

726
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:47,740
After I stabbed dad's back with cutter

727
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:52,060
then there is no one hit her.

728
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:58,400
But she wanted someone to beat her.

729
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:03,320
That's why I finished her.

730
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:10,500
Why don't we stop talking about the past?

731
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:21,660
I'm sorry, Granny.

732
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:30,530
I love you the most.

733
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:34,880
I love mom and dad too.

734
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:42,320
I don't know what to do when I met someone I like.

735
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,950
I feel confused.

736
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:48,100
I don't know what to do.

737
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:08,380
When I asked Nozaki to live with me

738
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,050
she said she wanted to be with her family.

739
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,540
I think she actually wants to live with me.

740
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,700
Tomorrow I'm going to see her grandpa.

741
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,300
I will talk to him.

742
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:49,660
Rumi! what's going on?

743
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:51,100
Leave me alone!

744
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,590
I'm coming in.

745
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,500
Don't you even dare to come in, hug!

746
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:00,500
Don't be so nice to me.

747
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,330
Stop being kind to me.

748
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:16,900
Remember, no matter what happens, mommy is on your side.

749
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:31,600
I have to do it.

750
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,390
You are going to visit your sister tomorrow, right?

751
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,630
Yeah.

752
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:53,490
The snow should have gotten lighter too.

753
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:57,990
Yeah, that's good.

754
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:11,650
I heard since yesterday, Taeko could not get in touch.

755
01:30:11,650 --> 01:30:12,210
Yeah, I heard that too.

756
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:15,660
My daughter hasn't been home for days.

757
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:20,350
Ms. Minami.

758
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:22,100
That woman ...

759
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:23,400
It's her fault.

760
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:25,350
Ms. Kuga, please calm down.

761
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:28,060
Your students have been missing for several days.

762
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,740
But you seem pretty calm.

763
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:35,410
I have heard from my daughter, she treated Taeko as a friend.

764
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,530
This woman is insane.

765
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:43,300
Because of this little thing, if I'm messed up

766
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,740
then I wouldn't be fit to be a teacher, right?

767
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:53,600
Tachibana!

768
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:58,440
You graduated from Ootsuma Middle School, right?

769
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:02,010
I heard that you were bullied back then.

770
01:31:04,210 --> 01:31:05,390
I can understand that.

771
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,800
I'm getting sick while I look at you.

772
01:31:11,410 --> 01:31:14,710
Being bullied made you insane.

773
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:18,810
Actually, you are so scared of our kids, aren't you?

774
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:24,300
Could it be, the students were killed by you.

775
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,220
That's harsh.

776
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:31,210
Don't you guys already know it too?

777
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:36,070
Our kids are not the type who is getting bullied

778
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:38,640
they are the type who are bullying others.

779
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,110
Are you want to puke again? you puke girl!

780
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:46,000
Seriously, why don't you just die?

781
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:47,640
That's so disgusting.

782
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:49,410
Yeah, that's so annoying.

783
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,390
No!

784
01:31:58,650 --> 01:32:00,290
I'm a teacher.

785
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:03,560
I could forget that unpleasant past

786
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,980
and start my school life again.

787
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:11,900
Even if I had to do it as a teacher, I want to go back to school.

788
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,740
I wanted to make a lot of friends.

789
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:19,490
I just wanted to graduate from Ootsuma Middle School.

790
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,400
That's all.

791
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,590
I can't believe she threw up!

792
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:33,980
It's disgusting.

793
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,970
Miss! Miss!

794
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:47,540
Ms. Minami!

795
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:50,040
Miss!

796
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:33,290
I need to know the number of Nozaki's room.

797
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:48,700
Gross!

798
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,370
What are you doing here?

799
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:54,990
Don't come over here, you murderer.

800
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:01,360
You don't want your sister to get burned again, right?

801
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:04,570
Any more move, I will set the fire up again.

802
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:07,100
You won't be able

803
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:11,980
to eat your favorite barbecue.

804
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:18,790
Even if she is alive, it's useless.

805
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,000
I will finish her off.

806
01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:43,780
Are you going to kill again in front of your sister?

807
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:07,610
I heard you were here.

808
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,370
I just came to see you.

809
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:20,610
Nozaki!

810
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,420
Your grandpa.

811
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:25,040
Your grandpa, he called an ambulance himself.

812
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,410
It seems he was attacked by someone while you were here.

813
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:29,930
Nozaki, it will be okay.

814
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:31,100
Don't worry.

815
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:31,140
Excuse us!

816
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:33,680
Granpa!

817
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:34,780
Bring him to ICU!

818
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,520
Aiba!

819
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:16,200
Aiba, let me see your hands.

820
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:18,890
Why?

821
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:20,260
Let me see your hands.

822
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:25,200
Let me see your hands, let me see it!

823
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:39,440
This is the wound I left when I convinced my granny yesterday.

824
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:47,900
But I did it for the both of us.

825
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:56,540
I want your grandpa to listen to me and understand what I feel too.

826
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,540
Because we have to live together.

827
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:10,580
Don't you think like that too?

828
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:17,380
Nozaki?

829
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:27,540
Ah, you two are so annoying.

830
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,610
It's all because you exist ...

831
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,510
That's why you started the fire?

832
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:46,920
It stinks.

833
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,100
What are you all doing?

834
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:03,980
Hey old woman, can you keep this as a secret?

835
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,080
We are leaving for today

836
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:10,880
but if you tell anyone else, we will be coming again.

837
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:12,510
Do it, Kuga!

838
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:16,320
I kinda want to see human burn to death.

839
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:18,500
What are you saying, idiot!

840
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,550
Ah, it's hot.

841
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,600
Mom?

842
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:32,070
There was such a stench that came

843
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:33,750
from your mother when she burned up.

844
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:34,640
Stop it!

845
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:39,160
Stop!

846
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,160
Dad!

847
01:38:48,670 --> 01:38:49,250
Stop it!

848
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:50,600
What are you doing?

849
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:54,600
What should we do, what should we do?

850
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:55,090
How could I know!

851
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:57,870
Hey Rumi!

852
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:00,650
Hey?

853
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:07,100
Stop it!

854
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:22,100
Stop!

855
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:30,580
Nozaki?

856
01:40:58,650 --> 01:40:59,870
It's all right now.

857
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:10,400
It was not like what you think.

858
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,340
Don't get me wrong, Nozaki

859
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:21,950
I was moved by the heroic actions of your father

860
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:24,060
who covered Shouko with his body.

861
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:27,930
He was the role model loving father.

862
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:34,180
I thought I would show you the heroic actions of your father one day.

863
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,990
You tried to kill me.

864
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:27,250
Didn't I say, I would protect you?

865
01:42:33,630 --> 01:42:36,700
I said I would protect you!

866
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:39,900
Nozaki!

867
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:47,400
Why don't you understand?

868
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:51,310
Your sister won't alive for long.

869
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:56,190
Your grandpa is going to die soon.

870
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:05,510
I'm the only one you can count on, right?

871
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:35,340
Look at this way and give me a smile.

872
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,480
Nozaki?

873
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:54,920
The liverleaf.

874
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:10,090
The strong flower

875
01:44:15,690 --> 01:44:17,300
just looks like you.

876
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:36,510
With such a heavy injury, you are going to wither here.

877
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:45,400
Nozaki, promise to live with me.

878
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:50,150
I will take you to the hospital

879
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:54,910
and then let's live together.

880
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:05,970
I would like to capture your smiles just one more time.

881
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:23,300
Oguro Taeko.

882
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:25,090
Present.

883
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:40,010
Hitori de aruku michinori ga

884
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:40,010
On the way while I was walking on by myself

885
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:36,380
Oguro Taeko.

886
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:51,700
Sabishii monoda to kanjita toki

887
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:51,700
I could feel the loneliness

888
01:48:51,700 --> 01:49:02,360
Nukumori o motsu ikimono tachi wa

889
01:48:51,700 --> 01:49:02,360
The living creatures who are bringing the warmth up

890
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:13,680
Tagaini te o tori hajimeru

891
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:13,680
They started holding hands

892
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:36,490
I want you to help me to cut my hair in the future, too.

893
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:46,820
Nozaki, let's go to Tokyo together.

894
01:50:03,210 --> 01:50:13,210
Deai ga hito o kaeru nonara

895
01:50:03,210 --> 01:50:13,210
If the encounter can changes people

896
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:23,420
Mada minu anata o machimashou

897
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:23,420
I would like to wait for you who I have not met before

898
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:33,980
Karada o nagareru mizu tachi wa

899
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:33,980
A lot of water flowing through inside my body

900
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:45,630
Jibun ni uso o tsukenaikara

901
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:45,630
I won't lie to myself anymore

902
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:52,860
Me ni mieru mono wa izure

903
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:52,860
Whatever had seen by my eyes

904
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:59,020
Kieusete mo

905
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:59,020
It would be fade away someday

906
01:50:59,230 --> 01:51:09,140
Kokoro ni hibiku mono wa nokotte iku

907
01:50:59,230 --> 01:51:09,140
The things were echoing in my heart, will keep being there forever

908
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:23,320
Wakete kudasai anata no kimochi o

909
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:23,320
Please share your feelings that you felt with me

910
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:32,460
Ima kanashii nonara koko de namida o nagashi

911
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:32,460
When I feel sad I would shed my tears

912
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:41,340
Ima ureshii nonara waratte shimaou

913
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:41,340
When I feel happy I would laugh

914
01:51:41,340 --> 01:54:21,680
