(Who is the mole?)

28
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,440
Ms. Zhang.

29
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,279
Ms. Zhang, what are you doing?

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,839
What's going on?

31
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,279
Ms. Zhang.

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,080
Are you going to leave, Ms. Zhang?

33
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,480
I have no idea.

34
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,239
Why is she packing up?

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,120
Ms. Zhang, stop packing up.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,240
Zhang Ting, what's wrong with you?

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,160
What? Are you feeling sorry for me?

38
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:14,720
No, I am not.

39
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,919
If you want to sideline me,

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,360
you don't have to bother.

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,559
Just ask HR to arrange my leaving.

42
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:20,919
Why did you

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,440
frame me before I go?

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,479
I just ordered you

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,960
to fetch a USB.

46
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:28,679
What? As you are Mr. Gu's girlfriend,

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,559
you can't do the trivial matter?

48
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,440
Even though you hate me,

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,919
you didn't have to compromise
the Gu Group's profits, did you?

50
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,839
I didn't.

51
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,320
Thank you for
your good intention. I don't need it.

52
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,679
Back off.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,679
I am done.

54
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,639
Guys, have you finished?

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,399
Just a minute.

56
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,119
Let's hurry up.

57
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,119
Otherwise, we won't catch up.

58
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:09,520
Okay.

59
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,839
Let me go with you.
I take the bus as well.

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,919
We four carpool.

61
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,479
I am afraid it's out of your way.

62
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,119
Just go.

63
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:21,600
Chop. Chop.

64
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,320
I'm leaving.

65
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,399
Jingjing.

66
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,960
Regarding the problems
with the hall's design,

67
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to talk about it with you.

68
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,559
Okay.

69
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,160
What?

70
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,279
Are you still dwelling on

71
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,479
Zhang Ting's leaving?

72
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:38,919
Zhang Ting leaves

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,360
because she gets a new offer.

74
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,639
It's her choice.

75
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,039
Nothing to do with you.

76
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,639
Do you have a date with Mr. Gu tonight?

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,839
Since something went wrong in the firm,

78
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,800
he may have to work late.

79
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,600
How about I take you to somewhere

80
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,960
to change your mood?

81
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,320
Baby, I am back.

82
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,239
You are back.

83
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,640
What are you doing, baby?

84
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,279
Why are there so many red packets?

85
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,839
My college classmate.

86
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,640
My neighbor.

87
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,399
And my cousin.

88
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,440
They all are going to
tie the knots recently.

89
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,119
So, I have to make preparations.

90
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,679
So many?

91
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,880
Yeah.

92
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,399
Look, as we are all
about the age to walk down the aisles,

93
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,399
they will get married if they need.

94
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,720
For these months,

95
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,760
I also received some
wedding invitation bombs.

96
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,359
My wage of this month
will all go to the brides and grooms.

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,320
It won't come back anymore. So scared.

98
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,440
Won't come back.

99
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,119
Back. Back.

100
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,679
What happened?

101
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,440
Baby, how about I cook for you?

102
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,640
I will go cook now.

103
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,279
Liar.

104
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,679
(Today, my friend)

105
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,279
(wore Dimon's new product)

106
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,519
(and told me its design is fantastic.)

107
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,480
(But I found out it is my design.)

108
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,600
I was just like an idiot.

109
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,760
I didn't know how to reply to my friend.

110
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,559
I will give you a satisfactory answer

111
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,399
to the leak of the design.

112
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,119
But now,

113
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,239
I need your favor.

114
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,320
Miss, here is your soft drink.

115
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:38,799
Thank you.

116
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,239
Mister, here is your wine.

117
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:40,959
Thank you.

118
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:47,200
Why do you take me here?

119
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,000
During my days when I learned design,

120
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,839
every time I felt unhappy,

121
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,480
I usually would have some drinks here.

122
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,920
What?

123
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,440
Are you still upset about that issue?

124
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,799
So, why do you join
the Design Department

125
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,559
of the Gu Group on earth?

126
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,359
Do my favorite thing, designing.

127
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,239
Is it you who gave the design to Dimon?

128
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,679
Not me.

129
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,480
Even you doubt me as well?

130
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,880
Now that it wasn't done by you,

131
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,559
why do you care about what others say?

132
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,519
Do you care about
others' feelings so much?

133
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,600
Or, do you enter the workforce

134
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,480
to make friends?

135
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,399
You shall know

136
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,000
you can't let

137
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,040
everyone think you are perfect.

138
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,600
As long as you are able to

139
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,200
extricate yourself from gossip.

140
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,320
This is

141
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,480
the best way to start your working life.

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,559
Here. Cheers.

143
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,399
There is a saying.

144
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,880
Nothing can't be solved

145
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,200
by drinking and chatting with friends.

146
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:01,160
Only in this way
can you work more happily.

147
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,160
Can you stay closer

148
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:04,200
to your designer dream.

149
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,816
(Jingjing)

150
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:47,440
(Sorry.)

151
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:50,400
(The subscriber you dialed
cannot be reached now.)

152
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,039
(Sorry.)

153
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,799
(The subscriber you dialed...)

154
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:06,244
(Xie Te)

155
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,359
Xie Te.

156
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,200
Jingjing isn't with Ai Mi now?

157
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
(No. Ai Mi and I are at home.)

158
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,880
(Why don't you call Jingjing?)

159
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,159
I can't reach her.

160
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,799
It's late at night.
She didn't pick up her phone.

161
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,799
I don't know where she is now.

162
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,679
(I will ask Ai Mi to
try to contact her.)

163
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,599
Alright. That's it.

164
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,080
Why are you still up?

165
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,000
Where did you go late at night?

166
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,080
You didn't pick up your phone either.

167
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,919
Do you know I worry you so much?

168
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,799
I am sorry. My phone is dead.

169
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,640
I didn't notice it.

170
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,719
I just drank something

171
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,479
with Director Du after work.

172
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,880
But I only had soft drink, not drinks.

173
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
Du Yuchuan again.

174
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:15,840
You...

175
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:18,239
Can you not stay with him

176
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,679
except during working hours?

177
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,239
Why?

178
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,599
We are just colleagues.

179
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,039
And he is nice.

180
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,520
You didn't get what I mean.

181
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,039
I mean

182
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,520
you are my girlfriend.

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,280
I don't want you to stay with other men

184
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,760
unless it is necessary.

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,919
Are you jealous?

186
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
I am not jealous.

187
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,039
What are you laughing at?

188
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,159
What is it if you are not jealous?

189
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:47,960
I can only revolve around you

190
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,559
after I became your girlfriend?

191
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,239
So many things
happened in the firm recently.

192
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,159
My colleagues are excluding me as well.

193
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Director Du is a nice person.

194
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:00,880
He even encouraged me.

195
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,479
Your colleagues are excluding you?

196
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,719
Right.

197
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,000
What's more, Zhang Ting resigned today.

198
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:15,559
I can't be exonerated now.

199
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,320
Zhang Ting left?

200
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,880
(How could it be?)

201
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,119
(It must be abnormal.)

202
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,760
(Board Resolution)

203
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,520
Is the board
giving you a hard time again?

204
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,599
They must think you are covering me up.

205
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:35,200
They give you pressure with this.

206
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:38,200
Never mind. It's nothing.

207
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,000
You always act tough.

208
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,239
Okay, I will be
at Feilin Hotel in 15 minutes.

209
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,559
Wait for me.

210
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,840
Feilin Hotel?

211
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,440
How's your talk with Lin Yaozhong?

212
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,672
(Ai Mi.)

213
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,679
Ai Mi.

214
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:24,960
(Jingjing.)

215
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,520
(Xie Te cheats on me.)

216
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,559
Stop crying. Stop crying.

217
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,640
Xie Te cheats on you?

218
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,280
(I am at Feilin Hotel now.)

219
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,479
(Come here now.)

220
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:36,359
(I don't know what to do now.)

221
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,760
Okay. Okay. Don't Cry. Don't Cry.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,880
I'll be there.

223
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:42,679
She...

224
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,239
I'm worried about Ai Mi. I have to go.

225
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,799
I will go with you. Let's go.

226
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,280
What happened?

227
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,159
You said Xie Te
cheats on you in the phone.

228
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,400
What does that mean?

229
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,440
During these days,

230
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,679
when I fell asleep,

231
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,679
Xie Te would go out.

232
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,919
I feel something's wrong.

233
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,400
I was extra sensitive today.

234
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,119
I didn't expect after I fell asleep,

235
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:16,520
he received a call from a woman

236
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,440
and said he would come to Feilin Hotel.

237
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,599
No way.

238
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,840
He won't cheat on you, will he?

239
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,000
He is not like that kind of person.

240
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,719
If it were not because
I heard it clearly,

241
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,960
I won't believe it either.

242
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,640
But in the middle of the night,

243
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,599
were it not for the wrong reason,

244
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,479
who will come here with a woman?

245
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,039
It makes sense.

246
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,440
I think something's wrong as well.

247
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,880
W-What do you think should I do?

248
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,479
It's okay. If it's true,

249
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,719
I will take it out on him for you.

250
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,080
I will knock him out.

251
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,520
But we are not sure about it now, right?

252
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,479
Let's go ask him now.

253
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Let's ask about this, okay?

254
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,119
Don't cry.

255
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,159
Nice to meet you.

256
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,440
Are you going to check in?

257
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,280
We are here to catch...

258
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,479
Find our friend. Our friend.

259
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,000
Which room does your friend live in?

260
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,679
Please contact him or her first.

261
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,679
We can't reach him suddenly.

262
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,919
Can you help us to check

263
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,880
which room a man

264
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,239
called Xie Te lives in?

265
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,479
Well, I am sorry.

266
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,799
It's our customer's privacy.

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,080
I am afraid I can't tell you.

268
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:29,280
I am here for my boyfriend.

269
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,679
Can't I check it?

270
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,880
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,559
If you don't have anything else,

272
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,679
please leave now.

273
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,359
Let's go now.

274
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,520
It's not a thing to stay here.

275
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,200
I'll see what we can do.

276
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,400
We can't mess around here.

277
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,119
Come on.

278
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,760
Take care.

279
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,760
Alright.

280
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,640
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

281
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,440
Let's go home first.

282
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:03,919
Watch out.

283
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,559
Wait a second.

284
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,359
Xie Te.

285
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,039
Take care. Take care.
Why did you drink so much?

286
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:12,559
Xie Te.

287
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,119
Slow down.

288
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,080
Stop there!

289
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,719
Jingjing. Ai Mi.

290
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,359
You jerk!

291
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:18,080
Why are you here?

292
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,840
I am just her designated driver.

293
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,760
D-Designated driver?

294
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:46,960
Come on.

295
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,960
I am fine.

296
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,760
It's fine.

297
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,559
Does it hurt?

298
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,960
No.

299
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Su Jingjing.

300
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,080
Why did you beat him so hard?

301
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,000
It's okay.

302
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,479
D-Do you feel painful?

303
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,280
Why are you so powerful?

304
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,959
Scared me off.

305
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,119
All right. It's fine. I am okay.

306
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,880
Alright. Alright.

307
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,359
Luckily, I am not the one you beat.

308
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,359
She criticized me.

309
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,040
I have bought this wedding gown.

310
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,959
I wanted to give you a surprise.

311
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,680
A special wedding.

312
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,800
Do you do a part-time job
as a designated driver for this?

313
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,359
Not exactly.

314
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:17,439
The wedding is a start.

315
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,000
I can't let you suffer
after you marry me.

316
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,680
I figured it out.

317
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,119
After we tie the knot,

318
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,680
you can run your store if you want.

319
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,359
You can close it and travel around
if you don't want to run it.

320
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,880
If you want to be a businesswoman,

321
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,400
I will accompany you,

322
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,520
expanding Ai Mi's store
into chain stores.

323
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,719
But all of these
depend on an economic base.

324
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,479
Although I am nobody,

325
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,719
I hope after we get married,

326
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,400
you can be like now,

327
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,760
happy every day,

328
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
with no worries.

329
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,400
Still in pain?

330
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:04,760
It's fine.

331
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,839
Su Jingjing.

332
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,880
Look, how hard you beat

333
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,160
my Xie Te!

334
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,520
I took it out on for you

335
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,920
and now you take his side.

336
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,959
I don't care.

337
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,800
It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

338
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:19,760
Xie Te.

339
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,000
You are at least
the assistant of the Gu Group's CEO.

340
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,640
Even if you want more money,

341
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,839
you don't have to
be a designated driver, right?

342
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,079
Are you implying

343
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
I give you too little

344
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,599
or you are too idle?

345
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,079
No, no. Mr. Gu.

346
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,560
I didn't mean that for sure.

347
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,880
As for money,

348
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,400
the more, the better.

349
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,319
But

350
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,719
if you really marry Su Jingjing,

351
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,319
you'd better prepare
a suit of armor every day.

352
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,880
Or, you can't stand her beating.

353
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,439
I planned to

354
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,719
cover your wedding.

355
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,520
But you slandered my Jingjing like this.

356
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,119
Now forget it.

357
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,079
What did he say?

358
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:12,160
Don't, Mr. Gu.

359
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,199
If you are going to be hit
after you get married with Su Jingjing,

360
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,079
let me be beaten for you.

361
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,040
No way.

362
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,599
Am I that violent?

363
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,560
Okay. Stop it.

364
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,359
Since the wedding gown is chosen,

365
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:26,719
hurry to select a good day

366
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,560
and marry my Ai Mi.

367
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,839
I want to be the maid of honor.

368
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:30,920
The maid of honor?

369
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,479
Great. I have chosen the wedding day.

370
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,839
You have chosen the day?

371
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,800
I am almost prepared for what I should.

372
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,359
We have the maid of honor now.

373
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,560
A best man to go.

374
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,400
Sure.

375
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,400
As Jingjing is the bridesmaid,
I will be the groomsman for sure.

376
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,640
Is it appropriate?

377
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,520
Yeah.

378
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:59,119
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

379
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:02,800
Are you happy?

380
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:23,439
As the Gu Group is our joint effort,

381
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,439
every decision we make

382
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,959
has to be responsible for the group.

383
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:28,760
Yes.

384
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,400
If for the leak of the design,

385
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,520
Mr. Gu can't solve it,

386
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I suggest putting off
the anniversary celebration

387
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,800
to give us more time

388
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,119
to change the topic.

389
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:39,760
What do you think?

390
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,119
- Right.
- Yes.

391
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,439
I know what you mean.

392
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,400
But we can't delay the celebration.

393
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:47,560
What...

394
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,880
What does Mr. Gu intend to do?

395
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,520
I will visit Lin Yaozhong again.

396
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,520
And beg him to draft one more design.

397
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,319
As I know,

398
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,000
Lin Yaozhong is flaky.

399
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,640
Not a designer we can win with money.

400
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:05,359
This time, his design
was leaked from the Gu Group,

401
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,920
and appropriated by Dimon.

402
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,239
What if Lin Yaozhong
doesn't cooperate with us

403
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,280
this time?

404
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,479
Yes. What should we do?

405
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,520
Then, I will ask him
to authorize his image

406
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,560
to the Gu Group.

407
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,560
And let our Design Department
to draft one more design.

408
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,599
Can our Design Department make it?

409
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,239
Yeah. Can they make it?

410
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,880
Alright. We respect Mr. Gu's decision.

411
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,920
But once there is any error,

412
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,920
Mr. Gu has to
shoulder the responsibility alone.

413
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:38,199
I'm leaving.

414
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,599
Go.

415
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:40,880
Let's go.

416
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,208
(Chairman Office)

417
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,959
Come in.

418
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,520
Mr. Gu.

419
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:19,696
(Legal Letter)

420
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,959
Mr. Gu, doesn't your talk
with Lin Yaozhong last night

421
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,719
go well?

422
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,319
Call on the Design Department
for a meeting.

423
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:31,920
Yes.

424
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,439
Lin Yaozhong is staunch.

425
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,319
I failed the peace talk.

426
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,359
What should we do now?

427
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,319
Is the anniversary celebration

428
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,239
really going to go down the drain?

429
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,839
There is still some time
before the celebration.

430
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,359
We have to do the design on our own.

431
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,119
Give me some time
to persuade Lin Yaozhong.

432
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,560
I will leave it
to your Design Department.

433
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,719
Director Du.

434
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:13,479
Need you to arrange them
in the emergency.

435
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,719
But if Lin won't authorize,

436
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,119
and we will have to hide it from him,

437
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,000
aren't we using his name?

438
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,119
We have no other choices.

439
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,599
If we reach that point,

440
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,760
we have to go to court with him anyway.

441
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,959
There will be no differences
for the Gu Group.

442
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,719
Alright. I will try my best.

443
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:53,728
(6 days before the anniversary)

444
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,640
These are your designs?

445
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,680
We only have no more than a week.

446
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:56,520
From now on,

447
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,959
no what main designer.

448
00:25:58,199 --> 00:25:59,640
Proceed it if you have an idea.

449
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,319
I want final designs.

450
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,760
Don't have to ask me for advice anymore.

451
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,079
Do your own designs now.

452
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,520
Why are you standing here? Go.

453
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,479
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

454
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,920
For your design, here...

455
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,280
Okay.

456
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,719
I have seen it.

457
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,719
Here is great. It's a highlight.

458
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:30,920
But the other places aren't good.

459
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:33,800
Change here.

460
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:53,119
- What a coincidence.
- Han Ran?

461
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,520
Why do you get off work late either?

462
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,920
I got a script that is urgently needed.

463
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:58,719
What about you?

464
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,199
Worked overtime as you did.
It's a long story.

465
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,800
Now,

466
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,839
we ought to drink some.

467
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,560
There is a new bar downstairs.

468
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,760
Let's have a drink.

469
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,640
Let's go.

470
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,319
Go.

471
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,959
You treat me.

472
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:16,920
My treat.

473
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,439
Go.

474
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,199
Drinking a bite of spirits,

475
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:33,920
I feel recovered instantly.

476
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:36,959
The wines are good indeed.

477
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,280
Although

478
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,839
as we've known each other for so long,

479
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,599
we always meet in a rush.

480
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:43,640
We've never sat down and chatted over

481
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,439
wines like today.

482
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,880
Yeah. I felt life

483
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,239
is like playing a game.

484
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,359
As long as I strive to
make myself out of the beginner zone,

485
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
and insist on
getting through the instances,

486
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,439
I can be riding high
on the battlefields,

487
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,199
living a comfortable life.

488
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,439
But when I am really
on the battlefields, I found

489
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,800
there are a multitude of people

490
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,479
who are beaten down.

491
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,319
It's a good thought.

492
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,040
I am going to write it in my book.

493
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,479
Great artist. Didn't know

494
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:17,160
you do have life experience.

495
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,160
Maybe you don't know yet.

496
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:21,280
My dad passed away
when I was in junior high.

497
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,400
My mom and I lived a tough life.

498
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,199
But we live a good life now.

499
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
We have overcome it.

500
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,839
How are you,
great writer of the bestsellers?

501
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,319
Since I became the best-selling author,

502
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,199
I have been either asked for drafts

503
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,400
or on the way of being asked for.

504
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,680
I couldn't even spare time
to accompany my parents.

505
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,880
And now they emigrated aboard.

506
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
I have fewer chances.

507
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,640
It seems that I have stayed longer

508
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:53,640
with Jingjing,

509
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,119
Master and Mistress.

510
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:57,160
Not right.

511
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,040
According to your words,

512
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,839
as you grew up with Jingjing,

513
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,599
why didn't you get together?

514
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,000
Jingjing is like my little sister.

515
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,719
We know each other too well.

516
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,680
She is

517
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,479
and will always be like a sister to me.

518
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,920
I lost just because

519
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,359
I met Jingjing too late.

520
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,640
And Gu Rong beat me to it.

521
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:23,199
Seriously? Are you falling for Jingjing?

522
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,199
Why?

523
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,119
Can't I rival Gu Rong?

524
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,439
Well, not that bad.

525
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,359
Jingjing focuses on
ones' minds other than money.

526
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,199
But sometimes,

527
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,880
the lineup in one's life

528
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
really matters.

529
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,400
Cheers.

530
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:47,640
Cheers.

531
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,040
The ancestral massages

532
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,239
can not only relax tendons
and activate collaterals

533
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,719
but also cure all sorts of bad moods.

534
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,880
How's it? Do you like it, Mr. Gu?

535
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,160
Yes.

536
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,959
The strength is good, right, Mr. Gu?

537
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,239
What are you doing?

538
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:12,359
Did you do that on purpose?

539
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,160
You did it deliberately.

540
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,119
Then, I will do it with you.

541
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,599
(Master asks me to check on.)

542
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,160
(I won't go disturb you.)

543
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,239
(But you have to remember)

544
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,400
(what you have said in front of Master,)

545
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,959
(otherwise, you will
be hit by him sooner or later.)

546
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,040
Hold me up.

547
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,199
How's it?

548
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,160
My dad's Dragon Sword
is impressive, right?

549
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,040
It's so impressive.

550
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:03,504
(Chief He)

551
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,079
Gu Rong.

552
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,800
Gu Rong.

553
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:15,599
(Mr. Gu.)

554
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,760
Chief He, I am Jingjing.

555
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,280
Gu Rong can't come to the phone now.

556
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,119
(Jingjing,)

557
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,640
(please tell Mr. Gu)

558
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,400
(that Chairman just got better.)

559
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,199
(But he doesn't listen to the doctors
and eats something as wishes.)

560
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,280
(Please ask Mr. Gu to come back
to persuade him if he is free.)

561
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:29,479
(Chairman might listen to Mr. Gu.)

562
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,400
Okay. I will tell him.

563
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,880
(Thank you.)

564
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,520
What's wrong?

565
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,160
It's Chief He.

566
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,359
He mentioned Grandpa.

567
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,239
Let's spare some time to visit Grandpa.

568
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,359
It's been a long time
since we went back.

569
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,439
What's wrong with Grandpa?

570
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,800
He's fine. Chief He said

571
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,839
he ate casually again.

572
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,160
He didn't listen to the doctors.

573
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,599
The stubborn old man.
Makes us worry him.

574
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,959
He knows he has a bad heart,

575
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,160
but he still eats as wishes.

576
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,359
I have to give him a lesson.

577
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,719
It's okay. I have an idea.

578
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,800
What is it?

579
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,520
Have river snails rice noodles with him?

580
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,359
Wait.

581
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,280
What's wrong?

582
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,959
Don't talk about the issues in the firm

583
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,800
with Grandpa.

584
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,400
With his health condition,
he can't worry much.

585
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,599
We should pretend like nothing happens.

586
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,239
Okay.

587
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,319
Relax. Smile like me.

588
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,599
One more time.

589
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,479
Let's go.

590
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:36,839
Do I smile better?

591
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,199
Grandpa, we are back.

592
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,079
Grandpa.

593
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,479
You are back.

594
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,080
I fell asleep.

595
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,000
Look what we bring to you.

596
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,879
River snails rice noodles.

597
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,840
Bingo.

598
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:27,520
I want this so much.

599
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,120
It's really boring to rest at home.

600
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,679
I should go out and have meals early.

601
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:32,600
I know you, right?

602
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,239
You got me.

603
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,080
You still eat casually even at home.

604
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,520
What are these?

605
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:41,719
Look. High in fat and sugar. Sugar rush.

606
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,879
The doctor enjoins you

607
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
from these kinds of foods.

608
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,560
Don't you know you get hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia?

609
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,040
Put here.

610
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,600
I am this old.

611
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,800
If I don't have them now,

612
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,760
let me take them
when I lie in the casket?

613
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,360
Let me tell you.

614
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,639
When I was about his age,
I was poor then.

615
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,719
I only wanted this walnut crisp.

616
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:02,760
But I couldn't have it
even when I was in tears.

617
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,239
You are used to a good life.

618
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,199
You don't even know

619
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,479
we people
of the older generation suffered.

620
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,320
I know you suffered,

621
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,479
but with your health condition,

622
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,159
you are not allowed
to have these, aren't you?

623
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:13,479
Please think of your heart.

624
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,840
You have undergone
the coronary bypass surgeries twice.

625
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,639
You can't disregard it

626
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,719
only because you crave for food.

627
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:18,959
I'll...

628
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,679
I'll die for anger but food.

629
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:24,879
Grandpa, don't be angry.

630
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
When it comes to food,

631
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,199
Gu Rong knows nothing.

632
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,919
Just let him go.

633
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,760
In our life,

634
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:33,719
we should eat what we like.

635
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:35,040
Or, the life will be boring.

636
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,320
Earning bread is not fun either.

637
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,159
Right. You are right.

638
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:40,600
Take it now.

639
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,439
How's it?

640
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:53,439
The noodles

641
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,479
are different from the past.

642
00:35:58,439 --> 00:35:59,439
Are they good?

643
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,320
Yummy.

644
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,600
But you still found it.

645
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:04,719
The noodles

646
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,439
are different
from the normal ones today.

647
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:09,560
The river snails rice noodles are made

648
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,000
of rice noodles and Konjac noodles.

649
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,560
They taste a bit differently.

650
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,120
But there is a huge gap in calories.

651
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,800
Really?

652
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,479
Right.

653
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,959
The low carbon diet is very popular now.

654
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,439
Even female celebrities
take it as a substitute.

655
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,840
Female celebrities have it?

656
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,000
Then, I will have it as well.

657
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:28,600
Grandpa.

658
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,560
The doctor is also right.

659
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,159
The foods high in fat and sugar

660
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,639
are not good for health indeed.

661
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:38,280
But, if we have
water-boiled cabbages every meal,

662
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:39,760
no one will stand it, right?

663
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,479
Yes.

664
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,360
Therefore,

665
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,280
who says healthy foods
are not delicious?

666
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,360
The river snails rice noodles

667
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,159
are both healthy and yummy, right?

668
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:48,000
There are lots of foods like this.

669
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:49,679
Really?

670
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,239
If you want to eat something sweet,

671
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
we have sugar substitutes.

672
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,800
If you want to have something crispy,

673
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,040
we can make them with hot air.

674
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,239
If you want to take ice creams,

675
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,760
we can make them using bananas.

676
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,080
Won't mess with you at all.

677
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:05,399
You are considerate. So considerate.

678
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,560
Right?

679
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,199
