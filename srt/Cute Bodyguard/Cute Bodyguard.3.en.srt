(Boss, you are in my way to love)

28
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:50,279
My daughter

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,519
is now a stewardess
in an airline company.

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,480
So many boys

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,040
are after her.

32
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,239
Of course.

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,239
Your daughter is beautiful.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,720
By the way,

35
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,360
what about Jingjing?

36
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,319
I've never heard of

37
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,559
her having any boyfriend.

38
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,440
Yeah.

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,440
We've worked together for years.

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,759
You never said anything about that.

41
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,639
Yeah.

42
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,240
Oh.

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,720
What about her job?

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,600
Of course.

45
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,520
She has already found a job.

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,919
A great job.

47
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,520
In a big company.

48
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,600
What does she do?

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,119
The size of company doesn't matter.

50
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,199
For girls,

51
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:29,800
a decent job is the best.

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,360
It is decent.

53
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,800
Is that Jingjing?

54
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:35,839
Come on, Mr. Gu.

55
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,119
Who is that guy?

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,919
That's her boyfriend.

57
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,520
Are you sure

58
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,720
I need to go in there?

59
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,199
Look.

60
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,160
Nobody has ever touched your face.

61
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,520
Look at your pores.

62
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,839
They are so big.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,039
Look at your skin.

64
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,759
It's getting loose.

65
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,960
Is it?

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,520
It is.

67
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
I don't think so.

68
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,199
I can't see anything wrong.

69
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,080
I don't like bragging.

70
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,559
That's why I never told you

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,000
about these things.

72
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,360
Look.

73
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,800
This is a skillful job.

74
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,759
Are you sure you can do it?

75
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,160
My mom can do it.

76
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,080
She has the skills.

77
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,279
She can teach me.

78
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,800
Just go.

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,720
If he weren't

80
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,279
her boyfriend,

81
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,199
why would she take his arm?

82
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,440
I'll ask her to teach me

83
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,199
how to give you a full service.

84
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,479
Please.

85
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,960
Mom.

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,960
Yes.

87
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,600
Come in.

88
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,679
Ma'am.

89
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,919
Ouch.

90
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,039
Keep your hand steady.

91
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,839
Keep the device vertical to the skin.

92
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,119
Don't press too hard.

93
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,479
Stop it.

94
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,279
You scream like you're laboring.

95
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,279
Why does this hurt so much?

96
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,320
Let me tell you this way.

97
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,839
Thermage is a treatment that heats

98
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,479
the dermis and fat
2 to 4 mm under the skin

99
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,080
by high-energy,
high-frequency radio waves.

100
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,360
(Information about Thermage)

101
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,600
By applying heat energy
of about 60 degrees,

102
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,960
it causes minor damage...

103
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,160
Wait.

104
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,600
What are you talking about?

105
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,919
In another word,

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,759
it means,

107
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,279
the whole process of Thermage
is done with high temperature.

108
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,720
When performing a subcutaneous focused
electric shock at a high temperature...

109
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,119
Can you keep it simple?

110
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,359
Well, it means...

111
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,399
Mr. Gu.

112
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,839
Are you interested in

113
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,720
applying for our VIP services?

114
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,519
No, I am not.

115
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,119
I can't believe I came here with you.

116
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,239
This thing hurts so much.

117
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,359
And now you are
still trying to trick me?

118
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,679
No.

119
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,880
Whatever.

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,279
Make your own decisions.

121
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
But think about your face.

122
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,399
I'm the only one who can touch it.

123
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,320
If you get a rash

124
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,880
or a pimple,

125
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,839
I won't help you.

126
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,519
How much is it?

127
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,359
The price is reasonable.

128
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,279
(Price for the VIP card)
Thermage is 12000.

129
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,519
And three…

130
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,040
Considering you are our tenant

131
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,000
and also my boss,

132
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,119
I'll give you

133
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,559
a discount of 12%.

134
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,640
5000 for three facials.

135
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,600
How is that?

136
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay.

137
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,239
As long as you don't screw up my face.

138
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:19,799
Well...

139
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,440
12000 for Thermage.

140
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,720
And 5000 for facials.

141
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,679
That'll be 17000.

142
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you.

143
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,519
You should totally

144
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,079
be a saleswoman.

145
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,399
See how happy she is?

146
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,720
Jingjing seems like a new person

147
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,480
now that she's in love.

148
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:42,760
Girls really flourish

149
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,200
in love.

150
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,079
They are crazily in love.

151
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,279
Tell you what?

152
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,000
When doing the facial,

153
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,640
he wanted no one

154
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:53,200
but Jingjing's hands on him.

155
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,880
The greatest thing

156
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,559
about this boy

157
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,920
is that he's faithful.

158
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,959
I don't need to worry at all.

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,519
Explain.

160
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,040
Don't say you know nothing about it.

161
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,920
Well...

162
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,160
Why does everyone else
get ten facials with 3000?

163
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:19,359
But for me,
it's three facials with 5000?

164
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,160
And you said it's a discount?

165
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,839
Don't get mad.

166
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,119
Think about it.

167
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,359
Who are their beauticians?

168
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,040
And who is yours?

169
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,160
You.

170
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,279
That's right.

171
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,239
Different beauticians

172
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,160
have different prices.

173
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,480
What kind of beautician are you?

174
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,399
You just learned it from your mom.

175
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,480
Am I not good enough?

176
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:41,440
Think about it.

177
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,880
Who else can touch your face?

178
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,679
There you go.

179
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,000
And that's the worth

180
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,040
of my service.

181
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:52,799
You are the only one
who gets to enjoy it.

182
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,640
Mr. Gu.

183
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:58,519
Now there's only 295000 left.

184
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,920
Why do I smell something fishy?

185
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,839
It's not.

186
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,239
That's my price.

187
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,839
I offer whatever service that pays.

188
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:09,600
Su Jingjing.

189
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:10,600
How can you say that

190
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,279
as a girl?

191
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,440
Well.

192
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,720
It does feel nice.

193
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,880
I can't believe I'm doing this
with all my martial arts techniques.

194
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Be gentle.

195
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,720
Tell me.

196
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,760
What else gold-digging service is there?

197
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,959
Anything you can think of.

198
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,920
Alright.

199
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,040
Enjoy.

200
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:04,880
Here.

201
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,760
Have one.

202
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

203
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:07,359
But I'm working.

204
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,119
I'll pass.

205
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,679
5000 if you eat it.

206
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,959
Too slow.

207
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,320
After you.

208
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,079
Mr. Gu.

209
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:23,040
I'll make your favorite dishes tonight,

210
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,600
cole with mushroom and fried shrimp.

211
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,079
You are being good lately.

212
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,440
Much better than Xie Te.

213
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,640
You look more approachable too.

214
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,200
I doubt if he can recognize you

215
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,599
when he sees you.

216
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,520
Are you really going to
leave your villa empty

217
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:46,559
and live in my home?

218
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,960
Don't worry.

219
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,679
I'll be gone when you pay off your debt.

220
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,599
Oh, my God.

221
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:56,919
Why is my senior here?

222
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,159
Look at me.

223
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,799
Is my hair alright?

224
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:04,400
Your senior is not going to marry you.

225
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,080
Do you have to be like this?

226
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,559
Why are you here, senior?

227
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,960
I just got here from the airport

228
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,960
and saw you guys here.

229
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,359
We went to the market.

230
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,280
Why didn't you tell me

231
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,880
so I can cook something you like?

232
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,159
Mr. Gu looks a little different today.

233
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,479
Indeed.

234
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,799
Let me introduce myself.

235
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,840
Now not only am I the tenant,

236
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,679
I'm also her boss

237
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,400
and her credi...

238
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,200
He means

239
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,919
I'm his assistant for now.

240
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,359
He's just my employer.

241
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,080
We have a contract.

242
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,159
Let's go home then.

243
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,080
Okay.

244
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:58,960
Jingjing.

245
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:03,919
Let's go!

246
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,840
Su Jingjing.

247
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,320
I want coffee.

248
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,840
At this hour?

249
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,640
You won't be able to sleep tonight.

250
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,640
There's instant coffee at home.

251
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,440
I don't drink that.

252
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,599
Then I'll order delivery at home.

253
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,359
No way.

254
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:17,479
That takes ages.

255
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,760
It also takes ages
for me to run to the coffee shop.

256
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,599
They get too many orders for delivery.

257
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,880
It's faster

258
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
if you run there in person.

259
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,320
Talking about running,

260
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,080
I'm yet to find someone
better than you, Mr. Gu.

261
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,000
Why did you start to act like that

262
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,719
as soon as you saw him?

263
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,599
Did you forget about the debt?

264
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,599
Are you threatening me?

265
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,440
I am.

266
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,479
If your senior knows that you have debt

267
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,400
before even getting married,

268
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,799
he won't want you.

269
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,919
Mr. Gu.

270
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,919
I'll go get your coffee now.

271
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,679
That's more like it.

272
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,760
Okay.

273
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,840
I want a Cappuccino.

274
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,880
Thank you.

275
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,640
Senior.

276
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,479
I'll be back soon.

277
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:10,679
Wait for me at home.

278
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,200
It'll be just a second.

279
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,039
I'll be quick.

280
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:13,760
Yeah.

281
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,559
Wait for me.

282
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,359
Take this.

283
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,719
It's gotta be

284
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,239
much lighter than Su Jingjing.

285
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,599
How is it?

286
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,799
Isn't it awesome?

287
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,799
I'll show you something even better.

288
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,960
Watch this.

289
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,239
Don't go.

290
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,760
Hey! Don't go!

291
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,239
Tell your parents

292
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,559
to send you here to study martial arts!

293
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,919
Children!

294
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:59,039
How did it fall?

295
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,880
Geez.

296
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,000
Master.

297
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,960
Han Ran! My biggest pupil!

298
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:08,239
Han Ran.

299
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:08,799
Come here.

300
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,599
Let me have a good look at you.

301
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,719
You came back after a business trip?

302
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,679
Yeah. I just came back.

303
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,919
You lied, Grandpa Su!

304
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,239
You said you'd give me sweets

305
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,799
if I bring them here to watch you.

306
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,559
Alright.

307
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,000
He doesn't know what he's saying.

308
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,359
Just go.

309
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Kids say all kinds of things.

310
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,919
Yeah.

311
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,679
Let me see.

312
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,280
Good.

313
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:30,359
Good.

314
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,320
Do you remember when you were little?

315
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:32,960
Yes.

316
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,400
You were such a puny kid.

317
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:36,599
I used to think

318
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,000
that I'd have done a great thing

319
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,440
if I could ever make you a fighter.

320
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,559
Do you remember I used
to make you do squats?

321
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,320
You said you'd read for as long as

322
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,080
you could keep the squat.

323
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,159
I should thank you, Master.

324
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,799
You supported me

325
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,119
when I wanted to be a writer.

326
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,400
Thank you too

327
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:54,760
for still seeing me as your pupil.

328
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,559
That's enough.

329
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,520
I understand.

330
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,840
To each his own.

331
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,679
Right?

332
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,840
But it's a shame

333
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,159
that there's no one

334
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,400
to compete with me now.

335
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,280
Maybe we can compete again.
What do you think?

336
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:08,880
I'm back.

337
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:09,880
Jingjing.

338
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,520
Look.

339
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,159
Look who's here.

340
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,640
I'll make dinner for you.

341
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:14,599
Jingjing.

342
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,000
Why did you rush home?

343
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,960
I...

344
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,119
I wanted to see you sooner.

345
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,719
You are still like a child.

346
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,799
I'm not going anywhere.

347
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,359
Why the rush?

348
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:25,880
You rushed home.

349
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,080
But he won't understand.

350
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,039
Here.

351
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,440
Have some coffee to sober up.

352
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,640
Why did you ask me to buy it

353
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,440
if you aren't drinking it?

354
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,280
Did you do this on purpose?

355
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,880
Think however you like.

356
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:45,679
You just wait.

357
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:47,799
Senior.

358
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,559
We're having dumplings for dinner.

359
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,400
Shrimp with eggs, and cole with
mushroom. How do you like it?

360
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,080
Sounds good.

361
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,599
Let's go.

362
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:57,719
So.

363
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,159
How is everything?

364
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,400
All good.

365
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,320
Don't worry, Mistress.

366
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,479
Do you know?

367
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,320
Jingjing told me

368
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,559
to fill the dumplings

369
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,080
with shrimp and eggs.

370
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,400
It smells really good.

371
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,080
Gu is here.

372
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:16,760
You...

373
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:19,039
Are you sure you'll
dress like this here?

374
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,599
Just sit there, Gu.

375
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:21,760
You don't need to do anything.

376
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,280
We can make the dumplings.

377
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,440
Thank you, ma'am.

378
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,919
Dear.

379
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,919
The dough pieces

380
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,760
are ready.

381
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,200
I'll go get some garlic.

382
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:30,200
Okay.

383
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:30,799
Senior.

384
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,320
Here.

385
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,200
I'll make one then.

386
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,000
Here.

387
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:34,840
I'll join you.

388
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:36,880
Like this.

389
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,840
Yeah.

390
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,799
It looks good.

391
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,840
You can do everything well.

392
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:50,960
I taught him how to do it

393
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,359
when he was little.

394
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,320
No wonder.

395
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,719
I'll get some flour.

396
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,559
Take your time.

397
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,000
There's no rush.

398
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,400
Okay.

399
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,000
I need the flour.

400
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,719
Okay.

401
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,479
You want to have a try, Mr. Gu?

402
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,039
If you can't do it,

403
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,400
just leave it to us.

404
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,599
Jingjing.

405
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,919
Manners.

406
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:34,760
Gu.

407
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,799
You don't have to do anything.

408
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,320
You can just join us for dinner.

409
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,119
Thank you.

410
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,280
Ran.

411
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,520
Now you are back.

412
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,440
You have to come more often.

413
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,960
After this trip,

414
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,400
I'll stay for a while.

415
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,440
I'll visit whenever I have time.

416
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,000
When you are not here,

417
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,080
Jingjing is always talking about you.

418
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:13,640
Here it comes.

419
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
Have it when it's still hot.

420
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,919
Gu.

421
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,760
Go ahead.

422
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,640
Have some.

423
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,400
Have it when it's hot.

424
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:19,880
Okay.

425
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,520
Thank you, ma'am.

426
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,960
Come and eat, Master and Mistress.

427
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,599
You enjoy yourselves.

428
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,119
Just go ahead.

429
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,400
Don't worry about us.

430
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,400
For you, senior.

431
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,080
Thank you.

432
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,640
Here.

433
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,280
Have one too.

434
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,320
This is the sauce.

435
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,760
You didn't add pepper just for me?

436
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:32,640
Yes.

437
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,599
It's delicious.

438
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,440
That's good.

439
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,760
Mr. Han.

440
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,880
Do you like sculpture exhibition?

441
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,559
Sculpture?

442
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,719
My...

443
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:53,280
My senior writes novels.

444
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,719
Why would he like sculpture exhibition?

445
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,479
He's devoted to writing.

446
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,039
Right?

447
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,520
Do you know?

448
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,960
We went to a sculpture exhibition.

449
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,199
Jingjing likes it a lot.

450
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:10,719
Jingjing.

451
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,239
I didn't know you like sculpture.

452
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,959
Okay.

453
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,839
Enough of that.

454
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,079
Time for dinner.

455
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,880
Have some, senior.

456
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:20,640
Thanks.

457
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
What about me?

458
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:27,880
Mr. Gu.

459
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,400
I was just going to.

460
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:32,079
Where is my sauce?

461
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
Go ahead.

462
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,319
Jingjing.

463
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,880
Didn't you say you like literature?

464
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,599
I'm looking for an assistant.

465
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Are you interested?

466
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,160
Of course I am.

467
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:51,319
She doesn't have time.

468
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:52,479
I'm her boss now.

469
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,520
She's my assistant.

470
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,719
She doesn't have time for that.

471
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,319
You can still do it as a part-time job.

472
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,680
You can sort the files for me

473
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,280
when you have time.

474
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,959
And Mr. Gu,

475
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,719
you don't look like
an inconsiderate boss.

476
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,239
Jingjing can have
some private time, right?

477
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,439
Mr. Han, you look like a gentleman.

478
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,599
You wouldn't tire her out
with so much work, right?

479
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,560
You misunderstood, Mr. Gu.

480
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,680
Jingjing said she likes it.

481
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,479
So I think,

482
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:17,359
this could be a good chance for her.

483
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,040
How do you know
whether she likes literature,

484
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,359
or she likes writers?

485
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,479
Of course literature.

486
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,880
Mr. Gu.

487
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,359
I have my free time, right?

488
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,920
I can help my senior

489
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,560
when I'm off work.

490
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,319
Right?

491
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:43,760
Okay.

492
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,040
Sounds good.

493
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,359
If you think you have time,

494
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:47,680
and you can still get enough rest,

495
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,760
you can go help him out

496
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
and make more money.

497
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,760
You need it anyway.

498
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,040
What a nuisance.

499
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,599
Okay.

500
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,119
Here.

501
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,359
Have more.

502
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,479
Come on.

503
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,040
Eat more.

504
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:20,816
(Su's Martial Club)

505
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,119
Jingjing.

506
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,359
Does that Mr. Gu

507
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,239
have anything against me?

508
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,239
He's not exactly friendly with me.

509
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,199
Not really.

510
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,479
That's just the way he is.

511
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,719
Very annoying,

512
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,319
quite arrogant,

513
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,719
and so grumpy.

514
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,599
Don't mind him.

515
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,359
Is she stupid or something?

516
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,319
Can't you see

517
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,239
he's not interested in you?

518
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,959
Su Jingjing.

519
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,280
I want watermelon.

520
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,959
Su Jingjing.

521
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,319
I want kiwifruits.

522
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,839
Su Jingjing.

523
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,160
Bring me some drinks.

524
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,160
I just knew

525
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:14,599
he wouldn't let me off.

526
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:15,640
Jingjing.

527
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,199
Are you sure you don't
need to go up there?

528
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:18,719
It's okay.

529
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,640
He can wait.

530
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,800
He can't do anything to me anyway.

531
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,280
Where were we?

532
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,719
Where are you going this time?

533
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,880
(The Myths of Iceland)
Iceland.

534
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:33,479
How long will you be gone?

535
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:36,520
I haven't planned it out yet.

536
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,000
That's for further discussion.

537
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,239
I see.

538
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,439
Are you thirsty, senior?

539
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,800
There's coke.

540
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,839
Okay.

541
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,920
Thank you.

542
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Senior.

543
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:04,239
I can't open this.

544
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,400
Okay.

545
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,800
I'll help you.

546
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,119
What are you doing?

547
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,719
I got thirsty from calling you.

548
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,520
I'll open it myself if you can't.

549
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,160
Okay?

550
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,439
You...

551
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,199
Didn't you already open it?

552
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,719
Is it good?

553
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,800
It's fine.

554
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:26,800
Too much sugar.

555
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,599
It's not good to drink this before bed.

556
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,760
Okay.

557
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,760
I'm going to rest.

558
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,959
Go change the aroma diffuser.

559
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,359
Can't you see I'm busy?

560
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,199
I'm afraid you'll have to
change it yourself.

561
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,239
Busy?

562
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,000
Okay.

563
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,359
I'll wait.

564
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,560
Jingjing.

565
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,400
It's getting late.

566
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,959
I should go.

567
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,319
Already?

568
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,800
I have a couple of days off.

569
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,560
I'll come tomorrow.

570
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,560
Okay.

571
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,160
It's a deal.

572
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,119
You have to come tomorrow.

573
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,439
Don't worry.

574
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,640
You've known me for so long.

575
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,760
Have I ever lied to you?

576
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,280
Be good.

577
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,119
I'll see you tomorrow.

578
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,959
See you tomorrow.

579
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,719
Bye.

580
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:16,599
Are you done now?

581
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,839
I hate to say this.

582
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,800
But can't you see I was talking with him

583
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,640
for business?

584
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,359
It's just an aroma diffuser.

585
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,680
Can't you do it on your own?

586
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,479
I didn't see any business
you were talking about.

587
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,119
But I saw

588
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,439
what someone was trying to do.

589
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,160
You clearly opened it.

590
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,760
But you pretended that you couldn't.

591
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,839
It's just a cap.

592
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,920
Why did you do this?

593
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,400
I wanted to.

594
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,280
You wanted what?

595
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,520
To pretend to be delicate?

596
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,199
What's wrong with being yourself?

597
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,040
No.

598
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,920
I just don't want him

599
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,160
to see me as a tomboy.

600
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,400
You tried so hard

601
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,119
to be someone else.

602
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,760
Aren't you tired?

603
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,400
Do you know?

604
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,760
When you like someone,

605
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,439
you would like who she is.

606
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,640
What do you know?

607
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,560
I've known him all my life.

608
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,479
I know what kind of girl he likes.

609
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,920
Besides,

610
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,760
I was just fighting

611
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,160
for my own happiness.

612
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,760
Do I not deserve happiness

613
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,479
as an ordinary girl?

614
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,119
Yes.

615
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,319
You do.

616
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,959
You can't wake up
someone who's playing possum.

617
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,920
Do you understand?

618
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:27,599
Do you think your senior

619
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,920
doesn't know you like him?

620
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,160
Don't try to read other people

621
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,280
with your own logic.

622
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,079
This is not your business.

623
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,040
Why don't you go back to your own?

624
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,800
Why are you so stubborn?

625
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,359
Stupid.

626
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,479
(Gu Rong is indignant.)

627
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,119
(How can such a forthright girl)

628
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:50,520
(fall in love with a slick guy?)

629
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,119
(He can't tell for himself)

630
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:55,239
(whether that's out of
his sense of justice)

631
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,599
(or something much subtler.)

632
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:09,199
(What should I wear
on the date with my senior?)

633
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,680
(This one?)

634
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,719
(This one?)

635
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,119
(Or these ones?)

636
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,839
(Which one will he like?)

637
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,560
You don't look busy, Mr. Han.

638
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,239
Your books don't sell well.

639
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,680
Aren't you worried?

640
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,680
I promised Jingjing I'd come.

641
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,160
I have to keep my promise.

642
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,079
Of course you do.

643
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,079
Writers need to know
their characters' mind, right?

644
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,439
Are you really good with

645
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,560
those slick characters?

646
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,359
I don't understand what you mean.

647
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,760
Maybe you do understand

648
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,680
and pretend that you don't.

649
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,319
Jingjing.

650
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:20,599
You really dressed up today.

651
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,680
You look better
when you don't put on makeup.

652
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,560
You are more comfortable to be with

653
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,479
when you keep your mouth shut.

654
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,560
It doesn't matter

655
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,439
if you make other people comfortable.

656
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,640
You should be comfortable with yourself.

657
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,400
Senior.

658
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,959
Let's go.

659
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,800
Where do you want to go?

660
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,560
I want to revisit

661
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,719
our old memories.

662
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:46,920
Okay.

663
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:53,479
Mr. Gu.

664
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,280
I'm taking the day off.

665
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,160
No way.

666
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,199
Why?

667
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,160
You have other arrangements?

668
00:25:57,479 --> 00:25:58,400
No.

669
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,760
I'm just

670
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:03,000
in a bad mood.

671
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,599
You can just deduct it from my paycheck.

672
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,000
The exhibition...

673
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,839
How about we all go?

674
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,959
You can take a walk and relax, Mr. Gu.

675
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,199
Fine.

676
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:27,800
Let's go.

677
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,640
Okay.

678
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,479
Let's go.

679
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,479
Now he's in a good mood.

680
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,319
But my date is ruined.

681
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,479
Jingjing.

682
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,439
What are you saying?

683
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,680
No.

684
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,719
Nothing.

685
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:02,864
(Milk tea for couples.
Half price for the second cup.)

686
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:05,616
(Milk tea for couples.
Half price for the second cup.)

687
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,479
(Milk tea for couples.
Half price for the second cup.)

688
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:10,119
Senior.

689
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:11,439
Do you want milk tea?

690
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,359
Okay.

691
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,040
I'll get it.

692
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,479
Senior.

693
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,520
What are you doing?

694
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,880
I heard that milk tea
gives you a good mood.

695
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:40,800
I want to try.

696
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:44,719
It's fine.

697
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,280
Jingjing.

698
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,920
You drink this one.

699
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,199
I'll get another one.

700
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:50,959
Stop drinking.

701
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:05,040
(Rong Hua Middle School)

702
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:08,800
Jingjing.

703
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Look.

704
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,839
You still have this photo?

705
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,040
Of course.

706
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:18,160
We should take
another one just like this.

707
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,839
Mr. Gu.

708
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Help us.

709
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,280
Isn't it boring

710
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,479
to take a picture

711
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,959
exactly like ten years ago?

712
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,839
Just help us.

713
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,719
Done.

714
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,680
What is this?

715
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,359
I can't take a good picture

716
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,800
when I'm in a bad mood.

717
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:01,280
It's better to bring
a selfie stick than you.

718
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,520
Senior.

719
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
Let's take a selfie.

720
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,000
Okay.

721
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,640
Here.

722
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,239
I'll do it.

723
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,359
Three, two, one.

724
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,000
It's okay.

725
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:18,760
We'll do it again.

726
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:24,520
Three, two, one.

727
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,400
How about taking a walk
in the lakeside park?

728
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:32,920
Okay.

729
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,400
Great.

730
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,760
There must be so many
people on the weekend.

731
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:39,920
Mr. Gu.

732
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,319
You can go home
if you don't want to stay.

733
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,400
I don't have a body...

734
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,359
I don't have an assistant.

735
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,520
It's too dangerous to go alone.

736
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,880
Mr. Gu.

737
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,199
I am very curious.

738
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,959
How did you live for all those years

739
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,719
without me?

740
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,040
Su Jingjing.

741
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,119
Don't bother trying to drive me away.

742
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:10,959
Senior.

743
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,920
Let's go.

744
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,640
Let's go.

745
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,160
Let's go.

746
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:21,800
(Sis.)

747
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,560
(Help me drive the third wheel away.)

748
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,520
(Come quick.)

749
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,319
Senior.

750
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,280
Just a minute.

751
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:33,800
Ai Mi should be here any minute.

752
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,560
It's okay.

753
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,000
Let me tell you.

754
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:07,680
Gu Rong has been
bugging me for half a day.

755
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,319
I can only count on you

756
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,119
to stall him.

757
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,280
No problem.

758
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,680
Nice to see you again, Han Ran.

759
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:17,959
Hello, Mr. Gu.

760
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,760
I'm Jingjing's friend, Ai Mi.

761
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,119
I've heard a lot about you.

762
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,400
Nothing good, I guess.

763
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:27,959
I'm here today

764
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,760
to bring you all kinds of supplies.

765
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,520
Yeah.

766
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,520
How could I forget that?

767
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,680
Let's go then.

768
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,119
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

769
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,119
I got a lot of food.

770
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:39,959
- Is it heavy?
- Heavy?

771
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,880
- Let me carry it.
- It's not.

772
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,199
Oh, my bag.

773
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:51,479
It looks like a lot of fun there.

774
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:53,239
It's beautiful.

775
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,760
Let's rent a bike for a ride.

776
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,400
Great.

777
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,359
But I'm really bad at riding a bike.

778
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:07,760
That's true.

779
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,040
Mr. Gu.

780
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:12,560
You'll have to take me with you.

781
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,119
Sorry, I don't know how to ride a bike.

782
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,239
Plus, I have haphephobia.

783
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,839
I can only ride with Su Jingjing.

784
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,359
I forgot.

785
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,079
He has problems.

786
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,760
We'll find another chance.

787
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,880
Are you ready?

788
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:49,839
Let's go.

789
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,520
Come on, Jingjing.

790
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,680
Hurry up.

791
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,479
What are you waiting for?

792
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,959
I can't believe

793
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:30,199
there's still someone
who doesn't know how to ride a bike.

794
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,479
Mr. Gu.

795
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,160
Maybe you should learn it.

796
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,760
I don't think that's necessary.

797
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,040
You're doing just fine.

798
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,680
Thank you so much.

799
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,719
You're welcome.

800
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,599
I was in a hurry.

801
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:57,920
I brought snacks

802
00:33:58,479 --> 00:34:00,119
but no drinks.

803
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,439
It's okay.

804
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,199
No way.

805
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,520
I need to go get some.

806
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,319
Mr. Gu.

807
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:08,239
Maybe you can come with me?

808
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,280
You can help me out.

809
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,879
It's not something

810
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,600
Su Jingjing can't do on her own.

811
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:20,360
Mr. Gu.

812
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,159
This is when

813
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,280
you are supposed to

814
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,959
be a gentleman.

815
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,560
Mr. Han is more of a gentleman than me.

816
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,520
Maybe he should go.

817
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:31,959
I'll go.

818
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,919
Yeah.

819
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,959
Han Ran and Jingjing can go together.

820
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,080
Just four drinks.

821
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,159
He can bring them back alone.

822
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:44,320
Mr. Han, you look like a gentleman.

823
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,000
You wouldn't tire out a girl,

824
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,399
right?

825
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,280
Mr. Han.

826
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:48,679
Well...

827
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,080
We can get the drinks later.

828
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,840
That can wait.

829
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,479
Su Jingjing.

830
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:23,239
I told you to dress like normal people.

831
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,199
See what fancy clothes got you?

832
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,679
Fine. I know.

833
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,879
What now?

834
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,320
Jingjing.

835
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:29,439
What's wrong?

836
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:31,800
Mr. Gu?

837
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,639
Follow me.

838
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,280
Wait here.

839
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,479
Mr. Gu!

840
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,239
He!

841
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:38,879
He!

842
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:41,199
Mr. Gu!

843
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,679
Why can he run so fast?

844
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:46,280
Is your company
next to a gym or something?

845
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,439
Hurry up.

846
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,239
Quick.

847
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:55,479
Mr. Gu!

848
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,520
He!

849
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,600
Jingjing!

850
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,080
Mr. Gu!

851
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,199
How long are you going to
ride this thing?

852
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,120
Just hit him.

853
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,000
Mr. Gu!

854
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,280
I can't hit him

855
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:12,959
in broad day light.

856
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,320
It's bad education for those kids.

857
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,000
Young lady!

858
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:17,399
Wait!

859
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,239
You just don't want to do it

860
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,560
in front of him, right?

861
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,000
Fine.

862
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,080
Then ride faster.

863
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:23,439
This is the best I can do.

864
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:24,280
You can get off.

865
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:26,199
We can be quicker that way.

866
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,239
Mr. Gu!

867
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,719
Their bike is there.

868
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,360
Good afternoon, everyone.

869
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,919
The chairman is feeling unwell.

870
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,479
I will host the acquisition meeting.

871
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Of course.

872
00:36:59,199 --> 00:36:59,959
It's the same.

873
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,159
Let's begin.

874
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,040
The acquisition of Hualin

875
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,639
is in the charge of Chief Jiang.

876
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,040
Tell us, Mr. Jiang.

877
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:07,719
Okay.

878
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:11,320
(Information about Hualin project)

879
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,520
Hualin's capital chain
is in serious trouble now.

880
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,000
They also had major personnel changes

881
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,760
in the company.

882
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,199
It's now a big mess.

883
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,919
I think now is the best time

884
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,479
to make the acquisition.

885
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,360
Yeah.

886
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,360
Once they pull this through,

887
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:29,879
it won't be so easy anymore.

888
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,520
I've also done my research on it.

889
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,080
Their capital chain

890
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,199
does have its problems.

891
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:38,520
But that's not the focal point.

892
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,600
The cause is that one of their

893
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,639
international orders went wrong.

894
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:44,520
They're praying for someone
to take that over.

895
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,199
As for the personnel changes
you mentioned.

896
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,120
Mr. Jiang.

897
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:51,239
Their new sales director

898
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,679
knows you pretty well, right?

899
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,679
Bai Anrou.

900
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,159
What's that supposed to mean?

901
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,879
This is slander.

902
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,639
This is not.

903
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:06,600
The board of supervisors
will start to investigate

904
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,320
and find out the truth.

905
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,399
The chairman is feeling unwell.

906
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:14,879
The president is not in the company.

907
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,879
But as long as

908
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,120
I'm here,

909
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,399
I won't let anything happen to Gu Group.

910
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,800
I hope all of you can do your job well

911
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,639
and keep the company running.

912
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,159
That's right.

913
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:29,360
That's all for today's meeting.

914
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,000
You can go now.

915
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:37,719
Bai Anrou!

916
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,800
Who do you think you are?

917
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:41,199
You are not married into the family yet!

918
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,639
Now that the chairman is ill,

919
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:47,120
who should we listen to?

920
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,048
(Xie Te)

921
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:49,080
(Miss Bai.)

922
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,439
(Mr. Gu called and said
Chief He found him.)

923
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,080
Mr. Gu.

924
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,080
Stop running.

925
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,080
Come back with me.

926
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:19,840
Do it.

927
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:20,879
Now.

928
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,120
Han Ran's not here.

929
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,439
Ouch!

930
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,040
It's you again?

931
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,520
I'm his bodyguard now.

932
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:32,679
Bodyguard?

933
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,760
Are you afraid now?

934
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,199
Then disappear.

935
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,120
Disappear?

936
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,360
If I disappear here today,

937
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:39,120
tomorrow I'll get fired in the company.

938
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,080
Then I won't go easy on you.

939
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,679
It broke.

940
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,000
Already?

941
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,879
I'll set it back in.

942
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,040
Let's go.

943
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,040
Mr. Gu!

944
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:51,280
Mr. Gu!

945
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,479
Where are they?

946
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Mr. Gu!

947
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,159
Mr. Gu!

948
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,919
At last.

949
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:08,840
I am exhausted.
