(Su's Martial Club)

29
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,400
Mom, I'm back.

30
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:51,680
Jingjing.

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,919
Mom.

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,559
Our house is cramped enough.

33
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:03,279
Why is there

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
a huge telescope here?

35
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,000
Someone sent it here.

36
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,959
Said that he brought it back

37
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,160
from the park for Gu Rong.

38
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,800
(Is that all you want?)

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,679
(What's wrong with it?)

40
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,440
(I just want to see it with him.)

41
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,160
(In the park.)

42
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,039
(On the stone stairs.)

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,160
(How romantic will it be)

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,639
(if I can sit there with him)

45
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,160
(watching the meteor shower?)

46
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,320
(If only we had a telescope.)

47
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,240
(That'd be even greater.)

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
No matter what,

49
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,880
thank you.

50
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,679
Don't flatter yourself.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,199
I just changed my schedule

52
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:46,160
and wanted to go to the park.

53
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,119
It's got nothing to do with you.

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,320
(Since when has he)

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,839
(become so strange?)

56
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,639
(He clearly wanted to
watch the meteor shower with me.)

57
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,320
(He just wouldn't admit it.)

58
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,279
(What's wrong with me?)

59
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,639
(Why would I care about)

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,279
(this annoying guy so much?)

61
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,639
Thank you for the medicine.

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
You're welcome.

63
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,479
Why are you putting that on your face?

64
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,960
What do you know?
This is an emergency trick.

65
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,240
So I can be all pretty

66
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,720
at the dinner party.

67
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,600
Only plastic surgery

68
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,360
can save your face.

69
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,720
I think you should just give up.

70
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,440
Whatever you say.

71
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:11,880
I won't let someone like you

72
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,399
ruin my mood.

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,040
Bright red.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,880
Cherry pink.

75
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,359
Cameo brown.

76
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,679
Which will he like?

77
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,640
He will like none.

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,200
Did I ask you?

79
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,119
How would you know what he likes?

80
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,040
I'll dress up all pretty.

81
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,839
When I show up at the dinner party,

82
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,600
everyone will know

83
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:55,600
that I'm his girlfriend.

84
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,839
And all the other clueless women

85
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,279
will stay away from him.

86
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,079
I'm afraid you are the only one

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,279
who's clueless.

88
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,160
Stop smiling.
You got the mask in your mouth.

89
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,959
Calm down.

90
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,119
Don't get mad with him.

91
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:27,320
It only gives you wrinkles.

92
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,680
(Xie Te)

93
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,799
Xie Te.

94
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,679
Whatever you do,

95
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,359
get me an invitation

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,040
of the dinner party

97
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,000
of Han Ran's publishing company

98
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,320
before tonight.

99
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,640
The invitation

100
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,559
of his dinner party?

101
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,720
Mr. Gu.

102
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,559
What if the chairman notices

103
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,279
what you're doing?

104
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,600
No questions.

105
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,200
I'm your boss.

106
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,279
Get it straight.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,200
Miss Bai.

108
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,959
Thank God it's you.

109
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,559
It'd be over for me if it was Chief He.

110
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,880
Mr. Gu is going to the dinner party

111
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,600
of a publishing company?

112
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,079
That's news.

113
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,640
I know he likes sculpture.

114
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Since when has he
got interested in literature?

115
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:38,320
I don't really know.

116
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,040
Okay. You can go.

117
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,839
I'll get the invitation.

118
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,519
But what am I supposed to tell Mr. Gu?

119
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:47,640
Don't worry.

120
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,679
I know what to say.

121
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,079
Thank you, Miss Bai.

122
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,279
(Dinner party?)

123
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,079
Didn't you come too early?

124
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,279
When will Mr. Zhang be here?

125
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,119
Just wait for a while.

126
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,320
Are you in a hurry?

127
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't worry. I'm here.

128
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,920
Gu Rong.

129
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,399
Anrou, why are you here?

130
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,399
Xie said you'll be here.

131
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:08,640
I'm afraid that something will go wrong

132
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,519
in a place like this.

133
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,079
So I'm here to accompany you.

134
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,239
It's about time. Let's go.

135
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,959
Have you thought about the trip?

136
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,600
You said you wanted to go to Iceland.

137
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,279
Now is the best time to go.

138
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,760
You can check this out if you have time.

139
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,440
Let's go.

140
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,119
Thank you. Change of plan.

141
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,599
I'm not going there.

142
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,520
Cheers.

143
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,080
Yeah? I think it's pretty interesting.

144
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,599
Long time no see, Mr. Li.

145
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,719
Mr. Wang.

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,520
Try this, Jingjing.

147
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:58,520
You might like this.

148
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,440
Okay.

149
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,679
Is it good?

150
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,719
Han.

151
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,840
Is this your girlfriend?

152
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,840
Nice girl you got there.

153
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,599
You two caught my eye
as soon as I got in.

154
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,440
Such a perfect pair.

155
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,960
Mr. Zhang, you misunderstood.

156
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,960
This girl can't be my girlfriend.

157
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:31,679
So she is...

158
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,039
She's my junior sister.
We grew up together.

159
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,119
She's more important than
a girlfriend. She's family.

160
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,679
Family?

161
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Family...

162
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,559
Of course she can't be
Han Ran's girlfriend.

163
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,200
Because I'm pursuing Miss Su.

00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,320
Stop it. I don't know how.

174
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,719
You are the only one who can touch me.

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,520
So you have to dance with me. Come.

176
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,512
♪Listen through the ends of your hair♪

177
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,660
♪Every cell of mine♪

178
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,232
♪Says to love you♪

179
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:48,208
♪I'm sure and confirm♪

180
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:52,336
♪How firm I love you♪

181
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,719
Can I ask you for a dance?

182
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,960
My honor.

183
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,679
Sorry.

184
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,479
It's okay.

185
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
You are my lady companion today.

186
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,200
You only need to look at me.

187
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,880
Miss Bai, is Mr. Gu serious?

188
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,679
I don't know.

189
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:32,559
Jingjing is very innocent.
I'm worried about her.

190
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:36,080
Mr. Han, even I can see

191
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,960
she doesn't just want to be your sister.

192
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,919
Since you chose to play dumb
from the start,

193
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:42,440
why would you pretend
that you care about her now?

194
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,640
Do you know how cruel it is

195
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,840
to give someone hope and then break it?

196
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:53,760
Miss Bai, Mr. Gu...

197
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,080
I must look like a fool today.

198
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,760
Why?

199
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,599
You look

200
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,640
captivating today.

201
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,599
I picked the dress for you, remember?

202
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,559
What good does it do?

203
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,000
I was doing everything in vain.

204
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,719
I have to use the bathroom.

205
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,679
If you really mean what you said,

206
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,080
I hope you can be good to her.

207
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,400
If you were only joking,

208
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,479
you should tell her immediately.

209
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,200
I don't want to see her getting hurt.

210
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,719
Is it?

211
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,479
But it's you who's hurting her.

212
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,280
Yeah, it's me.

213
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,719
It's my fault
for not telling her directly.

214
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,280
But now I have told her.

215
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,119
It's too late. You let it happen.

216
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,559
And you embarrassed her today.

217
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:10,000
Is that how

218
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,679
you don't want her getting hurt?

219
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,960
I see Jingjing as my family,

220
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,840
and nothing else.

221
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,679
That's good.

222
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,119
As for me, you don't
have to worry about it.

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,599
You don't want her getting hurt.

224
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:28,119
But I won't allow anyone to hurt her.

225
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,359
Okay. I hope you can remember

226
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,760
what you said today.

227
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,119
She's coming out soon.

228
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,840
She'll feel awkward seeing you.

229
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,400
I'll send her home tonight.

230
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,440
You should go.

231
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,080
Do you need help?

232
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,000
I hate these parties.

233
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,880
You can never eat and drink
as you want in there.

234
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,919
Come with me to grab something to eat.

235
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,840
Thank you for saving me back there.

236
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:30,159
I'm not hungry. Just go alone.

237
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,919
How can you not be?

238
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,919
You've barely eaten anything
since this morning.

239
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,919
I really don't want to go.

240
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,799
I just want to walk alone.

241
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,239
I can come with you.

242
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,640
No.

243
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:43,960
I don't want other people

244
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,840
to see me like this.

245
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,400
Nonsense.

246
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:51,440
What is there I haven't seen?

247
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,079
Turn right there and it's my home.

248
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,040
Okay.

249
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,680
I was rude at the party.

250
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,199
I'm sorry.

251
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,800
It's okay. Maybe you are right.

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,719
If you really don't want Miss Su

253
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,719
to get hurt,

254
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,640
there's something I need to tell you.

255
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,880
What is it?

256
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,520
Gu Rong's grandpa,

257
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,719
the chairman of Gu Group,

258
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,599
he set the standards and choice

259
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,680
for his granddaughter-in-law long ago.

260
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,719
And Miss Su doesn't really

261
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:01,199
meet the standards.

262
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,920
Miss Bai.

263
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:09,319
I guess you are his choice, right?

264
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,239
Mr. Han.

265
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,119
Thank you for driving me home. Goodbye.

266
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:22,599
Miss Bai.

267
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,400
Wait a second.

268
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,199
I don't think Jingjing has to

269
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,319
worry about what you just said.

270
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,119
Mr. Gu is pursuing Jingjing now.

271
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
What kind of standards he has

272
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,199
and gets to have,

273
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,920
that's his business.

274
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,160
Miss Bai is so smart.

275
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,439
You should know what I mean.

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,079
Mr. Han.

277
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,400
Can I have your phone for a second?

278
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,319
Okay. Now we are even.

279
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:25,712
(100 yuan RMB)

280
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:34,128
(Nickname of Bai Anrou)

281
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:53,712
(Jingjing, about tonight, I...)

282
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,680
(Do you know how cruel it is)

283
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:03,800
(to give someone hope
and then break it?)

284
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
(But it's you who's hurting her.)

285
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,680
(It's them.)

286
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:32,199
(I have to find a way to lose them.)

287
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:38,800
I want to have barbecue.

288
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,239
Let's go.

289
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Didn't you say it causes cancer?

290
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,400
Why would you want that now?

291
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,239
Let's cut them off in the front, Chief.

292
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,160
Let's go.

293
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,040
That's all.

294
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,959
- Thank you.
- I'll bring it soon.

295
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,520
Chief He would never know

296
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,640
that we went back here.

297
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,160
Do you want some drinks?

298
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,520
Do you know what this is?

299
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,920
Bomb shot?

300
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:17,800
Wrong.

301
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,000
Lover's tear.

302
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,599
Easy.

303
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:33,072
(Jingjing, I'm sorry.)

304
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,319
Slow down.

305
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,800
That's enough.

306
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Eat something.

307
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,079
Hurry up.

308
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,719
Just like this chicken heart.

309
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,199
I'll cut him off

310
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,359
and never turn back.

311
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,520
Slow down.

312
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,319
(Senior, you bought a new car.)

313
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,920
(I'll stick these toys on it.)

314
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,239
(So they can be with you)

315
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,599
(when I'm not.)

316
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,920
(And they'll smile at you)

317
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,839
(when you are sad.)

318
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,199
I'll just drink this.

319
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,760
What? You brought me here to drink.

320
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,319
Trying to stop me is one thing.

321
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,880
How can you be so hesitant about this?

322
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:05,839
Drink it.

323
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,880
I never asked you to drink.

324
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,920
Just this one.

325
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,479
That's it. That's more like a man.

326
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,239
What is that?

327
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,000
That's it. Stop.

328
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,880
That's enough.

329
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,680
Have another go!

330
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,319
What?

331
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,079
Go where?

332
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,280
Okay.

333
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,680
That's enough.

334
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,359
That's enough?

335
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,959
That's enough happiness for today?

336
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,119
You are not happy.

337
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,079
Of course I am.

338
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,520
Since I got up this morning,

339
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,800
I exfoliated, I picked my lipstick...

340
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,439
I did everything within my power.

341
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,400
Why am I not happy?

342
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,000
I starved myself all day

343
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,560
to get into this dress.

344
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,439
It's so tight.

345
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,560
What are you doing?

346
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,800
This is public space.

347
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,920
Tell me.

348
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,839
Do you think I'm pretty?

349
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,520
Say it.

350
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,119
I only found out today

351
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,319
that I'm his family.

352
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,839
I'm just his family.

353
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,520
I don't want it.

354
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:22,280
I'm just happy. I'm not crying.

355
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,680
I'm happy.

356
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,000
Su Jingjing.

357
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,760
Why taking pictures of me?

358
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,319
Give it to me.

359
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,119
No.

360
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,959
Your senior definitely
never saw you like this.

361
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,880
This is who you really are.

362
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,119
I'm so ugly. Delete it.

363
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:57,599
No. I'll show him.

364
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,439
Why am I so ugly?

365
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,880
Senior would never like me.

366
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,760
That's enough.

367
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,920
You've had enough drink.

368
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,119
Let's go.

369
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,920
Geez. Su Jingjing!

370
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:23,760
Let's go.

371
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:28,479
Why are you so heavy?

372
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,680
Don't say that.

373
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,160
Okay.

374
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,599
We'll wait for a taxi.

375
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,959
I don't want a taxi. I feel sick.

376
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:36,800
Well...

377
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,640
Let's walk back then.

378
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:42,239
Walk?

379
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:44,560
Okay.

380
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,079
The other way.

381
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,319
Lift your feet.

382
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,599
Hold on to me.

383
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,800
These shoes don't suit you.

384
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:08,160
The other one.

385
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,680
We'll throw them away

386
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:23,800
and get a new pair.

Why are you so heavy, Su Jingjing?

403
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,000
I want to ride that.

404
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,439
I want to ride that.

405
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,160
Okay.

406
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,359
Seesaw.

407
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,119
Okay.

408
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:24,959
Put me down.

409
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:25,920
Okay, okay.

410
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,680
Seesaw.

411
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,199
Careful.

412
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,760
Mr. Li's shop is still open.

413
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,560
Put these on.

414
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,560
Go sit there.

415
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,359
Go.

416
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,680
Okay, okay.

417
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,319
Up. Up.

418
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:21,280
I used to love playing this.

419
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,239
Every day after school,

420
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,239
senior would bring me here
to play seesaw.

421
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,160
I practiced martial arts every day.

422
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,599
None of the kids liked me.

423
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,359
Only he would play with me,

424
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,680
and study with me.

425
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,239
Senior.

426
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,119
It's getting harder and harder
to see you.

427
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:57,000
I want to go back to when we were kids.

428
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,719
Senior.

429
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,439
Senior.

430
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,439
Su Jingjing.

431
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:15,760
Wake up.

432
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm Gu Rong, not your senior.

433
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,119
Why can't you understand?

434
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,839
He only sees you as his sister,

435
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,920
his family.

436
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:26,079
Liar.

437
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:29,959
Liar.

438
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,719
I'm not his real sister.

439
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,160
We'll go our own ways in the future.

440
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
What else can I do

441
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,839
except becoming his girlfriend?

442
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
I see.

443
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,439
You call this love?

444
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:47,000
Are you three?

445
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,119
You are yelling at me.

446
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Okay. Stop crying.

447
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,599
Let's go home. Okay?

448
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:58,800
Don't bully me.

449
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,400
Alright.

450
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,959
Okay. Stop crying.

451
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,640
Let's go home.

452
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,400
Don't yell at me then.

453
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,439
As if you were always nice to me.

454
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,319
I did my research.

455
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:12,079
I don't need

456
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:12,920
Thermage at all.

457
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:16,040
Thermage.

458
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,479
Look at you.

459
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,680
Can't let you drink anymore.

460
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,280
Let's go home.

461
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,119
Cheers.

462
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:22,839
No one's drinking.

You are waking people up.

466
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:27,199
Keep your voice down.

467
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,199

00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,560
I want to drink.

Enough.

473
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,719
We're home.

474
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,280
You drank enough.

475
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,040
Drink.

476
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,719
Keep it down.

477
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,439
They are sleeping.

Let's go.

479
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,439
What now?

480
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,199
What do you want now?

481
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,040
Open up! I want plum juice.

482
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,800
Let's just go home.

483
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:53,000
Let's go.

484
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,920
Puppy.

485
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:57,599
Puppy.

486
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,199
What is it now?

487
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,640
My heels are gone.

488
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:09,560
Jingjing. It's not the heels.

489
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,880
Your high heel shoes are gone.

490
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,439
My shoes.

491
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,800
My shoes are expensive.

492
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,680
I need to find them.

493
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,479
Leave them. I'll buy you a new pair.

494
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:20,920
Buy?

495
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,599
Buy.

496
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,520
Let's go.

497
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:24,640
Jingjing. Go home.

498
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,439
Jingjing.

499
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,280
Just go home.

500
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,040
She's fine.

501
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,719
Hurry up.

502
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:28,479
She's okay.

503
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,239
Let's go home.

504
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,959
Okay. Sorry.

505
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,239
Sorry for the noise.

506
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,000
Good night, everyone.

507
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:36,079
I'm sorry.

508
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:37,280
That's enough.

509
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,520
Just go home.

510
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:41,640
Su Jingjing.

511
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,359
I can't carry you anymore.
You are so heavy.

512
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:49,280
Okay. Stop screaming.

513
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:51,359
Stop it.

514
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:52,560
What happened?

515
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,079
Ma'am.

516
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,599
She fell?

517
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,040
No. She had a little drink.

518
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,119
Drink?

519
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:59,239
How can she drink so much?

520
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,920
She's just like her dad.

521
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,079
A terrible drinker.

522
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:03,839
I...

523
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,719
What is it?

524
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,520
I need to pee.

525
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,920
Mom will take you there.

526
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,959
Jingjing. I'm mom.

527
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,599
Do you recognize me?

528
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,319
Mom.

529
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,520
Easy. Easy.

530
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,160
Okay.

531
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:18,719
Careful.

532
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,719
Is she okay, ma'am?

533
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,920
She's all settled.

534
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,560
You should go sleep too.

535
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,640
Good night.

536
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,280
What is it?

537
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,840
Senior gave me

538
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:25,239
so many blind boxes.

539
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,560
But I didn't get any secret figure.

540
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,919
Not even one.

541
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,239
Don't cry.

542
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,439
You're gonna wake up your dad.

543
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,320
I'll get you new ones, okay?

544
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
Stop crying.

545
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,120
Xie Te. Pick up.

546
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,320
Xie Te.

547
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,000
(Mr. Gu.)

548
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:54,000
Order a new batch of
blind boxes to the martial club.

549
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,760
To help with Ai Mi's business,

550
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,439
and also with the club's recruitment.

551
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,760
(Not to cheer Jingjing up?)

552
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:01,000
That's part of the reason.

553
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:03,040
(Okay. Thank you on behalf of Ai Mi.)

554
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,120
That's all.

555
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,520
Blind box...

556
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,360
Su Jingjing?

557
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:43,199
Where am I?

558
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:50,800
I...

559
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,120
Why am I here?

560
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,199
What happened last night?

561
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:44,080
I can't remember a thing.

562
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,679
Gu.

563
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:57,919
I'm so sorry

564
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,879
for the trouble last night.

565
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,040
It's alright.

566
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,360
Thank you.

567
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,239
It's okay.

568
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:04,399
I'll wash

569
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,600
your shirt too.

570
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,479
Don't worry about it.

571
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:08,120
You don't have to do this, ma'am.

572
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:08,959
No.

573
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,560
You finally got up?

574
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,439
What did you do last night?

575
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,399
I...

576
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:22,520
The color of this lipstick
looks familiar.

577
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,479
I'm asking you a question.

578
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,479
