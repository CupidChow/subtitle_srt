Come in.

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,919
Here are the applicants' works

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,919
that are selected
by the Design Department.

32
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,000
Please check them out.

33
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,600
If you are okay with it,

34
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,320
I will arrange
the applicants for the interviews.

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,919
(Su Jingjing's resume)
Su Jingjing. Sounds familiar.

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,039
She is Mr. Gu's girlfriend.

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,720
She is hot-debated recently.

38
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,839
It is said that Ms. Su
joined the company as a bodyguard.

39
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,919
She also helped the group
promote a big project.

40
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,160
Even Miss Bai

41
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,919
is taking a long leave due to her.

42
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,119
Leave her out.

43
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:47,720
Well...

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,520
I don't think it's good.

45
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,759
She is Mr. Gu's girlfriend after all.

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,919
Our department

47
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,440
doesn't need someone who gets
the position by pulling the strings.

48
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,880
If Mr. Gu is unsatisfied,

49
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,960
ask him to reach out to me himself.

50
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:06,919
Okay.

51
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:09,520
There you off.

(Su's Martial Club)

The Design Department
just replied to my application.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,559
I received a reply
from the Design Department.

55
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:30,440
How is it?

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,320
I haven't read it.

57
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,080
I'm nervous.

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,479
Don't worry. I am with you.

59
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:07,024
(A reply from the Design Department)
(You are not suitable for this position.)

60
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:17,200
(You are not suitable for this position.)

61
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Jingjing.

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,040
It's fine. I am used to it.

63
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:34,480
Since I was young, I always get

64
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,880
a "Thank You"
when I engage in a lucky draw.

65
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,239
I get used to it early.

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,760
You also prove to me

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
that you didn't pull the strings, right?

68
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,760
Someone's knocking. Go open the door.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,839
I feel sleepy.

70
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,880
I'll go upstairs to sleep.

71
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,320
I heard that the Design Department
unveiled the list today.

72
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,720
How's it? Does Jingjing pass?

73
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,519
To celebrate her,
we especially bought...

74
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,399
Ai Mi.

75
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,839
Jingjing has never ever won the drawings

76
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,040
since she was little?

77
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,239
It seems to be true.

78
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,279
Help me check

79
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,040
why Jingjing didn't pass the first test.

80
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,119
Okay. No problem.

81
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,640
Su Jingjing.

82
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,399
The subscriber you dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

83
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,640
Please redial later.

84
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,279
Get up.

85
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Get up.

86
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,079
Leave me alone, can't you?

87
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,279
You have been alone for a day.

88
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,440
I am just a bit tired.

89
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,559
I want to have a rest.

90
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,320
Why do you sleep at noon?

91
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,839
Get up and walk with me.

92
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:41,920
Gu Rong.

93
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,799
Leave me alone for a while.

94
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,799
Hurry up.

95
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,679
Dilly-dallying.

96
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,799
If you want to console me,

97
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,480
then you don't have to do this.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,880
I would rather sleep at home alone

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,160
to get through it.

100
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,799
No way.

101
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,320
I can't let you face it

102
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,279
alone.

103
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,880
So overbearing?

104
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,000
Right.

105
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,480
I am hungry. Let's have something.

106
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,959
I've lost my appetite.

107
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,000
Go eat yourself.

108
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,119
It's improper to let you eat alone.

109
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,279
What do you want to have? My treat.

110
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,119
Japanese food.

111
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,200
Japanese food?

112
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,480
They are all raw and cold.

113
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,119
Don't you think my heart is cold enough?

114
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,320
What about that crayfish?

115
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,119
It's hotter.

116
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,359
Didn't he tell us to take action
in front of the Japanese food shop?

117
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,679
Why do they go away?

118
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,839
Maybe she doesn't
want to have Japanese food.

119
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,600
Plan B. Follow them.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,440
Don't just peel the crayfish.

121
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:30,239
Have more.
Didn't you say you are hungry?

122
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,400
No. I want to
help you with the crayfish.

123
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,520
(Here.)

124
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,280
(All yours. Eat these first.)

125
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,200
Here. Eat more.

126
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,960
Give all to me?

127
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,880
Hello.

128
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,479
We have a promotion today.

129
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,200
As long as you have meals here,

130
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,400
you can take part
in the drawing for once.

131
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,559
Drawing?

132
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,239
Yes.

133
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,840
Anything but it.

134
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:06,719
I will give it up. I have bad luck.

135
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:08,200
I won't win.

136
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,320
Have a try.

137
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,960
You won't win if you don't try.

138
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,679
You might make it if you try, right?

139
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,840
Yes. Miss. Please have a try.

140
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,200
Maybe you will win.

141
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,799
Right.

142
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,159
Try it. I will go with you.

143
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,320
Go with me?

144
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,159
Let's go.

145
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,840
This way, please.

146
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,559
I will start it.

147
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:43,119
Okay.

148
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,200
I dare not see it.

149
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,239
It's okay.

150
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:51,000
Has it stopped?

151
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,880
(First Prize)
Not yet. Almost there.

152
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,400
The first prize. It's the first prize.

153
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,760
Congratulations!

154
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,440
I...

155
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,960
Here is your prize. Please take it.

156
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,880
Thank you.

157
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,840
I won a prize.

158
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,760
See? I've told you.

159
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,799
You might win if you try, right?

160
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,119
Are you happy?

161
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,799
Yes. I'm happy.

162
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,159
Done.

163
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,960
How is that possible?

164
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,200
A person like me
is able to win a prize.

165
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:31,919
Why not?

166
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,880
Congrats. Miss.

167
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,679
You are the 1314th consumer of the mall.

168
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,159
You can hit

169
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,640
a golden egg today.

170
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,239
H-hit a golden egg?

171
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:47,559
Give it a try.

172
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,799
You have good luck today.

173
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,679
We can make a bet.

174
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,599
If you fail,

175
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:54,919
I will kiss you.

176
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,000
What if I make it?

177
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,000
You kiss me.

178
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,159
You crook.

179
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,840
This one.

180
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,880
Congrats. Miss.

181
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:08,280
The first prize.
Purchase for free for one day.

182
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
For free?

183
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,440
You can buy anything in the mall today.

184
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,400
All are free.

185
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,799
All?

186
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,919
Let's go. It's rare to get such a prize.

187
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:20,599
Isn't it?

188
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:22,400
There are many goods we can buy.

189
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,880
But why do I feel

190
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,239
the two costumed performers sound

191
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,599
familiar?

192
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,239
Who? Do you know them?

193
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,359
I don't know anyway.

194
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,159
We're almost caught. Scared me off.

195
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:37,239
In order to please Jingjing,

196
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,799
Mr. Gu is so hard working.

197
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,400
Let's go change clothes.

198
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,440
There may be a next part.

199
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,359
Go.

200
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,159
Why do I think I lack something?

201
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,159
We've purchased many.

202
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,599
I don't know what it is.

203
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:54,599
But I still feel I lack something.

204
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,440
Oh, my god. Am I daydreaming?

205
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,799
Look.

206
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,520
Do you want to buy anything else?

207
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,679
No. It's enough.

208
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,679
I am afraid if I keep going on,

209
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,239
I will even run out of
the fortune quota in the next life.

210
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,880
Then, where do we go next?

211
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,200
Such fine weather.

212
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,080
What about walking around

213
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,479
after we load things onto the car?

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,159
What? Don't you want to
go back and lie on the bed?

215
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,599
I have recovered, okay?

216
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,159
I recover fast.

217
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,280
Also, I've come to realize one thing.

218
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,799
What is it?

219
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,840
We won't be unfortunate all the time.

220
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,320
As a person
who is insulated from winning prizes,

221
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,280
I won two prizes successively.

222
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,520
What does it mean?

223
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,559
It means we won't always have bad luck.

224
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,440
It doesn't matter if I failed one test.

225
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:47,440
I should practice more.
I will make it next time.

226
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,799
Not bad. Highly aware.
I am bullish on you.

227
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,960
Let's go.

228
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,200
Go. Let's see who the faster is
when it comes to pulling the cart.

229
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,799
No.

230
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,200
You can't rival me.

231
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,719
Let me taste yours.

232
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,400
No.

233
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,239
Please.

234
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:08,960
My strawberry and
cheese flavored one is better.

235
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
It's full of your lipstick.

236
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:11,280
You don't like it?

237
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,479
We bought the drinks with my prize.

238
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,239
Capsule toys.

239
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:15,719
Do you want one?

240
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,039
Let's buy one.

241
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,359
Here. Please scan the code.

242
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,280
Okay.

243
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,479
No. You are so lucky today.

244
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,479
So so.

245
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,280
Right?

246
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,159
I only won two prizes.

247
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,840
Can you share some good luck

248
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,719
with me?

249
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,159
How?

250
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,119
It's outside.

251
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,359
They kissed.

252
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,200
Your good luck is strawberry-flavored.

253
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,280
It's a secret figure.

254
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,080
Do you wanna have a try?

255
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,960
Okay.

256
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:12,000
Done! Let's go.

257
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,400
Great.

258
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,039
Babe. You have been toiling for a day.

259
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,919
Are you okay?

260
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,039
I'm okay. Are you exhausted?

261
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,359
I am not. I serve my boss.

262
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,919
Only serve your boss?

263
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,039
It's time for

264
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,159
serving my girlfriend.

265
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,119
Good boy.

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,880
Get on.

267
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,159
Let's go home.

268
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,960
You seem to become fatter.

269
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:47,359
Say it again. Who is fatter?

270
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,599
Just kidding. Are you ready?

271
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,239
Let's go home.

272
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,000
Slower.

273
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,479
It's also a secret figure.

274
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,200
One more.

275
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,719
We can stop here now.

276
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,599
You are going to use
all your luck in one day?

277
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,880
It's a secret figure as well.

278
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,799
You draw one.

279
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,400
Me? Forget it.

280
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,799
Draw one.

281
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:46,119
I knew it. The lipstick package.

282
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,679
The purchase for free for one day.

283
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,599
And the vending machine
which is full of secret figures.

284
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,559
They are all made by Mr. Gu, right?

285
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,400
How come?
It's because of your good luck.

286
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,119
The two costumed performers in the mall

287
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:00,880
are Ai Mi and Xie Te, aren't they?

288
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,919
Don't get mad.

289
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,200
I just want to cheer you up
because you didn't pass the application.

290
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,080
You are not mad?

291
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:18,400
I'm not mad.

292
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,159
Thank you, Gu Rong.

293
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,000
I extremely love all you have done.

294
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,400
I should thank you.

295
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,559
For what?

296
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,919
Thank you

297
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:35,320
for giving me my grand prize.

298
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,599
Gu Rong, I am exalted today

299
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,239
because you are by my side.

300
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,520
Although I failed the selection,

301
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,119
I don't feel regretful

302
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,080
because you stay with me.

303
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,239
Ms. Su Jingjing,

304
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,960
you are totally right.

305
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,080
You deserve it.

306
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,439
Have a good night.

307
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:33,359
(I know why Jingjing failed.)

308
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,560
Mister, here is your wine.

309
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,920
It's so ugly. Change one.

310
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,040
Wait a second.

311
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,839
Here is your wine.

312
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,119
What? It's your level now?

313
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,680
Buzzkill.

314
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,800
Are you doing it on purpose?

315
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,760
I can't criticize you

316
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,359
when you don't do well, right?

317
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,839
Isn't it Mr. Gu?

318
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,479
Here is your wine.

319
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,800
What? You are here for a drink as well?

320
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,359
I am here for you.

321
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,640
Me?

322
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,040
How did you know I'm here?

323
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,119
I can't

324
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,719
find my employees when I want?

325
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,239
That's true.

326
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,040
What's the matter?

327
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,920
It struck me.

328
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,479
You are here
for your girlfriend, aren't you?

329
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,319
It's you who left Jingjing out, right?

330
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,880
Our Design Department

331
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,359
never recruits someone
who has connections.

332
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,640
If Mr. Gu comes for this issue,

333
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,160
please leave now.

334
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:22,239
I heard that you are weird.

335
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:24,599
I see you now. You are really a weirdo.

336
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,040
Perhaps.

337
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,319
But if you wish her

338
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,800
to join the Design Department so badly,

339
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,520
it's okay.

340
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,479
Mr. Gu, you can choose to fire me.

341
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,359
You do assure

342
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,079
she can't engage in your
Design Department with her ability?

343
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,839
I heard that

344
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,439
you didn't even see her work.

345
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,520
She is your girlfriend and bodyguard.

346
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,680
How is she able to know design?

347
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,760
Why not put a bet?

348
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,199
A bet?

349
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,319
On what?

350
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,000
Don't you think Jingjing can't make it?

351
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:05,079
Then, her works must
be below your standard.

352
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,359
I asked for some

353
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,719
drawings of the staff
from the Design Department.

354
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,079
And Jingjing's work.

355
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,199
Can you pick it out?

356
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,319
What do you mean?

357
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,760
If Jingjing's work is the worst,

358
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,560
you must be able to
pick it out in the first place.

359
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,680
But if you can't,

360
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,719
or if you think Jingjing's work

361
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,719
is not the worst,

362
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,199
it means she is more qualified

363
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,599
to join your Design Department.

364
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,680
Sounds interesting.

365
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,880
Bet for what?

366
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,000
If you win,

367
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:42,319
I will cover
all your wines for this year.

368
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,880
Deal.

369
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,640
If I lose,

370
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,319
whatever you want.

371
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,079
Here. Check it out.

372
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:21,680
This is Su Jingjing's work, right?

373
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,920
You won.

374
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,079
Wait.

375
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
The reason why I can identify it

376
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,199
is not that she didn't do well,

377
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,479
but that I remember

378
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,280
the others' drawing styles.

379
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,079
What do you mean?

380
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,640
I have to admit

381
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,079
Su Jingjing draws well.

382
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:41,239
She

383
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,880
is qualified to enroll
in the Design Department.

384
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,640
Don't worry.

385
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,560
I will ask my assistant

386
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,520
to send her an offer tomorrow.

387
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,119
Right, Mr. Gu.

388
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,800
I still

389
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,119
won the bet.

390
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,239
Do remember to pay for my wines.

391
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:56,880
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

392
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:14,928
(Su's Martial Club)

393
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,439
What is it?

394
00:22:38,878 --> 00:22:41,744
(An offer from the Design Department)

395
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,079
I received an invitation
from the Design Department today.

396
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,760
Did you do it?

397
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,160
I did

398
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,400
go find the leader
of the Design Department.

399
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:49,199
But...

400
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:49,880
Gu Rong.

401
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,760
Didn't I say it's my job

402
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,800
and I want to make it by myself

403
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,640
but not with your position?

404
00:22:58,719 --> 00:22:59,479
I won't go.

405
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,160
Wait. Listen to my explanation.

406
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,160
Okay, I will listen to your words.

407
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,839
I did go find Du Yuchuan.

408
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,239
However...

409
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:15,680
I went to him

410
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,119
and showed him your design.

411
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,319
No. I showed him many designs.

412
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,680
But he only likes yours.

413
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,719
What should I do?

414
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,239
I can't help even if I want to.

415
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,920
He saw my drawing?

416
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,599
Yeah.

417
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,040
Then, he sent me the offer

418
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,199
after seeing my work?

419
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,640
You will know

420
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,079
after you go to work and ask him.

421
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,479
I misunderstood you.

422
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,319
Yes.

423
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,239
Since I promised you

424
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,640
that I would let you
apply for the job with your own ability,

425
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,640
I will definitely respect your choice.

426
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,880
But

427
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:56,319
the identity as my girlfriend

428
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,880
does cause you much
trouble and consequences.

429
00:23:59,079 --> 00:23:59,760
But these should be

430
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,560
settled by me, right?

431
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,000
I know

432
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,160
I, your girlfriend,

433
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,079
also bring you

434
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,640
much trouble.

435
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,400
Therefore, I didn't cross the line.

436
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,920
He really saw

437
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,199
my design?

438
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,000
I join the Design Department by myself?

439
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,040
Absolutely.

440
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:35,920
Are you happy now?

441
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:36,880
Yes.

442
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,959
Is this the midnight snack you said?

443
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,599
Yeah.

444
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:01,880
For the noodles of this brand,

445
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,079
the seafood-flavored ones are the best.

446
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:25,000
Hold on. Hold on.

447
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,160
I will hand in the draft in a minute.

448
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,160
Just a moment.

449
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,560
I will do it again. Do it again.

450
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,760
Arrived. I am going to work.

451
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:47,680
It's still early.

452
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,520
What is the rush?

453
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:50,000
You didn't sleep well
last night, did you?

454
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,359
Yes. I was over the moon.

455
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,760
So, I didn't fall asleep.

456
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,520
What about checking in later?

457
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,959
Let Xie Te send you back to sleep.

458
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,959
No way.

459
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,800
It's my first day to work.

460
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,640
You can't make an exception for me.

461
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,280
Alright.

462
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,400
Do you know

463
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,000
except for your first day to work,

464
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,520
what date is today?

465
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,280
What is the date?

466
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,839
Forget it. You seem dazed.

467
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,319
I will tell you at night. Go to work.

468
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:17,560
See you.

469
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,199
That's it?

470
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,479
Bye-bye, Mr. Gu.

471
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,920
Wish me a smooth day.

472
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,359
Okay. Clock out early.

473
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:29,719
Have dinner together.

474
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:30,920
Bye.

475
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:31,880
Bye.

476
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,160
Mr. Gu.

477
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,599
Or let me remind Jingjing?

478
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:41,760
Never mind.

479
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:42,959
It's her first day to work.

480
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:43,880
Leave her to work.

481
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:44,920
Okay.

482
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,199
Be careful.

483
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,079
Sorry, miss.

484
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,160
Why didn't you watch the road
when you rode the bike?

485
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,280
I rode in a direct line.

486
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,959
I didn't know you turned back suddenly.

487
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,359
It doesn't matter if you
didn't watch when you rode the bike.

488
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,040
But what is your attitude
after you splashed coffee on me?

489
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:17,520
I'm sorry.

490
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:19,920
Don't move.

491
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,680
So beautiful.

492
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:36,760
So beautiful.

493
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,199
What an extraordinary work.

494
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,839
I just splashed it casually.

495
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,119
Excuse me, miss.

496
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:45,880
Don't get me wrong.

497
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,520
Listen.

498
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,160
After your coat

499
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,760
was splashed by me, the master,

500
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,400
it is now priceless.

501
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,280
You shall cherish it.

502
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,359
What are you doing?

503
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,160
And your jacket

504
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,520
is priceless now as well.

505
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,959
Do treasure it.

506
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,119
You...

507
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:28,959
Jingjing.

508
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,599
Sorry, I am late.

509
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,920
What's wrong with your coat?

510
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:34,760
Don't mention it.

511
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,280
I met an insane person at the gate

512
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,439
and he splashed coffee on me.

513
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,800
What about changing it?

514
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
I would like that too.

515
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,199
I will do something later.

516
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,000
Let me have a look.

517
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,160
Director. Director Du.

518
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,319
This is Su Jingjing, the newcomer.

519
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,439
You are Su Jingjing.

520
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,479
Director Du.

521
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:06,880
Jingjing.

522
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,599
Mr. Gu.

523
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,000
What's wrong with your coat?

524
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,119
I...

525
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,319
What a coincidence. Mr. Gu.

526
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,359
You send a cup of coffee

527
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,119
as soon as our incident ended.

528
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:18,719
Incident?

529
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,239
Jingjing's coat is dirty
because of you, right?

530
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,199
Just an accident.

531
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,119
Mr. Gu won't be unhappy about it,

532
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:25,959
right?

533
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,560
Director Du.

534
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,760
I hope the anniversary plan

535
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,800
will be as surprising

536
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:31,839
as what you did.

537
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,839
You bet.

538
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:45,959
Work now.

539
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:46,959
Okay.

540
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,920
Where are we going?

541
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,359
You are going to

542
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,520
start your first day in this?

543
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,920
Do you have my spares?

544
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:06,040
So match.

545
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:06,959
Tall and handsome.

546
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,160
Where is the coat?

547
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:15,560
Wait a moment.

548
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,599
It's dirty.

549
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:29,880
Turn around.

550
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,079
Here.

551
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,760
Hold on. Your hair.

552
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,800
Okay.

553
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,959
Attractive.

554
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,920
Still attractive even if it's oversized?

555
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,319
I love to see you in my clothes.

556
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,400
Off to work.

557
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,439
That's it?

558
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,479
What else?

559
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,959
Haven't we...

560
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,000
Go.

561
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,680
Stop it.

562
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,319
I will wait for you
from work tonight. Don't forget it.

563
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,040
Xie Te, have you prepared all?

564
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:50,880
Don't worry, Mr. Gu.

565
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,880
I have sent them.

566
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,439
Wait for you to show your skill.

567
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,680
Okay.

568
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,640
I have done my work.

569
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,239
I can go meet my girlfriend

570
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,719
fair and square.

571
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,079
Put it down. Let me help you.

572
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,599
What are you doing here?

573
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,000
I am here to help you.

574
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,319
I can't let you get injured again.

575
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,560
I will do it with you.

576
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,520
No. You...

577
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,439
Just sit here.

578
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,479
As long as I am here,

579
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,079
you won't have to get your hands dirty.

580
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,479
I will handle them for you.

581
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:25,839
I will go move them.

582
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,319
Okay.

583
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:31,171
(Ai Mi's Toy Shop)

584
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,880
Everyone. Stop your work.

585
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:51,719
A few things to go.

586
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,199
Leave Wansheng's later projects to Lisa.

587
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,280
Zhang, help her.

588
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,079
Okay.

589
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:58,839
Director.

590
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,719
Can I join that project?

591
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,400
It is in the mid-late period.

592
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,680
It's improper for you to intervene now.

593
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:07,800
These are some design projects

594
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,040
of the Gu Group.

595
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,080
David, have a look.

596
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,719
Draft a schedule as soon as possible.

597
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,159
Take the lead for these projects.

598
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,320
They will work with you.

599
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:14,840
Copy that.

600
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:16,439
Director.

601
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,360
Can I join the new projects?

602
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I will help them actively.

603
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,360
These are
the major projects of Gu Group.

604
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,639
You have little experience. Forget it.

605
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,159
And as for what you are doing now,

606
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,280
you can't take your foot off the gas.
You shall start well and end well.

607
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,040
Thank you all during this time.

608
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,000
Keep working.

609
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

610
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,040
Director.

611
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,760
I can't be a dawdler.

612
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,959
Although I am new here,

613
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,120
I heard that despite
the Design Department

614
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,639
being subordinated to the firm,

615
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:45,959
in the design field,

616
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,600
it doesn't lose to any design companies.

617
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,879
So, I have been looking forward

618
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,520
to doing my favorite thing with you

619
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,080
and the outstanding colleagues.

620
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Please give me a chance.

621
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:56,560
You have seen

622
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
every part has someone assigned to it.

623
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,600
Then, I will do some auxiliary work.

624
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,840
I can collate information, right?

625
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,600
Alright. If you are willing to.

626
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,600
As you wish.

627
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:25,280
For those goods,

628
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,479
tell me how to put them
after you decide.

629
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,320
I will help you arrange them.

630
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:30,959
Great.

631
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,919
Who's that?

632
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,000
A-A-Are you alright?

633
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,360
I am bleeding. Help me.

634
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,280
Bleeding?

635
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,280
Y-Y-You should wipe them out.

636
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,840
Tissues.

637
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,520
Here are tissues.

638
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,000
Tissues.

639
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,199
Here.

640
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,639
Wipe out.

641
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,760
I can't see blood.

642
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:38,560
Okay.

643
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,120
Who is it on earth? Hit me and...

644
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,239
Director.

645
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,040
Su Jingjing, you again?

646
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,639
Director, I am sorry.

647
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,399
I-I got hematophobia.

648
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:02,280
How about I send you to a hospital?

649
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:04,639
Get disinfected
in case of an infection, alright?

650
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,639
I'll go.

651
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:07,560
Let's go.

652
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,040
Su Jingjing.

653
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,800
Where do I go
if you don't open the door?

654
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:19,679
It's locked.

655
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,280
What are you saying?

656
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,399
I-I-It's locked.

657
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,399
Get away.

658
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,399
My phone is on the desk.

659
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,679
Where's your phone?

660
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,679
Call someone to let us out.
