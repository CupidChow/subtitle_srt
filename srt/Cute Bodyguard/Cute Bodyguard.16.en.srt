(Your alleged boyfriend can only be me.)

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,000
What are you doing?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Didn't you say

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,879
that the plant blocks your view?

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,639
Let me cut the branches

32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,440
to make room for the view.

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,720
I asked you to move the plant out.

34
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:04,519
Don't you understand?

35
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,559
Miss Bai.

36
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,600
I am the bodyguard of Mr. Gu.

37
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,479
I am only responsible for Mr. Gu,

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,240
not you.

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,240
Be careful. Don't hurt yourself.

40
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,960
Xie Te couldn't find you anywhere.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,600
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:30,839
I...

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,839
I asked Miss Su to get me a file.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,279
You're done?

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,199
Let's go.

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,639
Did she give you a hard time?

47
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:17,520
No. It's nothing.

48
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,720
Don't be bothered.

49
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:19,600
Jingjing.

50
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,080
Let's announce our relationship.

51
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:25,160
No, we agreed to keep it a secret.

52
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,360
If we announce it,

53
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,839
it will affect your work for sure.

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't care.

55
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,160
I do.

56
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,199
Think about it.

57
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,880
Once we announce our relationship,

58
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,960
someone will

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,800
find faults with us.

60
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,119
In that case,

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,919
it will hinder your career

62
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,160
in the long run.

63
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,399
I just want to tell everyone

64
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,279
that you're my girlfriend

65
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,880
so that nobody dares to bully you.

66
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,440
I am Su Jingjing.

67
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,880
Who dares to bully me?

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,559
Come on, stop being worried.

69
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,160
Go back to work.

70
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,320
Fine. I'll let you off today.

71
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:07,919
But you have to make it up to me.

72
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,600
How?

73
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,440
M-Mr. Gu.

74
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,079
W-What are you...?

75
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,640
Cockroaches!

76
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,399
Cockroaches?

77
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,799
Mr. Gu, don't you hate cockroaches?

78
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,440
Go.

79
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:35,200
Go.

80
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,920
I-I killed it.

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,320
I stepped on it.

82
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,040
Let me clean it up for you.

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,640
No.

84
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,880
I stepped on it.

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,640
It must be crushed.

86
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,760
Go get some tools.

87
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,839
Let me handle this.

88
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,119
Just go.

89
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,760
(How's your first day at work?)

90
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,119
(Nothing required you)

91
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,160
(to use martial arts
or pepper spray, huh?)

92
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,519
(Absolutely boring.)

93
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:35,679
(If I had a pillow,
I could have fallen asleep.)

94
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,239
(I shouldn't have bought those.)

95
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,679
(I told you.
Are your colleagues easy-going?)

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,200
(Bah.)

97
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,200
(I'm an "orphan"
at the president's office.)

98
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,799
(Nobody likes me. Nobody cares.)

99
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,839
(What about my Xie Te?)

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,799
(I'll punch him
if he dares to bully you.)

101
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,040
(Dates before mates?)

102
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,920
(You're just texting
to ask about Xie Te!)

103
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:10,760
(Yeah, that's right.)

104
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,559
(It's your first day.
Your colleagues don't know you.)

105
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,119
(There's nothing to talk about.)

106
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,519
(It's afternoon tea time.)

107
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,119
(Get them some snacks.)

108
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:22,200
(Nobody hates free snacks.)

109
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,320
Miss Su bought some afternoon tea.

110
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,239
Come and get some.

111
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,119
Awesome.

112
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:37,480
Yeah.

113
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,079
Come.

114
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,320
Great.

115
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,040
Be careful.

116
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:40,839
Thank you, Jingjing.

117
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
This is so obvious.

118
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,519
Jingjing, you don't have to do this.

119
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,760
It's my first day here.

120
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,200
I don't know what you like,

121
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:47,519
so I picked something by myself.

122
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,799
Get whatever you like.

123
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,920
Let me see.

124
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:50,880
What do we have?

125
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,760
Cakes from the Grace Bakery?
Thanks, Jingjing.

126
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,399
I hope you like them.

127
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,359
Let me try it.

128
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,079
Jingjing.

129
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,160
Special flavor.

130
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,399
Open it and take a look.

131
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,160
Let me hold it for you.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,760
Okay.

133
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,519
(I'll reimburse your afternoon tea.)

134
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,600
(Also, I allow you)

135
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,000
(to fool around with fish at work.)

136
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,399
Right.

137
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,399
This... Special flavor.

138
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,200
You got it?

139
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Yeah, I got it.

140
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,959
See you.

141
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,920
Mr. Gu.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,799
The acquisition meeting
with Shenghua is at 4:00 PM.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,040
Resource integration meeting

144
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:50,480
with Miss Bai
and Vice President is at 5:00 PM.

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,200
After 6:00 PM...

146
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,799
Xie Te.

147
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,359
Jingjing bought this
only for me, right?

148
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,160
Su Jingjing is so sweet to you.

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,440
I know.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,640
So about the meetings...

151
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,279
It's alright. I trust you with that.

152
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,399
Okay, tell me when you need me, Mr. Gu.

153
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,079
We have

154
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,159
a newcomer called Su Jingjing.

155
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,559
She looks

156
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,359
quite ordinary.

157
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,479
But it turns out
that she's quite someone.

158
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,320
Sure enough.

159
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,119
No gossip can escape

160
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,559
your attention, Jin.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,919
Who is she?

162
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:45,440
According to
my observation and analysis,

163
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,960
Su Jingjing's boyfriend

164
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,799
is Mr. Gu...

165
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,960
Mr. Gu's assistant, Xie Te.

166
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,239
No way.

167
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,840
Think about it.

168
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,880
Assistant Xie prepared

169
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,599
a whole set of new stationery for her.

170
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,679
Su Jingjing ordered afternoon tea,

171
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,239
and he brought it in person.

172
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,119
And he gave her two cups of coffee.

173
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,559
Yeah, that's right.

174
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,280
Right?

175
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,159
I'm telling you.

176
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,359
There must be something going on

177
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,599
between them.

178
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,559
Assistant Xie

179
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,000
has such a promising future.

180
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:18,599
How did Su Jingjing get him?

181
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,200
Who knows?

182
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,760
Enough. Let's go.

183
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,559
Okay.

184
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,559
Chief, take a look.

185
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,320
Is it fine?

186
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,200
Yeah.

187
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,840
Mr. Gu.

188
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,440
- Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

189
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,280
- Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

190
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,159
Where is Su Jingjing?

191
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,440
She went out with Assistant Xie.

192
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,719
What?

193
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,039
Me and you?

194
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,000
No, no way.

195
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,880
If Mr. Gu finds out,

196
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:02,200
he will kill me.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,400
Why not?

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,719
Then no one will suspect

199
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
me and Gu Rong.

200
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,119
I still find it inappropriate.

201
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,760
What's inappropriate about that?

202
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,799
I'll tell Gu Rong.

203
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,880
What do you want to tell me?

204
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,559
Talk inside.

205
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,000
No.

206
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,960
I won't allow gossips

207
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,479
about my woman and another man.

208
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,559
That's right.

209
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:35,719
Also, I'm taken.

210
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,200
Ai Mi will be jealous.

211
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,640
But this is the best way

212
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,880
to hide our relationship.

213
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,039
And they're already gossiping about it.

214
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,719
Let me handle it.

215
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,400
You?

216
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,479
Don't worry. Let me handle it.

217
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,239
Mr. Gu, what's your plan?

218
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,840
The best way to stop a rumor

219
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,799
is to make a new one.

220
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Brilliant!

221
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,039
Take some days off.

222
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,919
Aren't you to blame too?

223
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:22,880
But... But this is...

224
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,799
It's too hard for me.

225
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,400
Paid leave. Go.

226
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,520
Disappear, now.

227
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,200
Thank you, Mr. Gu. See you.

228
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:33,960
Bye-bye.

229
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,080
Surprise!

230
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,039
Ouch.

231
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,679
Did you hurt your foot?

232
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,159
Come on, the doctor said

233
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,479
that I'd be fine in two weeks.

234
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,320
Don't worry. I'm fine.

235
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,960
You are not.

236
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,640
Toe bone fracture is a big deal.

237
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,479
It's my fault.

238
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,000
My hands got slippery, okay?

239
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,440
Stop blaming yourself.

240
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,440
No, I am to blame.

241
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,719
Stay at home and rest for two weeks.

242
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,960
I happen to have days off.

243
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,479
I'll take care of you

244
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,960
and the store.

245
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,239
You'd better keep your words.

246
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,239
Of course, let's go.

247
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,479
Let me make soup for you.

248
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:38,719
Let's go home.

249
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,559
- Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

250
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:51,880
- Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,039
- Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

252
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,919
Go back to work. Don't mind me.

253
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,520
Okay.

254
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,479
What are you...?

255
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,679
I don't know how to keep fish.

256
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,159
Take care of it for me.

257
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,559
You...

258
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,599
Mr. Gu.

259
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,559
You have

260
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,919
the same fish as Su Jingjing.

261
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,760
That's right.

262
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,880
Su Jingjing.

263
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,280
I didn't expect...

264
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,679
W-What?

265
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,080
Secretary Jin, slowly and clearly.

266
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,599
No rush.

267
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,559
I didn't expect that you'd be an expert.

268
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,239
What does she mean by "expert"?

269
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,679
Yeah, I'm an expert on this.

270
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,400
My dad taught me
how to raise fish when I was a kid.

271
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,039
No wonder your fish looks so energized.

272
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,200
No wonder Mr. Gu

273
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,599
asks you for help.

274
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,840
Yeah, Mr. Gu is so busy.

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So he wants me to help.

276
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:03,679
I have a tank of fish at home.

277
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,359
But they don't look lively.

278
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,400
Teach me a few tricks.

279
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,440
Okay, I feed them this.

280
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,359
Look.

281
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,719
This?

282
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,919
Take it. It's a gift.

283
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay, thank you.

284
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,159
Mr. Gu.

285
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,799
Mr. Gu.

286
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,960
Mr. Gu.

287
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,760
Let's go have food.

288
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,679
You...

289
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,039
Jingjing.

290
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,919
Mr. Gu is asking you

291
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,159
to drive for him.

292
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,320
Su Jingjing,

293
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,960
as Mr. Gu's bodyguard,

294
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,719
you should do your job

295
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,960
and fulfill your duties.

296
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,080
That's right.

297
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,479
Mr. Gu, I'll get you there
safe and sound.

298
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,359
Jin, I heard

299
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:39,760
that you're quite gossipy.

300
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,640
T-That's not true.

301
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,760
Make it true.

302
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,039
I can't.

303
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,039
Are you trying to get fired?

304
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,440
No.

305
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,919
Take a seat.

306
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,200
Jingjing.

307
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,320
Don't touch me.

308
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,679
Do you realize that you almost

309
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,280
exposed our relationship?

310
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,239
Yeah, I do.

311
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,479
And you still did that?

312
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:12,840
I just want to show them

313
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,760
that you work for me

314
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,159
so that no one dares to gossip.

315
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,080
But didn't we agree to keep it a secret?

316
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,239
Only by distracting them

317
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,320
can we stop that rumor
between Xie Te and you.

318
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,599
No way!

319
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,559
It will only lead to more gossip.

320
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,520
What will the others think about me?

321
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:31,719
Don't tell me

322
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,000
it's your way of ending the rumors.

323
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:33,919
That's right.

324
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,159
Even if there are rumors,

325
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,400
your alleged boyfriend can only be me.

326
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:41,640
You didn't consider

327
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,880
my feelings at all.

328
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,336
(Gu Rong)

329
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
Jingjing, come here for a second.

330
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,520
Mr. Gu, what can I do for you?

331
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,560
Jingjing, I'm sorry.

332
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,280
I mean it.

333
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,959
I'll do as you say from now on, okay?

334
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,640
You're so decisive.

335
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:56,640
I dare not make you listen to me.

336
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:00,680
I'm really sorry.

337
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,880
This is an apology gift.

338
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,160
Haven't you been longing

339
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,719
for the secret figure?

340
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,040
I didn't get it myself.

341
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,920
What am I supposed to do with it?

342
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:18,319
I am leaving.

343
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:21,280
The others may suspect us
if I stay here for too long.

344
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,330
(Jingjing)

345
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:48,680
(Sorry! The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.)

346
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,359
You guys,

347
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,400
let's dine out today. What do you say?

348
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:05,439
Great.

349
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,319
Oh, great.

350
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,199
Great, Chief He.

351
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,680
Count me in.

352
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,160
Okay.

353
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,640
Chief, I'm afraid I won't make it.

354
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,199
I know. You have to drive Mr. Gu home.

355
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,239
Rain check.

356
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,719
- Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

357
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,079
Mr. Gu, may I take a few hours off?

358
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,959
Mr. Gu.

359
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:28,680
Would you like to

360
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,400
join us for dinner?

361
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:30,680
I...

362
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,000
Mr. Gu is busy.

363
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,640
But he's very kind and allows me to go.

364
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,719
I'll wait for you by the elevator.

365
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,599
Let's go then.

366
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:42,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

367
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:43,719
See you, sir.

368
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,439
Let's go.

369
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,599
Come on.

370
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,400
Cheers.

371
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,119
Thank you, Chief.

372
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,760
Thank you, Chief.

373
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,199
Thank you, Chief.

374
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,520
Okay, dig in.

375
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,160
Okay.

376
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,640
You're grilling for us!

377
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,280
You know, if Assistant Xie is here,

378
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,359
you can't even have a bite

379
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,680
of the steaks I grill.

380
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,319
Really?

381
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,239
He's a foodie?

382
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,359
We're just the same.

383
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,439
Well, I'd like to tell you something.

384
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,599
Assistant Xie and I...

385
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,760
Don't worry. We get it.

386
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,199
No, I'm trying to say that...

387
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,079
Focus on the food.

388
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,400
Let's not talk about this.

389
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:32,319
Dig in.

390
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,800
Dig in.

391
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,319
Dig in.

392
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,680
Here, Chief.

393
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,400
The bubble tea next door is great.

394
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,760
I'll go get you some.

395
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,640
No sugar for me.

396
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,520
Half sugar.

397
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,199
Okay.

398
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:48,920
Okay.

399
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,040
Go on.

400
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,160
Alright.

401
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,000
What are you doing here?

402
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,880
Well, you forgot your phone.

403
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,800
What?

404
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,199
I need to talk to you.

405
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,640
I'm listening.

406
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,119
Jingjing.

407
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,760
I know things have been

408
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,959
confusing for you, and I'm sorry.

409
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,680
If you don't want to make it public,

410
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
I'll respect your decision.

411
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,359
Really?

412
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,880
Thank you.

413
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,400
Now that you're happy,

414
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,479
you should reward me with something.

415
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,280
Are you brushing me off?

416
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,640
I have to use the bathroom.

417
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:46,520
Okay.

418
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:47,319
Go.

419
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:48,479
We're in public.

420
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,520
What else do you want?

421
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,040
I'm sorry.

422
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,239
I-I didn't see anything.

423
00:21:58,479 --> 00:21:59,239
I swear.

424
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,359
Su Jingjing is my girlfriend.

425
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,199
Remember it

426
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,560
when you spread rumors next time.

427
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:16,680
Okay.

428
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,280
Mr. Gu, would you like to join us?

429
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,479
What now?

430
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,599
Why did they find out?

431
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,680
How am I going to work there?

432
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,239
They found out. So what?

433
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,199
Su Jingjing,

434
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:50,199
it's a healthy and equal relationship.

435
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,760
There's nothing shady.

436
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,880
Why are you worried?

437
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,079
But...

438
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,199
But what?

439
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,599
From now on,

440
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:00,959
raise the fish

441
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,520
and plant flowers in the company

442
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,439
so that I can see you all the time.

443
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,439
When I'm tired,

444
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,520
I'll get to hug and kiss you.

445
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,160
No, I have to focus on work.

446
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,800
I am your "work".

447
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,640
What are you doing?

448
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Kissing my girlfriend.

449
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,079
Dad, what are you doing here?

450
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,439
She kissed him.

451
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,079
Let's wait for the wedding.

452
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,400
Yeah, in no time.

453
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,800
I knew they'd be a couple.

454
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,319
What a match.

455
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:33,920
Wonderful.

456
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,479
Wonderful.

457
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,439
Don't tell the parents.

458
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,400
Don't worry. We won't.

459
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,880
So sweet. So jealous.

460
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,959
Be careful.

461
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,280
I can do it.

462
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,239
Be careful.

463
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, my God.

464
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,319
Rest your foot.

465
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,119
Is it hurting?

466
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,040
Let me get you a blanket.

467
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:15,839
Wanna eat something?

468
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:20,319
No.

469
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,959
The red one.

470
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,160
The red one.

471
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,760
This?

472
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,520
Let me.

473
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:38,880
Yummy.

474
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,319
One more.

475
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,040
Water.

476
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,760
Okay.

477
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,599
Slow down.

478
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,719
Yummy.

479
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,920
You're taking great care of me.

480
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,479
I'm not used to it.

481
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,479
You are injured.

482
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,800
Stop thinking so much.

483
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,079
From now on,

484
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,400
whatever it is,

485
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,680
let me handle everything.

486
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,400
Let's watch something.

487
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,000
Okay.

488
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,800
Mr. Gu.

489
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:45,880
You go first.

490
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,560
Aren't you coming in?

491
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,040
No.

492
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,560
We'll wait for the next one.

493
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:54,719
You go first.

494
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,040
Miss Bai.

495
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Hold it, Miss Bai.

496
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,520
What's wrong?

497
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,680
Why are you standing here?

498
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,359
It's coming. We'll take this one.

499
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,560
Yeah, we'll take that one.

500
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,239
It seems that the onboarding

501
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,959
hasn't been implemented well.

502
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,760
We must specify

503
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,000
how an ordinary employee

504
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,959
should behave

505
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,959
in public.

506
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,119
Profiting is our biggest pursuit.

507
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,640
Nothing matters

508
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,719
as long as we're profiting.

509
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,560
Does that include

510
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,439
hiring your girlfriend
as your personal bodyguard?

511
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,719
I don't see any problem here.

512
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,599
Gu Rong, be aware of the bottom line.

513
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,719
Don't push it.

514
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,439
Let's go get a coffee.

515
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,280
- Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

516
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:01,040
Mr. Gu.

517
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:04,520
Let's go.

518
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,040
Let's go.

519
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:05,560
Let's go.

520
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:06,359
Look.

521
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
They're holding hands.

522
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,959
They match quite well.

523
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,280
I just remembered the daily meeting.

524
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:14,680
I should check the machines.

525
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,599
I'm going now. Bye.

526
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,079
Su Jingjing.

527
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Come in, please.

528
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,800
Mr. Li.

529
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,800
Sit.

530
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,199
Have a seat.

531
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,959
Why is Mr. Gu taking her everywhere?

532
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,520
Keep it down.

533
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,680
The sales of this month

534
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,839
were up 3% year-on-year,

535
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,119
which is 1% higher than the estimation.

536
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,199
But there are personnel changes
within the departments.

537
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,839
I hope we could work well

538
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,400
together, and...

539
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,319
Mr. Gu.

540
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,199
Would you like to comment

541
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,199
on my report?

542
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,359
Not bad.

543
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,880
Generally well done.

544
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,760
If you can

545
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,839
focus more on data analysis

546
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,000
rather than me,

547
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,719
you can do even better.

548
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,920
Mr. Gu, what does that mean?

549
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:25,239
For example,
you can make a longitudinal analysis.

550
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,599
With such a high turnover rate,

551
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,719
the sales keep rising.

552
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,640
Does that imply
any issues with work efficiency?

553
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,239
It makes sense.

554
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,959
This is my first month

555
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,880
as CEO.

556
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,160
I know you have opinions
about my relationship

557
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,359
with Su Jingjing

558
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,719
and have doubts about her job.

559
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,400
But...

560
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,359
Su Jingjing.

561
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,439
Yes.

562
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,000
What's my schedule on Thursday?

563
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,319
Meeting with President Wan
of Jinyuan Group

564
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,319
at the restaurant at 9:30 AM.

565
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:04,319
Head to the Art Museum at 2:00 PM

566
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,520
for the collaboration.

567
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,319
At around 4:00 PM,

568
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:09,719
head to the annual business seminar.

569
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,239
The gifts for all the members

570
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,680
will arrive at the same time.

571
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,599
Next Wednesday?

572
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:17,199
From 7:00 to 7:30 AM,

573
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,520
I'll accompany you

574
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,680
to the morning practice.

575
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,560
The standardized guarding
starts at 9:00.

576
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,640
At 11:30,

577
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,079
head to the skyline garden restaurant

578
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,479
for the luncheon, and then...

579
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,479
So what?

580
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,119
It's just the most ordinary

581
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,160
line of work.

582
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:31,560
The company needs

583
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
someone to make a profit.

584
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,239
But I hired her

585
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,479
just for these trivial works.

586
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,280
The Gu Group is also

587
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,760
built upon all these

588
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,400
mundane and trivial things.

589
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,800
Thanks to Su Jingjing,

590
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,599
my haphephobia is cured.

591
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,239
Or I won't be here at this meeting.

592
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,839
As for making profits,

593
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:53,040
that's what I do best.

594
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,800
I promise

595
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,520
that I will lead

596
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,319
the Gu Group to make

597
00:29:58,479 --> 00:29:59,920
greater achievements.

598
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,880
You can supervise me.

599
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:06,839
Any more questions?

600
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,400
Ask now or never.

601
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:16,719
The last fan meeting

602
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,760
went well.

603
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,160
The fans are asking

604
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,920
if we can arrange another one.

605
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,520
Okay, let's do it.

606
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,400
I'll make it at 7:00 PM.

607
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,760
Is that fine for you?

608
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,640
Yeah.

609
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,719
It's easier for us too.

610
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,800
And Mr. Huang is asking

611
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,839
if you can change your book title. He...

612
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,040
Miss Bai.

613
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,719
Mr. Han.

614
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,040
Mr. Huang

615
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,959
is asking if you can
change the book title.

616
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,560
They've been waiting upstairs.

617
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,760
Shall we go there first?

618
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,239
Okay.

619
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,640
Let's go, okay?

620
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,079
Go to Chairman Gu's house.

621
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,760
Yes, Miss Bai.

622
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,800
You lost again.

623
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,160
You love risky moves

624
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,199
and tend to miss the big picture.

625
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,439
Chairman, you won again.

626
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,520
Anrou.

627
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:30,560
Chairman.

628
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,599
You're still so good at Go.

629
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:35,040
Sit down. Let's play.

630
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:44,400
Many things happened

631
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,000
at the company when you were away.

632
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,319
I'm listening.

633
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,400
Gu Rong just took over.

634
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,560
It's still a transition period.

635
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,199
There are many unstable factors.

636
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,319
And the announcement
of his personal relationship

637
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
caused much discussion.

638
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,880
So what's on your mind?

639
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,280
I'm just worried
that it might damage the company.

640
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,280
After all,

641
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,920
things have changed
ever since Gu Rong returned.

642
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:14,359
Changes are good. We need innovation.

643
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm afraid if it goes on like this,

644
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,880
the company will be out of control.

645
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,719
So I'm a bit lost.

646
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
I'd like to ask you for your opinion.

647
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,000
Check out your white pieces.

648
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,959
If you don't fight back,
things will get out of hand.

649
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,520
The path taken by the company

650
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,640
determines the future of its people.

651
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:44,359
Gu Rong is the CEO of the Gu Group.

652
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,040
He has the right

653
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,319
to decide where the company is heading.

654
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,920
As long as it doesn't do harm,

655
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:53,079
I won't interfere.

656
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,920
Being an employee

657
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,520
is like being a piece on the board.

658
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,199
Anrou,

659
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,040
you must know your place.

660
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:13,000
With all due respect, Chairman.

661
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,479
As you said,

662
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,119
we should all know our places.

663
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:17,800
But I've been wondering

664
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,560
if you have placed me

665
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,040
where I belong.

666
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,760
I think you know

667
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,359
why I stopped your project.

668
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,640
I-I didn't mean that.

669
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,079
I crossed the line

670
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:32,239
with Su's Martial Club.

671
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:35,479
Whoever you are,
and however capable you are,

672
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,319
you can't cross the line.

673
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,000
I entrusted the project to you.

674
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,800
You can't take risks

675
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,079
and miss the big picture.

676
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,040
Of course, we all know
that you're highly capable.

677
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,520
As long as you do well,

678
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,479
Gu Rong and I will treat you well.

679
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,119
On the other hand,

680
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,599
some things just won't happen
no matter how hard you try.

681
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,639
Rest assured, Chairman.

682
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,199
I won't let you down.

683
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,719
I have some work to do.

684
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:17,040
Sorry, I can't keep you company.

685
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,879
Okay, take care.

686
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,080
Tell Mr. Zhao from Wansheng

687
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,320
that I'm not going there.

688
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,639
Let Gu Rong go.

689
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,199
Okay.

690
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,360
(My little girl.)

691
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,639
(I heard
that you got popular in the company.)

692
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,360
(Looking forward to your performance.)

693
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
Let me help you.

694
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:04,479
No need. No need.

695
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,000
Take care of the project.

696
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,560
Chief, give me some work, please.

697
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,840
I'm bored of doing nothing.

698
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:37,159
Jingjing, Mr. Gu gave me the order.

699
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,679
I'll be in trouble if I give you work.

700
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,879
I can be more than a bodyguard.

701
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
I can do office work.

702
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,040
Office work?

703
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:49,360
Keeping the fish and having tea
are both office work.

704
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,879
If you don't assign me work

705
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,760
today,

706
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:56,800
I'm not leaving.

707
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,560
I'll bring you tea

708
00:35:58,719 --> 00:35:59,879
and follow you everywhere.

709
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:00,840
You...

710
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,120
How about this?

711
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,439
Send this file

712
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,199
to the Design Department, okay?

713
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,560
Okay. No problem.

714
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,608
(Design Department Recruiting)

715
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,639
Who are you looking for?

716
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,120
Chief He told me

717
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,399
to bring this here.

718
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,280
Okay, I'll take it from here. Thank you.

719
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,439
Are you Mr. Gu's girlfriend?

720
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,520
Miss Bai, how can I help you?

721
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,760
Bring me the files

722
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,479
on our project with Wansheng Technology.

723
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,080
Let me talk to my colleague in charge.

724
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,239
I know what you're thinking.

725
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,280
I may not be leading

726
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,479
this project now,

727
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:18,120
but I'm still on it.

728
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:20,159
What?

729
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,399
Should I call your director

730
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:23,719
and ask for the files in person?

731
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:25,760
You got me wrong, Miss Bai.

732
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,639
I'll call my colleague now

733
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,600
and ask him to bring it here.

734
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,199
Miss Su.

735
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,399
