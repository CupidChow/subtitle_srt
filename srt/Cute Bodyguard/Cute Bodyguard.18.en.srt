(My position)

28
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,080
Bye.

29
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,360
Good morning,

30
00:01:59,279 --> 00:01:59,919
Miss.

31
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:04,919
Morning.

32
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,160
Get set.

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,160
Come on in.

34
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,520
One, two.

35
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:17,839
This way, please.

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,880
Three.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,320
Four.

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,520
Amazing. You have so many students.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,440
You are a real master of martial arts.

40
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,240
How's it going?

41
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,080
Don't say that.

42
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,479
Here.

43
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:30,880
Back off a little.

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,119
I can't claim to be a master.

45
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,440
But Su's Martial Club

46
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,160
is known far and wide.

47
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,600
It's a beautiful club.

48
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:43,600
I poured

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,279
my heart and soul into the club.

50
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,320
It is modeled on the old-style

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,600
standard.

52
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,520
Look at the old-type tablet.

53
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:57,279
And the small stone lion over here.

54
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,639
This is no ordinary stone lion.

55
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,839
In ancient times,

56
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,520
it was called a hitching post.

57
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,039
Since we don't ride horses now,

58
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,520
I put it in here

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,080
to ward off evil.

60
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,160
I picked

61
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:11,960
and put everything here myself.

62
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:15,600
It's a sense of passing on.

63
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,199
Exactly.

64
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,240
Dad.

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,160
William

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,679
wants to learn some moves.

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,759
Just teach him.

68
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,160
Isn't it inappropriate?

69
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,720
Will it lead to

70
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,800
international tensions if I hurt him?

71
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,440
He came here for you.

72
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,919
Just show him something.

73
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,240
Then I'll embarrass myself.

74
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,080
Kids, come here.

75
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,800
Stand back.

76
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,800
Stand back.

77
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,600
Chinese martial arts are profound.

78
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,279
Basic skills are crucial.

79
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,240
Watch.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,559
It's called a horse stance.

81
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,559
Not bad.

82
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,000
Lunge punching.

83
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,679
It seems I need to show you

84
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,839
some real actions.

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,359
Next,

86
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:25,200
the visual impact would be massive.

87
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,119
In China and the Asia-Pacific region,

88
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,679
no more than two people know the punch.

89
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,959
One is my senior, and the other is me.

90
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,760
It's called Lightning Palm,

91
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,920
which is extremely powerful.
The key is to be fast.

92
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,200
It requires internal energy.

93
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:50,839
Boys, we don't have to learn this.

94
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,040
That's it.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
Right? Did you see the ghosting image?

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,519
I have never seen

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,119
Mr. Gu like this before.

98
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,320
It's his first big project

99
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:40,760
since he was appointed.

100
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,000
Mr. Zhao pulled his money

101
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,760
and spread panic among the team.

102
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,200
Now the president of SC is so tough.

103
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,200
No wonder Mr. Gu

104
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,880
is stressed.

105
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,040
I'll have no idea if I were him.

106
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,359
Jingjing, come.

107
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,119
Jingjing.

108
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,200
Come on.

109
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,839
Jingjing, will you
spend some time with him?

110
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,600
I think he needs you now.

111
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,720
Yeah.

112
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,799
It's fine. I think he can do it.

113
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,440
That's true.

114
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,559
Mr. Gu could

115
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,320
even handle Jingjing.

116
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,119
The SC president will be nothing hard.

117
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,399
How's it going?

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,279
SC sent four people,

119
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:26,359
including the president,

120
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,279
the marketing,

121
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,440
designing, and sales directors.

122
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,119
The route for their tour

123
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,920
is already set

124
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,799
and has been sent

125
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,119
to you, Mr. Gu, and Miss Bai.

126
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,519
Everyone is ready.

127
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,399
Okay.

128
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,679
Good job.

129
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,959
Let's put

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,359
the award-winning works

131
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,760
in a noticeable place.

132
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,880
The design department asked me

133
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,399
to get the samples but I was too busy.

134
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,000
Are they for the meeting?

135
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,320
Just go now.

136
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,000
Quickly.

137
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,320
Wait. I'll go get it.

138
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,399
Okay. Hurry up.

139
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,200
See you in the meeting room.

140
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,959
Okay.

141
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,959
Thank you.

142
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,119
How could you?

143
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,640
By the way, William

144
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,480
is so strange.

145
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,679
He never showed up when we visited him.

146
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,320
Why did he come in person?

147
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,760
No matter how deep the pool is,

148
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,760
the fish will bite.

149
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,279
It's time.

150
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,040
Okay.

151
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,279
Mr. Gu.

152
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:22,760
Mr. Gu.

153
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,600
Let's go.

154
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,440
Okay.

155
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,760
Since the 1990s,

156
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,559
we have been committed
to commercial real estate.

157
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,839
Great mixed-use shopping malls

158
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,959
emerged only in the past decade.

159
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,279
(He's the president of SC.)

160
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,399
But we started it

161
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,399
a long time ago.

162
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,320
William.

163
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,079
In addition to standardization,

164
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,239
we value features and artistic sense.

165
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,920
We have built more than

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,760
ten distinctive theme malls

167
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,359
around the country.

168
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,119
All of these

169
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,640
were from our designers.

170
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,000
It's our first time

171
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,880
cooperating with others in development.

172
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,920
To cooperate with SC,

173
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,440
we are in good faith.

174
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,320
Since Gu Group

175
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,799
is familiar with the China market,

176
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,079
and you have years of experience

177
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,559
in the foreign market,

178
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,000
this project would be

179
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,880
the beginning of long-term cooperation.

180
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,040
William,

181
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,280
if you have questions

182
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,840
or anything unclear,

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,960
just bring it up.

184
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,520
You are quite specific.

185
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,239
Mr. Gu is well-prepared

186
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,359
this time.

187
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,200
Miss, why are you here?

188
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,559
William?

189
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,960
Such a coincidence.

190
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,320
You work in the Gu Group?

191
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,000
Gu Rong is my boss.

192
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:54,239
I'm his bodyguard.

193
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,280
Cool.

194
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,280
What's going on?

195
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:03,599
It seems you know each other.

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,599
William,

197
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,520
do you have any suggestions

198
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,679
on the proposal?

199
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,039
Frankly, I believe that Gu Group

200
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:12,400
is experienced in the China market.

201
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,320
But I'm worried about

202
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,640
how you would attract young customers.

203
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
In the current proposal,

204
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,080
I didn't see

205
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,799
anything novel.

206
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,520
I've visited your malls.

207
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,799
But I don't think

208
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,239
there's a big difference

209
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,039
from all other malls.

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,880
Miss. What's appealing to you

211
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,679
about the malls of Gu Group?

212
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,280
William,

213
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,479
have you ever been to

214
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,119
their newly opened mall?

215
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,520
Not yet.

216
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
Have you noticed the bins and benches

217
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,159
when you visit the malls

218
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,799
in Ninghai?

219
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,880
They were under construction.

220
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:58,239
Here.

221
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,359
Yes.

222
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,520
This is Gu's newly designed theme.

223
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,520
We adopted the style of graffiti.

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,719
We want to combine the trendiest element

225
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,760
with the most common things

226
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,679
in malls

227
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,520
to give people a vibrant

228
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,760
and youthful vibe.

229
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,760
There are about a hundred benches

230
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,760
and bins in every mall

231
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,679
owned by Gu Group.

232
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,200
Each of them is designed

233
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,280
to be different.

234
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,719
Although

235
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,119
it just started to be on the market,

236
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,599
it has already

237
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,440
gone viral

238
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,440
on the Internet.

239
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,080
We want customers

240
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,760
to be surprised as opening blind boxes.

241
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,239
So far,

242
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,200
we've achieved initial success.

243
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:36,000
Although these are small details,

244
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,760
they can prove that Gu Group

245
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,080
is determined and has tried
to build special malls.

246
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,799
Great.

247
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,039
It's the best proposal I've heard today.

248
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,400
I didn't expect you to be good at design

249
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,919
in addition to Chinese martial arts.

250
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:02,679
Gu.

251
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,359
As long as she is here,

252
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,200
I feel assured to work with you.

253
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,960
I look forward to it.

254
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,799
But my girlfriend

255
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,039
will not be involved.

256
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,960
I never thought that Su Jingjing

257
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,400
would close the deal.

258
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:35,320
Me either.

259
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,359
Mr. Gu's girlfriend is really something.

260
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:39,760
Poor Miss Bai.

261
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:40,719
A couple

262
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,440
of a successful woman

263
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,119
and a big boss. Isn't it nice?

264
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,119
Save it.

265
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,919
Mr. Gu has never

266
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,200
liked her.

267
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,919
They've known each other a long time.

268
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,440
They could be together but they didn't.

269
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,119
Yeah.

270
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,799
The couple of the boss and his bodyguard
is much sweeter.

271
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,799
When will you meet the right guy?

272
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,119
None of your business.

273
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:05,919
I'll let my legal department

274
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,159
follow up on the case.

275
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,359
Gu, I have one favor to ask

276
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,520
before we cooperate.

277
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,359
Can I borrow your girlfriend?

278
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,119
Well...

279
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,200
Don't worry. It won't take long.

280
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,799
A shopping mall in the US

281
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,119
wants to host a show
on Chinese martial arts.

282
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,799
I want you to make a short video

283
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:29,039
in Su's Martial Club.

284
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,239
Miss, will you do me a favor?

285
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,359
Do you mean to film a movie?

286
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,719
But I can't act.

287
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,880
Don't worry. I have a professional team.

288
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,440
You only need to show some moves.

289
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,359
Okay.

290
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,479
My dad says

291
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,119
it's our mission to promote

292
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,320
Chinese martial arts.

293
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,320
Thank you, Miss.

294
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,359
See you then.

295
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,239
That's enough.

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,320
I look forward to our cooperation.

297
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
My dad says that.

298
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,880
It's so exciting today.

299
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,159
I never thought

300
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,039
that William is the president of SC.

301
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,960
How's your girlfriend, huh?

302
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,280
She not only helped you close the deal

303
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,039
but was also invited to film a movie.

304
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,440
How would you thank me?

305
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,159
Be with you in case you run around.

306
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,760
Good, keep it on.

307
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,200
By the way, have you ever filmed videos?

308
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,599
I don't have any experience.

309
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,840
I don't want to make mistakes.

310
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,200
Will you stay with me?

311
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,119
Why would I do that?
I'm not the director.

312
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
Who is jealous now?

313
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,679
Why do I smell jealousy here?

314
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,239
Me too.

315
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,760
Yeah. I'm jealous.

316
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:10,080
Would you like to taste it?

317
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:10,919
No.

318
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,239
Miss Bai,

319
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,679
it's a letter of intent

320
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,479
from SC.

321
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:30,320
Mr. Gu asked you to read it.

322
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,679
So soon?

323
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,440
I remember William said

324
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,080
it would cost one week.

325
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,799
I guess it's because of Su Jingjing.

326
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,320
I heard they knew each other.

327
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,359
William

328
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
is a big fan of martial arts.

329
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,679
Speaking of which,

330
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,559
Su Jingjing

331
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,679
is really a mascot of Mr. Gu.

332
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,880
You can leave now.

333
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,919
Okay. I'll go now, Miss Bai.

334
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:10,280
(Su's Martial Club)
Actors,

335
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,400
start freshening up.

336
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,479
Be sure to get everything

337
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,400
arranged.

338
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,039
Relax.

339
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:14,919
Find some plants

340
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,320
to be in the foreground.

341
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,719
I feel thirsty when I'm nervous.

342
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,559
Come on.

343
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,679
Director, what do you think of

344
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,400
my daughter being an actor?

345
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,599
She's intelligent.

346
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,640
She takes it after me.

347
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,599
It's obvious.

348
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:27,039
Okay.

349
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,159
William, why are so many people here?

350
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,000
Relax.

351
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,960
We'll shoot some fighting scenes today.

352
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:32,880
Okay.

353
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,719
Willy.

354
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,440
Let's go out.

355
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,080
Mr. Han, we're preparing the location.

356
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Okay. I'll go check it.

357
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,880
You can have a try later.

358
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,200
I'm an artist mother.

359
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,159
This is Chinese kung fu.

360
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,119
What are you doing here?

361
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,599
Gu Group is working with SC.

362
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,440
I'm here to visit my customer.

363
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,239
What about you?

364
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,039
Jingjing asked me to come.

365
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,080
Looks like she concerns

366
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,320
quite a few people.

367
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,200
The sword is so cool.

368
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:31,159
Will Miss film the video with it?

369
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,520
Yes, yes.

370
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
It's real.

371
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,880
It could hurt people.

372
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,520
Are you okay?

373
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,559
None of your business.

374
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,039
You have strength.

375
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,640
When it comes to strength,

376
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,520
flex your muscles

377
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,559
and punch.

378
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Well,

379
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,200
give it to me.

380
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,479
It's about to start.

381
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,000
Let's see how it is going.

382
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,119
Okay.

383
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,919
So hard.

384
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,439
Jingjing, I want you to be my master.

385
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,520
Why?

386
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,760
The kids bully me.

387
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,400
I want revenge.

388
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,439
But learning martial arts

389
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,040
is not about being competitive.

390
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
If I'm good at martial arts,

391
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,000
no one would dare bully me.

392
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,040
We are not in it for beating others,

393
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,359
but for restraining
the competitive feeling.

394
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,359
Your forehead...

395
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:46,959
It's no big deal.

396
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,719
That girl...

397
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
Her name is Su Jingjing. She's fine too.

398
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,520
Just can't stand the sight of blood.

399
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:02,040
We practice martial arts to keep fit

400
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,040
and help others

401
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,400
instead of fighting or taking revenge.

402
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,479
Do you understand?

403
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,160
But what if people bully you?

404
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:12,520
Bully me? Fight back.

405
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,520
Okay, cut.

406
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:17,920
Change the placement.

407
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,359
Okay.

408
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:19,959
Makeup.

409
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:20,560
Okay.

410
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Director, how was my acting?

411
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:25,199
You are empathized

412
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,040
and talented.

413
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,800
That's it for this part.

414
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,599
Let's rehearse

415
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:28,959
for the fighting scenes, okay?

416
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,479
Sure.

417
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,479
Come on.

418
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,520
Your daughter is good.

419
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,319
What are you doing here?

420
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:34,719
Xie Te.

421
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,959
You said you wouldn't come.

422
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:37,599
It's your first time acting.

423
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
I have to come.

424
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,560
You are going to bring us glory today.

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,800
The props.

426
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:48,839
The props.

427
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,160
What's the matter with you?

428
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,880
Why did you bring it in person?

429
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,000
Why the yelling?

430
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,079
I'm sorry.

431
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,760
Here.

432
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,239
Do a good job.

433
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,400
Come on.

434
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,199
Okay.

435
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:01,599
Okay. Rolling.

436
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,560
You can do it.

437
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,920
Okay. Get ready.

438
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,280
Mr. Gu.

439
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:21,520
Mr. Gu.

440
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,719
Mr. Gu.

441
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,400
Jingjing.

442
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,040
Jingjing.

443
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,280
Jingjing.

444
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:27,839
Jingjing.

445
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:29,280
Mr. Gu.

446
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,760
Hurry up.

447
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,640
Are you okay?

448
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,599
Mr. Gu.

449
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,119
Are you okay?

450
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Help them up first.

451
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,079
Come on, move it.

452
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,040
Mr. Gu.

453
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,959
Do it yourself.

454
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,880
I'm a patient.

455
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,920
Don't I deserve the treat?

456
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,719
Save it.

457
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:09,760
The nurse said

458
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,280
the wound on your back isn't serious.

459
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:12,680
We can go home soon.

460
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,079
Do it yourself.

461
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,160
I don't care.

462
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,640
My back still hurts.

463
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,280
Alright.

464
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,359
Save it.

465
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,319
Senior.

466
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,839
What are you doing here?

467
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,640
It seems I came at a bad time.

468
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,439
I'm here to see

469
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,400
my future

470
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:41,359
brother-in-law.

471
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,000
S-Senior,

472
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,680
what did you call him?

473
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,800
Brother-in-law.

474
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,920
Brother-in-law.

475
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,319
Brother-in-law.

476
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,319
Good. I like it.

477
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,439
Now,

478
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,280
you have been recognized.

479
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,400
Sorry.

480
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,520
I forgot about your wound.

481
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:04,400
Are you okay?

482
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,640
He's fine.

483
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,119
The doctor said he can go home tonight.

484
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,400
But it hurts.

485
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,319
Okay.

486
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,040
I will stop

487
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:15,880
being the third wheel here.

488
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,599
I have things to do. Gotta go.

489
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:20,680
Bye, Senior.

490
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,680
See you at the club.

491
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:24,599
Bye.

492
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,400
Get home safe, Senior.

493
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,760
I have never noticed

494
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,560
that Senior is a nice guy.

495
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,239
You never said that before.

496
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:37,719
Senior, senior.

497
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,160
Thick as thieves.

498
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:42,800
Things have changed.

499
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,400
Come in.

500
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,560
You got so many visitors.

501
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,680
Do you feel better?

502
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,400
Yesterday...

503
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,199
I've heard it.

504
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,319
Don't you blame me?

505
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,319
I just want Jingjing to be fine.

506
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,520
I'm here to say goodbye.

507
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,400
Have you made up your mind?

508
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,160
Where are you going?

509
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,119
I've been dwelling on

510
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,880
one thing for so long

511
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,079
that I forgot
why I'm still insisting on it.

512
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,839
It's time to have a vacation.

513
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,640
I'll go to Iceland.

514
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,000
Good. Go ahead.

515
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,800
If you want to come back,

516
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:14,800
Gu Group's door is always open.

517
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:24,560
What?

518
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,119
Porridge.

519
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,839
Come on, Mr. Gu.

520
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,000
Be careful

521
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:42,680
with the equipment.

522
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,479
Got it.

523
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,319
Okay.

524
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,199
Move lighting equipment
to the second car.

525
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:46,920
Okay.

526
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,040
You are leaving so soon.

527
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,599
Yeah. The video filming has finished.

528
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,439
I still have work to do.

529
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,119
Okay. It's nice to meet you.

530
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,160
See you next time.

531
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,160
Me too.

532
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,599
I have never met

533
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,680
such a lovely Chinese girl like you.

534
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,760
You can come to me anytime

535
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,839
if you need help.

536
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,599
There's always a place for you in SC.

537
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,439
Thank you.

538
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,920
I think Gu Group fits Jingjing

539
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,000
better.

540
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,839
Your boyfriend
seems to be a bit jealous.

541
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,520
Can we have a word in private?

542
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,359
Sure.

543
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:22,920
No.

544
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,160
I think Gu really loves you.

545
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:36,319
You are brilliant.

546
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,400
But

547
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,160
a sense of crisis can help him

548
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,359
maintain it.

549
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,560
Okay.

550
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:48,880
Bye.

551
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,239
What did he say?

552
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,920
I'm not telling you.

553
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:03,839
Su Jingjing,

554
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,479
can you stop

555
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,199
being adorable?

556
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,800
I'm telling you.

557
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,599
You have a boyfriend.

558
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,520
Don't listen to his nonsense.

559
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,280
What if he told me

560
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,199
to cherish my boyfriend,

561
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,959
who is a nice guy?

562
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,400
Should I listen to him?

563
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Then he's right.
You should listen to him.

564
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:27,560
No.

565
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,839
Who was it that said

566
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,520
I shouldn't listen to

567
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,520
the nonsense?

568
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,560
Listen to him.

569
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:34,439
No, I won't.

570
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,319
I heard you resigned.

571
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,439
Are you going to Iceland?

572
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:18,359
Would you like

573
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:21,000
to go for a late snack?

574
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,479
Sure.

575
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,959
Two buns

576
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,280
and two bowls of wonton soup, please.

577
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,199
Ma'am prepared fruits for you.

578
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:55,880
Thank you.

579
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,520
What's it that I can't see?

580
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,319
Nothing.

581
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,160
Nothing?

582
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,599
Let me have a look.

583
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
Don't laugh at me.

584
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,959
I won't laugh at you.

585
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,239
Let me see.

586
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,959
The painting is pretty good.

587
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,040
Really?

588
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:27,800
Gu Rong.

589
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:32,359
Actually, I want to work
in the design department.

590
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,400
I majored in design.

591
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,560
It's just been neglected for years.

592
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,239
I want to apply for the job.

593
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,040
If you want,

594
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,560
I can speak to the design department.

595
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,560
Go there when you're free.

596
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,599
No.

597
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,920
I want to apply for the job.

598
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,079
Sure. Just do it if you want.

599
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,640
I support you.

600
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:57,680
Really?

601
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,599
Do you think I can get the job?

602
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,000
Of course you can.

603
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,880
I knew you are the best.

604
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,560
Grandpa, the company...

605
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,199
All right. You don't have to tell me

606
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,079
anything about the company.

607
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,280
I trust your decision.

608
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:41,079
Besides, you will take control

609
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,119
of the company sooner or later.

610
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,359
Is there anything else?

611
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,880
It's about Jingjing.

612
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,359
She wants to work
in the design department.

613
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,680
What do you think?

614
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,280
She is talented in design.

615
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:16,319
But as you can see in the case

616
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,160
of SC,

617
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,000
she has the ability

618
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,160
to help me with the business.

619
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,319
Gu Rong,

620
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,560
have you ever

621
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,920
thought about what she likes?

622
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,079
She likes designing and action figures.

623
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,800
But...

624
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,400
Jingjing is a brilliant girl.

625
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:39,439
She can't always stand by your side.

626
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,760
She will find her position
sooner or later.

627
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:50,160
I get it.

628
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:53,439
Come on. Have a seat.

629
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,439
Have some fruits.

630
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,064
(Su's Martial Club)

631
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,560
Why didn't you go to work?

632
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,560
Come here.

633
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,000
The design department set the paper.

634
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:17,880
Have you read it?

635
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,839
Come up with a design about ourselves

636
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,439
of any style or form.

637
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:24,959
Do you have any ideas?

638
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,400
Do you want me to help?

639
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,040
Does Mr. Gu want to help me cheat?

640
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,319
I could.

641
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:39,920
No. It's my job.

642
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,479
I'll do whatever on my own.

643
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,479
Don't change the subject.

644
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,079
Why didn't you go to work?

645
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:48,439
I take these days off
and work from home.

646
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,520
Are you ill?

647
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,640
Why do you work from home?

648
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:56,079
My girlfriend is applying for a job.

649
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
I have to be with her.

650
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,640
Don't do whatever you want

651
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,839
as you own the company.

652
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,239
Do you like it?

653
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,719
Don't play with me.

654
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,199
I'm creating a design.

655
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,880
I have to be calm
and stay away from men.

656
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,319
Don't affect my work.

657
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,400
Really?

658
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,760
I'll go work on my design.

659
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,280
Jingjing, it's been an hour
since lunchtime.

660
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,839
Just come and eat something.

661
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,760
I'm not hungry.

662
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,520
Jingjing, have some water.

663
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:49,719
Don't work too hard.

664
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,040
I'm not thirsty.

665
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,320
I tried hard to cope with my parents

666
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:10,760
and now you are here.

667
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,439
You ate and drank nothing.

668
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,479
Are you working or suffering?

669
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,560
Of course I'm working.

670
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,679
Look.

671
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:24,399
Does it look like me?

672
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,919
It does look like you.

673
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,439
But it's not your "self".

674
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,439
Am I thinking about it the wrong way?

675
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,800
Let's eat something
before working on it again.

676
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,760
No. I don't have time.

677
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,479
Come on.

678
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,919
No. Let me go.

679
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:49,959
Go.

680
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,040
Hurry up.

681
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,040
No.

682
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,840
Come on. You'll fall.

683
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,360
I haven't finished my painting.

684
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:58,719
You'll fall. We're on the staircase.

685
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,600
Just drop it

686
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,840
and take a rest.

687
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:02,040
See?

688
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,959
Come on.

689
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,919
Take a break.

690
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,360
Let me go or I will punch you.

691
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
That's more like you.

692
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,080
Let's go. Have a rest.

693
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,239
I'll get you some water.

694
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,760
Have some water

695
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,639
and have a rest.

696
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,800
I don't want to rest.

697
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,600
Have some water.

698
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,239
I don't want to.

699
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,800
Would you like to eat something?

700
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,199
No.

701
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:34,560
Drink something else?

702
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,199
No.

703
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,679
In the world of design,

704
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,959
there's no toilet, no drinking,

705
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,439
and no eating.

706
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:46,399
Then don't go to the toilet

707
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,919
when you work.

708
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,959
Okay.

709
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,280
Sit down and rest.

710
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,360
It hasn't been one minute.

711
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,959
Don't always stay in the room.
Take a break sometimes.

712
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,879
Maybe

713
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:57,320
the inspiration would come.

714
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,199
Let's visit the shop today.

715
00:35:59,399 --> 00:35:59,879
Don't ask.

716
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,399
She would be shy.

717
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:02,544
(Send)

718
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,199
That's it.

719
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,120
(Gu Rong was right.)

720
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,199
Are you tired?

721
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,040
How'd you know my shoulders are sore?

722
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,040
I foresaw it.

723
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,639
You foresaw it?

724
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,120
My hands are sore too.

725
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,479
You didn't foresee it.

726
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:39,439
How could I not foresee it?

727
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,840
Did you set cameras in my room

728
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,600
or bugs on me?

729
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,959
No.

730
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,159
Give me your hand.

731
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,959
Roll up the sleeve.

732
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,719
Let me apply Su's magic oil.

733
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:07,280
The sleeve.

734
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,520
Here?

735
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,399
Does it hurt?

736
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:13,520
It's okay.

737
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,840
It'll get better soon.

738
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:16,679
Rub it first.

739
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,800
Poor girl.

740
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,120
Look.

741
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:25,800
Does it hurt?

742
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,679
No.
