One-sided love.

33

One-sided love?

Yeah.

Jingjing is back.

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,399
I'm going to help senior
with some files.

38
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,520
I'll go upstairs.

Wait there.

Didn't you see the mess here?

Can't you help us cleaning it up?

42

I have serious business.
You can do it yourself.

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,119
Hey. You...

44
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,479
Let me tell you.

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,440
Kids have secrets at this age.

46
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,479
She's so happy.

47
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,039
Yeah.

We're going to rest.

Don't think about it too much.

52
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,839
Let me tell you.

53
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:59,039
One-sided love is also love.

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,919
Yeah.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,399
It's pretty beautiful too.

56
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,559
Don't rush it.

57
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,800
It'll come to you when it's time.

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,839
That's right.

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,520
You have to make your move

60
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,919
when love shows itself,

61
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,559
and then it'll come to you.

62
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,679
Just like the two of us.

63
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,440
When we were in the disco hall before...

64
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,559
We just...

65
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't tell that to kids.

66
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,039
Young people are smart.

67
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:26,839
They know better than us.

68
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Right, Gu?

69
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,039
Let's go.

70
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:31,479
We're going to rest then.

71
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,520
We'll go now.

72
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,199
You should go to rest too.

73
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:33,839
Don't think about it too much.

74
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,679
It's okay.

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,399
Cheer up.

76
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,520
You are young.

77
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,279
Let's go.

78
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:37,919

79

81
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,960
Careful what you say.

82
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,759
I wanted...

83
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:45,479
I wanted Jingjing and
him to get together.

84
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,080
How is that possible?

85
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,119
Why not?

86
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,800
Just go.

I envy her so much.

93
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,160
My dad may seem goofy.

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,919
But he's so good to my mom.

95
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,039
I envy them.

96
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,959
If someone treats me like that,

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
I'll be so moved

98
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,799
that I won't find words to say.

99

100
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,920

You can't properly tie your shoes.

Do you remember?

105
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,720
You always tripped over
when you were little.

106
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,559
I do. And you always
help me tie my shoes.

107

Senior.

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,720
I can go with you

Did your confession go well?

126
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,839
No. It'd sound like I'm mad,

127
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,040
and make it look like I care about her.

128
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,600
I should be gentler.

129

I'm so happy for you.

132
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,200
That's too fake.

133
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,440
But why would I care?

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,279
I'm her boss. I just need
to know what's going on.

135
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,480
Right. That's it.

136
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,320
Come in.

137
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,720
Buy a coffee for me.

138
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,920
Drinking coffee at this hour?

139
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,600
Seriously?

140
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,040
Don't fool me around

141
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,600
whenever you see me happy, okay?

142
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,200
You are happy?

143
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,000
Why would you be happy?

144
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,839
Why would you care?

145
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,640
I strongly advise you

146
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,320
to go back and rest

147
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,720
if you want a good sleep tonight.

148
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,279
I need to organize
some files for senior.

149
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,839
Has he ever

150
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,440
sold one book?

151
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,720
What's the rush?

152
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,119
His book sells very well.

153
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,320
Of course someone
who focuses on stock price

154
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,519
other than books

155
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,519
wouldn't know

156
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,920
which book sells the best.

157
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,119
I read books

158
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,839
that you can barely understand.

159
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,799
Did your confession go well?

160
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,799
No.

161
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,920
I knew it wouldn't be that easy.

162
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,519
You are inexperienced.
What do you know?

163
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,040
If my senior thinks the same thing

164
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,239
as I do,

165
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,079
why would I rush things

166
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,600
and open it up to him now?

167
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,679
You are saying Han Ran likes you?

168
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,440
No way.

169
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm baffled.

170
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:57,239
Why can't you wish me something good?

171
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm just being objective

172
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,480
and that's the truth.

173
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,480
If he didn't like me,

174
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,640
why would he invite me

175
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,480
to go with him to a dinner party?

176
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,559
What?

177
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,600
No.

178
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,600
The contract requires you

179
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,480
to be on call all day.

180
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,600
Mr. Gu, do you know the Labor Law?

181
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:20,480
Everybody has the right

182
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,640
to rest and enjoy holidays.

183
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,799
I can take sick leave anyway.

184
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,640
You don't look sick.

185
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,480
I have a feeling

186
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,880
that my period is coming soon.

187
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,640
Maybe I should get
a leave permit from a doctor?

188
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,599
You are breaching the contract.

189
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,559
I have basic human rights.

190
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,119
And anything is secondary

191
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,359
before love.

192
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,239
Cheers.

193
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,679
Let's drink to your confession.

194
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,799
Ai Mi, actually...

195
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,039
Are you free tomorrow night?

196
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,559
I can introduce you to my best friend.

197
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,960
I am, but...

198
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:23,080
We get together now.

199
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,400
Just say whatever you want.

200
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,239
I'll be honest with you.

201
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,960
We had a misunderstanding.

202
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,039
Misunderstanding?

203
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,880
The roses were for my boss.

204
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,719
I wouldn't be here

205
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,599
if those people were not after me.

206
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,000
So?

207
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,000
Actually...

208
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,559
Actually I don't care about that

209
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,320
at all.

210
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,559
What I do care about is

211
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
whether you like me or not.

212
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,760
Not even a little bit?

213
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,119
I do.

214
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,719
More than

215
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,559
a little bit.

216
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,640
Well, that's it.

217
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,919
If this is where fate leads us,

218
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,520
we go along with it.

219
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,919
That's it.

220
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,760
I don't think my confession
is good enough.

221
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,119
I want to give you a better one.

222
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,719
Why does that matter?

223
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,359
You like me.

224
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,080
And I like you.

225
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,479
Isn't that enough?

226
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,479
Yes, it is.

227
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,919
For love.

228
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:26,400
(Mr. Gu)

229
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,119
Sorry. My boss.

230
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:34,640
Answer it. I'm young. I can wait.

231
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,080
Mr. Gu.

232
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,119
Xie Te, you have 15 minutes

233
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,400
to get to a cafe near Su's Martial Club.

234
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,239
But I...

235
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,520
Hurry up.

236
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,000
Your boss must be single.

237
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,840
How did you know?

238
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,280
Being all grumpy.

239
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,760
Asking employees to work overtime.

240
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,200
How can he have a girlfriend?

241
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,400
Mr. Gu.

242
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,359
It's my fault about the flowers.

243
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:26,400
Chief He and other people were after me.

244
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,039
It doesn't matter. Sit down.

245
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,039
Sit down.

246
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,159
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

247
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,599
I ask you whether you
have had a girlfriend?

248
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:41,719
You are not young anymore.

249
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,440
Just tell me the truth

250
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,599
whether you have or not.

251
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,840
Is it that hard?

252
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,880
I just got one.

253
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,119
It won't affect my work though.

254
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,599
It doesn't matter.

255
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,039
I didn't ask you that.

256
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,239
A friend of mine
fell in love with a girl.

257
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,280
What do you think he should do

258
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,119
to win her over?

259
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,719
I know all your friends.

260
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,239
You are talking about yourself, right?

261
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,479
Mr. Gu.

262
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,640
I could never in
a million years imagine...

263
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:18,119
Careful what you say.

264
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,400
Okay.

265
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,599
But I have to know

266
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,919
what that girl is like

267
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,960
to give you advice, right?

268
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,840
She is... How do I describe her...

269
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,000
Xie Te.

270
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Should I call the Finance Department?

271
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,200
Did they overpay you?

272
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,000
No. I already checked.

273
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,080
Not a cent more.

274
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:50,960
Sit down.

275
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,479
This girl

276
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,119
is not like the others.

277
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,119
She has someone in her heart.

278
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,919
Are you trying to steal her?

279
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,599
Of course not.

280
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,280
That guy doesn't feel the same way.

281
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,599
Wait, Mr. Gu.

282
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,000
You spent every day
in Su's Martial Club.

283
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,599
The only girl you see is Su...

284
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,280
Did you fall in love with Su Jingjing?

285
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:27,200
So the guy she likes is Mr. Han.

286
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,239
Is there a problem?

287
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,320
No.

288
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,239
She is cute.

289
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,239
Right?

290
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,039
She's cute.

291
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,000
I think so.

292
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,479
Do you think it's possible

293
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,280
that she actually likes me,

294
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,719
but she just thought

295
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,359
she likes Han Ran?

296
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,400
What woman would

297
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,479
pick Han Ran over me?

298
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,119
Look at me.

299
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:04,119
I'm a good person. I have
a good background. And I'm good to her.

300
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,800
What else does she want?

301
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:09,959
Mr. Gu.

302
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,800
I think Ms. Su

303
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,199
hasn't noticed you

304
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,640
because she hasn't fully
known about you yet.

305
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,920
Think about it.

306
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:19,079
How long has she known Mr. Han?

307
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,719
And how long has she known you?

308
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,040
That's the only thing
he has the advantage.

309
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,880
But the situation is different now.

310
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,359
It's you who see Ms. Su

311
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,640
every day.

312
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,040
I think you should find out
what she likes.

313
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,920
You should also guide her

314
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,839
to find out your merits.

315
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,959
That's the way to make her
give Mr. Han up.

316
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,199
And she can choose you.

317
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,160
It's...

318
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:47,920
It's good?

319
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:48,680
Let's drink.

320
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,520
(Su's Martial Club)

321
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:14,359
Find out what she likes,
and my merits as well.

322
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:25,000
(Let's go to the comic con tomorrow.)

323
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,359
(Come with me to the
comic con tomorrow.)

324
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,839
(Not a chance.)

325
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,439
(If I break something)

326
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,599
(and borrow another 300k,)

327
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,560
(I'll have to be your
bodyguard for life.)

328
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
She's so difficult.

329
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,400
(But how will she react)

330
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,239
(when she finds out)

331
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,599
(the sculpture she broke was my work?)

332
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay. Again.

333
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,280
Why did you bring me here?

334
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,560
Catch. Go.

335
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,119
Combat is your hobby, right?

336
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,680
My hobby?

337
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,839
You are worried that I can't

338
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,400
fight off those people
sent by your Grandpa, right?

339
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,359
Since you are my bodyguard,

340
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,719
you need to improve your skills.

341
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,280
You don't like here?

342
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,479
My dad said

343
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,239
that these are just
fancy foreign techniques.

344
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,479
It's my first time here.

345
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,319
You've only practiced

346
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,839
with those swords at your house?

347
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,800
That's enough to defeat

348
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,359
those after you.

349
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,560
But I'm an aspirant person.

350
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,359
I don't mind learning new stuff.

351
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,160
It is alright if you are glad.

352
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,839
Can you beat him?

353
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,439
Okay. You two.

354
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,640
What I just showed you

355
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:08,160
is straight punch in combat.

356
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,359
Now I'll teach you feet movement,

357
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,520
hook and swing, okay?

358
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,439
Come. Try it.

359
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,119
Keep your elbows inward
and shoulder down.

360
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:19,760
Fist down. Hips forward. Then punch.

361
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,520
Okay?

362
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,959
Come on. I'll show you.

363
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,920
Let's try

364
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,880
the techniques you learned.

365
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
In practical combat,

366
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,079
you use straight punch,
hook and swing, okay?

367
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,680
You two can have a try.

368
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,599
I don't think that's necessary.

369
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,199
Are you ready?

370
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,079
Why didn't you dodge?

371
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,400
You didn't give me time to dodge.

372
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:49,479
I...

373
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,400
This girl is not bad.

374
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:52,479
Don't bleed. I'll pass out.

375
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,239
I'm not. Come on.

376
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:15,280
Are you okay? Mr. Gu?

377
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,160
Why did I bring you here?

378
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,959
Mr. Gu, it's not really my fault.

Whose fault is it then?

381
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
You gave me the ideas, right?

382
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:43,119
I asked you to find out what she likes.

383
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:45,160
I didn't ask you
to take her to a fight club.

384
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,079
I wonder

385
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,800
if you are going on a date or a fight.

386
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

387
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:53,439
Is it not early enough?

388
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,880
I made it very clear.

389
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,479
Man.

390
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,239
Doesn't she have other hobbies?

391
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,280
You can ask her

392
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,319
and take her out to do it.

393
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,280
You wouldn't be needed if I can.

394
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,800
Did I tell you to get up? Down.

395
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,000
Hurry up.

396
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,719
Keep the position

397
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,599

Is there anything you want to do lately?

410
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,719
To go to my senior's

dinner party

412
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,800
as his girlfriend.

Anything else?

414
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,599
To see the meteor shower with senior

415
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,160
and wish to become his girlfriend.

416
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:15,920
Is that all you want?

417
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,119
What's wrong with it?

418
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,680
I just want to see
the meteor shower with him.

419
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,239
In the park.

420

On the long stone stairs.

421

if I can sit there with him

423
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,040
watching the meteor shower?

424
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,119
If only we had a telescope,

425
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,760
that'd be even greater.

426

Are you sure that making
a wish to the meteor shower

427
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,680
is going to work better

428

You won't understand anyway.

431
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,079
It's a pity senior has work today

432
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:42,479
and can't see the meteor shower.

433
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:42,520
and can't see the meteor shower.

I need to go out.

Tonight you can have paid vacation.

438
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,400
Sounds fishy.

439
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,280
Never mind then.

440
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,880
Wait. I didn't say I don't want it.

441

You'd better not regret it.

I don't know

443
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,160
if making a wish
to the meteor shower works.

444
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,800
But you need to be careful

445
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,319
with what you wish for.

446
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,520
For example?

447
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,839
For example.

448
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,119
You can't say

449
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,319
you want to get together

450
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,079
with your senior.

451
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:23,239
You have to say

452
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,439
you want to get together

453
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,640
with your Mr. Right.

454
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,920
What's the difference?

455
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,040
Of course there is.

456
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,839
What if your Mr. Right

457
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,040
isn't Han Ran?

458
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,800
Who else can it be?

459
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,839
(I just knew he wouldn't be so nice.)

460

(One minute he's
giving me paid vacation.)

461
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,359
(And next he discourages me.)

463
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,239
Put on your fancy clothes again?

464
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,439
It must be an important night.

465
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,839
Sort of. You should dress up too.

466
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,359
Me? I'm just there to
watch the meteor shower.

467
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,199
Is that necessary?

468
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,880
Be respectful.

469
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,479
What if your wish comes true?

470
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,599
Don't waste

471
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,599
the paid vacation I gave you.

472
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,800
(That's weird.)

473
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,079
(Didn't he always)

474
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,160
(try to discourage me about senior?)

475
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,880
Make a wish.

476
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,520
Look at that.

477
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,280
I see it. I'll make a wish.

478
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,400
Can I borrow your telescope?

479
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,280
You are so arrogant.

480
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,640
Another one! Over there!

481
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:11,536
(Xie Te)

482
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,119
Book a restaurant,
prepare a gift and flowers.

483
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,079
Check every detail

484

with me.

485
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,880
I'll bring Su Jingjing there
after watching the meteor shower.

486
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,719
I'm so sorry, Mr. Xie.

487
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,479
Our restaurant

488
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,880
probably will be closed by then.

489
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,959
Can you help me

490
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,359
and talk to your superior about it?

491
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,800
We've come so many times.

492
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,319
This is a special issue.

493
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,199
Okay. Please wait here.

494

495
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Ai Mi.

496
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,359
(It's already half past six.
Where are you?)

497
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,280
(My boss asked me to work overtime.)

498
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,680
(I'm still dealing with it.)

499
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:52,199
(Can you wait for me there?)

500
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,199
Why is your boss always like that?

501
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,920
I'm sorry, Ai Mi.

502
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:58,199
I didn't mean to be
late on our first date.

503
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,680
It's not your fault.

504
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,439
It's all because of your boss.

505
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,079
How can he always
make you work overtime?

506
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,439
That's brutal.

507
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,760
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.

508
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,839
I just checked with my boss.

509
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:13,959
(Ai Mi)
We can reserve a place

510

511
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:15,640
We'll wait.

512
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,520
Really?

513
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,640
Thank you so much.

514
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,319
You're welcome.

515
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,479
Ai Mi.

516
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
I'm busy now.

517
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,040
See you later.

518
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,119
What is it?

519
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,680
Why are you smiling?

520
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
My boyfriend said he's working overtime.

521
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,400
But actually he's preparing
a surprise for me.

522
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,680
What surprise?

523
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,439
I just heard that he reserved a place

524
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,839
at a restaurant for me.

525
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,599
That's so romantic.

526
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,359
I'm sorry, Jingjing.

527
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,520
I brought you here to meet my boyfriend

528
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,640
and made you wait for so long.

529
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:03,959
It's nothing.

530
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,040
What can be more important

531
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:06,959
than my best friend's love life?

532
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,520
Thankfully I didn't go to watch
the meteor shower.

533
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,640
Look at the downpour.

534
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,800
Why is it raining?

535
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,400
The weather forecast didn't mention it.

536
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:14,000
Let's go.

537
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,359
I got it. Let's go.

538
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,719
Let's go.

539
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,599
Mister.

540
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,400
Where are you going in this weather?

541
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,520
Arrogant man.

542
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Where are you, Su Jingjing?

543
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,280
I'm on my way.

544
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,079
You...

545
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,319
Didn't you say you want to
see the meteor shower?

546
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,719
Why didn't you go?

547
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,319
Do you know that

548
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,239
I waited for you for two hours

549
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,400
in that park?

550
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,479
Why were you waiting for me?

551
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,319
I...

552
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,359
You said you had something to do.

553
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:49,880
Why were you at the park?

554
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,079
It doesn't matter why I was there.

555
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:54,199
I'm asking why you weren't.

556
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,199
Look at the weather.

557
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,719
How am I supposed to go?

558
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,560
Anyway,

559
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,119
what would you care

560
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:02,079
if I went or not?

561
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,199
Mr. Gu, the restaurant is settled.

562
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:08,959
It's at...

563
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,400
How can I go to a restaurant like this?

564
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,239
Let me introduce you.

565
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,520
This is my boyfriend, Xie Te.

566
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:17,680
Mr. Gu.

567
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:21,880
You two know each other?

568
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,040
They probably know each other better

569
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,560
than you know him.

570
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,199
Mr. Gu.

571
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,400
I'm here to bring
my girlfriend to dinner.

572
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:41,400
Let's go together then.

573
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:42,959
My boyfriend booked a restaurant

574
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:44,640
for tonight.

575
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,560
Are we really going together?

576
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,800
I...

577
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:57,719
Thank you.

578
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,760
Enjoy.

579
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:10,719
Xie Te is off work now.

580
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,160
And don't make it out like

581
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:14,160
you booked the restaurant, okay?

582
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:15,680
I...

583
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,959
Actually it wasn't me.

584
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,959
Don't try to hide it, Xie Te.

585
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,880
Ai Mi heard everything over the phone.

586
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,160
Thank you.

587
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,439
Mr. Gu...

588
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,079
I have a little cold.

589
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,680
Mr. Gu...

590
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,280
He visited this restaurant very often.
I'm glad you like it.

591
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

592
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,479
On behalf of the gentleman
who booked the restaurant,

593
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:47,719
we dedicate this piece

594
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,520
to the girl he loves.

595
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,880
How is it? Do you like it?

596
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,000
Yes.

597
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,880
Xie Te.

598
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,599
I can't believe you did all this.

599
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:20,439
I envy you, Ai Mi.

600
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,880
Thank you. I like it a lot.

601
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,079
I'll do it.

602
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,640
Thank you.

603
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,319
This is yours, Ai Mi.

604
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,079
Thank you.

605
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:44,959
Ai Mi.

606
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,599
You like strawberries, right?

607
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,719
How about we exchange?

608
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,719
Red velvet.

609
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,680
Your favorite.

610
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,520
Am I dreaming?

611
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,600
No.

612
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,800
This cake is for Jingjing.

613
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,479
Yes, it is for her.

614
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,040
They must have made a mistake.

615
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,959
It doesn't matter now.

616
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,959
It still ended up in your hands

617
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,360
after all.

618
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,120
No. The necklace...

619
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,040
You don't need to explain, Xie Te.

620
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,399
Among the four of us,

621
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:54,840
only you can give Ai Mi a necklace.

622
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,479
We understand.

623
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,520
It's okay. Don't worry.

624
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,399
Right?

625
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,800
You don't need to feel bad about it.

626
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,719
Can you help me put it on?

627
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:14,000
Why are you looking at me? Put it on.

628
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,560
Yeah. Do it.

629
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,639
Okay.

630
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:33,360
Do it well.

631
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,040
Do it.

632
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,120
Keep your hands steady.

633
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,760
He's nervous.

634
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,639
This is beautiful.

635
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,719
You have taste, Xie Te.

636
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,000
It's so pretty.

637
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,120
Of course.

638
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:08,879
Thank you.

639
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,959
Is one kiss enough?

640
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,959
It is.

641
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,639
When is the wedding?

642
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,320
You bought the necklace.

643
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,840
You must have bought the ring too.

644
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,840
The surprise is not for you.

645
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:51,479
Why are you so happy?

646
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,879
How do you know it's not for me?

647
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,280
You...

648
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,239
You knew it?

649
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,800
Of course.

650
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,959
The surprise is for Ai Mi.

651
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,040
She is happy.

652
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,479
So I am happy.

653
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
In a way,

654
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,439
the surprise is also for me.

655
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,800
What's that logic?

656
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,199
Why do you care?

657
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,560
It's a good day. Let's go back now.

658
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,679
Tomorrow is a big day.

659
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,320
I need to get back and prepare.

660
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,239
What's so important?

661
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:36,280
Did you totally forget about it?

662
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:40,560
The dinner party with my senior.

663
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,080
I need to get back
and have a good sleep.

664
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:44,080
If you want to take a walk,

665
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,760
you'll have to go alone.

666
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
You are still going?

667
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:50,479
Of course I am. Bye.
