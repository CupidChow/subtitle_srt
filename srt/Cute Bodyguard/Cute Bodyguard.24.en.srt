Mister.

30

Can I ask you something?

31
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,239
Go ahead.

32
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,479
If there's a secret

33
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,199
to live with your wife?

34
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:15,080
I understand.

35
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:17,720
Gu.

36
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,240
This is the right time for you

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,039
to learn some life saving tips.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,839
When I was pursuing her,

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,800
as a typical guy,

40
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,720
I made so many mistakes.

41
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,960
Then how did you two

42
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,000
become a happy couple?

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,520
Well.

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,039
The secret is

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,119
I turned from a lone wolf
into her puppy.

46
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,639
I didn't know you are so wild.

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,960
Yeah. As long as she's happy,

48
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,119
then I'm happy.

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,880
How can I be happy?

50
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,160
Just spoil her.

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,080
That's the secret.

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,880
Well...

53
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:00,520
Guess I'll try.

54
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,639
Just do it.

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,039
It'll work.

56
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,440
Okay.

57
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,399
A man can't go onto
the battlefield untrained.

58
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,959
The anniversary was so successful.

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,160
We didn't even get a rest.

60
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,880
How about a drink?

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,959
Okay.

62
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,160
Let's do a cross cup.

63
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,399
The wine made me so hot.

64
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,600
Gu Rong, I'm a bit sleepy.

65
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,839
I'll go back to my room now.

66
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,480
And,

67
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:06,000
wear your clothes properly at home.

68
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,519
You might catch a cold.

69
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,760
Good night.

70
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,440
I even did that.

71
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,600
Am I not tempting enough?

72
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,959
Is it my problem

73
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,160
or hers?

74
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,279
You just made the posture.

75
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,600
But there wasn't any practical effort.

76
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,200
It wasn't working.

77
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,200
What practical effort can I make?

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,119
Do you know what I was like?

79
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,040
Be confident, Mr. Gu.

80
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,480
Girls love guys

81
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,519
who are initiative.

82
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,559
It won't work

83
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,559
if you are indecisive.

84
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,640
Xie Te. Listen.

85
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,440
If Jingjing doesn't agree to marry me,

86
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,760
you have to postpone your wedding.

87
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,160
What? Why?

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,119
I mean,

89
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,399
even if she doesn't say yes,

90
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,640
you still can't ruin

91
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,200
our happiness.

92
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,679
We've bought the wedding dress,

93
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,679
booked the hotel,

94
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,839
and sent out the invitations.

95
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,119
I don't care.

96
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,920
Our wedding

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,040
has to be earlier than yours.

98
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,480
What?

99
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,239
Marriage is between the two of you.

100
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,600
You need to ask
Su Jingjing about her will.

101
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,559
I can't make the decision for her.

102
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,839
It's settled then.

103
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,880
How is it settled?

104
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,119
How do I know what she's thinking?

105
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,959
All I can think of

106
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,399
is to be sincere.

107
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,799
Sincere?

108
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Am I not sincere enough to her?

109
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,160
That's true.

110
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,559
Where is Xie Te?

111
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,200
Mr. Gu has a business event.

112
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,160
Xie Te will come later.

113
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,720
I'll talk to Gu Rong about
this when I'm home.

114
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,000
How can he call Xie Te away

115
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,640
from something so important?

116
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,480
It's okay.

117
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,880
I'm just here to collect the dress

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,839
and try on the makeup.

119
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,920
You can have a look

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,079
and see if there's
anything else we need.

121
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,200
Leave it to me.

122
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,119
I'll make sure you're
the most beautiful bride.

123
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,119
The prettiest.

124
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:02,720
Ai Mi.

125
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,000
That dress you just tried on

126
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,440
is beautiful.

127
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,720
Xie Te picked it for me.

128
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,959
It took us a long time
to find this shop.

129
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,000
Look around.

130
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,720
They have many beautiful dresses here.

131
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,160
I see.

132
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,799
These dresses suit you well.

133
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,480
Maybe you should have a try.

134
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,839
I think I'll pass.

135
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,279
Just have a try. We came all the way.

136
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,920
The dress would look different

137
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,920
when you have it on.

138
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,799
This one just came in.

139
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,599
You can try it on.

140
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,159
Yeah. Then we'll know what kind of dress

141
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,320
suits you best when you get married.

142
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,440
You're sure it's not too much trouble?

143
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,119
No.

144
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:42,919
No.

145
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:43,919
Come on.

146
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,880
Okay.

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,679
Ai Mi. Why is the light off?

148
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,000

00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,400
Miss.

174
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,960
This is not a smart way

175
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,000
to get my attention.

176
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,479
Your attention?

177
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,239
Do you think I'd want to talk to you

178
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,559
if you didn't tear my clothes?

179
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,280
Su Jingjing.

186
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,239
(I don't have to play the role)

187
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,080

00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,959
We'll be called Ai Te.

300
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:52,839

301
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,280

304
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,959
So this is what you got

305
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,760
(Wedding of Xie Te and Ai Mi)
after all these days?

306
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,239
It's not any good?

307
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,199
I tried my very best.

308
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:34,160
Mr. Gu,

309
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,880
a wedding is a very personal thing.

310
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,079
What Ai Mi likes

311
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,479
is probably not
Su Jingjing's cup of tea.

312
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,760
That's why I have reached out

313
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,599
to the best wedding
design team in Ninghai.

314
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,160
I told them

315
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,239
Jingjing's preferences.

316
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,719
They'll design the wedding
in the auditorium,

317
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
the banquet in the hotel,
the fireworks show and the band

based on your needs.

319
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,920
I even hired

320
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,680
the most popular
makeup artist for celebrities.

321
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,359
They'll realize every dream

322
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,760

323
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,359
Good.

324
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:12,079
Xie Te, you are getting
better at your job.

325
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,520
I'm honored.

326
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,640
But

327
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,959
I need to keep an eye on everything

328
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
and make sure nothing goes wrong.

329
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,439
Okay.

330
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,119
Let's go.

331
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,719
Sweet Su.

332
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,280
Did you put the sticker

333
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,239
(Happiness)
on the door?

334
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,280
Yeah.

335
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,959
And the red strings.

336
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,119
Did you tie them on the tree?

337
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:38,880
Yeah.

338
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,119
Okay, okay.

339
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,079
Is there anything else?

340
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,400
The lamps. One, two, three, four, five.

341
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,359
Nothing wrong with that.

342
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,319
Right.

343
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,119
And at the entrance.

344
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,119
There are five more
outside the door, right?

345
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,280
Yeah. Don't worry.

346
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,199
That's right.

347
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,400
Another thing.

348
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,079
When is the makeup artist coming?

349
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:55,439
And the full dress.

350
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,040
When are they bringing
the full dress and wedding dress?

351
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,800
When are we going to the hotel?

352
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,119
Did you arrange that?

353
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:01,800
Yeah, yeah.

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,920
You've asked me so many times.

355
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,640
It's all arranged. Don't worry.

356
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,119
Really?

357
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,319
Yes.

358
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,680
My feeling is so complicated now.

359
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,160
There're so many things to do.

360
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,959
But I still feel so empty inside.

361
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,920
Dad, mom.

362
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:17,400
Jingjing.

363
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,319
Jingjing.

364
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:25,239
You don't have to do this.

365
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,319
Just go upstairs.

366
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,439
Put on a facial mask.

367
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,959
I'll come up later

368
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,640
to give you a massage.

369
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,359
Have a bath.

370
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,760
Get a night of good sleep.

371
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,000
Go to the wedding tomorrow

372
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,160
with your best self.

373
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,319
You are crying.

374
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,119
Don't cry.

375
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,719
She's moved.

376
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,439
You know what?

377
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,439
Everybody says

378
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,319
a woman is most beautiful

379
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,520
on her wedding day.

380
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,160
That's a memory of your life.

381
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,000
Just be a beautiful bride

382
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,760
tomorrow.

383
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,199
Make sure everything goes as planned.

384
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,160
Jingjing, don't listen to your mom.

385
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,119
Let me tell you.

386
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,560
A woman is always beautiful

387
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,040
as long as she married the right person.

388
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,119
Look at your mom.

389
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,719
I think she's more beautiful

390
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,920
than yesterday.

391
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,560
I think mom is beautiful

392
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,920
every day.

393
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,479
My baby girl.

394
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,439
Hurry up.

395
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,760
Go put on a facial mask.

396
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,280
I'll come up later.

397
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:26,839
Just go.

398
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,199
Do it.

399
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,079
Okay.

400
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
Sweet Su.

401
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:44,079
Our daughter is getting married.

402
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,839
(Happiness)
Is it real?

403
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,680
I feel like I'm dreaming.

404
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,520
For me,

405
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,880
she's still like a child.

406
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,479
She said to me every night,

407
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,160
"mommy, mommy,"

408
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,079
"you'll take my hand"

409
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,520
"and sing for me,"

410
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,640
"so I can fall asleep."

411
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,199
She was so cute.

412
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,079
How did she grow up so fast?

413
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,640
She's getting married.

414
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,079
I don't know if she knows this or not.

415
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,479
My biggest wish

416
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,079
is for her

417
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,160
to be happy

418
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,959
all her life.

419
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,520
This is the most important.

420
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,040
She will, right?

421
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,520
Yes.

422
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,640
She will.

423
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:00,439
She will.

424
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,640
Dear.

425
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:10,760
Thank you.

426
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,560
Thank you for giving me

427
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,800
such a good daughter.

428
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:23,800
Thank you.

429
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:41,360
(Names for great-grandchildren)

430
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,359
The groom is nervous?

431
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,359
I'm not.

432
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,319
I just came down to see
what you are doing.

433
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,560
I watched you grow up, remember?

434
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,640
You can't hide it from me.

435
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,640
You are practicing calligraphy

436
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,560
in the middle of the night?

437
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,199
I'm not practicing.

438
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,760
I'm thinking of names

439
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,959
for my great-grandchildren.

440
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,839
Grandpa, the wedding is tomorrow.

441
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,599
Isn't it too early to give names?

442
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:12,439
No.

443
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,400
The earlier, the better.

444
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:18,599
Okay then.

445
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,599
I'm going to bed.

446
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,400
Wait.

447
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:21,680
I haven't finished yet.

448
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,040
We are the only two people

449
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:26,680
in this family.

450
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:31,439
I've always wanted you to get married.

451
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,880
It'd look magnificent.

452
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,199
You're getting married tomorrow.

453
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,560
I'm so happy.

454
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:43,640
Grandpa,

455
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:46,280
thank you for all those years.

456
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,400
I don't have any other expectations

457
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,199
of you.

458
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,040
I just hope you can

459
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,319
make our family bigger.

460
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,680
Tell Jingjing to have many children.

461
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,359
I can't do that, grandpa.

462
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,479
Why not?

463
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,880
You're going to be a husband.

464
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,680
Why are you blushing?

465
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,079
I'm not.

466
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,079
I already got five names.

467
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,079
Look.

468
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,479

Five here.

474
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,800
Have many children.

475
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:33,920
Please.

476
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,839
Thank you.

477
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:40,640
Five might be too many.

478
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,880
Put it here.

479
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:47,599
Okay.

480
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,119
Okay.

481
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,599
This way.

Here.

00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,839
Have some wedding candies.

487

Wedding candies are here.

488
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,079
Aunt, you are here.

489
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,439
Careful.

So beautiful.

00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:20,599
Isn't it pretty?

492
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,199
Yeah.

Today,

495
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,079
I'm handing my daughter to you.

496
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,079
Be good to her.

497
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,079
Rest assured, Mister, Ma'am.

498
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,880
I'll take care of her.

499
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Well.

500
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,839
Why do I feel like crying

501
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,239
on a happy day like this?

502
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,199
Sweet Su.

Today is our daughter's wedding day.

504
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
You can't cry.

505
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,400
Don't cry.

506
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,000

507

We won't.

We won't.

509
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:56,959
Don't cry.

510

Okay.

Let's go.

515
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,760
Be good.

516
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,319
See you later, mom and dad.

517
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,439
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

518
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,359
Don't hurry.

519
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,040
Here.

520
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,160
Take care of her.

521
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,000
Don't worry, Ma'am.

522
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:15,719
Take care.

523
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,560
Master.

524
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,199
Just go. I'll handle it here.

525
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,280
I'm nervous.

526
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,640
Why nervous?

527
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,319
I'm nervous too.

528
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,520
This is once in a lifetime.

529
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,959
My parents were crying.

530
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,160
Our parents.

531
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,199
Fine, Mr. Sweet words.

532
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,119
Don't worry.

533
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,520
I won't let them down.

534
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,599
I'll be good to you forever.

535
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,920
Let me check your makeup.

536
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,959
What happened?

537
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:57,359
What's wrong?

538
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:59,479
I'll have a look, Mr. Gu.

539
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,000
What happened?

540
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,839
Mr. Gu, we have a flat tire.

541
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,400
How can that happen?

542
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,880
We won't make it to the auditorium.

543
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,119
Why does something go wrong

544
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:29,280
on the first day of our marriage?

545
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,199
Don't say that.

546
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,479
Nothing will go wrong.

547
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,599
What now?

548
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,439
I have an idea.

549
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,719
What is it?

550
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,680
We're not going to the auditorium.

551
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
We just got on the road.

552
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,079
And compared to the auditorium,

553
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,839
I think Su's Martial Club

554
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,479
means more for us.

555
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,160
Think about it.

556
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,199
We have so many memories there,

557
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,959
whether it's good or bad.

558
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,119
I think it's more meaningful
to have the wedding

559
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
in the martial club than the auditorium.

560
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,040
Right?

561
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,920
How do we get back?

562
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,199
This way, please.

563
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,959
Hurry up, Chief He.

564
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,079
We're running out of time.

565
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,680
In a second.

566
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:52,839
You're here.

567
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,880
Welcome.

568
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,560
If you think

569
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:57,839
it's not lively enough there,

570
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I can play
The Moon Mirrored in the Pool.

571
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,319
I can guarantee

572
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,400
it'll be touching.

573
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:05,880
Touching?

574
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,719
Spare us.

575
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:07,439
The bride and groom are here.

576
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,680
They are here.

577
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,400
Here they come.

578
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,119
Here.

579
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,319
They are coming.

580
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,640
That's their bike.

581
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,160
Look at them two.

582
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,560
Good.

583
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,792
(Su's Martial Club)

584
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,319
(Yes. This is my wedding.)

585
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,079
(There is no banquet.)

586
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
(No auditorium.)

587
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,040
(No band.)

588
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,959
(But there are my neighbors.)

589
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,160
(And there is Su's Martial Club)

590
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,439
(that witnessed my life and my love.)

591
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:14,320
(Su's Martial Club)

592
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's so beautiful.

593
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,640
Let's begin.

594
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,479
Okay. Mr. Gu Rong. Ms. Su Jingjing.

595
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:31,680
The wedding begins now.

596
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,359
Yeah.

597
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,239
The first bow for heaven and earth.

598
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,800
First, for heaven.

599
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,160
May it grant you conjugal bliss.

600
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,079
Yeah.

601
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,680
Second, for the earth.

602
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,439
May it give you good fortune.

603
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,439
Yeah.

604
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,920
Yeah.

605
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,599
Third, for heaven and earth.

606
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,800
May it bind you two together.

607
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,959
The second bow for parents.

608
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,280
First, for their nurture.

609
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:18,599
Yeah.

610
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:22,119
Second, for their love and care.

611
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:23,599
Yeah.

612
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,839
Third, for the parents.

613
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:28,439
May the grace live on forever.

614
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,719
Yeah.

615
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,040
The third bow for each other.

616
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:36,680
First, for harmony.

617
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,280
Yeah.

618
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:45,864
♪You are my good mood♪

619
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:51,280
Second, for offspring.

620
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:54,520
Yeah.

621
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,760
Third, for everlasting.

622
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,959
Yeah.

623
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,639
The ceremony is finished. Serve the tea.

624
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,639
The tea is here.

625
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,520
Time to serve the tea.

626
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,919
Here.

627
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,600
Grandpa, your tea.

628
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,840
Take this.

629
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,639
Time for tea.

630
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,159
Grandpa,

631
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,560
your tea.

632
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,159
Yeah.

633
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,159
Don't forget your mission.

634
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,399
Okay. Good boy.

635
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,679
Okay.

636
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,120
Dad, mom, your tea.

637
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,239
Mom, your tea.

638
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:56,159
Your red envelope.

639
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,239
Take this.

640
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:03,159
A daughter is the
sweetest gift for her dad.

641
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,399
Don't cry, my girl.

642
00:35:14,399 --> 00:35:17,679
Kid, if Jingjing does anything wrong

643
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,639
in the future,

644
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,800
don't treat her badly.

645
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:23,840
Take her back to me,

646
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,479
I'll tell her, okay?

647
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:27,439
Okay.

648
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,080
He wouldn't dare.
If he treats her badly,

649
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:31,479
I'll be the first to give him a lesson.

650
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,360
Come on. Hurry up.

651
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:36,679
Now you may enter the bridal chamber.

652
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,239
There's someone making trouble.

653
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,679
Someone objects.

654
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,520
The brother.

655
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,679
Brother, your tea.

656
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,120
He's nervous.

657
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,600
That's more like it.

658
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
You have to give him a red envelope.

659
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:58,800
That's for sure.

660
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,800
But, as your brother,

661
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:02,959
I need to tell you one thing.

662
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,280
If you dare bully Jingjing,

663
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,199
I won't go easy on you.

664
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:09,639
Don't worry.

665
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,120
She's way stronger.

666
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:14,679
Funny guy.

667
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,399
Time is gold.

668
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,479
Hurry up.

669
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,320
Jingjing, Gu Rong agreed

670
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,280
to give me five great-grandchildren.

671
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:25,159
You got to complete the mission.

672
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,399
Please.

673
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,679
I didn't say that.

674
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,040
Grandpa got the names ready.

675
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,360
Hurry up.

676
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:33,320
Just go.

677
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,479
To the bridal chamber.

678
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,520
To the bridal chamber.

679
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,600
In-law.

680
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,520
Grandpa of Gu.

681
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,239
No, no.

682
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:52,239
Bridal chamber in broad daylight?
Is that proper?

683
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:55,520
I just heard someone

684
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,280
promised grandpa with five children.

685
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,199
Won't that tire you out?

686
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:08,600
It's kind of hot here.

687
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,600
You are hot?

688
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:23,024
