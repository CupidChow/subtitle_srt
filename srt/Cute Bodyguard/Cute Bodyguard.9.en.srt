your shirt too.

Don't worry about it.

You don't have to do this, ma'am.

00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,559
No.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,160
You finally got up?

34
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,040
What did you do last night?

35
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,000
I...

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,120
The color of this lipstick
looks familiar.

37
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:07,080
I'm asking you a question.

38
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,720
I had a little drink.

39
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,360
A little?

40
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,199
Really?

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,039
Su Jingjing.

42
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,800
You disappointed me so much.

43
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,639
You know you can't drink.

44
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,759
How could you do this?

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,039
Just because you know a few moves?

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,119
It's dangerous out there.

47
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,600
There are all sorts of people.

48
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,559
Thank God Gu was with you.

49
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,800
Thank you so much, Gu.

50
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,320
If it weren't you,

51
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,279
who knows

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,199
what could happen?

53
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,800
You don't know what could happen.

54
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,520
Ma'am.

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll wash it myself.

56
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm going upstairs.

57
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,800
And I want to talk to her in private.

58
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,720
Okay. Go.

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,479
It's okay.

60
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,000
Su Jingjing.

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,759
Yes.

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm telling you.

63
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,479
This is your first time,

64
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,759
and also the last time.

65
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,720
Girls can't

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,520
get themselves wasted like that

67
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,240
out there.

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,000
That's the principle.

69
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,479
Promise me

70
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,039
you'll remember it.

71
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,039
Okay, I will.

72
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,520
Go.

73
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,039
Parents just can never stop

74
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,240
worrying about their children.

75
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,039
What is it?

76
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,039
Do you remember
what happened last night?

77
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,800
What happened?

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,919
You really don't remember?

79
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,479
What about the dinner party?

80
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:03,600
I remember that part.

81
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:04,759
You saved me.

82
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,559
I'll pretend

83
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,839
that you never said those words.

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,520
Can you stop talking like this?

85
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,240
I've made myself clear.

86
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,000
You also showed your feelings.

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,640
What feelings?

88
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,480
How did I get lipstick on my shirt?

89
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,320
How can I know?

90
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
Stop pretending. You do know.

91
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,640
Fine. I admit it.

92
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,160
The color does look like

93
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,480
my lipstick.

94
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,200
But I really don't know

95
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,799
how it got there.

96
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,320
Fine.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,320
Then think about this.

98
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,959
How did you end up

99
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,480
sleeping in my closet?

100
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,040
Yeah.

101
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,440
Why did I sleep in your closet?

102
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,880
You really don't remember?

103
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,320
You kissed me.

104
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,839
I...

105
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,000
Su Jingjing.

106
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,040
What are you doing here?

107
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,839
I'm a secret figure.

108
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:26,040
Who opened this blind box?

109
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,200
What blind box?

110
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,440
I'm a blind box.

111
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:40,160
You opened this?

112
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,440
Come on. Let's go to bed.

113
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,679
I'm the sleeping beauty.
You need to kiss me.

114
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,519
You...

115
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,320
I...

116
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:56,720
Look at me.

117
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,920
Do you know who I am?

118
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,239
Of course.

119
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,760
Gu Rong.

120
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,799
You...

121
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,799
You want me to kiss you?

122
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,959
Su Jingjing.

123
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,079
Su Jingjing.

124
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,880
Be quiet.

125
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,559
I did?

126
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,720
In wine there is truth.

127
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,239
I believe it now.

128
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,720
Where are you going?

129
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,119
We're having lunch soon.

130
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:24,399
(Su's Martial Club)

131
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,640
What did I do last night?

132
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,839
Jingjing, you are up.

133
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,479
You are sober now?

134
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:34,799
Yeah.

135
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,840
You drank too much last night.

136
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,359
Have a plum juice.

137
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,479
To sober you up a little.

138
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,880
Yeah. Have one.

139
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,599
You all know I got drunk?

140
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,760
Everybody on this street

141
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,960
knows.

142
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,400
You woke everyone up.

143
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,159
Yeah.

144
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,119
That's right.

145
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,039
No one could fall sleep, right?

146
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,200
No one could.

147
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,359
It was Gu, right?

148
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,679
Yeah, Gu carried her back.

149
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,719
He barely managed.

150
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,719
Girls shouldn't drink so much.

151
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,760
Don't do that anymore, Jingjing.

152
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,679
It's bad for your health.

153
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,400
Be good.

154
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,599
Okay.

155
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,760
Gu should have stopped her.

156
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,679
Right.

157
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:06,080
Ai Mi.

158
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,880
(Where are you, Jingjing?)

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,919
(Go home now.)

160
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,039
(I'm bringing blind boxes to you.)

161
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:11,119
(Where are you?)

162
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,359
When?

163
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,599
(I'm almost there.)

164
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,359
(Go home, quick.)

165
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,280
What?

166
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,799
What blind boxes?

167
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,679
(Just come home. Don't ask.)

168
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,039
(I'm almost at your place.)

169
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,599
Jingjing.

170
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,320
Come.

171
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,359
This way.

172
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,679
What are those?

173
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,640
- No idea.
- So many.

174
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,359
Be careful.

175
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,760
Don't break anything.

176
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,280
These toys have small parts.

177
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
We got it.

178
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,239
Leave them at the door.

179
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,039
Okay.

180
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,039
Thank you

181
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,840
for doing this for me.

182
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:56,000
My business and my love life

183
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,719
are both going so well.

184
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,719
Love you.

185
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,520
Stop.

186
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,760
Calm down, Ai Mi.

187
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,760
Think about it.

188
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,559
I'm so poor.

189
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:06,599
How can I have the money

190
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,039
to buy so many blind boxes from you.

191
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,320
You don't know?

192
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,559
This is not consumption.
This is investment.

193
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,960
Mr. Gu arranged everything.

194
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,440
He bought a share of my shop,

195
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,679
and will distribute blind boxes here.

196
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,440
We're having a cooperation.

197
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,479
That's enough. Stop.

198
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,760
There's not enough space

199
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,159
for so many blind boxes in my house.

200
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,000
Ai Mi, can you return them?

201
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,039
Can you?

202
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,919
She can't. This is business investment.

203
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,640
The income will be good within no time.

204
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,559
But...

205
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,760
Where do I put all these?

206
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,919
Right.

207
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,760
I have an idea.

208
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,880
What is it?

209
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,159
What is it?

210
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,080
That's it.

211
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,000
You are a genius, Ai Mi.

212
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,719
Of course.

213
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,919
I can take the rest of them

214
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,479
in my warehouse.

215
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,239
Tell me when these run out.

216
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,719
I'll top it up anytime.

217
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,039
Isn't that great.

218
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,960
Okay. You two have fun.

219
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
I have to go now.

220
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,679
Wait.

221
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,799
I don't care what you think of it.

222
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,039
But what I said is true.

223
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,200
From today on,

224
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,119
I'll start to pursue you.

225
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,960
(No way.)

226
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,119
(Is he serious?)

227
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:39,440
(How is that possible?)

228
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,200
(This must be another prank.)

229
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,640
(Or he's pitying me and teasing me.)

230
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:45,559
(Or...)

231
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,080
I know.

232
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,840
It's because I'm the only person

233
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,760
you can touch

234
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,559
in this world.

235
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,320
So you want to try it with me, right?

236
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,640
What kind of logic is that?

237
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,880
No. It must be the case.

238
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,119
But let me tell you.

239
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,280
You don't have a choice. But I do.

240
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,320
I won't choose

241
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,440
a difficult rich guy as my boyfriend.

242
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,080
That's not why

243
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,159
I confessed.

244
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,960
What else

245
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,039
can it be?

246
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,919
That's a bug that no one can fix.

247
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,440
I...

248
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,799
How can you deny it after you kissed me?

249
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm not denying anything.

250
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,520
I was drunk. It doesn't count.

251
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,280
I'll just pretend you never said this.

252
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,400
Where are you going?

253
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,200
I'll disappear

254
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,400
so you can get your head clear.

255
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,239
I...

256
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,880
My head is clear.

257
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:43,280
(Ai Mi's Toy Shop)

258
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,359
I agree it's a shame

259
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,159
that Han Ran and you didn't work out.

260
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,760
But to be honest,

261
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,640
he's probably not the one for you.

262
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,119
You think so too?

263
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,320
Who else are we talking about?

264
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,440
Nothing.

265
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,320
I just feel

266
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,239
my feelings for senior

267
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:05,919
might not be love.

268
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,359
You two must be really awkward now.

269
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,559
You've known each other for so long.

270
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,760
I don't want that either.

271
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,880
I need to talk to him sometime.

272
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,400
Don't worry.

273
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,200
You know what he's like.

274
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,440
He'll be fine with it
as long as you are.

275
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,719
If you ask me,

276
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,840
I'd say you don't see enough guys.

277
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,280
There're only Han Ran

278
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,239
and Mr. Gu.

279
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,359
You should go out with me more.

280
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,440
So you can meet more people.

281
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Don't always stay at home.

282
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,080
Ai Mi.

283
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,799
Why are you here, Xie Te?

284
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,479
We were going to have a date today.

285
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,280
I...

286
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,679
You are in a bad mood.

287
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,559
I won't leave my friend for a boyfriend.

288
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,080
I asked him to buy

289
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,039
your favorite river snails rice noodle,

290
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,000
pig feet and beer.

291
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,559
Didn't you say

292
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,760
there's nothing

293
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,640
a bowl of rice noodle can't solve?

294
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,119
If it can't, make it two.

295
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,200
No matter what,

296
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,559
all the sadness will pass.

297
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,559
When the can is empty,

298
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,000
the sadness will be gone.

299
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,640
No. I can't drink anymore.

300
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,960
It only brings trouble.

301
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,039
What trouble?

302
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
I'll whisper.

303
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,559
I got drunk and kissed Mr. Gu.

304
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:53,640
And he confessed love to me.

305
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,640
What?

306
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,039
You kissed Mr. Gu.

307
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,200
And he confessed love to you?

308
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,760
Do you need a speaker?

309
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,559
Sorry. I was shocked

310
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,000
and couldn't control my volume.

311
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,000
But how did that happen

312
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,880
between you two?

313
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,200
Since it's no longer a secret,

314
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,919
I'll be honest with you.

315
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:26,640
Mr. Gu is pursuing Jingjing.

316
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,760
I know that.

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You know that?

318
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,719
Why didn't you tell me?

319
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:37,039
Mr. Gu won't allow it.

320
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,679
I'm your girlfriend.

321
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,960
He's just your boss.

322
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,679
Did you get that straight?

323
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,440
How can you keep it from me?

324
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,200
I know.

325
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,239
But if I irritated my boss,

326
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,520
I can't afford a girlfriend anymore.

327
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,760
Okay. Stop it.

328
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,520
Did you accept him?

329
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,400
Of course not.

330
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,039
Although I love

331
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,640
seeing an ordinary girl

332
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,400
marry into a rich family.

333
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,840
According to all the shows I watched,

334
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,599
the ordinary girl

335
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,799
has to go through a lot of obstacles.

336
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,159
As your best friend,

337
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,440
I'm willing to sacrifice

338
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,719
my chance of having a rich friend

339
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,000
and advise you to think it twice.

340
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,200
I know.

341
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,719
I know he's not serious.

342
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,359
That's not true.

343
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,080
I have to speak for him this time.

344
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,559
He did everything he can think of

345
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,080
to pursue you.

346
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,400
He never talked about it.

347
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,559
But think.

348
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,760
How is he treating you?

349
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,840
How is he treating your parents?

350
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,080
That's solid wrapping.

351
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,039
This is good stuff. Look.

352
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,880
What's happening here?

353
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,479
Gu.

354
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,440
Gu's here.

355
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Mister, ma'am.

356
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,200
These are

357
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,559
some house appliances.

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,799
Thank you.

359
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,119
You are so thoughtful.

360
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,119
You can keep these

361
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,400
when I move out.

362
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,000
Thank you for taking care of me lately.

363
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,000
Thank you.

364
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:03,719
Well...

365
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,000
Gu.

366
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,079
It's me who should say thank you.

367
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,560
You are so thoughtful.

368
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,319
Thank you so much.

369
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,359
Thank you.

370
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,040
Your mouth...

371
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,079
What about it?

372
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,239
It's a bit dry and cracked.

373
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,199
Do you want fruits?

374
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,439
I'll prepare some.

375
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,439
Have some fruits.

376
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,599
Jingjing, go wash some fruits.

377
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,479
Go.

378
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:28,880
Do it.

379
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:29,359
Me?

380
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,119
Yes. Hurry up.

381
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,199
Come. Have some fruits.

382
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:32,800
Have a seat.

383
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,520
Make yourself home.

384
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,640
Am I your real daughter?

385
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,599
Now you remember it?

386
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,719
And there's more.

387
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,560
The date in the fight club.

388
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,560
The meteor shower.

389
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,160
The restaurant.

390
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,760
The necklace.

391
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,119
Those are all for you.

392
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,280
I've never seen him...

393
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,479
This necklace

394
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,079
isn't for me?

395
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:10,439
I was moved for days.

396
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,000
I need to give it back.

397
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,479
Don't.

398
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:16,160
I bought it from Mr. Gu.

399
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,079
Just think of it as my gift for you.

400
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,640
Think of it as your gift?

401
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,479
So what should I think of

402
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,599
our relationship?

403
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,319
Relationship is a different matter.

404
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,079
Yes.

405
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,800
It might as well not exist at all.

406
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,239
Get up.

407
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,199
Ai Mi.

408
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:50,544
(Senior)

409
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,839
Su Jingjing is not home.
What do you want?

410
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:03,560
(Ask Jingjing)

411
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,800
(to bring the files
to my studio next week.)

412
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,640
(And you too.)

413
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:14,256
(Mr. Gu)

414
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,599
My phone.

415
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,839
Mr. Gu.

416
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,959
I'm with Ai Mi.

417
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,119
Su Jingjing?

418
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,599
She... She's not here.

419
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,959
No. I'll tell.

420
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:44,920
She's at Ai Mi's shop.

421
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm sorry.

422
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,359
What did he say?

423
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,760
He said he's on the way here.

424
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:17,160
I need to go.

425
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,719
I don't know how to face him.

426
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,760
Jingjing.

427
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,599
Why do I feel

428
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,959
she's more nervous now
than with Han Ran?

429
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,479
What kind of fight is that?

430
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,959
That's just couple's banter.

431
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,280
What's there to fight about?

432
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,239
I'm speechless.

433
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,079
Sorry.

434
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,520
Why are you hiding from me?

435
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,760
I'm not.

436
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,839
I was just looking for Ai Mi.

437
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,119
How important can it be

438
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:51,920
that you had to leave

439
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,319
in your pajamas without your phone?

440
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,680
It's a girl thing. You don't understand.

441
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,560
Fine. Are you finished now?

442
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,640
No. Not yet.

443
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,479
I'm still mad.

444
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,119
Let's play a game

445
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,719
as your punishment.

446
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,359
Game?

447
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,359
What game?

448
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,760
Truth or dare.

449
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,719
I'll start.

450
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,880
Tell a secret.

451
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:36,079
My secret

452
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,479
is that you are my first love.

453
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,079
It's your turn.

454
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,479
A kiss of love.

455
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,000
Ai Mi had a fight with Xie Te.

456
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,040
I still need to...

457
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,839
I swear they were fighting.

458
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,680
That's just what couples do.

459
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,719
Don't you think it's awkward
for us to stay here?

460
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,439
Are you leaving or not?

461
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,520
The other way.

462
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,160
Is there any bun left?

463
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,520
No. We're closed.

464
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:49,920
Okay.

465
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,800
Aren't you cold?

466
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,680
I'm fine.

467
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,599
Ran away in your pajamas.

468
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,400
None of your business.

469
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,520
Gu.

470
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,000
Jingjing. You are back.

471
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:00,680
Yeah.

472
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,599
Jingjing. You are back.

473
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:02,520
Yes.

474
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,640
Look at them.

475
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,719
They are quite a match.

476
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,760
Right? I think so too.

477
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,920
Han Ran just called you.

478
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,959
What did he say?

479
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,599
What did you say?

480
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,359
Calm down.

481
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:20,920
He asked you

482
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,160
to bring the files

483
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,359
to his studio.

484
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,119
Then I have to take a day off next week

485
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,160
so that I can bring the files to him.

486
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,880
I'll go with you.

487
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,160
It's none of your business.
Why would you go?

488
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,239
I'll go alone.

489
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,800
How is it not my business?

490
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
From the moment I started pursuing you,

491
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,520
your business is also mine.

492
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,800
How can you do that?

493
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,119
I need

494
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:48,520
my private space, okay?

495
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,800
Take it easy.

496
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,040
Han Ran asked me to go with you.

497
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,000
Why does he want you?

498
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,479
No idea.

499
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,560
Who cares?

500
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:18,960
(Su's Martial Club)

501
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,560
I just have to say this.

502
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,479
Why do you always dress like this

503
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,439
before seeing my senior?

504
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,920
You dressed pretty plain today.

505
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Do you know why

506
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,280
only a male peacock flaunts its tail?

507
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:52,520
Because female one doesn't look as good.

508
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,800
What are you doing?

509
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,439
I saw my grandpa.

510
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,319
You are only making it worse.

511
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,520
Let's go.

512
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,160
Thank God there are two lifts.

513
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:11,680
I know my day hasn't come yet.

514
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,479
Why is your grandpa here?

515
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,479
I don't know.

516
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,040
Probably for business.

517
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,599
Many companies in this building

518
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,920
have businesses with Gu Group.

519
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,760
What a luck.

520
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,599
You bumped into him here.

521
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,359
(Dream Star)

522
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:31,880
Let's go.

523
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,839
Senior.

524
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,160
Han Ran.

525
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,560
Jingjing.

526
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,880
Mr. Gu.

527
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:53,760
I'm not doing anything against the law.

528
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,359
Is that necessary?

529
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:01,040
I'm blocking the sun.

530
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,239
Come in.

531
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,000
Okay.

532
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,359
Senior, what is going on?

533
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,719
The lease of this studio
will expire soon.

534
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,119
I'm moving to a new place.

535
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,920
It's pretty messy because I'm packing.

536
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,119
I hope you don't mind.

537
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:33,280
Senior, your files.

538
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,280
Okay. You stay here.

539
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,319
I'll go make coffee.

540
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:41,079
Okay.

541
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,160
I'll go out for a minute.

542
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,839
Stay here.

543
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:05,760
Senior.

544
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,439
Why are you out here?

545
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,880
Half sugar, half cream, right?

546
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,439
Thank you for remembering this.

547
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,239
Of course.

548
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Senior, I have something to tell you.

549
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Go ahead.

550
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,800
At the dinner party...

551
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
I'm sorry, Jingjing.

552
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:35,319
I put you in an awkward position.

553
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,760
No.

554
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,000
It's me who didn't get this straight.

555
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,959
I've done a lot of thinking
after I went home.

556
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:45,079
I probably don't like you in that way.

557
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,079
I am just afraid.

558
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:51,319
(Soundproof walls?)

559
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,880
(Are they secret agents?)

560
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,160
Afraid? Of what?

561
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,359
After we grew up,

562
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,719
we became more and more different,

563
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:02,439
and we saw each other less and less.

564
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,560
I'm afraid that I'll lose you

565
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,439
and become the most unremarkable one

566
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:10,079
of your many fans.

567
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,839
Silly girl. How is that possible?

568
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:17,000
Why are you worried about that?

569
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,160
You've always been my model.

570
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,839
You are so excellent

571
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,439
and talented.

572
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,719
If your interest were martial arts,

573
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,239
you would be much better than me.

574
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,599
I've always been

575
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,839
like a clumsy duckling

576
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,920
following you around.

577
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:37,160
I want your approval

578
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:40,959
and to be always with you.

579
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,959
Jingjing, you are good enough.

580
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:45,640
You are a great girl.

581
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,760
No.

582
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,560
I pretended to be one.

583
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,199
I'm not great,

584
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,359
and remotely a lady.

585
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,280
Everything you like

586
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,959
and the books you wrote,

587
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,160
I can't even understand them.

588
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,000
Senior.

589
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,599
There's something
I want to come clean to you.

590
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,239
Those files

591
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,920
were all written by Gu Rong.

592
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:14,319
I can't stand western literature.

593
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,520
I knew that long ago.

594
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,199
When?

595
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,319
When you gave me the first files,

596
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,239
I noticed that.

597
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,400
The content in it

598
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,479
couldn't have been written by you.

599
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,880
There's a lot of

600
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,920
new ideas in it.

601
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:31,160
And Gu Rong is the only one

602
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,199
who can help you cheat.

603
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,359
That's why I asked him to come here.

604
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,839
So I can discuss it with him.

605
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:45,599
But Jingjing.

606
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,760
I need to apologize.

607
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
After I came back,

608
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,800
I did notice something weird about you.

609
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:55,400
I've suggested you many times.

610
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,839
But you didn't seem to get it.

611
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,319
How did you suggest?

612
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,839
When was it?

613
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,560
It doesn't matter now.

614
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,640
Senior, you can't suggest me.

615
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,880
You have to tell me.

616
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,439
Otherwise I won't understand.

617
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,479
You need to know

618
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,319
that we've got different levels of IQ.

619
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,520
Jingjing, we grew up together.

620
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,719
I don't have a biological sister.

621
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,119
But for me,

622
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,920
you are my real sister.

623
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
No matter where I am and what I do,

624
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,599
I would care about it

625
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,239
as long as it's about you.

626
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,079
Really?

627
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,319
I swear.

628
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
You won't forget me

629
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,680
even if you have a wife?

630
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,719
No.

631
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,760
I'm joking.

632
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,760
How can I be that annoying?

633
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,680
Your wife should come first.

634
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:52,199
I'm really happy to see you like this.

635
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Me too.

636
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,000
It feels so much better to be myself.

637
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,280
I'm here to see if the coffee is ready.

638
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:34,719
Mr. Gu.

639
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,680
These files you sorted out

640
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,239
really helped me a lot.

641
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,239
But the things you wrote

642
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,520
have nothing to do with your profession.

643
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,680
You fished out the good points

644
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,560
and provided a lot of unique ideas.

645
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,760
I just looked around on Vascoda.

646
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:54,959
What was that?

647
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,959
An interdisciplinary website.

648
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,719
I saw you mentioned Laxness.

649
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,160
Everybody says he's a radical writer.

650
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,760
But you seem to disagree.

651
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,199
He's radical on the surface.

652
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,640
But there's a positive pessimism

653
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,920
in all his works.

654
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,719
Keep going, Mr. Gu.

655
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,119
Enlighten me.

656
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,880
I just looked around on the website.

657
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,640
The chairman specified

658
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:25,119
that we should look carefully
on the 12th floor.

659
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:25,640
Got it.

660
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:26,400
(Dream Star)
Got it.

661
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,079
No matter what, thank you very much

662
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,400
for providing so many ideas

663
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,920
for my next book.

664
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,079
It's okay.

665
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,640
We just did some printing.

666
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:41,839
We're leaving then.

667
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:42,839
Jingjing.

668
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:45,439
Don't compromise for anyone.

669
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,839
Do whatever you want to do.

670
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,079
As your brother,

671
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,839
I'll support you unconditionally.

672
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,680
Okay, I will.

673
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:54,560
But as your family,

674
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,640
I have to be the one

675
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,760
to assess your future boyfriend.

676
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,800
Why?

677
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,920
Why is it you to assess me?

678
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:07,439
Have you finished your book?

679
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,439
You don't have anything else to do?

680
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,600
Let's just go. Don't be childish.

681
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,639
Bye, senior.

682
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:17,959
(Dream Star)

683
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:18,959
This is my resume.

684
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,000
Okay. Let me see.

685
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,919
Did you hear him?

686
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,840
How can he say that?

687
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,760
He's not even grateful to me.

688
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,399
Stop it.

689
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,040
How do you know he's talking about you?

690
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,560
Come.

691
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:43,840
Go check.

692
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:45,120
Okay.

693
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,280
Why are they here?

694
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,159
Did they see us?

695
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,639
No way.

696
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,439
How could they

697
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,719
when I dressed like that?

698
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,320
What now?

699
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,840
We can't use the stairs.

700
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,280
This is the 12th floor.

701
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,639
It's just the 12th floor.

702
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,040
Thankfully, we are going down.

703
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,399
Okay.

704
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,000
What did you two

705
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,800
talk about at the counter?

706
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,639
I thought you aren't interested.

707
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,120
I am now.

708
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,120
I'm telling you.

709
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,919
Stop looking down at me.

710
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,000
That's my privacy.

711
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,159
I won't tell you.

712
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,600
Childish.

713
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,600
Childish.

714
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,560
Now we're equal.

715
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,560
You can tell me now.

716
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,399
Let's take the stairs.

717
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,879
You go up. I'll go down. Quick.

718
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:54,560
Okay.

719
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,959
Let's go.

720
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:21,800
Why are you staring at me?

721
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,520
You look exactly the same

722
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,760
as that night.

723
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:26,760
What?

724
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,199
In my closet.

725
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,040
It was also cramped.

726
00:36:33,919 --> 00:36:35,080
You were blushing,

727
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,040
with your pink lips

728
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:39,040
and flashing eyes.

729
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:41,959
We were so close.

730
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,120
And you...

731
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:44,719
Enough.

732
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,159
Stop it.

733
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,360
Let's get out of here first.

734
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,320
Where can we go
with them running around?

735
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,439
They are everywhere.

736
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,399
Let's go back to the building.

737
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,080
We'll see what to do next.

738
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,719
I'll ask Xie Te to pick us up.

739
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:15,479
Okay.

740
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,000
(Sorry! The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.)

741
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,120
How can he not be there when I need him?

742
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,199
You have to give me an answer today.

743
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:23,399
Do you hear me?

744
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,639
What kind of quality is this?

745
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,080
Look at it.

746
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,760
Maybe I should go confront them.

747
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,600
And you can leave
when they are busy with me.

748
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:28,399
No.

749
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,000
You are outnumbered.

750
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,040
We should stick together.

751
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:33,560
Ask your manager to see me.

752
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,439
But our schedule today...

753
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:35,719
Right now.

754
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,399
Ask your manager to show up.

755
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:38,000
What kind of attitude was that?

756
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,760
We can help you

757
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,679
if there's any problem.

758
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,040
But our schedule today

759
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:41,679
is already set.

760
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,399
Look at this dress.

761
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:43,959
Look at that.

762
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,840
I'm so sorry.

763
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,199
How do I take wedding photos with that?

764
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,239
I'm asking you a question.

765
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,800
You have to give me an answer.

766
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:51,840
I don't care how you do it.

767
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,360
What is this?

768
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,080
We came here

769
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,479
to have a nice set of photos.

770
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,679
And this is what you provide

771
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:57,560
to your customers?
