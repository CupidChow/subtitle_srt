I'm talking to my grandson.

176
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,119
Please be quiet.

177
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,880
You are right, mister.

178
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,559
I'm his bodyguard.

179
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,159
If you go hard on him,

180
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,520
I'll have to protect him.

181
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:13,440
Come.

182
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,280
I don't care if you have
no dignity, Gu Rong.

183
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,039
But I do.

184
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:22,280
Come back if you are still sensible.

185
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,599
Otherwise,

186
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,640
you know what will happen.

187
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:33,679
You'd better give up, grandpa.

188
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,679
I won't come back

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,479
before you understand me.

190
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,799
Tell you what.

191
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,159
You were really like
a heroine back there.

192
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,280
Of course.

What's with your face?

198
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,719
Why did you put on so much makeup?

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,119
And your hair?

200
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,799
Tell me. What did you do?

201
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,080
Mom.

202
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,640
We went to...

203
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:36,479
No.

204
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,400
Nothing.

205
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:41,280
Let's go.

206
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,640
You think I'm so easy to fool?

207
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,359
So ridiculous.

208
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,320
I've imagined it so many times.

209
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:08,679
How did we...?

210
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,719
How did that even happen?

211
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,280
Pick the photos.

212
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,760
The photographer just sent me.

213
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,719
What?

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,280
The whole thing is absurd enough.

215
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,400
And you want to keep the photos?

216
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,280
How is it absurd?

217
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,719
Look. You are beautiful in them.

218
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,440
I like this one.

219
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:37,760
Look.

220
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,119
Does it matter if you like it?

221
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,280
Just delete them.

222
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,599
Wait.

223
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,359
Did you notice something weird

224
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,359
about these photos?

225
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,880
What?

226
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,880
There's something missing. Look.

227
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,159
What's missing?

228
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,520
This.

229
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,320
Jingjing, Gu, come have some fruits.

230
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,559
I don't want it.

231
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,840
Jingjing.

232
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,520
Gu.

233
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,080
Have some fruits.

234
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,520
It cools you down.

235
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,919
Well...

236
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Jingjing... She went upstairs.

237
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,960
She said she's tired.

238
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,599
Yeah. She is.

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,599
Jingjing.

240
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,479
You don't want fruits?

241
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,559
Okay. Just go upstairs.

242
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:39,760
Just go.

243
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,840
Yeah.

244
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,880
Today must be my lucky day.

245
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,880
(It's bad enough)

246
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,559
(that I took wedding photos.)

247
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,599

251
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,479
(you would have punched him)

in the living room or bedroom?)

I don't have vanity.

260
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,440
It's not a matter of vanity. You know?

261
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:54,080
They all say
equal social status is vital.

262
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,080
It must have a point.

263
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,719
That's why people always say that.

264
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,760
Right, Sweet Su?

265
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,479

Sweet Su.

268
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,479
What is it?

269
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,440
You didn't hear anything I said?

270
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,880
I was just taking to myself?

271
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,039
Didn't you...?

272
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,239
Didn't you notice
there's something bothering me?

273
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,239
Do you know I can't sleep?

274
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,719
Didn't you notice
there's something bothering me?

275
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,719
Don't scream, dear.

276
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,159
Tell you what.

277
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,400
You are not as nice to me
as when we were young.

278
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,000
When we were young,

279
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,840
you said I excited you.

280
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,840
Now I only make you sleepy.

281
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,559
Just go to sleep, dear.

282
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,479
I have worries.

283
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,440
How can I sleep?

284
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,719
Be good. Don't scream.

285
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,559
How can you even fall asleep?

286
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,320
Just sleep.

287
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:50,239
And you even snored.

288
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:51,880
I'm telling you...

289
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,799
Come here.

290
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,479
I'm not...

291
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,280
Just come in.

292
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:55,760
You...

293
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,599
Hold my hand.

294
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,159

(Su's Martial Club)

296
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,160
One, two, three, four...

297
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,040
Come on. Run with me.

298
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:11,800
Get ready for practice.

299
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,760
Five minutes every day.

300
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,239
One, two, three, four.

301
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,520
Su Jingjing.

302
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,359
Why are you so down today?

303
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,439
Look at me. Then look at yourself.

304
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,479
You are not like my daughter at all.

305
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,280
You have no spirit.

306
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,040
You are up.

307
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,280
Dear.

308
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,680
What's wrong with your makeup today?

309
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,680
It makes you look so tired.

310
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,119
I am. I didn't sleep well.

311
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,439
Gu, you're here.

312
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,760
Gu, you're up.

313
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,479
Good morning.

314
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,520
What's wrong?

315
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,760
You don't look good either, Gu.

316
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,479
I stayed up for work last night.

317
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,959
I didn't rest well.

318
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,920
What's up with the three of you?

319
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,920
That's enough talk.

320
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,839
I got up late

321
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:05,760
and didn't prepare breakfast.

322
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,680
Go buy some buns

323
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
on the street.

324
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes, sir.

325
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,000
Hurry up.

326
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,839
Mister.

327
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,040
I'll go with you.

328
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,959
I want some fresh air.

329
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,359
Good. Let's go.

330
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,439
One, two, three, four.

331
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,280
Jingjing.

332
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
What filling do you want?

333
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,640
Shrimp and egg.

334
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:30,839
Jingjing.

335
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,119
Come to the kitchen

336
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,680
and help me out.

337
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,280
Come.

338
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,719
Jingjing.

339
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,680
You should talk to me
if there's anything on your mind.

340
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,959
There's none.

341
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,400
What about you and Gu?

342
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,479
When are you going to tell me

343
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,719
about you two?

344
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,719
I can't resist anymore.

345
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,640
What about us?

346
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
What about you two?

347
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:29,760
Last night in the corridor, you...

348
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,239
You saw us?

349
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:39,280
I saw pretty much

350
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,719
everything.

351
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,959
It was just an accident.

352
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,160
Accident?

353
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,719
I've lived for long.

354
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:52,119
Why didn't it ever happen to me?

355
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,760
How does he feel about you?

356
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,400
How would I know?

357
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,680
Our range hood is pretty good.

358
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
It's new.

359
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,800
Ever since we had this,

360
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,199
I can barely smell a thing.

361
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,079
Look how good it looks.

362
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,719
It works well too.

363
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,760
Come here. I want to talk.

364
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:25,959
Maybe,

365
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,199
when he comes back,

366
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,880
I will talk with him.

367
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,880
What's there to talk about?

368
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,800
Don't make it worse.

369
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,800
How am I making it worse?

370
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,479
You are my daughter.

371
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,920
Will I ever lie to you?

372
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:42,839
I'm telling you.

373
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:47,000
I really like this boy.

374
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,280
He's handsome,
and he has a good background.

375
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:55,079
Most of all, he's a good person.

376
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,040
Look what he got me.

377
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,160
Integrated cooking system.

378
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,920
And these here.

379
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,359
I can make different dishes
at the same time.

380
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:04,479
And there's no smoke.

381
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:05,520
It's so nice

382
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:06,880
and convenient.

383
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,359
He's a thoughtful kid.

384
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:12,560
The only thing

385
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,119
is that he spent money extravagantly.

386
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,479
The only thing?

387
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,119
Do you remember

388
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,760
when he just came here?

389
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,119
He was so annoying.

390
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,160
Whoever marries him

391
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,800
will be so miserable.

392
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,800
Don't speak so badly of him.

393
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,439
Why did you kiss him then?

394
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
I kissed him?

395
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,880
He kissed... me.

396
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,400
Playing chess?

397
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,280
Right.

398
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,560
Buns here.

399
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:47,920
Louder.

400
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,640
Buns.

401
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,640
Playing chess again?

402
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,199
Su.

403
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:54,760
The cucumber is good.

404
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,319
You come out for a walk, Su?

405
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,880
Keep your eyes on your job.

406
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,199
Don't mess his hair.

407
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,599
Mister.

408
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,319
I have a question.

409
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,520
Say it.

410
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,160
How do you know

411
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,839
if a girl

412
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,040
likes you?

413
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,000
Well.

414
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,000
Why don't you just ask her?

415
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,439
What if she just won't admit it?

416
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,199
Won't admit?

417
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:29,800
Su, you're here.

418
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,920
The buns are fresh-made.

419
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,160
- Let me see.
- Want some?

420
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,599
Let me see.

421
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,560
It looks so good.

422
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:42,319
As good as you.

423
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,640
Give me six buns with fresh meat.

424
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,880
And two with shrimp and egg.

425
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,640
Okay.

426
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,439
Su, you are better and better

427
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,880
with sweet talk.

428
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,119
I'll give you two more

429
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:53,400
just for that.

430
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,640
Ten buns it is.

431
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,800
You can't.

432
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:56,719
Why?

433
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,599
Let me tell you.

434
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,479
If Caixia finds out

435
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,560
that you give me two buns for free,

436
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,479
she will kill me.

437
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,920
She gets jealous.

438
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,199
I can't stand you.

439
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,319
Do you have to tell everyone
you're so happy with your marriage?

440
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,119
Really?

441
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,880
I'd be glad to tell everyone every day.

442
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,760
It's love for us.

443
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,199
Right. Gu.

444
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,800
I think you can

445
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,560
do whatever it takes

446
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,520
to make her realize her feelings,

447
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,280
to make her like you.

448
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,239
To make her like me?

449
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,280
Yeah. You can...

450
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,959
Your phone's ringing.

451
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Just scan this code.

452
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:44,079
I heard that grandpa went to
the family Su yesterday?

453
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,079
He did.

454
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,040
What do you plan to do next?

455
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,880
You can't live there anymore.

456
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,719
Let it be.

457
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,520
Saving me the trouble of hiding around.

458
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,800
So you'll keep

459
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,959
living there?

460
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,680
Of course.

461
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,160
I know grandpa quite well.

462
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,760
You'd better come home soon.

463
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,239
(He won't give up.)

464
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,079
Okay. That's it.

465
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:13,800
I'll tell you

466
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,319
if there's anything.

467
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:17,072
(Bai Anrou)

468
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:19,599
Su.

469
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:22,079
Who's that handsome boy?

470
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,160
Our tenant.

471
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,680
Tenant?

472
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,920
He would be a good match

473
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,359
for Jingjing.

474
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,079
He can't be.

475
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,760
He already has a girl.

476
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,400
Really?

477
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,160
Yeah. He asked me for advice.

478
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,520
I was just telling him

479
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,719
what to do with his girl.

480
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,160
Be careful with that.

481
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,359
Okay. Here.

482
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,040
Okay.

483
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,040
You're done? Let's go then.

484
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:46,760
Let's go.

485
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,319
We're off, Zhang.

486
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:48,959
Bye, Su.

487
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,479
That should work well.

488
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,959
Just tell her frankly.

489
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,880
Make her realize her feelings,

490
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,800
and then make her like you.

491
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,640
Will it work?

492
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,880
Of course.

493
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,079
Just listen to me.

494
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,959
I've tried that.

495
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:02,760
That's how I won over

496
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,319
my wife.

497
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,880
What are you looking at?

498
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,040
He hid in Su's Martial Club for so long.

499
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,760
And you didn't even notice a thing?

500
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Well. Chairman. This young man...

501
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,560
How can you let him stay there

502
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,119
for so long?

503
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,280
Chairman. Please listen to me.

504
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,160
Just go.

505
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,959
Let's go.

506
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Anrou. Have a seat.

507
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:05,359
Anrou, you knew that he's staying there,

508
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,920
didn't you?

509
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,800
That girl called Su Jingjing...

510
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
She's just his bodyguard.

511
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,640
Is it really?

512
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,000
You must have noticed her too.

513
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,199
She's not just

514
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,319
an employee, right?

515
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,280
Mr. Gu is just acting like a child.

516
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,640
He saw too much of the best,

517
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,800
and now wants to try the ordinary.

518
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,560
How much do you know about her?

519
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,239
I did some research.

520
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,239
She didn't graduate
from the best schools.

521
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,079
She's not really capable.

522
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,319
And she was unemployed

523
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:51,319
before working for him.

524
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,119
Anrou.

525
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,800
Ever since you came here
after graduation,

526
00:26:57,439 --> 00:27:00,479
I've been trying to make you

527
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:04,400
Gu Rong's future helping hand.

528
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,920
Are you willing

529
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,479
to let him stay there

530
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,920
and idle through life?

531
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,599
I understand, Chairman.

532
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,000
I'll try to convince him

533
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,760
to come back.

534
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:22,000
Good. I can always count on you.

535
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,800
Look at that.

536
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,000
You see them?

537
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:37,239
Their arms are around each other.

538
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,520
You have to be careful.

539
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:49,616
(Su's Martial Club)

540
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,319
I think he has a point.

541
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,000
But what should I do

542
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,160
to make her admit that she likes me?

543
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,920
Mr. Gu.

544
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:07,280
Don't come to me for advice anymore.

545
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,239
My legs still hurt

546
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,880
from the squatting last time.

547
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,800
That's your fault for not working out.

548
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,119
Why didn't you give me better ideas?

549
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,479
I tried.

550
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,680
But I lack experience too.

551
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Just tell me.

552
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,880
What is it like with Ai Mi?

553
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,839
They are friends.

554
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,000
They might have something in common.

555
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,359
It's so personal.

556
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,640
How can I talk about that?

557
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:38,439
Just tell me.

558
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,280
When does she care about you the most?

559
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,199
Care about me the most?

560
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,959
It must be

561
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,079
when I look at other girls.

562
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,959
She always gets so mad.

563
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,560
Yes. She cares about me the most

564
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,719
when she's jealous.

565
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,520
But,

566
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,359
I really like it when she's like that.

567
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,479
Do all girls get jealous?

568
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,119
I guess so.

569
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,640
If Su Jingjing sees you

570
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,400
being too close

571
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:30,839
with another girl,

572
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:33,880
she'll definitely feel bad.

573
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,119
Really?

574
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,319
If she really likes you.

575
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,400
After all,

576
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,599
there's no place for a third person

577
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,719
in the world of love.

578
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,719
I got it. Go contact
that school mate of mine

579
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,640
when I was studying in UK.

580
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,400
School mate?

581
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,760
That one

582
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,439
who always wanted to see me

583
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:00,319
saying that she wants cooperation.

584
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,439
Qin... Qin Xiaoxiao.

585
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,520
Yeah. That one.

586
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,640
Hurry up and ask her out.

587
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,000
Now?

588
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,599
She'll help for free.

589
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,520
I need to make Su Jingjing
see those girls after me.

590
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,359
Otherwise she won't know
how popular I am.

591
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,719
Get the car. Bring Su Jingjing. Now.

592
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,280
Let's go.

593
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:16,680
Okay.

594
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,000
Now.

595
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,439
That's brilliant.

596
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,880
Mr. Gu.

597
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:36,199
Qin Xiaoxiao asked you so many times

598
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,040
to talk about the investment
on the Cultural Park.

599
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,680
You finally agreed to see her.

600
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,280
The Cultural Park is going strong

601
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,199
in the last couple of years.

602
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,839
And out of politeness,

603
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,920
I can't reject a girl all the time.

604
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,119
Mr. Gu.

605
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,079
But I think this is just a cover-up.

606
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,479
I think she's using this

607
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:07,280
to get close to you.

608
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,800
I think you're overthinking, Xie Te.

609
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,359
Maybe she just wants to find someone

610
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,000
who would spend money willingly.

611
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,239
(Is she mad?)

612
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,680
(Is she upset about
me seeing another girl?)

613
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,920
How can you say that about her?

614
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,760
You've never met her.

615
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,439
You can't slander her like that.

616
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:33,880
Mr. Gu, I'm not slandering her.

617
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,760
I'm slandering you.

618
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,319
(Slandering me?)

619
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,959
(It's so obvious.)

620
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,199
(And she still won't
admit she likes me?)

621
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,839
To be honest, we were on good terms

622
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,199
when I was studying in UK.

623
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:52,359
I should contact her more

624
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:53,920
after coming back.

625
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,839
Xie Te, drive faster.

626
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,760
I can't wait to see Xiaoxiao.

627
00:31:58,599 --> 00:31:59,239
Okay.

628
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,280
Xiaoxiao...

629
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,880
We have to be more careful

630
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,760
with the other projects.

631
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,800
Long time no see.

632
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:41,479
Oh, you still have haphephobia?

633
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,959
Yeah. Sorry about that. Xiaoxiao.

634
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,079
But now I find you

635
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:49,920
a little different from before.

636
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,160
Different?

637
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,439
How?

638
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,160
I'm always like this.

639
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,719
We were on good terms, weren't we?

640
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,160
This is...

641
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,719
My bodyguard.

642
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,319
Su Jingjing.

643
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:13,520
So this is the Cultural Park
you told me about?

644
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,359
How much do you need?

645
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,199
Easy, rich guy.

646
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:22,040
You're not going to ask
how we make money?

647
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
Of course I am.

648
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
Why would I come here otherwise?

649
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:27,319
Right?

650
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
This way.

651
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,640
Let's go.

652
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,439
Mr. Gu.

653
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,680
You are not acting

654
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,280
like yourself today. It's weird.

655
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,479
I don't need you to remind me. Let's go.

656
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,520
Told you she just wants money.

657
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,359
Of course she'll want to see you.

658
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:57,280
There are many restaurants and cafes.

659
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,040
A lot of artists

660
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:00,479
will open their studios here.

661
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,119
We've got everything

662
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,239
in this park.

663
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,119
And...

664
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:06,680
What's this?

665
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,479
Is this your main feature?

666
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,040
Yeah. Don't underestimate it.

667
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:15,800
This wall is very popular now.

668
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,919
A lot of couples and friends

669
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,080
come here in line to
leave their handprints.

670
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:20,919
I...

671
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,679
I saved a spot for you.

672
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,719
I want to do this with you.

673
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,560
Let's do it together.

674
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Okay.

675
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:42,840
Okay.

676
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,879
Sorry. It's my fault.

677
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,879
There's not enough space

678
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,560
for three handprints

679
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:09,840
in the heart.

680
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,479
It's okay.

681
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,159
Jingjing can just do it on mine.

682
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:16,560
Come on.

683
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,439
Come on.

684
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,280
No. That won't look so good.

685
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,040
I can just do it here.

686
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,600
Mr. Gu, are you hungry?

687
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,719
Let's finish quick and go have lunch.

688
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,760
Oh. I prepared your favorite lunch

689
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:34,479
in our private club.

690
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,600
Let's go.

691
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,239
Okay.

692
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,040
I'm sorry.

693
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:06,560
I didn't know Miss Su would be here too.

694
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,600
So I didn't prepare her lunch.

695
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:12,000
It's okay.
I can have lunch later at home.

696
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,719
I'm sorry.

697
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:17,239
Who was it asking to have lunch

698
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,919
at the graffiti wall.

699
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,800
It's fine. She's my bodyguard.

700
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,560
We can share my lunch.

701
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,479
I knew you would be here.

702
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,159
So I made steak

703
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,600
and seafood fried rice for you.

704
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,239
Try it.

705
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,520
Go ahead.

706
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,520
How is it? Does it taste familiar?

707
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,800
It does taste familiar.

708
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:50,360
I knew you would love this fried rice.

709
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,800
That's why

710
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,239
I always think of you

711
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,919
when I taste it.

712
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,360
Before I came back from UK,

713
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,919
I went to learn the recipe

714
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,879
with a fortune.

715
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:03,080
Is it good?

716
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,919
Have this.

717
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:23,320
This is so good.

718
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,320
You have a recipe?

719
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,840
It tastes great.

720
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,879
Can you tell me the recipe?

721
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
Miss Su.

722
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,840
You want the recipe

723
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,159
so you can make it for him?
