=Episode 15=
(I will go wherever you go)

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,160
Jingjing has to move because of him.

29
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,919
So, he deserved to lend her a house.

30
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,959
I know. I won't tell her.

31
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:03,319
Mr. Gu is so affectionate.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
Jingjing is here. I have to go.

33
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:18,000
Boss, I want 100 blind boxes.

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,919
You can only get two boxes.

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,240
So, you want to trick your boyfriend

36
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,199
aligning with his grandpa?

37
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,800
Oh, my god.

38
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,360
The twist comes so seriously.

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,320
Wasn't it the cliche love story

40
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,360
that he wanted to
buy you off a few days ago?

41
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,360
And now it turns into a spy show?

42
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,639
Every rich kid has a family feud.

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,600
It's standard.

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,119
Don't tell Xie Te about this.

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,240
I got it.

46
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,199
What if Gu Rong finds out?

47
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
How could I get three

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,399
from the same series in a row?

49
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,679
What rotten luck.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,039
I don't know either.
Resign myself to my fate.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,800
Feuds of rich families
are too complicated.

52
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,520
You owe me 50 yuan.

53
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,600
Come. This way. Almost there.

54
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,000
Well, are we going wrong?

55
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,520
Not wrong.

56
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,679
The last property we will check today

57
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,720
is in this garden.

58
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,240
But for here,

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,919
compared to the properties
we took a look before,

60
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,479
whether for its equipment
and environment,

61
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,000
it's much better.

62
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:59,639
Since the properties we checked
are already expensive,

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,679
we can't afford
the rent here definitely.

64
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,119
What about giving it up?

65
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,639
It's a waste of time if we have a look.

66
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,360
Ms. Su, please don't go.

67
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,240
Let me tell you.

68
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:10,360
The property is a steal.

69
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,000
And the owner is anxious to rent.

70
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,759
The rent is low and
the house is in good condition.

71
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,399
If you really want a great apartment,

72
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,880
believe me, you must check it out.

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,279
Right. We have come this way.

74
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:18,920
Let's check it out.

75
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,279
We are already here
and checking is free.

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,239
Right.

77
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,079
Alright.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,320
This way.

79
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,079
Ms. Su.

80
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:33,079
The apartment enjoys
clearly-established ownership.

81
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,239
And it's rented for the first time.

82
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,799
Look, the interior decoration.

83
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,519
Smart curtains. Smart furniture, right?

84
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,399
The bathroom

85
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,839
boasts a big bathtub.

86
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,880
It all owns
constant temperature and humidity.

87
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,119
The most important point

88
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,640
is that most of the furniture

89
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,160
can be controlled by smartphones.

90
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:47,760
It almost rivals

91
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,079
the model house with smart furniture.

92
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,559
This is the bedroom.

93
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,320
You can go feel it.

94
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,320
The mattresses are all
imported from Europe.

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,079
The owner

96
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,880
must be particular about
the sleep environment.

97
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,679
Yeah.

98
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,559
Jingjing.

99
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,200
What do you think of the apartment?

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,119
Such a great apartment.

101
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,600
But it shares
the same rent as my old house.

102
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,200
There must be something wrong
with the owner.

103
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,000
Nothing wrong for sure.

104
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,679
Let me tell you, the wealthy

105
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,959
don't care about the minor rent.

106
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,239
As long as your family of three

107
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,559
take good care of the apartment,

108
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,640
it will be good.

109
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,959
What about this? If you sign today,

110
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,320
I will cut my brokerage.

111
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,000
I need to discuss it with my parents.

112
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,880
Ms. Su, no need to discuss this.

113
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,279
If you sign today,

114
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,640
I will give you
an extra cleaning service.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,160
I think it is a good deal.

116
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,959
Lend me your phone.
I want to call my parents.

117
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,464
(WiFi of Mr. Gu's apartment)

118
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:13,359
Mr. Gu, the apartment is yours?

119
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,600
R-Right.

120
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,799
Jingjing, I was wrong.

121
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,320
The apartment is mine.

122
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,760
It's nothing to do with my grandpa.

123
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,959
I should tell you directly.

124
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:34,959
But I know

125
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:36,760
you won't take it for sure.

126
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,119
You have to move because of me.

127
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,559
I have to do something anyway, right?

128
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,119
Jingjing.

129
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,119
Jingjing.

130
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:47,160
Jingjing.

131
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,359
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,720
I shouldn't hide it
from you with the broker.

133
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,959
Don't be mad at me.

134
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,399
He likes you.

135
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,079
He feels ashamed
if you are forced to move out.

136
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,799
So, make use of it.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,440
(Never mind. I will have a try.)

138
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,480
(Count it as I am
rescuing a problem child.)

139
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,239
Gu Rong.

140
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:12,000
Recently, I do feel upset

141
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,640
because I have to move.

142
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,320
But I always think

143
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,519
your grandpa actually
is not that stubborn.

144
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,320
Maybe you just need

145
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,040
to chat away.

146
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,359
You are family.

147
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,880
I hope from my heart

148
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,200
you won't have a strained relationship.

149
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,559
There is a saying in TVB's shows.

150
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,600
"A family should

151
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,079
stay together merrily."

152
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,559
Also, as we are together now,

153
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,480
whatever difficulties we may encounter,

154
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,359
I want to face them with you,

155
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:44,359
instead of
seeing you making effort alone.

156
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,119
And...

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,760
And what?

158
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,079
I am your bodyguard.

159
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,559
No matter what decisions you make,

160
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,200
I will be on your side.

161
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:56,959
Mr. Gu.

162
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,799
Don't you want to hug your girlfriend?

163
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,720
My bodyguard girlfriend.

164
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,079
Please promise me.

165
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,559
Stay by my side

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,160
wherever I go, okay?

167
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,160
Okay.

168
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
I'm freezing. I'm freezing.

169
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,880
It's cold.

170
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,959
So happy.

171
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:33,008
(Su's Martial Club)

172
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:57,200
Mister, what are you doing?

173
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,840
Gu, it's late at night.
Haven't you gone to bed?

174
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,000
I can't fall asleep.
I'm going to take a glass of water.

175
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,320
Me, too.

176
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,559
I wanted to check

177
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,599
where I can fix.

178
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,000
So, I repaired the light.

179
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:16,400
In the past, I always thought
I had a lot of time.

180
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,760
I didn't spare the time to mend.

181
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,320
And suddenly, I have to move.

182
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,520
I feel I don't have much time now.

183
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,719
So, repair them as soon as possible.

184
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,559
How do I put it?

185
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,280
"Finish what has been started."

186
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,719
Hand over the intact house
to the next owner.

187
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,559
Then, I won't regret it
in the future when I recall.

188
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:48,679
Let's drink some.

189
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay.

190
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:57,359
Drink some. Drink some.

191
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,840
Good wine. Good wine.

192
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,840
Gu, don't be too anxious.

193
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:20,679
As we move suddenly,

194
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,479
your auntie and I are not worried.

195
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,599
It's not like the past.

196
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,359
It's not a rare thing for us

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,440
to move and change our residency.

198
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,520
What we worry about the most

199
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,039
are you and Jingjing.

200
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,520
Jingjing likes you so much.

201
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,520
She treats you well

202
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,200
with wholeheartedness.

203
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,840
We can tell.

204
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,599
I don't know what the contradiction is

205
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,840
between you and your grandfather.

206
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,200
I don't want to know it either.

207
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,840
But as a man,

208
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,760
you must face something.

209
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:04,919
Otherwise, in the future,

210
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,559
you can't face Jingjing or your grandpa.

211
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,840
Right?

212
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,039
Mister.

213
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,320
Gu, I know what you are thinking.

214
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,719
I got it.

215
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,679
You can't control

216
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,559
the love.

217
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,599
But,

218
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,599
your auntie and I

219
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,479
only have this precious daughter.

220
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,440
As parents,

221
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,919
we only hope our kid

222
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:46,479
can be safe and sound.

223
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,159
You can understand it, can't you?

224
00:11:57,719 --> 00:12:00,039
Mister, please rest assured.

225
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,000
I will definitely give you all

226
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,320
a satisfactory answer.

227
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:10,520
Great. Great. I only want this word.

228
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,719
Cheers.

229
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,599
Let me tell you.

230
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,679
I like you from my heart.

231
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,359
Sweet Su.

232
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:24,960
Honestly...

233
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,080
Don't move.

234
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,760
You...Sweet Su.

235
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,559
Your hand

236
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,440
is on Gu's shoulder.

237
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,440
Haphephobia is cured completely.

238
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:48,239
Yes.

239
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,719
Come on. Come on. Let me hug you.

240
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,159
It's cured completely. It's real.

241
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,200
Let me hug you as well.

242
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,159
Cured thoroughly.

243
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,840
Let me hug you as well.

244
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,119
Fantastic.

245
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,119
Fantastic.

246
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:04,400
Come on. Come on.

247
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,799
We have to drink for this.

248
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,239
Cheers.

249
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:07,599
Wait.

250
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,119
Sweet Su, you don't sleep at night

251
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,440
but drink here.

252
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,080
Drink medical wine?

253
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,599
Don't care about your health?

254
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,000
No. No.

255
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:20,919
I-I couldn't fall asleep.

256
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,320
I wanted to check
whether there is something

257
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,440
to mend.

258
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:24,320
I also repaired the light.

259
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,679
Let me tell you, he...

260
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,799
Why do you come here

261
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:29,679
instead of sleeping at night?

262
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,359
I...

263
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,159
I want to check

264
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
if I can unclog

265
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,679
t-t-the chimney.

266
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,239
Or, the house will
be handed over like this.

267
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,000
The next owner will say

268
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,679
we don't cherish the house, right?

269
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,200
Mister, ma'am,

270
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,919
let me help you fix them.

271
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,719
Take it as my gratitude to you

272
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,280
because you cured my Haphephobia.

273
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,719
Gu, don't thank us.

274
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,559
The power of love is tremendous.

275
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,359
Love can cure all.

276
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,479
Where are they?

277
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,880
Jingjing, Gu, come down
to have breakfast.

278
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:15,799
Coming.

281
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,359
Hello, mister.

282
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,679
I am the renter of
Su's Martial Club at the corner.

283
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,520
Did Jingjing go to your store
some days ago?

284
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:55,599
(It's Su's Martial Club.
May I have your name?)

285
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,200
I am Gu Rong, her boyfriend.

286
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,479
(Gu Rong. It's you.)

287
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,400
(Yes. Jingjing came here in a raincoat.)

288
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,440
(She came with Mr. Gu.)

289
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,599
(Mr. Gu is your grandfather.)

290
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,320
(Right?)

291
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,119
Thank you.

292
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:14,840
(It's alright.)

293
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,359
Miss Bai.

(Han Ran)

295
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,320
Gu Rong. Are you here for Chairman?

296
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,760
No matter what,

297
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,200
don't act on impulse.

298
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,000
Not impulse.

299
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,880
I have to deal with something.

300
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,280
Mr. Gu.

301
00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,760
Mr. Gu.

302
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,880
Miss Bai.

303
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,599
Prepare the files now.

304
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,760
It seems that I made the right move.

305
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,119
You have achieved your goal.

306
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,359
Your means are good as well.

307
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,080
I just want you
to get back to the firm sooner.

308
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,039
Come on. Take a seat.

309
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,400
It's fine for me to come back,
but I have a condition.

310
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,359
We must transform the company.

311
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,080
If we still run it

312
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,440
in the old way,

313
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,599
the firm won't yield great fruits.

314
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,000
Nor be able to
embrace the younger market.

315
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,440
Leave the firm to me.

316
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,159
I will make Gu Group better and better.

317
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:52,840
I won't meddle with
your work any longer.

318
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:54,880
And...

319
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,799
I hope you won't intervene
in my private life anymore.

320
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,640
Don't embarrass
the Su Family especially.

321
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:05,959

(HOUSE SALES CONTRACT)

323
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,079
I wish you can end the deal.

324
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,400
Jingjing is a good girl.

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,040
Treasure her.

326
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,000
Su Jingjing. Su Jingjing.

327
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,359
How could you fool Gu

328
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:37,920
with his grandpa?

329
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,880
You even fooled your parents.

330
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,319
I-I didn't fool you.

331
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:45,760
Yes.

332
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,800
It's because Old Gu
morally blackmailed me.

333
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,319
Right.

334
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,160
What are you doing?

335
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:52,319
Don't talk like that.

336
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,760
What Old Gu?

337
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,920
It's rude.

338
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,680
It's his grandpa.

339
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,160
Alright, darling. Save it.

340
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,319
Jingjing did it for Gu Rong.

341
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,000
Right.

342
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,680
Look, when the grandpa
and the grandson are good,

343
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,199
we don't have to move then.

344
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,640
It's a triumph. We should celebrate it.

345
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,319
That's right.

346
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:08,880
Right?

347
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,839
Su Zhengkui.

348
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:11,880
Shut up your mouth

349
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:12,839
when I teach my girl.

350
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,479
Remember to shut up forever.

351
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,359
Squat down.

352
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,479
It seems that you have known it.

353
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,479
Gu, you are back.

354
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,479
What do you want to have?

355
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,000
Whatever.

356
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,800
I will make it for you.

357
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:37,439
It's alright.

358
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:38,239
All are ok for me.

359
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,560
Then go to the kitchen.

360
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,119
Help me with the dinner.

361
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,719
Okay.

362
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,920
I want to chat with you.

363
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,319
Let me help you.

364
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,119
I don't need you.

365
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:46,560
I...

366
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,719
She doesn't need you.

367
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:48,479
Let's have braised ribs, shall we?

368
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,920
Don't need me. It's done.

369
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,816
(Su's Martial Club)

370
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,640
(He seems to know the thing.)

371
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,880
(Right. He is his family after all.)

372
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,719
You don't have to
sell Su's Martial Club.

373
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:20,119
You can live here however long you like.

374
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:25,920
In the past,

375
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,359
because of my Haphephobia,

376
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,599
I always chose to eschew.

377
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,119
But during the days when I lived here,

378
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,079
your family cured me.

379
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:37,439
You also let me know

380
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,920
if I want my grandpa to let me go,

381
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:41,599
I must face up to him.

382
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:43,920
I have to tell him

383
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,719
I can shoulder the responsibilities
for myself and the firm

384
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,319
with my strength.

385
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,719
So, my coming back to the company

386
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,359
is a definite must.

387
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:56,839
Well...

388
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
Are you going to move out?

389
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:03,920
I am your renter.

390
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,079
Since you don't have to move,

391
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,079
I won't leave either.

392
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,199
Like we were before.

393
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,719
Let's talk about another thing.

394
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,920
What is it?

395
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:13,640
You even wore a raincoat

396
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:14,680
when you had
snail rice noodles with grandpa.

397
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:15,920
You are really considerate.

398
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
S-Sorry.

399
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:22,479
I shouldn't...

400
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,280
It's okay if you know your fault.

401
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,199
But as punishment,

402
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,479
you should guarantee me one thing.

403
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:27,439
What is it?

404
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,040
You must go back to the firm with me

405
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,439
as my bodyguard.

406
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,479
Ms. Su.

407
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,680
Are you willing to
stay by my side forever?

408
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,079
Yes. I am extremely willing to.

409
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:43,719
I will go wherever you go.

410
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,239
Jingjing.

411
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,479
Su Jingjing.

412
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,239
Gu, have breakfast.

413
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,000
♪The passing summer left a secret♪

414
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,760
I lost again. See what it is.

415
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,880
I don't know how to play it.

416
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,160
Well. Gu bought it for me. Great.

417
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:15,959
Is it good?

418
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,839
So good.

419
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,359
Bad for your eyes.

420
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,439
Gu.

421
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,319
Time to eat.

422
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,400
Where is Jingjing?

423
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:23,959
Jingjing went out early in the morning.

424
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:24,959
She said she had urgent business.

425
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,160
Teach me how to play it.

426
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,479
Have breakfast.

427
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,680
I'll go make a phone call.

428
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,680
I'll have it after finishing my call.

429
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:33,199
Okay.

430
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:33,760
Teach me when you are back.

431
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:34,680
I'll get back soon.

432
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,000
Where is she?

433
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,160
(Where do you go?)

434
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,160
Go.

435
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,199
Ai Mi.

436
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,280
Su Jingjing, slower.

437
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,479
Su Jingjing.

438
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,079
Su Jingjing, slower.

439
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,160
No.

440
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,239
Why don't you ask
Gu Rong to go crazy with you?

441
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,959
I can't let Gu Rong

442
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,800
see my wildness.

443
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,800
Su Jingjing.

444
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:51,640
My goodness.

445
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:56,680
Watch me.

446
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,560
Alright.

447
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,199
Watch this.

448
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,920
Su Jingjing, are you going too far?

449
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,119
You are just Gu Rong's bodyguard.

450
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,400
This is my first time

451
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,719
being a bodyguard
of a great firm's senior leader.

452
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,479
In the movies,

453
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,319
bodyguards should make schedules.

454
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,040
If leaders are in danger,

455
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,520
bodyguards should
evacuate them in the first place.

456
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,880
For the equipment, martial arts,
and driving skills, you can't lack one.

457
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,680
I have to learn about them in advance.

458
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:56,760
Jingjing.

459
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,760
Are you really going to take bodyguard

460
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,040
as your full-time job?

461
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,239
It has a bad effect, right?

462
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,160
You think it isn't suitable, don't you?

463
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,319
If you ask me,

464
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,280
you should consider yourself more.

465
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:12,680
As I am his bodyguard and girlfriend,

466
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,400
we are intimate indeed.

467
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,959
I have to keep low-profiled then.

468
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,199
What did you do?

469
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,439
I can't find you for a whole day.

470
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,719
You didn't reply to the messages.

471
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,520
Nor picked up the phone.

472
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,439
Look. What time is it?

473
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,400
I have told you.

474
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,680
I have business with Ai Mi.

475
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,959
It's getting late.

476
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,239
I'll go upstairs to sleep.

477
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,359
Gu, how's the walnut?

478
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:06,959
Good.

479
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,520
Good.

480
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:09,920
We shall hit the road
before the morning rush hour.

481
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,319
Jingjing.

482
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,560
Hurry up.

483
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,119
We are waiting for you.

484
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,560
Jingjing.

485
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,599
So cool.

486
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:51,239
My dear daughter.

487
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,319
You are so cool.

488
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,359
Watch out.

489
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,199
Be careful.

490
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,800
Help me.

491
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:21,599
Okay.

492
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,319
It's all right.

493
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,520
What is this?

494
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,599
Pepper spray.

495
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,439
What are you doing?

496
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,920
Jingjing, what are you going to do?

497
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,199
As your bodyguard, I should dress well.

498
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,920
I am well prepared.

499
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:41,839
You don't have to

500
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,040
be so serious.

501
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,040
You just need to follow me.

502
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,000
No way.

503
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,239
I have prepared all. Okay?

504
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,520
Right. My daughter is the best.

505
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,839
So, you ignored me yesterday

506
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,199
because you prepared these secretly?

507
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,839
Yes. What else?

508
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,560
But for the sunglasses,
you don't need them.

509
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:03,920
We are not acting.

510
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,000
Leave it to me.

511
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:06,959
Is it good?

512
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,560
It's good. Great.

513
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,400
Let's go. Clock in.

514
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,040
Okay.

515
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,199
Let's go.

516
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:12,640
Go.

517
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:13,800
Bye, mister and ma'am.

518
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,400
Bye.

519
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,800
Bye.

520
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,479
Bye-bye.

521
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,920
Be good.

522
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,640
Jingjing, be good.

523
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,079
Okay.

524
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:19,680
Be careful.

525
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,439
Why are your hands so sweaty?

526
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,439
What are you looking at?

527
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,959
Watch the surrounding conditions.

528
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,400
Protect you all the time.

529
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,680
Jingjing, relax.

530
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,199
Take a deep breath.

531
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,800
It's okay.

532
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:48,880
Right, Xie Te.

533
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,400
Remember to pull over to let me get off

534
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,479
at the crossing
500 meters away from the firm.

535
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:54,479
Why do you get off first?

536
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,400
Think about it.

537
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,760
I am your bodyguard

538
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,800
and girlfriend.

539
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,079
Such a complicated relationship

540
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,560
must be a source of gossip

541
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,839
in the company.

542
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,520
I don't want to
be in the limelight of the gossip.

543
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,079
So, our other relationship

544
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,680
can't be discovered.

545
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,800
What other relationship?

546
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,280
Let me see who it is so idle to gossip.

547
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,680
No.

548
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,880
No discussion.

549
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,479
As you are my bodyguard,

550
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,839
isn't it normal for you

551
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,079
to clock in and clock out with me?

552
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,959
What's more,

553
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,199
have you seen bodyguards

554
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,079
stay far away

555
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,800
from their employers?

556
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,280
That makes sense.

557
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,520
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

558
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:45,920
Go.

559
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,400
- Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

560
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,199
Mr. Gu, welcome back to here.

561
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:01,400
The flowers.

562
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:18,599
You...

563
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,680
Mr. Gu.

564
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,599
The flowers represent
the flaming enthusiasm

565
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,560
of the staff
from the president's office.

566
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,439
Welcome your triumphant return.

567
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,280
Thank you for your flowers.

568
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,839
I hope that you will always maintain

569
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,079
your flaming enthusiasm.

570
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,640
As I come back to the Gu Group

571
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,719
as CEO this time,

572
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:35,760
I will lead you to write a new chapter.

573
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,359
That's it.

574
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:38,880
Okay.

575
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:39,680
- Okay.
- Okay.

576
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,839
Let's go.

577
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,280
Is that Mr. Gu's female bodyguard?

578
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,760
It feels like we were
traveling in Mission: Impossible.

579
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,199
Isn't she 007?

580
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:49,640
What girlfriend power.

581
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:51,800
Let's go.

582
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,160
Wait.

583
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,599
Have you finished the check,
Ms. Bodyguard?

584
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,359
Safe.

585
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,280
Right.

586
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,119
Tell me your schedule ahead of time.

587
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:45,800
I need to eliminate potential risks.

588
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,239
Be prepared ahead.

589
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I will stay in the office
for the whole day.

590
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,680
Don't worry.

591
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,000
I will be

592
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,239
within your sights, okay?

593
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,199
Great.

594
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,839
Jingjing, let me show you the way.

595
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,560
Okay.

596
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:06,800
Go.

597
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,680
Here comes the introduction.

598
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,959
This is Su Jingjing.

599
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,640
Mr. Gu's bodyguard.

600
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,680
She will work with you from today.

601
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,079
Let's welcome.

602
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,719
Hello, I am Su Jingjing.

603
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,119
From now on,

604
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:37,239
please give me guidance.

605
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,079
Welcome.

606
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,599
Welcome.

607
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,280
Assistant Xie.

608
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,760
Look, my desk is opposite to the door.

609
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,439
Chief He asked me

610
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,640
to change to here some days ago.

611
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,640
Go.

612
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,400
Here, here. Sit in my seat.

613
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,199
I will move there.

614
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:56,719
Jingjing, let me show you around.

615
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:59,199
Do a favor. There you go.

616
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,239
Okay. Let's go.

617
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,640
Thank you, everyone.

618
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,400
I'll accompany Mr. Gu to the meeting.

619
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:06,079
Just go.

620
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,439
Jingjing.

621
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,319
This position

622
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,599
is close to Mr. Gu's office.

623
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,839
He might want you
to report to him often.

624
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:18,520
Okay. Thanks.

625
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,439
I'll take my leave.

626
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,719
Chief, give me some work, please.

627
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:59,199
No need. You're new here.
Just have a rest.

628
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,319
Check the document I sent.

629
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:03,319
Okay.

630
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:04,319
Are you bored?

631
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,000
Liu,

632
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,719
take Jingjing out for a walk.

633
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:08,639
Okay.

634
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,919
No need. No need.

635
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,959
Well...I will take a rest.

636
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,040
Hello.

637
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,239
Miss Bai.

638
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,679
Okay. Okay. Wait a minute.

639
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,199
S-Su Jingjing.

640
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,320
You are free now, right?

641
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,199
The new promotion materials are here.

642
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,479
Take and send them to Miss Bai.

643
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,040
Me?

644
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:58,479
Who else? Everyone is busy.

645
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,320
Go now. Miss Bai is waiting.

646
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,360
Liu is free. Liu.

647
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,199
No, I can't. Chief.

648
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,399
Mr. Gu needs the document so badly.

649
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Never mind. I will go. Right away.

650
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:19,560
Jin.

651
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:22,080
What's wrong, Chief?

652
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,919
Nothing.

653
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,520
Your lipstick color looks good.

654
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:42,840
The elevator. Hold on.

655
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:44,280
Wait for me. I...

656
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,040
Miss Bai.

657
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:55,639
Miss Bai.

658
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,679
These are
the promotion materials you need.

659
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,239
Send them to my office.

660
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,600
Miss Bai, these are
the promotion materials.

661
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,040
Please don't
break into my office casually

662
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,959
unless I say "come in" next time.

663
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,679
Okay. I am sorry.

664
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,600
Where should I put
the promotion materials?

665
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,520
(Miss Bai, the marketing department asked)

666
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,679
(if the promotion materials arrived.)

667
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:29,760
(Their director said your projects)

668
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,679
(are handed over to them temporarily.)

669
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,399
I got it.

670
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,600
I will communicate
with their director directly.

671
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:36,239
Okay.

672
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,639
Miss Bai, the promotion materials.

673
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,679
The plant grows too high.

674
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,239
It blocks my views.

675
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,479
Ms. Su, move it out for me.

676
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:56,520
Miss Bai, as the plant is too heavy,

677
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,560
I can't make it alone.

678
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
As you are Mr. Gu's bodyguard,

679
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,959
isn't a great physical strength
an essential factor?

680
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,360
What?

681
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,719
Can't you even move this?

682
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,320
What are you doing?

683
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,120
Didn't Miss Bai say

684
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,199
the plant blocked your views?
