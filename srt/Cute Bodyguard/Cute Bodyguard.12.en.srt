Sweet Su.

51
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,360
I am so uneasy.

52
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,839
Can you chat with me?

53
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Why? An early menopause?

54
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,000
Impossible.

55
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,279
I'm not going through menopause.

56
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,399
Rest assured.

57
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,919
Oh, my God.

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,479
I'm not in the mood to joke with you.

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,240
I met Mr. Li

60
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,279
on my way back from work just now.

61
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,199
Guess what he told me.

62
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:43,559
What is it?

63
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,039
He told me...

64
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,720
When I was walking my dog the other day,

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,000
I saw your daughter

66
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,440
fighting with a bunch of guys in suits.

67
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,800
When?

68
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,399
Jingjing didn't tell me anything.

69
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,559
An old man with four or five guys.

70
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,919
Looks like they were here for Gu.

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,759
I heard Gu call that old man grandpa.

72
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,119
Did you see them

73
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,960
actually fighting?

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,679
That's right.

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,679
It was quite a fight.

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,480
I almost unleashed my dog to attack them

77
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,160
because I was afraid
Jingjing might lose.

78
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,079
But after they said something,

79
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,320
the old man led the way and left.

80
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,079
Don't mind me asking.

81
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,440
You should figure out

82
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,920
who that Gu is.

83
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,760
So I'm telling you.

84
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,000
We can't leave these two kids

85
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,440
unattended.

86
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,720
Yes, we should step in.

87
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,559
Gu

88
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,200
is just one of our tenants.

89
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,040
It's none of our business

90
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,480
how complicated he is.

91
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,959
But now all of a sudden,

92
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:00,679
he is pursuing Jingjing.

93
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,320
Then this is a different story.

94
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

95
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,959
And

96
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,399
a man with a family background like him,

97
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:11,000
must have a lot of enemies out there.

98
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,320
It's terrible to involve our Jingjing

99
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,040
into such matters.

100
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,359
Put that aside.

101
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,399
I am also worried

102
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,160
that Gu's grandpa

103
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,839
doesn't like our Jingjing.

104
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,920
He...

105
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,480
He doesn't like our Jingjing?

106
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,839
How wonderful our Jingjing is.

107
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,160
I can't believe
that he doesn't like her.

108
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,399
I don't like much of him as well.

109
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:37,440
Sweet Su, that Gu.

110
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,559
He's not a hard-working guy.

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,760
If Jingjing marries him,

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,320
then she has to take care of him,

113
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,079
which makes her a housekeeper.

114
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,880
I feel so worried about her.

115
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,519
I care about Jingjing.

116
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,079
I am afraid that Jingjing may suffer.

117
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,799
Yeah.

118
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:58,320
And even though

119
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
Gu and his grandpa are on the outs,

120
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,200
they have blood relation after all.

121
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,959
Yeah.

122
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:04,600
Right?

123
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:06,880
If they have some conflicts,

124
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,040
after all, our Jingjing is an outsider,

125
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,440
Jingjing would get the worst of it.

126
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,399
Right.

127
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,200
No, no way.

128
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,000
And,

129
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm sure his grandpa
requires a great-grandson.

130
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,320
Maybe he would require three or more.

131
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,320
Then in the next ten years,

132
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,279
Jingjing will have to
give birth to many kids.

133
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
She'll suffer a lot.

134
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,839
That's right.

135
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,720
- No way.
- No way!

136
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,079
Definitely no way!

137
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,200
I'll go get the door.

138
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,440
Then go.

139
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,320
Coming.

140
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,399
Miss Bai.

141
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,279
Ma'am, hello.

142
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,359
I heard Mr. Gu is sick.

143
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,720
I'm here to give him
some health care products.

144
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,600
Just come in.

145
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,839
Over there.

146
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:11,519
He took some medicine
and just fell asleep.

147
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,040
I think he's going to sleep for a while.

148
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,079
Okay. Let him sleep.

149
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,959
I have something to talk to you alone.

150
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,079
Let's go.

151
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,359
This is for anti-glycation.

152
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,880
Take one every morning.

153
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,640
The diet of your family

154
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,480
is all about frying and stir-frying,
which is not healthy.

155
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,720
This is for antioxidant.

156
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,559
Take one every night before bed.

157
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,000
Remember not to mix it with hot water.

158
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,839
I think you haven't removed the mites
for the house for a long time, right?

159
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,720
This is for anti-allergy
and immune-boosting.

160
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,839
Take one every 24 hours.

161
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,119
Miss Su, I heard the chairman say

162
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,000
that you met the other day.

163
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,720
Mr. Gu...

164
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,880
After all, he is
the grandson of the chairman.

165
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,480
It's impossible for them not to contact

166
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,559
for the rest of their lives.

167
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,320
You'll be in an awkward position

168
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,400
between them in the future.

169
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,880
Miss Bai, I think you misunderstood.

170
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,320
Before Gu Rong knew me,

171
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,520
he didn't want to go home either.

172
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,000
Otherwise, he wouldn't be living here.

173
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,200
Besides, if he wants to go back,

174
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,479
I won't stop him.

175
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,679
Miss Su.

176
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,799
I think

177
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,520
you didn't understand what I meant.

178
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,119
The chairman has already known

179
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,479
that Mr. Gu is pursuing you.

180
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,559
Mr. Gu is on a whim.

181
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,520
After he comes home,

182
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,520
what should you do then?

183
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,200
I...

184
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:22,400
Mr. Gu received the best education
when he was young.

185
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,960
At 16, he went to study in UK

186
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,080
and got into the top 10 business majors.

187
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,919
In this aspect,

188
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,559
he is kind of a genius.

189
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,520
Not to mention Gu's business

190
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,919
is the responsibility he can't escape.

191
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,960
Even if he doesn't go back to Gu Group
but starts from scratch,

192
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,520
he would certainly make a success.

193
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,919
Do you think

194
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,000
he will always stay in your world?

195
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,919
I don't mean
to make him stay here forever.

196
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,400
Okay, so do you think

197
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,200
you can walk into his world?

198
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,239
You,

199
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,599
your family,

200
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,559
and everything around you,

201
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:09,280
are all too new for him.

202
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,880
Being with you

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,599
means he can totally
get out of the chairman's control.

204
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,400
He has a crush on you for now.

205
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,679
The chairman

206
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,000
and I totally understand it.

207
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,239
Miss Su.

208
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:37,039
You are a very simple girl.

209
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,960
You should live a simple life.

210
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,440
Do you think I'm right?

211
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,559
Miss Bai, have some fruits.

212
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,320
Ma'am, I have work to do.

213
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,840
I have to go now.

214
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,760
You're leaving?

215
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,799
I'll see you off.

216
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,440
No, thank you.

217
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,640
Goodbye.

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,760
Jingjing.

219
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:24,919
Have some fruits.

220
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,080
What did Miss Bai

221
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,559
tell you just now?

222
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,799
Nothing.

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,919
Just something about Gu Rong.

224
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:42,440
Do you want to chat with me?

225
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,320
To talk about Gu.

226
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,840
Your dad and I think

227
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:55,400
that maybe you and Gu
aren't right for each other.

228
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,320
We are a little worried.

229
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,320
Mom, don't worry.

230
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:05,080
Gu Rong and I won't
be in love relationship.

231
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,479
Jingjing.

232
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Your dad and I don't mean anything else.

233
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,479
We just hope...

234
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,239
I know. I get it.

235
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,320
Jingjing.

236
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,760
We're not in the same world.

237
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,760
My daughter,

238
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,840
are you feeling very sad now?

239
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,320
Jingjing.

240
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,080
What have you got for me?

241
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,239
I'm hungry.

242
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,200
There's plenty of delicious medicine.

243
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,960
What are those?

244
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,520
Miss Bai sent them here.

245
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,640
There are a lot of anti-things.

246
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,320
This is way over the top.

247
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,919
I'm not some medicine jar.

248
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:50,119
I suggest you take them.

249
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,840
We don't have a healthy diet,

250
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,840
and we don't get rid of mites.

251
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,719
I am afraid we might poison you.

252
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,679
What's wrong with you today?

253
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:02,119
Why are you so resentful?

254
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,679
I didn't offend you today.

255
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,599
Gu Rong.

256
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,479
We're not right for each other.

257
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,919
We'll just keep
our relationship professional.

258
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,119
Well, why are you saying that again?

259
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,599
Didn't you already forgive me?

260
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,719
Forgiving and accepting

261
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,320
are two different things.

262
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,320
Well, so you tell me,

263
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,039
what's wrong with
you and me being together?

264
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,440
If you can't think of anything,

265
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,080
then there's nothing wrong.

266
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,440
If so,

267
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,440
then we're right for each other.

268
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,239
We are from two different worlds.

269
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,719
We can't make it.

270
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,760
We are from two different worlds.

271
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,520
(You can't hear me.)

272
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,000
(But you can't even see?)

273
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,320
(You caught on my clothes.)

274
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,039
Miss.

275
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,599
This is not a smart way

276
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,239
to get my attention.

277
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,559
Who are you?

278
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,719
I mistook you as my mom.

279
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,039
Why didn't you say anything?

280
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,119
You were in your bath robe.

281
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:41,919
If you found out it was me,

282
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,799
you'd call me a bad guy again.

283
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,880
(You,)

284
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,239
(your family,)

285
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,200
(and everything around you,)

286
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,919
(are all too new for him.)

287
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,200
What now?

288
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,479
Wrong room again?

289
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,719
I just knew you don't know how it works.

290
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,479
Keep your windows and doors open

291
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:00,400
when using the incense.

292
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Do you want to get poisoned?

293
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,080
Of course she can't be
Han Ran's girlfriend.

294
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,200
Because I'm pursuing Miss Su.

295
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't care what you think of it.

296
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,239
But what I said is true.

297
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,400
From today,

298
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,919
I'll start to pursue you.

299
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,960
(Mr. Gu...)

300
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,119
(After all, he is
the grandson of the chairman.)

301
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,719
(It's impossible
for them not to contact)

302
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,799
(for the rest of their lives.)

303
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,559
(You'll be in an awkward position)

304
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,599
(between them in the future.)

305
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,080
Disobeying,

306
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,840
and threatening elders.

307
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:37,760
Is this the ambition

308
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,479
you talked about?

309
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,159
Maybe you and Gu
aren't right for each other.

310
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:47,119
(We are a little worried.)

311
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,119
(Mom, don't worry.)

312
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,880
(Gu Rong and I won't
be in love relationship.)

313
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,033
♪Somehow it's like we meant to be♪

314
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:05,328
♪Love you is my destiny in this life♪

315
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:14,096
♪My love for you is pure and clean♪

316
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,680
You get up!

317
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,439
What do you mean by that?

318
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,040
These are the account numbers
and passwords for all my money.

319
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,520
You can use them whenever you want.

320
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,199
What do you mean?

321
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:41,560
You said we are from
two different worlds.

322
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,640
So we're in balance now.

323
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,280
Are you an idiot?

324
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,839
You don't understand what I meant.

325
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:49,640
Well.

326
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:52,079
You raised a problem and I solved it.

327
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,640
Then why do you yell at me?

328
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,199
Gu Rong, don't you get it

329
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,359
that there's more to us than just money?

330
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,439
I can't get used to your values.

331
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,839
And you don't agree with my values.

332
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,839
Do you understand?

333
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:03,680
Why can't I agree?

334
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,920
I've lived here for a long time.

335
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,199
I'm pretty well now.

336
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:08,439
That's because
you are like a wandering tourist.

337
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,880
You never fit in here.

338
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,680
Those household affairs,

339
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,560
trifles,

340
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,400
odds and ends

341
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,160
are my life.

342
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,119
So fierce.

343
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,160
What did you say?

344
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,319
You're going to
transfer your money to her?

345
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
(Aimi's toy shop)
This much?

346
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,760
Yeah.

347
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,199
And then I got yelled at.

348
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,359
Why did she yell at you?

349
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:43,079
She should have beaten you up.

350
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,119
So much money,

351
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,040
what's that supposed to mean?

352
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,920
To buy her?

353
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,560
Who do you take Jingjing for?

354
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,560
I didn't mean that.

355
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:52,920
Jingjing said,

356
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,920
the problem for us

357
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,479
is that our financial gap is too big.

358
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,079
That's why I came up with this idea.

359
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,359
Oh, my God.

360
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,439
What Jingjing meant is

361
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,839
that you're rich and she's normal.

362
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,040
It's not your fault that you are rich.

363
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,400
But by dealing with the problem

364
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,280
in such a childish and stupid way,

365
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,839
you're insulting Jingjing

366
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,160
and your relationship.

367
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,359
I think you deserve to be yelled at.

368
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:17,479
It proves that you two are
truly from two different worlds.

369
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:18,880
Oh, my God.

370
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,599
I see now.

371
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,800
I noticed that Xie Te has been
getting dumber lately too.

372
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,479
Does love

373
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,239
really make people stupid?

374
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,239
What am I supposed to do?

375
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,479
You need to get to know her life.

376
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,959
Stop getting her all around you.

377
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,400
Mr. Gu.

378
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,079
This is as far as I can help you.

379
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,199
If you can't figure it out yourself,

380
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:46,680
you might not be right for Jingjing.

381
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,199
To tell the truth,

382
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,920
it is fate that you and Jingjing

383
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:55,400
who are from two different worlds
can meet.

384
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,520
But the probability

385
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,359
of you two being together

386
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,599
is really much lower than
getting a secret figure from blind box.

387
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,199
What is this?

388
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,239
A secret figure.

389
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,000
Grandpa, I'll rock the chair for you.

390
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:26,680
You are good.

391
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,599
Is there any candy today?

392
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,800
Gu.

393
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,400
Jingjing said you caught a cold.

394
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,640
This is the herbal tea

395
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,880
of honeysuckle fruit I just made today.

396
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,280
Have a drink
to clear the heat in your body.

397
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,400
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

398
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,199
It's okay. Just drink it.

399
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,119
Ms. Chen.

400
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,800
Do you think you have a good business?

401
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
No.

402
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,599
You can see there's nobody here.

403
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,640
I do business with

404
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:09,800
those regular customers.

405
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,400
Haven't you thought about
getting a takeout account?

406
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sure you'll get a lot of orders.

407
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,520
I don't understand
those internet things,

408
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:17,839
contract or agreement.

409
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,599
I'm afraid if I get scammed,

410
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,040
my money will be all gone.

411
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,439
I might still

412
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,959
do business with regular customers.

413
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,680
Then let me get you one.

414
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,079
I'm sure it won't hurt you.

415
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,239
Why did the dean talk about

416
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,560
the KPI thing again?

417
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,280
What is that?

418
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,079
It's all about persuading guests
to apply for VIP cards.

419
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,959
As soon as I persuade
the guests to get the cards,

420
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,479
they'll have

421
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,959
that long face.

422
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,640
All I recommend to them

423
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,119
are special packages.

424
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,640
They just don't trust me.

425
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,280
But people at our age

426
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,760
are certainly not so eloquent

427
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,520
as those young beauticians.

428
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,680
Besides,

429
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,280
look at us, with the old faces.

430
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,359
Who will trust what we recommend?

431
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,400
You can't say that.

432
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,199
We still have to be pretty
even if we're getting older.

433
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,479
If I have the money,

434
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,079
I will use all the stuff

435
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,640
in our store.

436
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,439
Right.

437
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,560
How nice it is to be pretty.

438
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,040
Ma'am.

439
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,280
Xie, why are you here?

440
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:25,880
Mr. Gu recommended to me.

441
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,119
He said your beauty salon

442
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,920
provides nice and professional services.

443
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,839
So we decided to
apply for cards with you

444
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,359
as our company's
excellent employee benefits.

445
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,239
50 cards in total.

446
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,719
All are under your credit.

447
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,959
Ma'am, thank you then.

448
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,199
50 cards!

449
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,719
50 cards?

450
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:45,719
Really?

451
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,560
Yes.

452
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:50,040
I need you to tell them again.
How many are there?

453
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,079
Say that again.

454
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,880
50 cards.

455
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Really?

456
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:56,959
Yes.

457
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:04,920
This...

458
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,199
Wonderful.

459
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:11,439
I just wondered

460
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,400
why we don't have to talk loudly today.

461
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,439
Everyone is wearing headphones now.

462
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,239
It looks so weird.

463
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,640
Su. Thank Gu for me.

464
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,119
For what?

465
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:33,479
We got complaints about disturbance.

466
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,119
So we could only play our music quietly.

467
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
Those who are in the back
couldn't hear the music clearly.

468
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,199
I met Gu yesterday.

469
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,000
He told us

470
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,560
that there are
wireless Bluetooth headphones now.

471
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,479
He gave each of us a pair of them

472
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,040
and taught us how to use.

473
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,680
See, now no more disturbance,

474
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,079
so we

475
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,640
feel more comfortable dancing now.

476
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,880
Great!

477
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,800
I'm going to get a drink of water.

478
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,079
Okay, be careful of your headphones.

479
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,359
Okay.

480
00:24:58,959 --> 00:24:59,839
No way.

481
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,319
It doesn't seem like something
Gu Rong would do.

482
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,000
You are wrong.

483
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,439
He must be the one who did it.

484
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,319
Su.

485
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:06,959
Let's go.

486
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Hanging out with your daughter?

487
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:09,839
Su.

488
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:10,680
Here. Have some.

489
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,239
How much is it?

490
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:11,800
It's cheap.

491
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,439
I've already bought it.

492
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,439
Well, next time.

493
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,959
No. 94. Take it.

494
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:18,719
Repair the car again?

495
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,079
Yeah.

496
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:20,800
Su.

497
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,560
You are free. You got rich?

498
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,359
Su.

499
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,640
I need to tell you something.

500
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,719
I want to thank you.

501
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:29,199
Thank you.

502
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,400
Thank you very much!

503
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,439
No! Stop!

504
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,239
What are you thanking me for?

505
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,239
Thanks for your Gu.

506
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,199
After he applied for
the takeout account for me,

507
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,640
I got plenty of takeout orders

508
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,040
every day.

509
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,119
I have hundreds of orders every day.

510
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,680
I'll thank you some other time.

511
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,560
Good luck with your business.

512
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,880
You're sweet.

513
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:47,760
No. 97. Take it.

514
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,560
Jingjing.

515
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,520
Here.

516
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,199
Maybe Gu is out of his mind?

517
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,959
Let's go back.

518
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,959
Here.

519
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,839
Su.

520
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,400
Hello!

521
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,160
That's weird. They are

522
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,560
all wearing headphones.

523
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:08,839
Gu.

524
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,839
Mister.

525
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,439
Busy?

526
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,839
Look at this, mister.

527
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,359
These are the registration forms

528
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,680
for the summer vacation class
of Su's Martial Club.

529
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,880
So many?

530
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,239
The...

531
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,160
These children

532
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,839
all signed up
to learn martial arts from me?

533
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,439
Yeah.

534
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,599
We could not enroll any student before.

535
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,040
Why are there so many now?

536
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,599
Here is the thing, mister.

537
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,680
Take a look at this.

538
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,520
I made a H5 promotional page

539
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,319
for some parents
of the 1980s generation.

540
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,719
In this day and age,

541
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,359
deeply buried gold cannot shine.

542
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:42,800
I think the necessary marketing

543
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,800
needs to be done.

544
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,199
So I made this.

545
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Amazing.

546
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,680
Thank you very much!

547
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,239
Sorry.

548
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,680
- That's amazing.
- Mister.

549
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,599
I have one more thing.

550
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,079
What is it?

551
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
I want to learn martial arts from you.

552
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,920
I know you always thought

553
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,280
I am spoiled and not hard-working.

554
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,040
I want to change my image

555
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,199
in your mind.

556
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,160
I'll put your mind at ease.

557
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:08,920
Well.

558
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,560
To learn martial arts from me?

559
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,959
You're still having a fever?

560
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,560
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

561
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,280
Of course.

562
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,079
My dad can't do a lot of boxing,

563
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,640
but he knows how to train people.

564
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,239
What are you talking about?

565
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,319
Why can't I?

566
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,959
I'm all set for you.

567
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,000
You're all set?

568
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:31,880
Then let's go.

569
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,439
Okay.

570
00:27:43,344 --> 00:27:47,760
(Su's Martial Club)

571
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,920
There's an old saying that
if one does not train basic skills,

572
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,719
one will regret it in old age.

573
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,800
Martial arts
are not just about defending.

574
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:01,359
What is more important
is to train basic skills well.

575
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,560
So, from now on,

576
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,839
we're going to train
your basic core strength.

577
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:13,079
For squats, hands should be level,
and legs should bend down.

578
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,160
Get lower.

579
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,800
Are you alright?

580
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,160
Go back.

581
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,560
Here, daughter, you go.

582
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,640
Don't move, Mr. Gu.

583
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:31,880

Gu.

611
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,319
The soup you make is delicious.

612
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,800
I've never had such good chicken soup.

613
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,319
You taught me well, ma'am.

614
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,319
You are so clever

615
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,839
that you got it right away.

616
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,520
Oh, mister and ma'am.

617
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,160
You eat first.

618
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,520
Well, Mr. Li got his feet injured.

619
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,680
I have to walk his dog.

620
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,520
Now?

621
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,719
Yeah, I'll be right back
after I walk the dog.

622
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,199
Why do you...?

623
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:28,800
You go now?

624
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:33,880
Xia.

625
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:35,079
Did you notice

626
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:37,760
that Gu has changed a lot recently?

627
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,599
Sweet Su.

628
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:42,680
Why do I suddenly

629
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,479
feel like I have a son?

630
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,880
We don't have
to worry about Jingjing now.

631
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,239
We couldn't do that back then,

632
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,000
but if we could,

633
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,839
our son would be this old.

634
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,640
Isn't the country
encouraging a second child now?

635
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:10,479
How about...?

636
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,719
Sweet Su. You still have that ambition?

637
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,800
What are you talking about?
That doesn't work.

638
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,640
A man is as bold as he can be.

639
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,160
Let's try and get another child.

640
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,280
You... Anyway,

641
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,800
you are not the one
who will get pregnant.

642
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,439
Do you know
how painful it is to give birth?

643
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,119
I may look young.

644
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,560
That's because I've been

645
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,040
taking care of myself well.

646
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,680
I'm getting old.

647
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,680
It's dangerous
to give birth at an old age.

648
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,239
I'm telling you.

649
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,839
You and I should

650
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,239
keep our bodies healthy

651
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:43,000
and wait for Jingjing

652
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:44,760
to give us a grandchild.

653
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,239
Jingjing.

654
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:51,319
Jingjing.

655
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,280
I think

656
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:57,400
Gu seems to be sincere to you.

657
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,319
Don't talk about it.

658
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,119
Let's eat.

659
00:32:15,888 --> 00:32:19,472
(Su's Martial Club)

660
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,719
How did I fall asleep
in the middle of the day?

661
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:19,719
You've been so busy.

662
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:28,359
Then I'm cured of my insomnia.

663
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,199
Just like you right now,

664
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,920
I can fall asleep
as soon as I go to bed.

665
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,520
Didn't you keep telling me

666
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,280
that one should follow his heart?

667
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,160
Now look at you.

668
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,599
Aren't you forcing yourself?

669
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,640
I have to change myself
to get closer to you.

670
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,239
Besides,

671
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,680
I like my life the way it is.

672
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,839
I feel so happy.

673
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,359
I have a sense of security

674
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:00,800
that I've never had before.

675
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,280
I've tried so hard

676
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,479
to be a part of your life.

677
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,360
Your parents gave me a chance.

678
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,679
What about you?

679
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,520
I... I haven't decided yet.

680
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,639
Jingjing.

681
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,959
You can't drink plum juice like this.

682
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,320
You will catch cold.
Look how much you've had.

683
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,560
It's fine. I'm just trying to calm down.

684
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,320
Otherwise, I'm afraid

685
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,040
I'll just say yes to him.

686
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,479
For what?

687
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,959
Nothing.

688
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,280
Say it. For what?

689
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,959
Nothing.

690
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,040
We old girls don't understand

691
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,080
what you young girls think now.

692
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,280
But I think Mr. Gu is good.

693
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:30,040
He's handsome and rich,
and he's nice to you.

694
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,360
He's so cool.

695
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,679
The young man with him is nice too.

696
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,159
Let me tell you, Jingjing.

697
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,560
If you two get together later,

698
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,399
don't treat him wrong.

699
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,719
Impossible.

700
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,120
Look, Ms. Chen.

701
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,399
The delivery guy is here.

702
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:46,879
You go get busy.

703
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,760
Is No. 48 takeout ready?

704
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,399
Yes, wait a second.

705
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:53,760
Here, No. 48.

706
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:54,159
Thank you,

707
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:54,800
Here.

708
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,719
Miss Su.

709
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,879
I am afraid that you might

710
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,199
need to come with us.

711
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Where are we going?

712
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,439
The chairman wants to see you.

713
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,000
Me?

714
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,080
Grandpa Gu.

715
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,439
May I ask why you want me here?

716
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,360
I need you to convince Gu Rong
to return to Gu Group.

717
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,120
I'm sorry, Grandpa Gu. I can't.

718
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,520
You can ask for whatever you want.

719
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,439
I know during this period,

720
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,040
Gu Rong and you get along very well.

721
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,800
And I believe you can do it.

722
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,639
As long as you ask for it,

723
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,679
Gu Rong will listen to you.

724
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:11,719
Grandpa Gu, Gu Rong and I are not...

725
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:13,040
Gu Group's finance team

726
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:15,159
and legal team are here.

727
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,879
Think it over.

728
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,879
Let them know what you want.

729
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:30,959
Before she said yes,

730
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,520
don't let her leave.

731
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,959
Don't forget she knows martial arts.

732
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:35,800
Okay.
