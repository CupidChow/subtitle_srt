(You can't be the one beside him.)

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,839
Please, Ms. Su Jingjing.

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,119
You can have a walk around.

30
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,720
I'll tell you when I'm finished.

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,160
How about taking me with you?

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,679
What? You'd miss me too much?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,080
Are you sure you want to come along?

34
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,199
It's going to be boring.

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,960
Yes.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,199
Let's go.

37
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,520
Is it just the two of us?

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,960
Yeah.

39
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,800
I gave Xie Te a day off.

40
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:42,960
He was so happy.

41
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,839
Is that the right thing to do?

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,800
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Zhao.

43
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,000
Now I finally see you in person.

44
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,199
The pleasure is all mines.

45
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,199
You are a capable young man, Mr. Gu.

46
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,720
Just as they said.

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,839
Is this...

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,399
This is...

49
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,320
Mr. Zhao.

50
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,320
Haven't seen you in a while, Bai.

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,559
I was just wondering,

52
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,039
how Mr. Gu could not bring

53
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,600
this beauty.

54
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:23,720
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,559
I was delayed on the way.

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,360
Let's sit down.

57
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,759
Have a seat.

58
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:48,160
Is this Mr. Gu's new assistant?

59
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,839
Hasn't he introduced you yet?

60
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,240
This is

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,000
Mr. Gu's bodyguard.

62
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,279
Bodyguard?

63
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,839
Not bad, Mr. Gu.

64
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,559
You let a pretty girl be your bodyguard.

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,440
I wonder

66
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,279
who's doing the protecting though.

67
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:11,880
Maybe I should

68
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,440
find a bodyguard like that too.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,239
Such a treat for the eyes.

70
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,920
Let's talk later. We should order first.

71
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,239
The Huai-Yang Cuisine
here is just marvelous.

72
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,079
Well.

73
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:27,799
Mr. Gu's bodyguard.

74
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,320
Can you please fill the glass for us?

75
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,119
Okay.

76
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,720
Waitress.

77
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,079
Fill the glasses.

78
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:47,720
Wait.

79
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,000
It's just a glass of water.

80
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,959
You'll let her do that, right?

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,000
Mr. Zhao.

82
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,279
I don't think it's appropriate

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,279
to ask my girlfriend to fill your glass.

84
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,119
She's your girlfriend?

85
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,440
Why didn't you tell me?

86
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,239
Mr. Zhao, the water is too hot.

87
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,720
I heard that cooler water
is better to make tea.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,359
I'll get a new pot.

89
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,359
Gu Rong.

90
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:37,160
Mr. Gu's girlfriend is shy.

91
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,079
Don't tease her too much, Mr. Zhao.

92
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:40,920
Don't worry. I'll go check on her.

93
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,600
Stay here with Mr. Zhao.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,959
So there's someone smart

95
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,920
in your company after all.

96
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,040
Unlike those kids in my company.

97
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,320
They just don't understand the obvious.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,279
So I had to come to see you in person.

99
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,239
(It's pretty boring indeed.)

100
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,600
(I'm going home.)

101
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:09,799
(No.)

102
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,760
(Ai Mi injured her foot.)

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,640
(I want to go check on her.)

104
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,720
(See you.)

105
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,480
Wherever you are,

106
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,040
your will only bring gossip

107
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,079
to Gu Rong.

108
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,640
It's fine that you don't know business.

109
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,119
But as long as you are with him,

110
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,399
it will change people's view on him,

111
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,200
and also his own discernment.

112
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,799
Is this how you love him?

113
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,839
Qianda Group just bought a land

114
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,000
next to our project

115
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,480
to build a shopping center too.

116
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,959
You should know that, right?

117
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,559
That's why I said

118
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,440
we should slow down,

119
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,880
wait and say how it goes.

120
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,679
I think the exact opposite.

121
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,200
Mr. Gu, you have quite
an ambition for a young man.

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,119
Never be radical in business.

123
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,160
Even if Bai didn't tell you this,

124
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,040
your grandpa must have had.

125
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,880
Just say what's on your mind, Mr. Zhao.

126
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,519
No need to beat around the bush.

127
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,959
A real man should focus on big things.

128
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,440
I just asked your girlfriend
to fill the glass.

129
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,440
Why make a big deal of it?

130
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,239
Keep your eyes on business,
not such petty things.

131
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,480
As someone older than you,

132
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,640
I'll tell you this.

133
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,440
When a man brings
a pretty woman with him,

134
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,799
she's either a great help like Bai,

135
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,720
or she's just a pretty face.

136
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,440
Why would you care so much

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,359
about the latter?

138
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:00,440
You can always get
a new one when it's broken.

139
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,200
It's over.

140
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,760
So soon?

141
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
I mean the cooperation
with Wansheng is over.

142
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,320
What happened? Gu Rong?

143
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,719
Where is Mr. Zhao?

144
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,159
Miss Bai, since you came without a notice

145
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,359
and you know him so well,

146
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,080
why don't you talk to him
about the termination?

147
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,640
Let's go.

148
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,880
You'll really terminate
the contract with him?

149
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,719
Is it because of me?

150
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,520
How can it be?

151
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,960
He's not trustworthy anyway.

152
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,200
Jingjing, it's my fault
for not protecting you.

153
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,000
No. I was just thinking

154
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,400
if I embarrassed you.

155
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:26,719
No way.

156
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,440
You are always perfect.

157
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,440
I know.

158
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,039
But,

159
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,840
you can't protect me all the time.

160
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,159
I have to find my own place.

161
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,679
Trust me.

162
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,640
I can protect you forever.

163
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,599
I trust you.

164
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,960
But you need to trust me too, okay?

165
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,119
Of course.

166
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,320
Come on. Let's go home.

167
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:15,000
(Did you terminate the contract
with Wansheng?)

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,479
(I ended it before it's too late.)

169
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:15,919
(I ended it before it's too late.)

170
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,280
(He might get us into worse trouble)

171
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,520
(in the future if we don't end it.)

172
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,799
(What about the financial gap?)

173
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,840
(Did you think of something?)

174
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,080
(I'll bring a new
business partner to you)

175
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,479
(in a week.)

176
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:49,840
Why are you going on a business trip?

177
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,400
Is it because of Mr. Zhao?

178
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,719
Don't worry. I can handle it.

179
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,320
Has Bai Anrou worked

180
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,440
in your company for long?

181
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,679
Is she a great help

182
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,400
for your grandpa?

183
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,280
She has been there for long.

184
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,559
But she's not the only capable one

185
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,080
in the company.

186
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,919
Does she like you?

187
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,000
She's come here for me before.

188
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,719
What did she tell you?

189
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,719
She did help me at work.

190
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,880
But she and I are just colleagues.

191
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,919
I know that.

192
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,200
Such a cute guy

193
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,400
I got here.

194
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,599
Of course girls would fall for you.

195
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,039
Are you jealous?

196
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,640
Greet. Keep it up.

197
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,039
I allow you to doubt yourself.

198
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,559
But never doubt your boyfriend.

199
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,320
You finished packing?

200
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,719
Half of the suitcase is still empty.

201
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,400
Perhaps you...

202
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:17,159
You are going there for business.

203
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,599
There's not much I can do.

204
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,719
I'll wait for you in the company.

205
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,799
I just want you to be with me.

206
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:26,760
If this is for

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,520
what happened
in the restaurant last time,

208
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,440
that's all the more reason
for me not to go.

209
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,919
Why?

210
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,440
Because a pretty bodyguard like me

211
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,599
will only distract you

212
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,200
if I'm there.

213
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,880
Okay, okay.

214
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,599
I'll be back as soon as possible then.

215
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,559
Please do.

216
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,320
Okay.

217
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,719
Hello.

218
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:55,479
I want to check in.

219
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay. Your ID, please.

220
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,640
Okay.

221
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,000
Gu Rong.

222
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:09,880
Your ID.

223
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:10,559
Sorry.

224
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,239
It's okay.

225
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,479
I already got the rooms.

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,080
This is your card.

227
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,760
Why are you here?

228
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
William in Shengda Group

229
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,440
loves Sichuan Cuisine,
collection, and snooker.

230
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,640
He has a weird temper.

231
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,200
He's the business partner
you want, right?

232
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:33,880
Yeah.

233
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,520
We can still work well together

234
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:39,799
if you keep a distance
from my relationship.

235
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,039
Am I not?

236
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,799
Okay. We're out of time.

237
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,359
Go take your suitcase upstairs.

238
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,239
We need to

239
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,919
get to Shengda as soon as possible.

240
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,719
I'm so sorry.

241
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,479
Our manager is out for a meeting today.

242
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,000
Did Mr. William say

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,919
when he would be back?

244
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:05,960
I am so sorry.

245
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,760
We don't know that either.

246
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,200
Thank you.

247
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,760
You are back.

248
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,239
Ai Mi must have been recovering fast

249
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,000
with you taking care of her.

250
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,159
This is...

251
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,719
Mr. Gu asked me to bring this.

252
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,400
Do you know what

253
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,799
he's going on a business trip for?

254
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,359
Probably looking for
a new business partner.

255
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,840
To take the place of
Mr. Zhao in Wansheng?

256
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,440
I'm not sure about that.

257
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,359
What did you ask though?

258
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,520
Nothing. Just go.

259
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,799
Okay. Bye.

260
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,440
Thanks for this.

261
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:40,039
Bye.

262
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,320
Grandpa Gu.

263
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,799
Do you want to have Snail Rice Noodle?

264
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,119
My treat.

265
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,359
Have some coffee, please.

266
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,440
It's lunch time.

267
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Mr. William's meeting

268
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,880
should be over by now.

269
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,080
I am so sorry.

270
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,400
Our manager went to lunch

271
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,479
with the business partner

272
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,719
after the meeting.

273
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,359
He said they need to
talk about something.

274
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,320
Do you want to have lunch now?

275
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,640
It's okay.

276
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,799
We'll wait here.

277
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay.

278
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,880
Grandpa Gu.

279
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,239
I came to learn the business.

280
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:10,800
Jingjing.

281
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,959
Get me club No. 7.

282
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,000
No. 7?

283
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,959
The third one from the left.

284
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,400
Jingjing,

285
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,760
you've been here for a while.

286
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:31,760
Are you used to it now?

287
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,400
Not really.

288
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,719
They don't really let me do anything.

289
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,079
I have so much free time.

290
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,640
I finally got him

291
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:40,199
to bring me to a business event.

292
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,119
But then I screwed it up.

293
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,880
I heard that your drawing skills

294
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,239
are getting better and better.

295
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,239
Chief He must have snitched on me again.

296
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,079
I'm old.

297
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,079
Even my limbs are failing me.

298
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,599
Jingjing, do you want to have a try?

299
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,119
I don't know how.

300
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,520
Some businesses

301
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:09,680
are done on the court.

302
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Playing is also part of the trade.

303
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:14,880
Is it also

304
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,719
part of Gu Rong's work?

305
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,680
It is.

306
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,119
I'll have a go then.

307
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,800
Come. Have a try.

308
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,520
Jingjing.

309
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,199
You are pretty gifted at playing golf.

310
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,599
So, am I also gifted

311
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,239
at doing business?

312
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,800
What?

313
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:46,239
You want to help him with the company?

314
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,280
Of course.

315
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,880
But I don't know where to begin.

316
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,079
Jingjing,

317
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,800
did someone tell you anything?

318
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,359
Can't hide anything from you,

319
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,439
Grandpa Gu.

320
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,719
Do you like doing business?

321
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:10,280
Not really.

322
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,000
But I'm willing to try

323
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,479
if I can help him.

324
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,640
Jingjing, I understand

325
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,839
how much you love him.

326
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,760
But he can see it

327
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,640
if you are doing
something you don't enjoy.

328
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,800
Why force yourself?

329
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,199
But I'll only be good enough for him

330
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,640
if I can do that.

331
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,800
Jingjing,

332
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,560
think about it.

333
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,359
Does he like you

334
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,400
because you can help
him with the company?

335
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,239
He likes

336
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,680
your sincerity and honesty.

337
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,119
You don't need to make do

338
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,920
for other people.

339
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,640
Just be who you are

340
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,199
and do what you enjoy.

341
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,880
Doesn't that make
your life more meaningful?

342
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,400
The older, the wiser.

343
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:12,439
Thank you, Grandpa Gu.

344
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,959
I can do it.

345
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,880
Just sit back.

346
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,800
(You drove three hours)

347
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,880
(just to bring me here?)

348
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,239
(This place)

349
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,439
(is definitely for couples.)

350
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,079
(Did you have a crush on me?)

351
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,839
Why did you come here?

352
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,880
It smells too good.

353
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,160
You have an injury.

354
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,079
Go sit down.

355
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:18,439
I didn't know you cook.

356
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,839
The smoke is bad for your skin.

357
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,479
You shouldn't be in the kitchen.

358
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,160
Go back.

359
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,680
No.

360
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,719
I want to be here with you.

361
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,800
The water is there.

362
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,439
The phone is charged.

363
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,839
Call me anytime

364
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,920
if you need anything.

365
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,119
Be careful with your foot at night.

366
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,079
I'm off then.

367
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,800
Wait.

368
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,479
What if I drink some water

369
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,319
and want to go to
the bathroom at night?

370
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,040
What if I get hungry

371
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:05,959
and want to eat at night?

372
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,880
And...

373
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:08,560
You...

374
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,319
You left the phone here.

375
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:12,239
What if it falls under the bed

376
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,319
and I can't reach it?

377
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,400
Didn't you say I can
leave everything to you?

378
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,479
Well...

379
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,160
What should I do?

380
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,719
Stay.

381
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:45,719
Okay.

382
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:23,920
How is it?

383
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,680
Not well.

384
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:27,520
I called every restaurant

385
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,599
William visits often.

386
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,439
He didn't go to any of them.

387
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,479
We waited the whole afternoon

388
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,760
and he didn't show up.

389
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,760
Is it possible

390
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:38,000
that he doesn't want to work with us?

391
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,520
I don't think so.

392
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,800
Shengda wants to get into
the domestic market.

393
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,400
It's widely known

394
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
that this guy has a weird temper.

395
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,959
I'm not surprised by
what happened today.

396
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,719
I think we should make the project plan

397
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,520
as good as possible.

398
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,760
It's always competence that counts.

399
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,719
Are you tired?

400
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,040
Let's go eat something.

401
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,479
It's late. You should go back and rest.

402
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,839
I'm off then.

403
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,319
(What are you drawing?)

404
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:37,040
Just doodling, looking for inspiration.

405
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,959
Did you miss me?

406
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:43,959
Of course.

407
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,000
(Good. Keep it up.)

408
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
I'll hang up if you act like this.

409
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,239
Don't!

410
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,520
I have a gift for you.

411
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,560
There's an exhibition of toys

412
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,959
in the exhibition hall.

413
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,160
I bought you a ticket.

414
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,560
Really? It's so hard to get!

415
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,839
How did you get it?

416
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,239
(Xie Te'll bring the ticket to you.)

417
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,560
Who is it?

418
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,359
Gu Rong, I forgot my coat.

419
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,079
(Who is it?)

420
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,439
Probably the cleaning lady.

421
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,119
I'll go have a look.

422
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,839
(Don't stay up. Go to bed.)

423
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:33,520
Your coat.

424
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,000
Anything else?

425
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:38,599
No.

426
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:40,040
Good night.

427
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,760
Mr. Gu is so thoughful.

428
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,479
He did this for you
even on a business trip.

429
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,040
Thanks, Xie Te.

430
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,560
Go back to Ai Mi now.

431
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,199
Now that Gu Rong's not here.

432
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,439
You can finally take a break.

433
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,079
You know me so well. I'm off then.

434
00:27:59,239 --> 00:27:59,640
Just go.

435
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,359
Bye.

436
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,959
Stop there!

437
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:40,760
It's so dangerous.

438
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:41,479
Just leave him.

439
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,079
Yeah.

440
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:44,640
Jingjing, are you okay?

441
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,239
Of course I am.

442
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,280
My heroine, thank you.

443
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,520
I'm not a heroine.

444
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,160
I just know some kung fu.

445
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,520
You should check your phone.

446
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,479
Kung fu?

447
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:58,760
I've always been interested in it.

448
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:01,000
I even had a kung fu teacher

449
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,520
in the US.

450
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,199
So we share the ideals.

451
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,599
Share the ideals?

452
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,439
Means we are the same.

453
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,920
No. We are not the same.

454
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,040
I came to China

455
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,599
to find someone to teach me kung fu.

456
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,119
Can you teach me?

457
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,719
I'm not qualified to teach anyone.

458
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,839
But my family has a martial club.

459
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,920
Really?

460
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,160
That's great.

461
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,199
Can I pay a visit there?

462
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,000
My name is William.

463
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:33,199
This is my contact.

464
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,599
(William's business card)
Please let me pay a visit

465
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,680
to show my gratitude.

466
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:42,719
Fine.

467
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,640
My dad will be so happy

468
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,000
if you come.

469
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,319
Great. I'll go tomorrow.

470
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:51,920
Tomorrow?

471
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:54,640
Tomorrow...

472
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,599
Jingjing, you hurt your hand.

473
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:02,199
It's okay. Just a scratch.

474
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,920
I'll send you to the hospital.

475
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:08,839
Sorry. I can handle this.

476
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:13,160
Call me.

477
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,800
Who is that guy? You can't let him come.

478
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
He's a foreigner.

479
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
A foreigner who loves kung fu like me.

480
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,280
He just met you. And then
asked to go to your home.

481
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,959
And he touched your hand.

482
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:28,280
Mr. Gu had specified
before he left that...

483
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,040
What?

484
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,640
I guess he can tell you himself

485
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,439
when he's back.

486
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,079
Your hand's injured.

487
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,800
It's all that guy's fault.

488
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,199
And you even agreed to
let him go to the club.

489
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,760
He's not a thief.

490
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,199
Xie Te.

491
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:44,359
Did you spend too much time with Gu Rong

492
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,040
and catch some of his inhospitality?

493
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,319
That's not true.

494
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,040
Mr. Gu cares about you a lot.

495
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,400
They worked till late
at night yesterday.

496
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,959
And he still remembered
to ask me to send the ticket.

497
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,000
They?

498
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,040
Yeah. Miss Bai and him.

499
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,520
Bai Anrou?

500
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,319
Who is it?

501
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:09,760
(Probably the cleaning lady.)

502
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:10,640
(I'll go have a look.)

503
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,520
(Don't stay up. Go to bed.)

504
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,359
What's wrong?

505
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,160
Nothing. Just go.

506
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:23,000
Jingjing.

507
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:24,680
She's injured and mad.

508
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,439
This month's bonus is gone for sure.

509
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,920
I...

510
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,719
Why do you want me?

511
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,319
This private restaurant
makes good shrimp.

512
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:58,839
Try it.

513
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,479
Work can wait. Try the shrimp.

514
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,280
This project plan is good.

515
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:18,239
Sufficient market research.

516
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,400
And very convincing too.

517
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,199
Now all we need is him.

518
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,959
What did you just say?

519
00:32:32,272 --> 00:32:34,288
(Xie Te)

520
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,400
(Mr. Gu, I asked around)

521
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,319
and found out

522
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,520
that William is probably at Ninghai.

523
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,800
I came all the way here

524
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,280
and he went to our company?

525
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:48,400
Mr. Gu.

526
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,880
Well...

527
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,479
There's another thing.

528
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,719
What is it?

529
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,800
Su Jingjing hurt her hand

530
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:58,719
while catching a thief.

531
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,520
What? She was catching a chief?

532
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,199
How is she?

533
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,079
It's a little serious.

534
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,400
Where are you going?

535
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,719
You are not waiting for William?

536
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,359
I found him.

537
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,079
Well? Did you miss me?

538
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,680
Why are you back?

539
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,079
I need to see your hand.

540
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,599
Are you okay?

541
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,680
It's just a small cut.
It doesn't even hurt.

542
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,000
Don't do that anymore.

543
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,520
You'll make me worry.

544
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,959
Don't worry.

545
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,239
It's no big deal for me.

546
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,239
That was the eighth thief

547
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,800
I caught in my life.

548
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,800
The eighth?

549
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,320
Yeah. Awesome, right?

550
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,840
Amazing.

551
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,879
Amazing.

552
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,919
Have you waited long?

553
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,080
Are you hungry?

554
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,320
I am.

555
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:28,159
What do you want?

556
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,120
Mom's braised pork.

557
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,159
Let's go home.

558
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,080
Braised pork is waiting for us.

559
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:39,760
Let's go.

560
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,959
I'll make you Snail Rice Noodle.

561
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,439
Okay?

562
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,280
Let me help you.

563
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:06,000
Were you really alone

564
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,280
on this trip?

565
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:12,760
Bai Anrou was there too.

566
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:14,520
But she went on her own.

567
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
I didn't know she'd go.

568
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,959
I admit

569
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,760
she did come to my room that night.

570
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,159
But I didn't let her in.

571
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,040
She came to fetch something.

572
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,439
I didn't tell you

573
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,199
because I didn't want you to get mad

574
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:31,560
or think too much about it.

575
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,239
Are you mad?

576
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:44,520
I am.

577
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,840
But not because of her.

578
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:48,439
I'm mad

579
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,199
because we should trust each other

580
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,719
now that we're together

581
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,639
instead of hiding something.

582
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,800
I promise.

583
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,479
I won't hide anything from you anymore

584
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,080
no matter what happens.

585
00:36:12,944 --> 00:36:16,368
(Su's Martial Club)

586
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,719
Morning.

587
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:21,520
Morning.

588
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:30,840
Is that friend of yours

589
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,000
the reason why you hurt your hand?

590
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,399
Xie Te snitched on me again.

591
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,120
Then he doesn't need to come.

592
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,879
He must want something else.

593
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,360
What's that nonsense?

594
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,679
Eat your breakfast.

595
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,719
You have work to do.

596
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:49,600
No.

597
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:53,040
Mr. Gu.

598
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,879
You'll be late for the morning meeting.

599
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,719
We'd better go now.

600
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,320
Come on. Time to work.

601
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,040
You'll be late for the meeting.

602
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:04,520
And you.

603
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,320
Stop snitching on me.

604
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,439
I'm not.

605
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,159
Come on.

606
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:16,600
Hurry up. You are late.

607
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,199
Be careful on the road.

608
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,159
Don't worry.

609
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:30,040
Come home early.

610
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,560
I'll come back as soon as I'm off work.

611
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,399
I'm leaving then.

612
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,080
Okay. Bye.

613
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:34,760
Bye.
