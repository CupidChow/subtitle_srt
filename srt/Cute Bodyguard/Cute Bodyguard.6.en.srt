I can't even recognize it.

I made it. It should be my son.

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,320
I designed it, remember?

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,520
It's my son.

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,679
I made alteration when making it.

You can't deny my part.

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,559
Fine. I won't argue with you about that.

It's our son then.

46
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,279
It is then.

47
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,800
You didn't have dinner?

48
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,720
The fridge is empty.

49
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,720
I'll go get something for you.

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,119
Wait. Let's go together.

51
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,639
How can you go out like this?

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,600
It's okay. I want to take a walk anyway.

53
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,399
It's pretty cold at night.

54
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:54,199
(Why is he looking at me like that?)

55
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,000
(He likes me?)

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,199
(What's wrong with me?)

57
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,839
(How can I think of
something like that?)

58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,399
What are you thinking?

59
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,720
Nothing.

60
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,399
What did my dad say about your sprain?

61
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,000
Soft tissue bruise.
It's fine. Don't worry.

62
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,480
It's really not serious?

63
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,399
How can it not be?

64
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:26,079
It hurts so bad when I walk.

65
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,079
Really?

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
I told you I can ride a bike.

67
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,119
You wouldn't listen.

68
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,040
I'll go take the bike now.

69
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't bother.

70
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,079
It's nice to take a walk like this.

71
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,040
Let's go.

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,239
Aren't you hungry?

73
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,799
At our pace,

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,440
those restaurants would close
long before we get there.

75
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:59,440
It's not safe to ride
a bike in the dark.

76
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,679
Don't you think

77
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,839
you are a little different
than when you just came here?

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,519
How?

79
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,399
You stayed away from
everyone when you got here.

80
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:12,920
Even if I'm an exception
to your illness,

81
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:16,119
you'd never be so close to me.

82
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,119
Who's close to you?

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,839
Why are you embarrassed about it?

84
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,519
Watch out! Make way!

85
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,440
Didn't I tell you

86
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,320
it's not safe to ride a bike at night?

87
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,959
It's you?

88
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,000
Ai Mi. We...

89
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,640
What are you doing?

90
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,160
Here it comes.

91
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:24,799
Thank you.

92
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,279
You're welcome.

93
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:36,600
Mister.

94
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,839
Do you have a bathroom here?

95
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,079
I want to wash my hands.

96
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,839
Why would I have a bathroom

97
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,000
as a small stall?

98
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,519
Do you have water?

99
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,079
Yeah. Here.

100
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,920
Are you seriously

101
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,559
taking Gu Rong to this place?

102
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,440
This is the only place that's open.

103
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:00,480
Going out in the middle of the night.

104
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,000
Getting your arms all around him.

105
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,079
What a bodyguard you are.

106
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,880
My arms weren't around him.

107
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,559
It was you.
Can you be more careful on the road?

108
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,000
I was careful. It was you.

109
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:14,000
Fine. Let's eat.

110
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,040
Go ahead.

111
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,320
Thank you.

112
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,679
Is your foot okay?

113
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,920
Yes. It has nothing to do with you.

114
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,480
Ai Mi.

115
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,799
Why were you still on the road?

116
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,079
Where were you going?

117
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,559
I was going to your place.

118
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:51,600
To my place?

119
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,040
I have good news.

120
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
What good news?

121
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,839
I'm going to have a boyfriend.

122
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,239
Boyfriend?

123
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,760
Who is it? Do I know him?

124
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,000
Not yet.

125
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,880
But you'll meet him soon.

126
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,839
How soon?

127
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,519
I'll bring him to you

128
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,480
after we officially get together.

129
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm so envious.

130
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,239
I want a boyfriend too.

131
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,799
How hard can that be?

132
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,799
Yours

133
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,399
is right in front of you.

134
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,359
I meant her senior.

135
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,599
Oh. Didn't you go with him

136
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,119
to the signing session?

137
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,359
You were going to confess, right?

138
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,760
You made so many preparations, right?

139
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,080
Don't even mention it.

140
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,400
I didn't confess.

141
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,599
And I missed the signing session again.

142
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,799
What happened this time?

143
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,239
It was just bad luck.

144
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
Okay.

145
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,119
Don't be upset.

146
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,000
He's not going anywhere.

147
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,400
If you're determined to confess,

148
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,520
there are loads of opportunities.

149
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,039
That's true.

150
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:12,599
But he's doing so well with his career.

151
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,559
I'm afraid

152
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,080
some other woman will take him away

153
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,039
before I confess.

154
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,039
I need to hurry up.

155
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,280
That's right.

156
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,280
Mr. Gu.

157
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,559
You need to help her on this.

158
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,000
You'll be doing a great thing

159
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,960
if they end up together.

160
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,080
What's wrong with you?

161
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,280
I don't know.

162
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:45,679
It's just my chest.

163
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:50,239
Can you be more specific?

164
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,880
It's a little...

165
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,039
A little stuffy in my chest.

166
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,520
Good morning.

167
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,200
It's you again?

168
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,080
I'm not welcomed by you, right?

169
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,880
You do see through people, Mr. Han.

170
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,799
Mr. Gu.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,200
If you can be nicer to other people,

172
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
you might recover sooner.

173
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,760
Thank you so much for your advice.

174
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Senior.

175
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:51,840
Why didn't you tell me you'd come?

176
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,239
I...

177
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,520
Master.

178
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,760
I asked him to come.

179
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,479
What a great help you are.

180
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,520
What did you say?

181
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,880
I asked him here to help me.

182
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,559
With what?

183
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:06,280
Help you?

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,799
Why are you laughing?

185
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,239
What's wrong with him?

186
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,919
He's weird.

187
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,479
The anniversary of your encounter?

188
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,119
No. The 30th anniversary
of our encounter.

189
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,359
I want to celebrate the 30th year

190
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,599
she's been in my heart.

191
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,599
I want to make
a grand celebration for her.

192
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,320
Master.

193
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,840
You are pretty romantic.

194
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,599
Mister.

195
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,760
How would you like to do it?

196
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,679
My plan is

197
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,599
to recur the scene

198
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,760
of our encounter.

199
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,679
Dad, didn't you say

200
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,880
you first met my mom

201
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,080
in a disco hall?

202
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
That's right.

203
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,400
Where are we going to find one now?

204
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,719
We don't find one. We build one.

205
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:09,599
Build?

206
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,359
I want to build the same disco hall

207
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,679
in our living room.

208
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,840
Our living room?

209
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,760
Yes.

210
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,359
Not only will I recur the scene

211
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,719
in our living room,

212
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,919
I'll also build

213
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:21,960
my old self

214
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,840
with the same

215
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,239
clothes, makeup,

216
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,799
and props.

217
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,359
And I'll make a delicious dinner for her

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,039
as a surprise.

219
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,159
The point is,

220
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,440
you three have to help me today.

221
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,400
Dad.

222
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,919
That is great.

223
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,640
If only my other half in the future

224
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,000
can do this for me.

225
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,280
Wake up.

226
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,239
Stop day dreaming.

227
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,159
Only an unhappy person

228
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,640
will say mean things like that.

229
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,840
At least I have someone in my heart.

230
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,440
You have no one.

231
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,200
Don't interrupt me.

232
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,640
Come on.

233
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,400
Get your spirit up for this.

234
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,440
There can be no mistakes.

235
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,200
Yes.

236
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,359
Let's split into two teams.

237
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,080
One team gets the materials.

238
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,760
The other one stays here to set up.

239
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,919
Dad. I'm good at that. I'll stay.

240
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,599
Mister.

241
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,679
My foot hasn't fully recovered yet.

242
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,000
I'll stay too.

243
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,280
Gu.

244
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,039
It's understandable for you to stay.

245
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,400
But Jingjing,

246
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,440
you can't stay.

247
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,039
You weren't even born at the time.

248
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,400
You don't know what it's like.

249
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,640
I'll have to stay here

250
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:38,479
to rebuild the scene.

251
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,440
How about this?

252
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,960
Senior and I go buy the materials.

253
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,520
I... I can go too.

254
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,799
My foot is almost healed now.

255
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,280
No, it isn't.

256
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,440
Don't make your injury worse.

257
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,840
Just stay here.

258
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,840
That's right.

259
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,559
Right?

260
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,119
Gu, I appreciate that.

261
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:57,039
You are very active.

262
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,520
That's a good thing.

263
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,679
But you should stay.

264
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,919
Okay. Jingjing and I will go.

265
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,559
She knows what Mistress likes to eat.

266
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,479
I'll be the one

267
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,479
to bring them all back.

268
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,039
Okay.

269
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,520
That's it then.

270
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,840
We'll set off now.

271
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,280
I have something to tell you anyway.

272
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,320
Go.

273
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,640
We're off then, Master.

274
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:15,799
Okay. Hurry up.

275
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:19,599
Don't be upset.

276
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,239
He's not going anywhere.

277
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,719
If you're determined to confess,

278
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,760
there are loads of opportunities.

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,479
(Is she going to confess again?)

280
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,640
(No way.)

281
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,799
(Who would confess at the market?)

282
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,080
(But what does she
have to tell him in private?)

283
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,200
(The way she looks at him, it's...)

284
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,799
Mister.

285
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,280
What is it, Gu?

286
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
What should I do?

287
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,799
Just wait here. No hurry.

288
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,719
I need to think about this.

289
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,200
To rebuild the scene.

290
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,200
This over here.

291
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,159
And over there...

292
00:15:15,184 --> 00:15:17,392
(First place)

293
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:22,359
Gu. Don't touch it.

294
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:23,440
Put it back.

295
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,080
Just put it back.

296
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,719
Let me tell you.

297
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,679
This is Ran's gift to Jingjing

298
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,159
when he got a prize for the first time.

299
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:33,400
Jingjing values it a lot.

300
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,679
She'll get mad if you break it.

301
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,799
Go do something else.

302
00:15:55,472 --> 00:16:01,968
(Certificate of Merit for Han Ran)

303
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,000
(What's wrong with me today?)

304
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,760
(Certificate of Merit for Han Ran)
(What's that got to do with me)

305
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,119
(if she'll confess or not?)

306
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,679
Gu!

307
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,640
Don't!

308
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,679
Put it back.

309
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,880
Don't touch these things.

310
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Let me tell you.

311
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:24,159
Ran and Jingjing

312
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,599
used this sword

313
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,000
when they were learning martial arts.

314
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,479
Jingjing likes it so much.

315
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:30,320
She'll be upset if you break it.

316
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,679
They even called themselves

317
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,320
the legendary twins back at the time.

318
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,400
Senior.

319
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,559
Can I be your girlfriend?

320
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,359
Say yes!

321
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,520
Say yes!

322
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,119
Say yes!

323
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,719
Yes.

324
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,119
Yeah!

325
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,680
Mister, I need to go out.

326
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,599
Where are you going?
It's not finished yet.

327
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,319
I... I need to go buy some flowers.

328
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,280
You must have flowers

329
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,839
on a day like this, right?

330
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
You are so right, Gu.

331
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,640
Is your foot okay?

332
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,599
It doesn't matter
as long as she's happy.

333
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,760
It's almost healed anyway.

334
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,239
Good kid. Thank you so much.

335
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,199
I'm off then.

336
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,079
Gu. Well.

337
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,119
Can you do me a favor?

338
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,439
I want to borrow some of your clothes.

339
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,319
Whatever.

340
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,640
Clothes, shoes, glasses.

341
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,079
Anything.

342
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:11,680
Okay.

343
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,160
Anything you want.

344
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,239
Be careful.

345
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,239
Such a good kid.

346
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,359
Xie Te, get some flowers

347
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,199
and send them to the martial club

348
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,400
before 6:00 PM.

349
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,384
(Su's Martial Club)

350
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,920
I'm so sorry, senior.

351
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,160
I missed the signing session again,

352
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:38,599
and made you worried sick
for a whole night.

353
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,839
You said you have something to tell me.

354
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:41,800
Is that it?

355
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,640
It's fine.

356
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,400
As long as you came back safe.

357
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
You are just trying
to make me feel better.

358
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,760
I have something to tell you too.

359
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,359
I do need your help now.

360
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,800
Help?

361
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,359
With what?

362
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,839
I'm going to write a book
about western literature theories.

363
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,359
I need to do a lot researches.

364
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,599
Can you help me?

365
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,479
Thanks a lot, my little assistant.

366
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,599
No worries.

367
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Senior.

368
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,280
Do you think we look like

369
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,959
my parents now?

370
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,400
I mean they often

371
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,199
come to the market together too.

372
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,880
They always love each other deeply.

373
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,439
I can make something for you, senior.

374
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,079
Pick whatever you want.

375
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,599
Don't bother.

376
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,119
Let's just pick what Mistress likes.

377
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:30,160
It's not a bother.

378
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,760
I can make meals for you every day.

379
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
What do you want to eat, senior?

380
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,160
Eggs? How about tomato soup with eggs?

381
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,680
Such a sweet guy like you.

382
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,439
Being all gentle and nice

383
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:44,520
to every girl

384
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,680
that comes your way.

385
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,959
Do you know what distance means?

386
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,479
(You probably like it a lot)

387
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,680
(being surrounded by girls, right?)

388
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:55,088
(Market)

389
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,359
Move.

390
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,479
Excuse me.

391
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,800
What are we going to buy?

392
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,239
Parrots? Tomatoes?

393
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,719
The cucumber is fresh.

394
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,640
Do you want it?

395
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,439
This looks pretty fresh.

396
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:30,199
Yes.

397
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,199
These just came in.

398
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,160
Can I get it cheaper?

399
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,359
What are you doing?

400
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,760
Why did you destroy my vegetable?

401
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,199
I'm sorry. I'll pay for it.

402
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,400
The price is low.

403
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,760
Hey, you.

404
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,079
Mistress will be so happy

405
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,040
when she sees the dinner

406
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,119
Master makes for her.

407
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,439
We forgot the chicken wings.

408
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,239
My mom loves it.

409
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,400
It's over there. Let's go.

410
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,640
What's wrong with you?

411
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,760
Why are you picking out
mung bean in multigrain?

412
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,640
What are you doing?

413
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,280
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,199
Is the chicken wing fresh?

415
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,160
Yes.

416
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,839
Did it come in this morning?

417
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,199
It did.

418
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,288
(Post on Weibo)

419
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,839
My book?

420
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,479
Thanks.

421
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah.

422
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,040
Let's go, senior.

423
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,560
We want some oranges.

424
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,640
Okay. These just came in.

425
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,400
Are they fresh?

426
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,400
Of course.

427
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,160
We'll pick some ourselves.

428
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:47,400
Okay.

429
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,280
Get a few more.

430
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,760
It smells so good.

431
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,280
I'll take it, senior.

432
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,640
It's not heavy. I can do it.

433
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:55,119
It's okay.

434
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:55,560
I can handle it.

435
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,239
I'll do it.

436
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,479
You want this one?

437
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,400
I'll pick them up.

438
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,079
I can do it.

439
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,239
Some are squished.

440
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,640
That's okay.

441
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,920
You like that girl?

442
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,280
No.

443
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,560
I've been like that before.

444
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:13,280
It won't work just hiding from her.

445
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,319
Why would someone like me

446
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:17,839
like her?

447
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,560
There's no shame in it, young man.

448
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,199
Do you have trouble breathing

449
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,520
and feel stuffy in your chest

450
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,199
when you see her

451
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,680
with another man?

452
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,880
That's love.

453
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,839
You need to tell her.

454
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,520
What's wrong?

455
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,680
Somebody fainted!

456
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,079
Young man!

457
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,680
Jingjing, if I ever made
you misunderstand...

458
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,359
Help!

459
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,520
What happened there?

460
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,839
Let's go have a look, senior.

461
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:01,119
Wake up, young man.

462
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,640
Mr. Gu?

463
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:03,479
Young man.

464
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,319
Mr. Gu?

465
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,000
You know him?

466
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,760
Mr. Gu.

467
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,040
Mr. Gu.

468
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,479
What happened?

469
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,800
(Why did I have to
pass out in front of him?)

470
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,079
(That's so embarrassing.)

471
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,119
Are you feeling better, Mr. Gu?

472
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:27,160
Of course he is.
See how fast he's walking.

473
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,719
Didn't he say

474
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,439
he'll stay home to help Master?

475
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,119
Why did he go to the market?

476
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,719
Yeah. I was too occupied
with waking him up

477
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,040
and forgot to ask him.

478
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,599
Jingjing.

479
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,719
Do you think he treats you in a way...?

480
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:47,000
What? You mean he likes me?

481
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,079
How can that ever happen?

482
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,119
Like you said.

483
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:52,040
We are from two different worlds.

484
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:55,079
With that being said,

485
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,160
but I just feel
he's acting weird to you.

486
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,079
He is.

487
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,239
He always looks at me

488
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,719
like looking at a maid.

489
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,479
But I'm used to it now.

490
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,000
(Wait.)

491
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:18,199
(Why is senior suddenly
so concerned about Gu Rong?)

492
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,040
(Is he jealous?)

493
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,640
(Su's Martial Club)

494
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,680
Dad, we are back.

495
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,280
What took you so long?
Look what time it is now.

496
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:34,400
We had a little accident.

497
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,160
But it's okay.

498
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:37,239
We are all here to help you.
We can still make it.

499
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,119
What accident can you
have in the market?

500
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,079
Well.

501
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,400
Gu.

502
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,520
Why are you with them?
Where are the flowers?

503
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,719
Flowers?

504
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,800
Did you go to the market for flowers?

505
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,359
Is broccoli flowers now?

506
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,400
Don't worry, mister.

507
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,880
It'll be here soon.

508
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,160
Dad.

509
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,719
Don't just stand here. Get in.

510
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Go set up the living room.

511
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,640
Move it.

512
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,560
Hurry up.

515
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,839
(Did you get the flowers?)

516

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,439
Jingjing? She's out.

691
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,600
Ran left. She went to show him out.

692
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,760
She put on a brand new dress

693
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,719
when she left.

694
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,959
Really?

695
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,560
Yeah.

696
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,399
No wonder

697
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,199
I haven't seen her.

698
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,840
Right.

699
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,199
Gu.

700
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,040
Gu.

701
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,639
What's wrong?

702
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:23,120
No. It's nothing.

703
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,399
Gu.

704
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,280
You can talk to me about everything.

705
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:28,159
You know?

706
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,360
Xia.

707
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:31,120
Let's bring the fruits upstairs.

708
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:31,879
Okay.

709
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,360
Okay?

710
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,120
Let me tell you.

711
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,000
This dishwasher is great.

712
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,159
It works wonders

713
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,159
when cleaning the fruits.

714
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:41,919
You don't have to worry about
pesticide left anymore.

715
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,199
I knew.

716
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,000
Let's go.

717
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,520
You can take it.

718
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,040
♪The passing summer left a secret♪

719
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,919
What is it, Gu?

720
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,959
Cheer up.

721
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,000
I feel weird in my heart lately.

722
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,479
You startled me.

723
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,239
Don't give him a heart attack.

724
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,399
How can that be?

725
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,360
That's no minor illness.

726
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:14,280
Can you be more specific?

727
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,639
It's because of

728
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,439
a friend.

729
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:20,760
Friend?

730
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,159
What friend?

731
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,199
Just a regular friend.

732
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,600
I feel stuffy in my chest

733
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,320
whenever I see her with other people.

734
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:35,800
It's a girl, right?

735
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,959
And you saw her with a guy?

736
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,679
Gu.

737
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,199
This is not illness.

738
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,600
I know.

739
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,159
This is love.

740
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,399
One-sided love.

741
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,479
One-sided love?

742
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,439
Yeah.
