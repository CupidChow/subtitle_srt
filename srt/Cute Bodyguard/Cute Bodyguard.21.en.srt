Sweet Su.

30
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,360
Our daughter has grown up.

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,839
She has to live her own life after all.

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,239
We were young

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,959
too.

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,039
What path our daughter will choose to go

35
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,759
and how she will go through,

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,279
we can't replace her to make the choice.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,240
I'm trying to convince myself

38
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,399
to be an open-minded mom.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,479
Let's do this together!

Gu

is a nice guy.

43

Being with him,
our Jingjing won't be wronged.

44

You can trust me.

45
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,199
And the students are coming.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,800
When they are here,

47
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,360
how do you arrange them?

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,600
If they don't move out,

49
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,240
where do you think the students live?

50
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,559
Yeah, we should take care of

51
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,839
the safety of those children.

52
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,800

58
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,639
Take a break.

59
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:47,240
Sit down and have a glass of water.

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
Your house is in minimalism style.

61
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,039
I don't even know

62
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,639
where to put my toys.

63
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,759
From now on,

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,119
this house will be in Su Jingjing style.

65
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,520
I want to see "you"

66
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,679
in every corner.

67
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,199
In every corner?

68
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,440
And from now on,

69
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,320
you are the hostess of the house.

70
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,279
I would listen to you.

71
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,399
You don't have to listen to me.
Understand?

72
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,720
Then I'll have to think about that.

73
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,760
I want a super big closet!

74
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,640
Okay, a super big closet.

75
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,640
I'm going to put my blind boxes

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,440
and my figures
in every corner of this house.

77
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:42,679
That couldn't be better.

78
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,160
Come on.

79
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,519
Go!

80
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
Come in.

81
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,559
Gu Rong, do you have any extra pajamas?

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,440
Lend me one.

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,320
I didn't bring my pajamas.

84
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,000
Take your pick from the closet.

85
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,640
I knew you are still up.

86
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,040
Let's work overtime together.

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,880
What are you doing dressed like that?

88
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,799
It's either a suit
or a shirt in your closet.

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,679
Then I can only choose this one.

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,799
Where is your charging cable?

91
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,839
In the drawer. I'll find it for you.

92
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,480
Did you find it?

93
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,359
The cable is buried so deep.

94
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,000
Gu...

95
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,399
What are you doing?

96
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,399
Nothing.

97
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,279
You are being so weird tonight.

98
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,079
Nothing. You get busy.

99
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:12,480
Your cable is too short
and I'm going back.

100
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,040
Come in.

101
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,279
Mr. Gu, I won't even indulge myself

102
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,160
to drink this red ginseng drink.

103
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,760
Now I'll give it to you.

104
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,359
To me? Why?

105
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,440
I've heard it.

106
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,080
You start to live with Su Jingjing.

107
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,919
It's a little bit...

108
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,719
But you should
pay attention to your body.

109
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:49,599
Still water runs long.

110
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,599
I don't need it. You take it back.

111
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,799
You drink it with Ai Mi.

112
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,840
Well, Mr. Gu, I...

113
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,679
Why are you being so polite to me?

114
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,760
Let me see.
Imported with original packaging.

115

116
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,719
Come on. Drink it.

117
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,239
Easy.

118
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:13,840
Here.

119
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,280
Mr. Gu.

120
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:14,880
Take it.

121
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,359
You drink it.
If you can't, then share it with Ai Mi.

122
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,799
If you don't have enough, just tell me.

123
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,559
Okay.

124
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,799
Go. I'll get it for you.

125
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,479
Maybe I should save you two bottles.

126
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,760
I don't need it. I'm busy.

127
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,840
Well...

128
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,640
Go find Ai Mi.

129
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Then take care.

130
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,159
Ai Mi is waiting for you. Just go!

131
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,200
(Gu Group)

132
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,119
Ai Mi.

133
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,000
Jingjing.

134
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:46,479
What are you doing here?

135
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,760
I've known you for over 20 years.

136
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,599
I've never seen you work so hard.

137
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,159
It's noon break.

138
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,119
I'm afraid

139
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,200
you're the only one working in Gu Group.

140
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,400
Okay, don't make fun of me.

141
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,200
What are you doing here?

142
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,840
I made ginseng chicken soup this morning

143
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,719
for Xie Te.

144
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,799
I see now.

145
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,760
I knew it when I saw your box.

146
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,559
I'm really jealous of Xie Te.

147
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,280
When is he going to marry you?

148
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:19,159
I want to know too.

149
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,159
Then you might want to make him hurry.

150
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,479
If he doesn't make it fast,

151
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,200
I'm about to take you from him.

152
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,200
Stop it.

153
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,479
About marriage,

154
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,440
if Xie Te doesn't mention it,

155
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,640
I can't just ask him to propose.

156
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,400
You can give some hints.

157
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Hints?

158
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,559
On weekdays,

159
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,640
I can eat lunch made by my girlfriend.

160
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,000
How wonderful it is!

161
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,559
If you like it,

162
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,640
I can make it for you every day.

163
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:57,960
Thanks, baby.

164
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,280
Did you notice

165
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:03,000
the envious eyes of those single people

166
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,239
at my office?

167
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,280
Are you silly?

168
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:07,760
I'm the happiest man in the Gu Group.

169
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
I feel so good

170
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,039
about being in a relationship right now.

171
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:14,280
We can't just be in a relationship.

172
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:16,960
Yeah, I have to take actions

173
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,039
to cherish you.

174
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:26,440
If I wear this dress,

175
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,400
would I look prettier?

176
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,599
Sure.

177
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,599
My baby looks pretty in anything.

178
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,719
I have a meeting.

179
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,239
If you like it,

180
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,679
then you can walk in by yourself.

181
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
I am leaving.

182
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,400
Walk in by myself?

183
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:08,016
(10 days before the anniversary)

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,359
Stop what you're doing for a moment.

185
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:16,599
I'll make an announcement.

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,679
Mr. Lin Yaozhong

187
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,880
has decided to cooperate with us.

188
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,880
He will fully cooperate
with the theme activities

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
of the anniversary event of Fanfun Mall.

190
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:26,159
Great!

191
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,960
Awesome.

192
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,960
Awesome.

193
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,840
Jingjing.

194
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,080
Your design proposal

195
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,280
is going to be put in place.

196
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,479
Thank you!

197
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,479
Thank you for inviting Mr. Lin Yaozhong.

198
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:39,080
In order to ensure that the cooperation

199
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,080
will go smoothly,

200
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,679
all the colleagues
working on the project

201
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,760
will have to sign
this confidentiality agreement.

202
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
There must be no disclosure

203
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,400
of the key elements

204
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,799
before the event begins.

205
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,320
Hand them out.

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,359
Here.

207
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:51,960
Thank you.

208
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,039
Pass them around.

209
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,159
Here you are.

210
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,000
Here you are.

211
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,960
What's wrong?

212
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,159
I've worked on this poster

213
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,960
many times.

214
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,679
(Anniversary Poster)
But I still don't quite satisfy with it.

215
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,919
Probably because the picture is 2D,

216
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:26,159
so I found it very rigid,

217
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,239
not vivid enough.

218
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,239
Who says a poster has to be 2D?

219
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,039
Look.

220
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,200
The width of the poster
cannot be changed,

221
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,599
but you can make a breakthrough
on longitude.

222
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,159
In fact, sometimes
the so-called creation bottleneck

223
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,359
is nothing more than
the shackles set by yourself.

224
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,080
Once you believe it,

225
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,719
you'll never get out.

226
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,400
You can refer to

227
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,080
the image effect of projection.

228
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,239
I see. Thank you, Director Du.

229
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,599
I'll fix it right away.

230
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,159
Tomorrow, we can

231
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,280
start to arrange exhibitions

232
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,559
in a small section of the mall.

233
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,159
I'm looking forward to your poster.

234
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,760
Don't worry.

235
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,679
I'll work all night today.

236
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,479
I have to get this done.

237
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,840
Cheer up!

238
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,719
Rest assured.

239
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:25,880
Director.

240
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,280
Here you are.

241
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:27,840
Okay.

242
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,152
(Project Confidentiality Agreement)

243
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,119
This Su Jingjing is really amazing.

244
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,000
Not only can she be Mr. Gu's girlfriend,

245
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,599
but also gets along well
with Director Du at work.

246
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,559
She is sociable.

247
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,400
No wonder she got
that important project.

248
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,599
If she is not capable,
she can't take it.

249
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,400
Let's just finish

250
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,640
what we have at hand.

251
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,599
Get on with it
or we'll have to work late.

252
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,719
What? It can't be done today?

253
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,080
Yes, I know the proposal

254
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,440
didn't arrive until this afternoon.

255
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,719
But we have to start
to arrange the exhibitions tomorrow.

256
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,400
I have to get it today no matter what.

257
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,280
Right, it is just a preliminary plan,

258
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
but I...

259
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,119
You're the printing supplier
for Gu Group, right?

260
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,520
If what she asked for

261
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:39,919
doesn't arrive tonight,

262
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,599
let's terminate the agreement then.

263
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,640
Here you are.

264
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,479
Impressive.

265
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,559
Don't worry.

266
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,640
The chairs should be arranged neatly.

267
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,200
Okay.

268
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,320
The two sides of the strip
must face each other.

269
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:02,799
No problem.

270
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,719
Just put the ladder over there.

271
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:05,359
Okay.

272
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,599
Hang up everything over there.

273
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,080
Okay.

274
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,400
Be gentle with the blind boxes.

275
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,679
Give me a hand here.

276
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,039
Okay.

277
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,799
I need another chair here.

278
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,400
Here.

279
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:24,960
Thank you.

280
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,000
Jingjing.

281
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,520
In fact, as a designer,

282
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,640
you do not have to be hands-on.

283
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,559
I want to make sure everything is okay.

284
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,799
I want to get involved in

285
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,200
the things I designed.

286
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,359
It's okay.

287
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,239
Okay.

288
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,880
Let me have a look first.

289
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:42,760
Okay.

290
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:57,799
Align them.

291
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,359
Okay.

292
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,920
Basically nothing's wrong.

293
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,000
But the gate

294
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,239
is the first area to come into view.

295
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,400
Keep it simple

296
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,599
and pay attention to details.

297
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,400
Remember to follow up

298
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,199
on this issue.

299
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,079
Thank you, Director.
I got it all memorized.

300
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,599
Will ten chairs be enough?

301
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,160
Yes.

302
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,800
Let's open the main poster.

303
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,359
Okay.

304
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,599
How come...?

305
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,920
What's going on?
Where's the main poster?

306
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,239
I remember I have
handed it over this afternoon.

307
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,560
Director, well...

308
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,119
This is just to see the whole picture

309
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,719
as a backup.

310
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,800
The 3D main poster

311
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,520
designed by Su Jingjing
this time is quite complicated,

312
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,319
and the design
was completed this afternoon,

313
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,719
so there is no time to replace it yet.

314
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,640
It will be officially
exhibited tomorrow.

315
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,640
It hasn't been replaced yet.

316
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,880
What's wrong with you?

317
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,439
Don't make such a stupid mistake

318
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,280
ever again.

319
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:04,599
Jingjing.

320
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,160
Now the design is complete.

321
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,160
You go get it.

322
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:07,959
Okay.

323
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,319
There's a backup copy in the flash drive
on Director's desk.

324
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,920
Okay, I'll go get it.

325
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,439
I'm done here.

326
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,400
All right, I'm done here too.

327
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:26,280
(Anniversary Poster)

328
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,199
The chairs should be all aligned.

329
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,280
Okay.

330
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,239
What are you doing here?

331
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,079
Beyond my imagination.

332
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,719
This design of yours

333
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,079
will definitely help Fanfun

334
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,719
to make a successful transformation.

335
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,839
It's also crucial for Gu Group.

336
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,959
It's just a poster,

337
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,439
not as important as you said.

338
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,959
All right, I have to go to work.

339
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,160
No way! Take a good rest.

340
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,560
No matter where you are,

341
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,040
I'll be with you.

342
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,280
Then you can stay late with me tonight.

343
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,680
Nine o'clock?

344
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:40,359
Did you turn off my alarm?

345
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:41,359
You have to be responsible for me.

346
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,760
I have to go to work.

347
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,560
If I'm not responsible for you,

348
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,160
then who will be?

349
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,719
Don't make fun of me now.

350
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Why hasn't Mr. Gu answered his phone

351
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,439
since last night?

352
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,359
No. Turn around.

353
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,880
Let's go.

354
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,199
Come on.

355
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,560
Why do you want me?

356
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,199
We didn't want you
and you didn't want us either.

357
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,040
Everything is an illusion.

358
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:07,920
You go on.

359
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,439
Why didn't you explain that to them?

360
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,119
I'm sure they all got the wrong idea.

361
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,119
We're living together now.

362
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,560
What should we explain?

363
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,079
Mr. Gu, something bad happened.

364
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,439
(News about event of Dimon Group)
This one and that one.

365
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,280
Let me see. What's going on here?

366
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,199
Here.

367
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,599
This is the mall theme exhibition
of Dimon Group.

368
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,040
Their promotion

369
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,280
is all over the place now.

370
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,640
Most important of all,

371
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,040
their themed dolls

372
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,599
are almost identical to the image

373
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,719
of the secret figure of blind boxes
Lin Yaozhong designed

374
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,920
for Fanfun mall's anniversary.

375
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,160
What's going on?

376
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,880
How did it happen?

377
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
What's the matter?

378
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,560
Chief He.

379
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,760
Get all the directors here
for a meeting now.

380
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:04,640
And

381
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,520
bring me the press kit from Dimon.

382
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,640
I'll see it later.

383
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,439
Liu,

384
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,800
tell all the staff
involved in this project

385
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
to come to
the conference room immediately.

386
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,800
Okay.

387
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,000
Director Du.

388
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:16,640
You are in charge of this project.

389
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,079
I want to know

390
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:19,400
your backup proposal at the meeting.

391
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,680
Okay.

392
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,839
It's fine.

393
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,280
We can work it out.

394
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,239
Don't be sad.

395
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:52,680
Guys,

396
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,959
any backup proposal?

397
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,599
Dimon acts so quickly.

398
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,319
Now some blind boxes

399
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,839
have entered the blind box machines
in some shopping malls.

400
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,719
And they are the regular ones.

401
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,479
Now even if we just move up

402
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,880
the Fanfun's anniversary event,

403
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,160
I'm afraid...

404
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,920
In fact, we paid great attention to

405
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,680
protect the secrecy
of Lin Yaozhong's design.

406
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,880
For safety reasons,

407
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,359
the blind boxes have been in my office

408
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,719
since they were flown
back from Singapore.

409
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,839
I haven't even seen them myself.

410
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,439
This is a big deal.

411
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,520
It definitely will affect
our Group's interests.

412
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,319
Right.

413
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,479
Who have been in your office?

414
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:30,920
Check the monitor.

415
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:31,680
Okay.

416
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,479
How could it be her?

417
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,239
Yeah.

418
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:02,319
Why?

419
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,280
Miss Su.

420
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,439
Why did you

421
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,800
show up there at that time?

422
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,239
We need to know your side of the story.

423
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,359
I did go to Director Du's office,

424
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,280
but I just went to take
a digital copy of the poster.

425
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,040
It's clear from the monitor footage,

426
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,280
that there's no one else.

427
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,880
It makes no sense
for you to deny it now.

428
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,760
Your behavior

429
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,640
not only offends Lin Yaozhong,

430
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,359
but also causes a serious impact

431
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,040
on the Gu Group.

432
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,160
Yeah, the most effective thing for now

433
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,400
would be a public apology
from Su Jingjing.

434
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,760
If we don't reassure
our customers first,

435
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm afraid Gu's share price

436
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,520
will suffer.

437
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,079
You have reasons to be suspicious of me.

438
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,359
After all, I showed up
at Director Du's office

439
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:54,400
at a wrong time.

440
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,719
But I think it's important

441
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,400
that we find out what happened.

442
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,239
If I have anything to do with it,

443
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,760
then I will not excuse myself.

444
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,319
But in this case,

445
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:05,760
I didn't do it.

446
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,800
Why would I admit it?

447
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,199
About if this has anything to do
with Jingjing,

448
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,359
I will find a stronger proof

449
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:14,839
than taking all your anger

450
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:15,760
out on a little girl

451
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,160
without any proof.

452
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,479
Mr. Gu.

453
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:21,079
We're just discussing it.

454
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,000
Forgive us if there is
anything wrong with our words.

455
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,479
But

456
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,880
as the CEO of the company,

457
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,359
your top priority

458
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,560
is to consider the best for the company.

459
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,160
I'm the CEO of Gu Group,

460
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:36,239
so I can't just

461
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,560
jump to conclusions like that.

462
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,839
If you have to find someone

463
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,000
to blame,

464
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,319
it can be me then.

465
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
It was me who sent Su Jingjing

466
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,839
to my office that day.

467
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,199
This responsibility

468
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:57,040
cannot be left to Su Jingjing alone.

469
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:02,160
And just a footage

470
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,359
cannot tell anything.

471
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
There is still a more important issue.

472
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,239
What about the Fanfun's anniversary?

473
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,920
We'll hold it as usual.

474
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:23,359
Gu Group always has a plan B.

475
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,359
(Xie Te)

476
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,640
Mr. Gu, terrible!

477
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,280
What's going on? Take a breath.

478
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,599
Senior Gu suddenly fainted.

479
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Grandpa, you're awake.

480
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,599
If you faint,

481
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,479
then you should go to the hospital.

482
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,280
These people are lying again.

483
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,479
I just had high blood pressure.

484
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,920
And,

485
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,000
I know the best about my own body.

486
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,479
Be careful.

487
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
I know about Fanfun.

488
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,959
How's it now?

489
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,239
You can rest assured.

490
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,079
Don't worry about it while I'm here.

491
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,719
You just have a good rest at home.

492
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,800
It's a blessing in disguise.

493
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:26,359
This matter

494
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:30,719
shows that someone
has evil intention from the beginning.

495
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,599
You should know it clearly in mind

496
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,920
and take this opportunity

497
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,520
to thoroughly find out

498
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,119
the mole in the company.

499
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,680
Yes, I think so too.

500
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,959
What's wrong?

501
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,880
The board of directors
is a tough nut to crack, right?

502
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,199
Did they embarrass Jingjing?

503
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:58,920
Don't worry.

504
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,359
Jingjing

505
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,280
is much stronger than we thought.

506
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,439
Besides, I will definitely be
on her side.

507
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,160
Don't worry.

508
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,880
All that matters right now

509
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,920
is your plan B.

510
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,040
Grandpa fell asleep?

511
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,119
But he's not in the best shape yet.

512
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,680
The doctor said
to let him have a good rest.

513
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,719
In this period,

514
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,160
I'll stay with you to be with grandpa.

515
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,880
Okay.

516
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,839
By the way, let me show you something.

517
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,000
I made some last-minute changes

518
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,400
to the alternate proposal
of the anniversary event.

519
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,880
(Anniversary Event)
See if you can use it.

520
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,199
If I can save some losses of Gu,

521
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,760
I will feel better.

522
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,479
Okay.

523
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:04,239
Anything you say.

524
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,920
I made some reservations

525
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,000
in the poster design this time,

526
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,599
but I also made
some changes in the content.

527
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,160
I've also made some changes

528
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,640
to the immersive section experience.

529
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,560
But it won't be a huge job.

530
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:22,920
We can keep

531
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,199
the simple blind box treasure hunt.

532
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,880
Oh, I have a general idea of

533
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,719
the new blind box image.

534
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,040
See if it's...

535
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,719
Okay, don't worry about Grandpa.

536
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,079
The doctors will take good care of him.

537
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,479
Well...

538
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,880
What are you going to do
about the company?

539
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,040
I'll take care of the company too.

540
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,640
I'm going to find out

541
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,040
who disclosed those designs to Dimon.

542
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,959
Have you heard from Dimon yet, Xie Te?

543
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,239
Yes.

544
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,880
Dimon said they started

545
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,599
the production a month ago.

546
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,599
And they said that
if we ever interrupted them again,

547
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,560
they would safeguard their rights
through legal means.

548
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,680
They are good at
turning the facts upside down.

549
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,359
Dimon's designs

550
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:43,239
and Lin Yaozhong's designs

551
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,280
are exactly the same.

552
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,119
Even a coincidence

553
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,319
can't be so exact.

554
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:50,319
They stole our designs

555
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,199
and wanted to sue us.

556
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,079
How can they

557
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
say such shameless words?

558
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,160
But I also checked with the printshop

559
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:56,040
Dimon works with.

560
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,040
They did

561
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,079
start printing the packaging
a month ago.

562
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,199
I checked the date

563
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
and it was the day after
we signed the contract with Lin Yaozhong

564
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,560
and confirmed the size.

565
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,239
Do you mean

566
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,640
there is a mole in the company?

567
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,000
There are eight days left

568
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,160
until the Fanfun's anniversary event.

569
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:21,079
Let's solve the problem first.

570
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,680
Xie Te, when we arrive,

571
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,000
ask Du Yuchuan to come to my office.

572
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,199
Okay.

573
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,199
Now we have two things to do.

574
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,160
First, block the news.

575
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,160
I made Xie Te alert all departments

576
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,119
to keep it confidential.

577
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,719
We must not let news

578
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,760
about Lin Yaozhong's designs

579
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,119
being released by Dimon

580
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,079
spread out.

581
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:57,280
Exactly.

582
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,560
Lin Yaozhong has many fans.

583
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,119
If they hear about it,

584
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,719
there'll be great disturbance.

585
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,359
Moreover,

586
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:08,359
we need to find out right now

587
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,400
how exactly the designs got disclosed

588
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,359
to Dimon.

589
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,319
Otherwise, we'll meet the same problem

590
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,239
if we design another draft.

591
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:18,079
No matter who in the design department

592
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,599
disclosed the designs,

593
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,880
as the director of
the Design Department of Gu Group,

594
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,319
it's my fault.

595
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,199
If you need someone to blame,

596
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,839
then blame me.

597
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,959
Director Du, this is not your fault.

598
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,280
The top priority

599
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:32,920
is about finding out the truth.

600
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,359
You can't escape
the responsibility of management.

601
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:37,119
But now is not the time

602
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:38,280
to discuss your responsibilities.

603
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,400
I understand.

604
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:42,040
But the designs are decided
by Design Department

605
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,760
and Lin Yaozhong personally.

606
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,439
All members in the Design Department
have signed

607
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,760
a strict confidentiality agreement.

608
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:50,000
All designs and confidential documents
handled by the Design Department

609
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,000
will never be disclosed.

610
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,000
By rights, such problems
should not arise.

611
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,680
Unless...

612
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,000
Unless what?

613
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,400
Unless one faces the lure
of greater benefits,

614
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,520
one would take such a risk.

615
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,520
Tell me more about
your internal division of labor.

616
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,400
Who can get

617
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,400
Lin Yaozhong's design draft?

618
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,040
Zhang Ting is in charge of

619
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,560
the receipt and delivery
of the design draft.

620
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,000
She is also in charge of
contacting the printshop.

621
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,760
So now the biggest suspect
is Zhang Ting.

622
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,359
In the monitor footage,

623
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,920
you went to Director Du's office
to get the flash drive.

624
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,160
Who told you to?

625
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,040
Zhang Ting.

626
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,599
But I don't think

627
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:48,439
that proves

628
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,880
that it was Zhang Ting
who colluded with Dimon.

629
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,959
I haven't been
in the Design Department that long,

630
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,920
but from what I know about Zhang Ting,

631
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,359
I don't think she's the type
to do something like this.

632
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,000
I don't believe
Zhang Ting would do so either.

633
00:32:58,719 --> 00:32:59,839
She has been working
in the Design Department

634
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:00,880
for more than two years,

635
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,319
and her work has been the best.

636
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,439
I see.

637
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,599
Give me a copy
of all the information on Zhang Ting

638
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,439
since she joined the company.

639
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,680
All right, I'll organize it

640
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,040
and send to your mailbox.

641
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,800
Alright, you can go back to work now.

642
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,920
Director Du.

643
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,520
I think the company

644
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,000
would not fire Zhang Ting

645
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,280
without finding out any proof, right?

646
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,040
I don't believe it was her.

647
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,520
No.

648
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,680
Don't you trust your Mr. Gu?

649
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:08,399
Okay, let's get this out of your head.

650
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,479
The most urgent thing we need now

651
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
is an alternative proposal.

652
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:13,639
Go get busy.

653
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:15,439
Okay.

654
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,040
I'll go back to my seat.

655
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:31,439
Miss Zhang.

656
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,320
Who would have thought that?

657
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:35,600
I am telling you.

658
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,679
See? The biggest suspect

659
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,239
not only has the protection from Mr. Gu,

660
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,840
Director Du is also on her side.

661
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,399
Right, an accident on the design draft

662
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,120
has such a great influence on Gu Group.

663
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,719
Right.

664
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:46,760
I just don't like it

665
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,280
when people who are
really capable are ignored.

666
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,199
But those who got some relationship
are put in important positions.

667
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,520
See how capable Miss Zhang is. Right?

668
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,280
Right.

669
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,439
Miss Zhang, take a look at

670
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,399
this proposal.

671
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,120
What's wrong?

672
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,879
I don't know.

673
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,320
Come in.

674
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:26,959
Have a seat.

675
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:41,800
Water.

676
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:49,600
Director Du.

677
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:51,959
Just tell me what you have to say.

678
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,879
I am prepared.

679
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,800
Our Design Department has to answer

680
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,919
to the board of directors

681
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,199
for the design stealing matter.

682
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,879
So you want me to take the blame, right?

683
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,479
I believe you didn't do it.

684
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,439
But that day,

685
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,199
you did send Su Jingjing

686
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,000
to my office to take the flash drive.

687
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:23,800
So between me and Su Jingjing,

688
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,679
you chose to give up on me.

689
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,000
Zhang Ting.

690
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,639
You're a smart girl.

691
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,040
Once this charge is put into practice,

692
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,199
it will be much harder for you
to go to another company.

693
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,560
Director Du.

694
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,439
I know this is difficult for you.

695
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,199
You can let me go.

696
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:48,439
But let me get it clear.

697
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,320
I really didn't give Dimon the designs.

698
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,080
I, Zhang Ting,

699
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,600
am a decent person.

700
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:57,679
I sent her to your office
to take the flash drive.

701
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
So what?

702
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,239
I admit

703
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,239
I don't like Su Jingjing.

704
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,639
I don't like her entering
Gu Group all of a sudden.

705
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,479
As Mr. Gu's girlfriend,

706
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,919
she has a lot of opportunities.

707
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,679
But I will not play with
the interests of the company.

708
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:15,199
I understand.

709
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,439
If you want,

710
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,159
I can recommend you a new job.

711
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,120
Director Du.

712
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:29,479
Thanks for your kindness.

713
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,719
Leaving Gu Group,

714
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,360
I believe

715
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,439
I can find a nice job with my ability.
