I know during this period,

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,440
Gu Rong and you get along very well.

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,199
And I believe you can do it.

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,040
As long as you ask for it,

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,080
Gu Rong will listen to you.

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,119
Grandpa Gu, Gu Rong and I are not...

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,440
Gu Group's finance team

35
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:14,559
and legal team are here.

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,279
Think it over.

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,279
Let them know what you want.

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,360
Before she said yes,

39
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,919
don't let her leave.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
Don't forget
she is good at martial arts.

41
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,199
Okay.

42
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Chairman.

43
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,039
Try to satisfy whatever she wants.

44
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,199
I just want Gu Rong
to be back home as soon as possible.

45
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,720
Yes, chairman.

46
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,919
You care about Mr. Gu so much.

47
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,320
I believe one day,

48
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,160
Mr. Gu

49
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,039
will understand your consideration.

50
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,800
I hope so.

51
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,960
Hello, are you sunbathing?

52
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,679
Hello, aunt.

53
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,800
We'll cook as soon as we are home.

54
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,880
Okay.

55
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,720
Su.

56
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,559
What are you doing in such a hurry?

57
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,759
Honey, something bad happened.

58
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,399
Jingjing is missing.

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,080
Gu, isn't Jingjing with you?

60
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,600
No.

61
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,160
I went shopping with ma'am.

62
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,160
Isn't Jingjing at home?

63
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:48,839
No.

64
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,720
I called Jingjing.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,960
Her phone is off.

66
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,320
Jingjing never turns her phone off.

67
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,880
We've been out of contact for hours.

68
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,639
Why don't you call Ai Mi?

69
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,119
Maybe she's at Ai Mi's.

70
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,320
I did.

71
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,320
Ai Mi said Jingjing didn't find her.

72
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,800
I'm afraid
that something happened to her.

73
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,800
I am so worried.

74
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,119
Don't talk nonsense.

75
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,320
What's wrong?

76
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,080
I can't contact Jingjing.

77
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,839
Right.

78
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,679
She's still here
drinking plum syrup in the afternoon.

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,279
Really?

80
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,919
Where did she go after drinking?

81
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:12,839
Right.

82
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,720
There are a lot of people back then.
Let me think.

83
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,040
Think it over.

84
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:16,880
Think it over.

85
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,160
She... Right!

86
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,359
A group of men in suits came

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,559
and took her away.

88
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,040
A group of men in suits?

89
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,239
Is there anything wrong with that?

90
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,959
Mister and ma'am.

91
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,519
I know where Jingjing is.

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,559
Don't worry.

93
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,440
I'll be sure to bring her back.

94
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:34,839
It's okay.

95
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,239
There's no problem, right?

96
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,959
Don't worry.

97
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,600
Is she okay?

98
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:46,920
Mr. Gu.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,119
(Is my grandpa in the office today?)

100
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,359
No, he went out at noon.

101
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,320
What's wrong?

102
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,239
(Bye.)

103
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,000
What happened?

104
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,040
What's wrong?

105
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,920
Nothing.

106
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Mr. Gu asked me

107
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,640
if the chairman is in the office.

108
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,359
The chairman.

109
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,119
Miss Bai.

110
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,839
Is there anything wrong with Mr. Gu?

111
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,399
I'll go out for a minute.

112
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,359
What happened?

113
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,079
Ms. Su.

114
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:37,440
As long as you're willing to cooperate,

115
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,239
you are free

116
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,760
(Bank Check)
to fill in the amount on this check.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,880
That sounds familiar to me.

118
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,040
The same thing happened

119
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,600
when that guy first came to my home.

120
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,279
If there's anything else you need,

121
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,640
you can just tell us.

122
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,519
We have
our financial and legal team here.

123
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,239
We will do our best to satisfy you.

124
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,839
The only thing I ask

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,440
is to leave me alone.

126
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,320
Ms. Su, before you think it through,

127
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
you can't leave.

128
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,000
What do you mean?

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,920
Jingjing.

130
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,119
Jingjing.

131
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,160
Stop it!

132
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,399
You!

133
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,079
You!

134
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,799
Stay still.

135
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,839
Stay still.

136
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,160
If you don't want to be frozen...

137
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,239
Stay still.

138
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,880
What are you doing here?

139
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,079
I'm here to protect you.

140
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,519
You still dare to move.

141
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,760
Stand back.

142
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,160
Stand back.

143
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:21,920
You dare to move.

144
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,600
Mr. Gu, stop!

145
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Mr. Gu, stop it!

146
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,640
Gu Rong.

147
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,320
Gu Rong, you finally come back.

148
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,079
I was just about to ask you

149
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,040
why you brought Su Jingjing here?

150
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,559
If I don't invite Ms. Su here,

151
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,600
you won't even be here.

152
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,359
You had Chief He chasing me around,

153
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:49,160
and took people
to Su's Martial Club to fight.

154
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,720
I put up with all that.

155
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,640
But if you want to hurt Su Jingjing,

156
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm not going to ignore it.

157
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,600
Gu Rong.

158
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:58,119
Do you think Ms. Su
is really suitable for you?

159
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,359
There are too many
great girls around you,

160
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:05,079
and you get used to them.

161
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,679
You just like Ms. Su

162
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,559
on a whim.

163
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
I know my feelings

164
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,519
to Jingjing well.

165
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:22,279
She may seem ordinary,

166
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,720
but she is kind and simple,

167
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:27,119
and never forces me to do anything.

168
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,720
I have haphephobia since I was a kid.

169
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,000
But Jingjing is an exception to me.

170
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,359
I have no concerns
when being around her.

171
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,440
I don't have to play the role
as Gu Zhenhua's grandson.

172
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,200
I don't have to play the role

173
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,640
as the sole heir to Gu Group.

174
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,760
I just have to be me

175
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,200
as Gu Rong.

176
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,840
So I'm willing

177
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:58,200
to be a simple person for her.

178
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,280
I just want her to be happy every day.

179
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:07,039
You grew up in privileged circumstances.

180
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,919
Do you really think

181
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
you can live forever at Su's home?

182
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,200
Grandpa Gu.

183
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,919
I don't think you know about Gu Rong.

184
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,960
At first I was like you,

185
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,440
thinking Gu Rong

186
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,440
was just a pampered boy.

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,039
You're my bodyguard,

198
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:53,880
so you have to practice every day

199
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,799
in order to maintain your strength.

200
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,080
It's your family rule and my guarantee.

201
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,080
So you have to get up
at 5:30 every day to run.

202
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,960
No exceptions.

203
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,119
Mr. Gu, don't you think it's tiring?

204
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,200
No.

205
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,719
Ms. Su, run faster.

206
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,559
Ma'am's electromobile

Right, Su Jingjing.

208
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,080
Faster.

209
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,960
You are cruel!

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,760
Hello, Grandpa Su.

211
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,599
Hello, Grandpa Su.

212
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,119
Hi, morning.

213
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,479
Su Jingjing.

214
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:31,880
Yes.

00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,039
What happened?

218
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,200
Why is there no hot water?

219
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,359
Why are you blushing?

220
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,599
You're dressed like that
in the middle of the day.

221
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm worried about you catching a cold.

222
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,799
I don't think there's any problem with
dressing like this when washing my hair.

223
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Go and boil the hot water for me.

224
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,679
Pay for gas if you didn't.

225
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,000
And pay the water bill as well.
All of them shall be fully paid.

226
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,280
Don't you have any common sense?

227
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,239
Hurry up!

228
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,799
But Gu Rong made his efforts

229
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,400
to let me see a different person.

230
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,200
He went jogging
with my dad in the morning.

231
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,880
He practiced martial arts with my dad.

232
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,119
He ate buns for only 1.5 yuan each

233
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,719
with my dad.

234
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,520
He enrolled members for my mom.

235
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,960
When he was free,

236
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,599
he also helped
Uncle Li next door to walk the dog.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,679
He no longer shows off his money,

238
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,640
or holds his head high.

239
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,080
He takes care of other's feeling,

240
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,039
and cares about everyone around him.

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,280
A Gu Rong like him,

242
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
why can't he stay with me?

243
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:11,919
So do you mean that you accept me?

244
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,440
Idiot.
Don't I make it obvious enough to you?

245
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,320
So from today,

246
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,280

247
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,119

Chairman.

259
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,719
You did not break them up,

260
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,359
but offered the help.

Chairman, everything's ready.

266
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,239
That kid

267
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,919
didn't even call me
Grandpa the whole time.

268
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,599
Don't be angry. Take a sip of tea.

269
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,280
What has this girl

270
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,440
done to Gu Rong?

271
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,640
He doesn't even want to go home.

272
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,440
Gu Rong was raised by you.

273
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,080
He won't leave you.

274
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,479
But, Chairman...

275
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,559
Say it.

276
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,479
At first I thought Gu Rong

277
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,880
was just on a whim.

278
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:06,799
Now he seems

279
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,919
to like that Martial Club very much.

280
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,280
And he's changed a lot.

281
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,119
I need more time

282
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:14,599
to persuade him to go home.

283
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,080
How dare he?
He has just got a girlfriend,

284
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,640
and he's not going home anymore?

285
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,559
Chairman, this..

286
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,599
But this kid

287
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,200
is serious about Su Jingjing.

288
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,880
Let's talk about it in a couple of days.

289
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:27,880
But...

290
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't know why we are here.

291
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,719
We're here to do things
that a couple will do.

292
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,200
Mom, come after me.

293
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,479
Baby, slow down. Where's your mom?

294
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,760
Do you lose your mother?

295
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,359
Mom can't find me.

296
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,760
You can't find me.

297
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,880
Baby, you're being naughty again.

298
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:11,599
So cute.

299
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:12,440
You can't be that naughty.

300
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:13,200
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,280
My boy is so naughty.

302
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,080
It's alright.

303
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,159
Say goodbye to them.

304
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,520
Goodbye.

305
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,119
Bye.

306
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:20,679
Bye.

307
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,640
Bye.

308
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,320
Let's go.

309
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,880
Let's go shopping.

310
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,479
Towels, toothbrushes...

311
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:49,520
Is this what a couple will do?

312
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,599
Right. Get couple models.

313
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,919
Shouldn't we do so?

314
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,359
And pajamas.

315
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,440
But there's no need
to buy that many items.

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,919
It's okay. Not that many items.

317
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:10,320
What are you doing?

318
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,400
There's no need to buy two sets of cups.

319
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,359
What a waste!

320
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,280
One for water
and another one for teeth brushing.

321
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,679
No waste at all!

322
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,760
But we have already had

323
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,400
the pajamas, cups and toothbrushes.

324
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,159
We don't need to buy them.

325
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,039
If you don't want to spend money,

326
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,840
you should've said yes to my grandpa

327
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,359
and taken that check

328
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,440
to fill in 10 million yuan,

329
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,799
and then come to find me.

330
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,799
All right, one last item.

331
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,280
And then I'll take you

332
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,679
to a place you're sure to like.

333
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,880
Let's go.

334
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,880
Okay.

335
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,239
Let's go.

336
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,559
So from today,

337
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,280
Su Jingjing,

338
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,799
you are my girlfriend.

339
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:25,280
Pretty girl, are you alone?

340
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,760
Maybe we should have a drink together.

341
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,319
Sorry, I don't like this wine.

342
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,760
You haven't even had a drink.

343
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:39,280
How do you know you don't like it?

344
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Come on. Do me a favor.

345
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,520
I drank and I know I don't like it.

346
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,239
Do you know how expensive this wine is?

347
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:52,839
Do you know who I am?

348
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,560
I am Mr. Charming...

349
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,079
Who are you? Get off me.

350
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:58,880
Sorry.

351
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,319
My friend got drunk.

352
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,079
But l think

353
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,280
you can drink more.

354
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,920
You know what? It's my treat.

355
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,359
Okay.

356
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,680
You're good.

357
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,760
If you are here
because you want me to thank you,

358
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
I will apologize to you.

359
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:28,959
I'm not in the mood.

360
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,839
But if you want another drink,

361
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,000
then it's my treat.

362
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,959
I don't need more alcohol.

363
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,439
I just had a few drinks with my friends.

364
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,359
If there's anything

365
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,959
you want to talk to me,
I'd love to listen.

366
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,560
I don't think

367
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,079
we're familiar with each other.

368
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,880
You might as well talk about it.

369
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,839
Maybe I can help.

370
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,839
What will you help me with?

371
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,319
Help me break up
Su Jingjing and Gu Rong?

372
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,800
I can't help you with that.

373
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,079
And I won't.

374
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,800
If you want to vent your frustration,

375
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,239
I can have drinks with you.

376
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:34,520
I let Xie Te ask around.

377
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:35,719
This shop has the largest number

378
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,880
and the most complete variety

379
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,280
of blind boxes.

380
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,319
In terms of probability,

381
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,880
there should be a high chance
to get secret figures

382
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,640
in a shop with
such a large number and variety.

383
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Let's try.

384
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,400
You see this princess series.

385
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,599
Its secret figure

386
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,880
is called Jelly Princess.

387
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,959
She's super cute, pink and clear.

388
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:58,199
And this... this ninja series

389
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,719
is super hard to get.

390
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,400
Even Ai Mi's shop doesn't have it.

391
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,719
Try this.

392
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,520
You can guess it by sound?

393
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,560
Its secret figure

394
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,760
is one centimeter
shorter than the regular model.

395
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,560
It feels a little bit different.

396
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,439
Try it.

397
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
If that works,

398
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,800
then everyone can get a secret figure.

399
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
It doesn't make sense to do business.

400
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:31,000
It is not always so accurate.

401
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,079
Each of blind box has different

402
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,160
materials, styles,
weights and touch feeling.

403
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,800
Especially the secret figures

404
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,640
are definitely
not like the regular ones.

405
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,160
As long as I feel it with my heart,

406
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm sure I can get it.

407
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,760
This is my very own secret technique.

408
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,920
Then you teach me.

409
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,599
It's a good time for me to have a try.

410
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:55,920
Pick a light one.

411
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,640
This is of a bit of weight.

412
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Try this.

413
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:00,719
This?

414
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,640
Are you alright?

415
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,640
I don't want you to take care of me,
I'm okay.

416
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,319
Alright, I'll take you home.

417
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:15,239
Be careful.

418
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,680
Be careful.

419
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,199
Baby, are you okay?

420
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:34,959
Okay.

421
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,160
Baby, are you okay?

422
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,800
Watch out. Be careful.

423
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,719
Are you okay?

424
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,520
Yes.

425
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,880
I'm so sorry.

426
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,839
Do you like this?

427
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,040
Yes.

428
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:44,000
It's for you.

429
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,359
Thank you.

430
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,959
Thank you.

431
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:48,199
Bye.

432
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,079
Bye.

433
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,400
Bye.

434
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,640
Do you feel like you've cured

435
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,359
your haphephobia?

436
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,319
I think so.

437
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:08,319
Congratulations to Mr. Gu

438
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,640
for falling back to earth.

439
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,400
But you lost at least 10 million yuan

440
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:17,359
for pulling me back to earth.

441
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,599
Why are you still so happy?

442
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,199
I've been wanting to ask you

443
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:25,040
why you are
on the outs with your grandpa?

444
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,400
You gave up billions of yuan

445
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,800
and just wanted me, a stunning beauty.

446
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,160
Actually,

447
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,959
I don't intend to give up
inheriting the group.

448
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,719
I was having a hard time

449
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,800
interacting with people

450
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,319
because of the haphephobia.

451
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,520
And my grandpa

452
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,000
has forced me to obey him

453
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,959
without listening to me.

454
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,800
And those old men in the group

455
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,239
are hard to get along well,

456
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,040
even harder than
getting the blind boxes.

457
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,000
I think someone

458
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,880
would be more suitable
for this position than I am.

459
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,880
But I think

460
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,239
grandpa is your family after all.

461
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,280
He knows you have haphephobia,

462
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,479
and requires you to inherit the group.

463
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,000
It's not going to do him any good,
right?

464
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,479
So I think he did it only because

465
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,880
you're the person he trusts the most.

466
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,239
He trusts you the most, so he did so.

467
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:33,839
What about you?

468
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,400
Am I the person you trust the most?

469
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,959
No way!

470
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,239
Look at you.

471
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,079
You bought a bunch of them,

472
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,680
without even one secret figure.

473
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,439
Your probability is not working.

474
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,359
I don't think so.

475
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,959
I think I've found

476
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,640
the most precious secret figure.

477
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,479
I'm so lucky.

478
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,680
Ms. Bai, are you okay?

479
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,000
Be careful. Come.

480
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,839
Slow down.

481
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,959
Be careful.

482
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,680
You didn't bump into that, right?

483
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,479
Thanks for taking me back.

484
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,439
Ms. Bai!

485
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,920
What's wrong?

486
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,520
Be careful. Slow down.

487
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,599
Be careful.

488
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,280
Okay,
don't touch the water these few days.

489
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,079
Ms. Bai.

490
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,880
I don't know what happened

491
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,199
between you and Gu Rong.

492
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,680
But it's like waiting for the aurora.

493
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,599
Sometimes we don't need

494
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,160
to hold on to a result.

495
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,439
It's about the process, isn't it?

496
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,199
You drank too much. Go to bed early.

497
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,479
Have a good rest.

498
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,079
Check it out.

499
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,959
It's like a facial spa.

500
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,920
Right? You need to apply it often.

501
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,319
It makes you look younger. Right?

502
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,160
Jingjing is still out this late.

503
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,040
Do you think
it's okay for us to make facial masks

504
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,839
at home?

505
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,400
What's the problem?

506
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,560
Gu has sent us the message.

507
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,319
I don't trust Gu.

508
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,839
Why don't you trust Gu?

509
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,119
Gu is so good.

510
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,479
Do you think Gu is good

511
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,239
or the masks from him are good?

512
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,640
Look at you. You were bought off easily

513
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,239
by such a little favor.

514
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,920
You just said

515
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,760
this mask is so good,

516
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,520
and expensive items are of good quality.

517
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,119
Who said that?

518
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,479
Me. What?

519
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
You don't want to listen to it, right?

520
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,719
You despise me, right?

521
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,760
How dare you?

522
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,640
How dare you?

523
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,479
I am embarrassed. You...

524
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,239
Mom.

525
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:25,719
Wait.

526
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,040
You get up!

527
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,160
We're back.

528
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,319
Well, your mom's got a stiff neck.

529
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,800
My shoulder hurts.

530
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,560
It really hurts.

531
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,520
What happened this time?

532
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,680
It hurts.

533
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,400
What does that mean?

534
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,880
What happened?

535
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,920
What does that mean?

536
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,439
What does it mean?

537
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,160
What happened?

538
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,839
Your daughter is growing up.

539
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,800
Growing up?

540
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,560
What happened?

541
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:07,800
What happened?

542
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,959
They are in love.

543
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,640
Right?

544
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,119
You're right.

545
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
I am a considerate mom.

546
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,000
Tell me about it.

547
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,560
When did it happen?

548
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,640
How did it happen?

549
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,359
Tell me about it.

550
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,439
You!

551
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,920
Stop it!

552
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
Come back here!

553
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,560
Come and have a meeting.

554
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:02,880
Mister and ma'am, have a cup of tea.

555
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:12,800
Well, Jingjing is my daughter, right?

556
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,680
I know about her. She's a little grumpy.

557
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:19,040
And she's careless.

558
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,640
Dad!

559
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,560
Anyway...

560
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:25,239
But anyway,

561
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,359
she's our little girl.

562
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,880
That's right.

563
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:31,959
Since Jingjing chose you,

564
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,079
so I hope that you could

565
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,680
cherish her,

566
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:37,119
love her,

567
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,439
and protect her.

568
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,000
You can rest assured of that, mister.

569
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,280
Gu.

570
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,719
From now on,

571
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,319
you are no longer a tenant,

572
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,400
or an outsider.

573
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,000
You're my future son-in-law.

574
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,319
So this place...

575
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,839
You... How do I put it?

576
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:02,079
You can live as long as you want.

577
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,439
We don't charge you anything.

578
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,199
But I have to criticize you

579
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:10,959
for coming home so late
on the first day of dating.

580
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,239
What attitude is that?

581
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:16,400
Mister, we will be careful
in the future.

582
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,000
Let me tell you.

583
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,280
I'm an open-minded father. Right?

584
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,280
I have no objection to you two dating.

585
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,959
But I have rules.

586
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,920
If there is any behavior
crossing the line,

587
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:36,920
don't blame me for being ruthless.

588
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,400
Do you understand?

589
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,479
- Understand.
- Understand.

590
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,119
Alright, it's being late now.

591
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,199
You two

592
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:48,520
go back to your rooms and rest.

593
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,160
There's plenty of time for dating.

594
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:50,719
Go.

595
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,280
Your hands.

596
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,680
Mister and ma'am, good night.

597
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,959
Dad, Mom, good night.

598
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,319
He doesn't fall asleep so early, right?

599
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:37,640
I think she'll be awake at this hour.

600
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,599
In the middle of the night,

601
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,880
I can't just knock on his door.

602
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:07,400
No, I can't take it anymore.

603
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:27,119
- Why are you still awake?
- Why are you still awake?

604
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,280
I seem to have forgotten
to brush my teeth.

605
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,439
What a coincidence. Me too.

606
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,760
Then together.

607
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:54,640
I'll do it.

Use it or not.

613
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,880
Just do this.

614
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:13,160

(Good night.)

633
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,800
(Good night.)

634
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,280
No way.

635
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,879
We said good night

636
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,600
before we started chatting.

637
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,280
(What would you like to eat tomorrow?)

638
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,320
(I want to eat snail noodles.)

639
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,280
(What is snail noodles?)

640
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,479
(I can't believe you don't know)

641
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,800
(snail noodles that can give off
the tasty smell all around.)

642
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,399
(I don't know. What's that tasty smell?)

643
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,800
(There's one down the street,
it's really authentic.)

644
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,840
(Didn't you smell it
when you walked by?)

645
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:02,479
(But neither of my parents
like the smell,)

646
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,159
(so I can't eat it at home.)

647
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,719
(I'll buy you one tomorrow.)

648
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,320
(You're making me hungry right now.)

649
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:10,600
(Are you hungry?)

650
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,120
(A little bit.)

651
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,199
(Why don't we go down
and cook some noodles?)

652
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,040
(Okay.)

653
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,919
Surprise! You didn't expect me, right?

654
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,320
It's so worthwhile.

655
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,639
Great harvest!

656
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,719
I have a feeling

657
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,080
that you two will meet tonight.

658
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:05,760
This is a typical case

659
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,719
of waiting for windfalls.

660
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,120
You went out again and again.

661
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,399
Do you really think I'm sleeping?

662
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,000
How dare you try
to play tricks secretly?

663
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,120
I... I just came out
for a glass of water.

664
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,439
Your mother told this kind of lie

665
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,600
to your grandpa back then.

666
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:37,479
If it wasn't your grandpa,

667
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,520
you must be
three years older than you are now.

668
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,399
3 years!

669
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:45,439
I waited for three years. I...

670
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,520
Why would I tell them that?

671
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:51,959
I... I am not thirsty now.

672
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:52,959
Then I don't drink water.

673
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,399
I'm going to go back to bed.

674
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,600
You!

675
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,239
Mister, good night!

676
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:05,959
The older,

677
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,560
the trickier.

678
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,679
You're too young to play tricks.

679
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,879
You haven't left yet.

680
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,239
