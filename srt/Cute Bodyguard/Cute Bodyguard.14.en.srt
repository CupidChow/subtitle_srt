You are still here?

29
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,319
You're up.

30
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,320
Have some honey water
to ease the hangover.

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,559
I was about to make you breakfast.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,479
But you don't have
anything in the fridge.

33
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,800
So I just ordered a takeout.

34
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,880
Have some.

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm allergic to peanuts.

36
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,720
You can have it yourself.

00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,759
When you leave,

38
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,240
don't forget to shut the door for me.

39
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm going to work. Goodbye.

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,919

00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:38,919
when you were drunk.

42
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,880
Nothing happened yesterday.

43
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,960
And you are wrong about one thing.

44
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,039
However beautiful the journey is,

45
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,839
if we don't get what we want in the end,

46
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,520
it will still be a regret.

47
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,240

Where's Gu Rong?

51
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,000
He went to me

52
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,479
early this morning

53
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,919
and asked me what snails rice noodle is.

54
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,279
And I told him

55
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:47,800
it's just something like

56
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,360
the instant noodle.

57
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
I said, Jingjing loves that stuff.

58
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,880
And then he's gone.

59
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,440
No idea where he went.

60
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,119
He should be at the shop on the street.

61
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,080
I'll go get him.

62
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,520
But breakfast is ready.

63
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,520
You have it.

64
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,440
It took efforts to make this, you know?

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240

67
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,239
Jingjing, you came early today.

Mr. Zhang.

69
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,640
Did a young guy come here today?

70
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,760
No. I just opened up.

71
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,320
Do you want a noodle now?

72
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,839
Give me two.

73
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,200
My boyfriend's coming later.

74
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:45,799
You have a boyfriend?

75
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,679
I have to see

76
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,839
what kind of guy

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,839
can win you over.

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,679
Okay.

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,640
Why did you open up early today?

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,079
An old friend of mine

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
just reconnected with me.

82
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,519
He heard I have a shop here

83
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,559
and wanted to try it out.

84
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,320
He loves this too, huh?

85
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,279
Speaking of the devil.

86
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,760

Okay.

89
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,160
I'll bring your favorite in a second.

90
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,000

(That's right.)

95
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,040

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,799
With spinach, duck feet,

97
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,320
and mung bean soup as dessert.

98
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,079
- Almost forgot the snails.
- Your snails.

99
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,559
Almost.

100
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,600
Thank you.

101
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,399
Gu.

102
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,279
Guess what?

103
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,959
That girl over there likes snails

104
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,000
just like you.

105
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,720
Not many people order that in my shop.

106
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,959
That was the last bit for today.

107
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,760
Just have it, Jingjing.

108
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,959
When the next batch

109
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,040
comes in,

110
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:17,920
I can send it over to you.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,359
It's okay. Don't worry.

112
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,519
Okay.

113
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,239
(He likes it too?)

114
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,200
(Well.)

115
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
(He's Gu Rong's grandpa after all.)

116
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,760
We can share this.

117
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,200
How did you know about this shop?

118
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,040
The owner came from Liuzhou.

119
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,959
I met him when I was in Guangxi.

120
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,679
You've been there?

121
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,519
Does the noodle over there

122
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,160
taste even better?

123
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,119
To be honest.

124
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,920
This is not as good as
the noodle in Liuzhou.

125
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,559
It's probably because of the water.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,720
Look.

127
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:22,160
The broth is not good enough.

128
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:25,640
That's a shame.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,320
I really want to go there

130
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,920
and taste the noodles.

131
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,200
Strange though.

132
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,040
You like this noodle so much.

133
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:32,959
But why doesn't Gu Rong

134
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,799
even know what this is?

135
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,399
He probably doesn't like the smell.

136
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,040
You've asked him?

137
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,760
- Well.
- How do you know he doesn't like it

138
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,399
if you didn't even ask him?

139
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,119
I don't want to force
my interests on him.

140
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,079
I want to give him the best.

141
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,040
Taking over the company

142
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,959
is his best choice.

143
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,239
But you can't force
good things on him either.

144
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,559
Besides,

145
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
he never said he wouldn't take it over.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,160
Did he tell you that?

147
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,359
Is he coming here later?

148
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,200
He...

149
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,079
(Jingjing, I'm going back home.)

150
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,640
(Where are you? Where?)

151
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,880
He's not coming. So no chance to fight.

152
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,440
Actually,

153
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,719
I think you two just need communication.

154
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,640
You don't know

155
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,960
what each other's thinking.

156
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,320
And neither of you gives in.

157
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:45,880
When he just came to my home,

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
he was a troublesome guy.

159
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,880
A total headache.

160
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,880
But now,

161
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,039
he'll even repair the couch with my dad.

162
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,640
So, I think

163
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,919
he's not that headstrong.

164
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,880
He must have his reasons

165
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,479
if he doesn't want something.

166
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:00,919
You two might just need to sit down

167
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,520
and have a good talk.

168
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,359
You are his real grandpa after all.

169
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,239
You are his real grandpa, right?

170
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:11,440
I am.

171
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,000
There you go.

172
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,239
If that doesn't work,

173
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,719
just give him a bowl of
river snails rice noodle.

174
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,919
There's nothing

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,520
it can't solve.

176
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,559
If there is,

177
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,960
just give him two duck feet,

178
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,679
or some snails.

179
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,320
He'll understand.

180
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,880
Okay.

181
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,200
Mister. I'll take that one to go.

182
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,320
Okay.

183
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,400
Okay.

184
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,320
Thanks. I already paid online.

185
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:35,880
Okay.

186
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,359
See you later, Grandpa Gu.

187
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,679
(She's an interesting girl.)

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,640
(No wonder Gu Rong likes her so much.)

189
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,760
(I'm really old.)

190
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,280
(She knows my grandson)

191
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,960
(even better than me.)

192
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,400
Dad, I'm back.

193
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,479
Okay.

194
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,840
- Where were you?
- Where were you?

195
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,200
- You first.
- You first.

196
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,320
I went to buy you snails rice noodle.

197
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,400
Why didn't you

198
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,479
go to the shop on the street though?

199
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,440
Your mom said it's like instant noodle.

200
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,919
So I went to the supermarket.

201
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,479
What's that smell? It stinks.

202
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,440
But it tasted great.

203
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,599
Zhang.

204
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,359
(Su.)

205
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:32,320
(I have something to tell you.)

206
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,679
(Someone wants to buy the house.)

207
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,799
(So I need it back.)

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,599
(I'm sorry.)

209
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,559
What?

210
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,200
Zhang, what do you mean?

211
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:41,520
What is it?

212
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,640
That's a really short notice.

213
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,119
You should at least

214
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,719
tell me in advance.

215
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,280
Zhang.

216
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,320
You broke the news so suddenly.

217
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,599
What do I do now?

218
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,159
(Think of something.)

219
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,559
(I need it back
within three days, okay?)

220
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,280
What? Zhang? Hello?

221
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,559
What is it?

222
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,320
What did it say?

223
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,039
What is it?

224
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,119
It was our landlord Zhang.

225
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,760
He wants this house back.

226
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,280
Why?

227
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,760
Because someone is buying it.

228
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,880
We've lived here for over ten years.

229
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,200
Someone wants to buy it

230
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,000
now?

231
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:23,440
He's selling it?

232
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:26,320
Dad. Is there a mistake?

233
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,960
Don't panic.

234
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,440
My head went totally blank

235
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
on the phone.

236
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,559
I think he said

237
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:37,359
we need to move within three days.

238
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,159
Three days? With all these?

239
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,159
How can he do that?

240
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,000
It's outrageous.

241
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,559
At least give us some more time.

242
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,039
What's wrong with him?

243
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,200
Stop it.

244
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,760
And he said,

245
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,520
the buyer is coming
to see the house today.

246
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Chief He, why do I feel like

247
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,000
we are on the lookout again?

248
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:10,960
Let me tell you.

249
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,679
The chairman doesn't know
what to do with his grandson now.

250
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,679
So he sent us here

251
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,919
to keep an eye on

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,400
what they are doing.

253
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,400
He's just worried about him.

254
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,000
I was thinking,

255
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,599
do you think Mr. Gu

256
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,080
is really going to stay here

257
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,880
as if this is his home?

258
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,039
Men.

259
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,719
Once they had a lover, they'd forget...

260
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,719
They'd forget their grandpa.

261
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,440
That's Miss Bai's car.

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,159
Go.

263
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,400
Miss Bai.

264
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,159
Miss Bai.

265
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:51,960
Why are you here?

266
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,320
Why are you here?

267
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:56,239
The Chairman asked us to stay here.

268
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,760
And you are...

269
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,719
I'm here to collect the house.

270
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:02,919
Is the Chairman really going to do that?

271
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,520
The Chairman just wants one thing.

272
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,119
And that's for Gu Rong to go home.

273
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,440
But you haven't had any luck.

274
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,119
Right. But after

275
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,919
what Mr. Gu just did.

276
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't think this is the right time.

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,599
It's impossible now

278
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,760
to convince him to go back.

279
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,440
The Chairman chose to do this

280
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,559
to give him a reason to leave.

281
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,000
Chief He.

282
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:30,919
I probably know what Grandpa Gu wants

283
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,080
better than you.

284
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,880
Right?

285
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,599
Yes.

286
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,919
What do we do?

287
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
Only 400000.

288
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,799
Not a cent more.

289
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,159
That's not gonna cover it.

290
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,799
We need much more

291
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:52,960
to buy this house.

292
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,440
Yeah.

293
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,200
Dad, mom.

294
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,080
I have 20000 on my card.

295
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,760
How can we take your money?
Take it back.

296
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,359
It's not enough anyway.

297
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,359
Mister, ma'am. Don't panic.

298
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,679
Let's ask the landlord

299
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,039
how much this house costs.

300
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,159
I can get the money.

301
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,960
We can't take your money, Gu.

302
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,119
What should we do then?

303
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,359
Gu. We appreciate that.

304
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,359
But still,

305
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,320
we can't use your money.

306
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,239
That's right. Gu Rong.

307
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
We do appreciate it.

308
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,840
Are you really moving out

309
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,159
if you can't buy the house?

310
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:46,640
I...

311
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,239
Did you forget

312
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,880
how smart your mom is?

313
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,479
Did you forget that?

314
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,320
Sweet Su. Tell you what.

315
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,039
This house is too old.

316
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,960
The buyer is coming

317
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,239
to see the house, right?

318
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,359
Let's just tell them,

319
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,799
for example,

320
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,119
there're lots of problems
in the kitchen.

321
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,599
And also upstairs.

322
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,400
I'll go see the living room.

323
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:20,000
Let's just tell them

324
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,919
all the problems of this house.

325
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,599
Maybe they'll give it up

326
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:27,159
after they hear it.

327
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,440
Move. Sweet Su.

328
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,919
You go to the kitchen. You two upstairs.

329
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,640
I'll do the living room.

330
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,359
Let's move. Hurry up.

331
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,320
Let's get going.

332
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Come on.

333
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,400
We'll have to try this.

334
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:01,159
See? The tiles are all broken.

335
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,400
You see that?

336
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,359
Sweet Su.

337
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,960
Do you think it's gonna work?

338
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,559
The screen went loose.

339
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,119
It's been over ten years.

340
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:42,919
I've got used to this house.

341
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,559
How can we just leave?

342
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,880
The bathroom is leaking.

343
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,760
And the landlord.

344
00:16:58,239 --> 00:17:00,440
How can he just sell it all of a sudden?

345
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,080
Told us to move.

346
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,400
Where can we go

347
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:05,280
with all of these?

348
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,400
The door socket is loose too.

349
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,359
I remember the corridor.

350
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,479
Took me ages to pick the color.

351
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,680
And you painted it.

352
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,920
Is the tap in the kitchen repaired?

353
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,040
No. See?

354
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,599
Sweet Su.

355
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,560
I don't want to go.

356
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,680
I don't want to leave.

357
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:54,920
Who's that?

358
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,319
They're here.

359
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,880
For the house?

360
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,319
Probably.

361
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,160
Go then.

362
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
You go.

363
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:01,959
Me?

364
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:02,920
Hurry up.

365
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,359
They came here so fast.

366
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,920
Miss Bai. Why are you here?

367
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,760
Why are there so many people?

368
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,680
You came for Gu, right?

369
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,400
No. I came for the house.

370
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,079
Do it.

371
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,439
What are you doing?

372
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,319
Why are you taking that?

373
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,239
What is this?

374
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,760
Just go out.

375
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,079
Calm down.

376
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:46,880
Why are they doing?

377
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,880
It's okay.

378
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,160
Let's talk.

379
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,760
Yeah.

380
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,680
Come. Have a seat.

381
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,560
You are buying the house?

382
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,880
Since you are Gu's friend,

383
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,000
I'll be frank with you.

384
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,280
Money doesn't seem
like a problem for you.

385
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,640
Why would you

386
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,439
want such an old house?

387
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:09,160
Old houses have lots of problems.

388
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,319
Look at the kitchen.

389
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,160
The flue design is outdated.

390
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,560
When you make something,

391
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:19,839
there's smoke everywhere.

392
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,680
And,

393
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,839
the tiles.

394
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,359
They just keep falling off.

395
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,280
They just keep falling off.

396
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,640
You can't even repair them

397
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,880
as fast as they fall out.

398
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,520
And the walls.

399
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,520
The paint is coming off.

400
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:32,959
This house is going uninhabitable

401
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,040
in no time.

402
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,319
I'm telling you the truth.

403
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,719
You are such

404
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,280
a lovely girl.

405
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:45,160
How can you live

406
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,920
in a house like this?

407
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,719
It's okay.

408
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,839
I'm not the one living here anyway.

409
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,599
That won't be a problem

410
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,040
as long as Gu Rong can accept it.

411
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,319
Gu. This is your friend.

412
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,040
She said she's buying the house.

413
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,239
Why are you here?

414
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,880
The Chairman said,

415
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,479
since you're not coming home,

416
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,119
he'll make this place home.

417
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,119
Those who don't belong

418
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,599
can just leave.

419
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,239
I already signed the contract.

420
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,280
(Real Estate Contract)
You have a week to move out.

421
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,439
No hurry.

422
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,880
No hurry.

423
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,640
Grandpa told you to do this?

424
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,640
You know what grandpa's like.

425
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,119
He always gets

426
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,239
what he wants.

427
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,400
Even if he wants this house,

428
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,520
I didn't expect you to do it.

429
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,079
Surprised?

430
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,079
I was always helping you

431
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,599
and wanted the best for you.

432
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,359
Now I still do.

433
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,359
Gu Rong, it's time to come back
to the right path.

434
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,439
I am on the right path.

435
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,479
Just go.

436
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,192
Tell grandpa his methods are outdated.

437
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:35,024
(Su's Martial Club)

438
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:40,359
Just seven days.

439
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,280
There's not enough time.

440
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:45,199
They are sending us on the street.

441
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:53,400
Mister, ma'am, Jingjing.

442
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,680
I got you involved

443
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,160
in my family dispute.

444
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,199
I'm really sorry.

445
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,760
Don't worry about it. Gu.

446
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,839
Family disputes are universal.

447
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
We're the same with Jingjing.

448
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,079
We understand.

449
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,520
She had conflicts with us too.

450
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,119
But asking you to move...

451
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,520
It's no big deal.

452
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,239
We've lived here

453
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
for more than ten years.

454
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,040
I've told you.

455
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,479
It's about time to
change the environment.

456
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:31,920
Now is the chance

457
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,680
to move to a new place.

458
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,760
Right? Sweet Su?

459
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,760
That's right. A new place.

460
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,800
Mom, dad. I'll go out for a minute.

461
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,640
Where are you going?

462
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,920
No need to find excuses.

463
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,479
I want you to stop

464
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,719
all of Bai Anrou's projects now.

465
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,520
Put someone else in charge.

466
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,680
Yes, Chairman.

467
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,839
And, He.

468
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,199
You can forget about
the bonus this year.

469
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:21,959
Well, I...

470
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,959
Any complaints?

471
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,359
No.

472
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,359
Good.

473
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:30,520
Keep an eye on everything she does

474
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,000
from now on.

475
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,119
Yes, Chairman.

476
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,280
Rest assured, Chairman.

477
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,719
I won't let her out of my sight.

478
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,479
Good.

479
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:41,040
You know Gu pretty well?

480
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,079
I saw you two talking last time.

481
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,959
I'd rather we met

482
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,520
because of snails rice noodle.

483
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,160
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

484
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,280
No worries.

485
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,199
Did you send Bai Anrou to buy my house?

486
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,839
Why did you do that?

487
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,319
I even helped you last time.

488
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,359
I just found out about it.

489
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,880
Just found out?

490
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,839
They already signed the contract.

491
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,000
I did consider doing this

492
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,959
to make him go home.

493
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,000
And now?

494
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,920
Jingjing, you said neither of us

495
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,959
understands the other.

496
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,680
Actually, I know

497
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,280
he doesn't agree with

498
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:41,280
those conventions in the company.

499
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,839
He wants to make changes,

500
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,400
using professional managers.

501
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,479
I'm not against that.

502
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,640
I just think he's too young

503
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,239
and too headstrong.

504
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,800
I don't want him to suffer a loss.

505
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,680
I know he doesn't want
to be around people.

506
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,520
I raised him up.

507
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,239
I know his ability.

508
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,880
He's definitely capable
to run the company.

509
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:13,959
I'm 75 now.

510
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,439
I can only trust him

511
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,359
with the company.

512
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,680
Jingjing, can you help me?

513
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:58,079
Dear, come here.

514
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
I'm busy.

515
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,280
Come.

516
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,199
What is it?

517
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,319
Come.

518
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,719
What?

519
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,079
Look.

520
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,160
The wedding ring?

521
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:12,479
Where did you find it?

522
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,079
Let me have a look.

523
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,439
What?

524
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,560
Dear Tian Caixia.

525
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,359
Thank you for going
through thick and thin

526
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,880
with Su Zhengkui for over twenty years.

527
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,000
I will carry the spirit and do better

528
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,599
into the future.

529
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,880
Are you willing to

530
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:37,359
live the rest of your life

531
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,319
with me?

532
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:40,719
Yes.

533
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,800
What if the kids see us?

534
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,839
What? He's really here.

535
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,079
Sorry, Gu.

536
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,319
I was too devoted.

537
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,079
See? It's so embarrassing.

538
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,719
I was too into it.

539
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:00,959
Where's the ring?

540
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:02,959
I didn't swallow it, did I?

541
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,839
Let me see.

542
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,479
There's no rush.

543
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,599
Where is it?

544
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,239
Where did you put it?

545
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,760
Did you find it? This is...

546
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:15,959
This...

547
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,560
This is good stuff.

548
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,000
This...

549
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:17,760
Come sit down.

550
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,439
Hey...

551
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,239
- Open it.
- No.

552
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,000
Open it.

553
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:21,959
We'll just have a look.

554
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,880
What's there to look at?

555
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,560
Let us have a look.

556
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,719
Gu. Open it.

557
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,479
Is this Jingjing?

558
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,359
Yes.

559
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,760
She was pretty chic.

560
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,000
Jingjing really liked music at the time.

561
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,160
Gu.

562
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,439
We should find the ring.

563
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,439
What's the rush?

564
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,920
Look at this. What's this?

565
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,760
This is the bike with an umbrella,
made by myself.

566
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,680
He made it to block the sun for me.

567
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:50,719
Let's just find the ring.

568
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,520
We need to tell him about it.

569
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,319
What was mister doing here?

570
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,359
I... I was

571
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:59,439
making the couch.

572
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:00,760
That's enough. Gu.

573
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,640
Let's talk about something else.

574
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:02,560
I'm not finished.

575
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,000
This is...

576
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,079
What is this?

577
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,640
It must be Jingjing.

578
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,920
Cash?

579
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,199
Su Zhengkui. Explain this.

580
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,040
What's the story?

581
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,000
What's that got to do with me?

582
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:23,920
Nothing to do with you?

583
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,680
What is this?

584
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,319
You'd better explain.

585
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:28,439
What is this?

586
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,199
You've got some nerves.

587
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:30,839
Don't.

588
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,239
You were keeping money on the side?

589
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,400
I didn't.

590
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,119
Squat!

591
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,439
It's not like that.

592
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Let me count.

593
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Sweet Su.

594
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,599
You managed the money well.

595
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,520
There's quite a lot.

596
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:43,959
I'll put it away now.

597
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:44,560
Mister.

598
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:45,959
How did you go through all those years?

599
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,239
A man got to endure.

600
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,000
This is the rule of the house.

601
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:53,160
Gu. Every family is like this.

602
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,640
It took efforts to raise a child.

603
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,079
It must be the same

604
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,040
for your grandpa too.

605
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,800
It's not easy.

606
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,680
Well then...

607
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,479
I'll give you a lesson later.

608
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,079
Let's go.

609
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,119
Why are you hiding money?

610
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,479
What do you want to do with it?

611
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,520
Nothing.

612
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,920
Why are you keeping it from me?

613
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,520
Are there any other little secrets?

614
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,520
No.

615
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,680
Better tell me the truth.

616
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:42,880
Grandpa.

617
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,280
Will you disappear

618
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:45,479
like mom and dad?

619
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,479
No. I'll always be with you.

620
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,319
You can see me every day.

621
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,319
This is your favorite chocolate milk.

622
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,520
Here.

623
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:01,319
I'll pick you up after school.

624
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,119
Okay?

625
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,680
Be good and work hard.

626
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,000
Go.

627
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,040
Bye, grandpa.

628
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:07,680
Bye.

629
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,680
You're still up?

630
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:28,040
What were they yelling about?

631
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,239
Why are you still here?

632
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,400
I'm sorry, Jingjing.

633
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,400
You should be the victims

634
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,640
of my family matters. Sorry.

635
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,280
Mr. Gu.

636
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:50,079
Tell me your story

637
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:52,520
in the Gu Group.

638
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,400
Me?

639
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,040
I've only worked there for a year.

640
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:01,079
But within that year,

641
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,800
grandpa made me work

642
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,000
in every position there is.

643
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,560
And?

644
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,079
What did you learn from it?

645
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:12,479
The company is still running

646
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,920
in an old-fashioned way.

647
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,199
It might seem fine currently.

648
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,719
But in a few years,

649
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,280
it's going to lag behind.

650
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,520
So what should you do?

651
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,959
Is your grandpa against making changes?

652
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,439
Grandpa thinks about it a lot.

653
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,640
He won't listen to me.

654
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,359
And there's...

655
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,280
There's your haphephobia?

656
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,319
Did you ever tell him

657
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,719
about this?

658
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:46,959
How?

659
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:50,000
It always ends with a fight.

660
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,760
It must be difficult.

661
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,119
Poor you.

662
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,479
Yeah, it is.

663
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,400
Poor you.

664
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,880
Do you know what this is?

665
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,599
My parent's...

666
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,599
Wedding ring.

667
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,839
Do it quietly.

668
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,680
(See you tomorrow
in the noodle shop, Grandpa Gu.)

669
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,839
See?

670
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,800
I told you it's a problem
of your communication.

671
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:08,640
It's not raining today.

672
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,239
Why are you wearing a raincoat?

673
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,560
The smell is so strong in the shop.

674
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Gu Rong would find out where I've been

675
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,359
without the raincoat.

676
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,520
That's all he told me.

677
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,599
I don't know anything else.

678
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,439
If there's more you want to know,

679
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,719
you should talk to him yourself.

680
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:24,599
Goodbye.

681
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,239
What's wrong?

682
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,319
It's my heart.

683
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,359
I had an operation
a couple of years ago.

684
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:38,079
It's busy in the company lately.

685
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
My heart's acting up again.

686
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,839
Please don't do this.

687
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,400
I came to see you behind his back.

688
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,160
I feel bad about it already.

689
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:54,359
I can't do anything else for you.

690
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,680
It feels like I betrayed him.

691
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,239
Didn't he agree to come back?

692
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,079
Then you should wait
till he reaches you.

693
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,239
I don't know how long I can wait.

694
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,919
I thought I could count on Anrou.

695
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,320
But now,

696
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,360
I can only count on you, Jingjing.

697
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,080
There's nothing I can do
if he doesn't want it.

698
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,040
There is. Just do one thing.

699
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,639
What is it?

700
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,439
He likes you.

701
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,520
He feels guilty that your family
is forced to move out.

702
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,679
Use that to convince him.

703
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,479
Gu.

704
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,919
I have one more question.

705
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,840
Say it.

706
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,679
Is he your real grandson?

707
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:54,840
Why are you asking that again?

708
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,919
My son and daughter-in-law
passed away early.

709
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:59,280
He's my only grandson.

710
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,760
My real grandson.

711
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,199
Please.

712
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:18,840
You are back.

713
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,080
Mom.

714
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,399
There's no hurry to pack these up.

715
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:25,639
We still have a few days.

716
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,120
There's not much time.

717
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:29,000
We have a lot of stuff.

718
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,800
I told you to look for a house online.

719
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,360
Did you?

720
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,199
Ma'am.

721
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,959
You are looking for a house?

722
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,120
Can you give me some more time?

723
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,479
Let me handle it.

724
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,760
I won't let you move out.

725
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,760
Gu. I know

726
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,639
you are a good kid.

727
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,040
But we need to plan ahead.

728
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:54,159
I have an appointment
at an agency on west street.

729
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:56,239
You should go there with Jingjing.

730
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,760
There's so much stuff.

731
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,399
I have plans for tomorrow morning.

732
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,040
I'll go with you later, okay?

733
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,560
I'll go upstairs then.

734
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,159
Smell of river snails rice noodle?

735
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,048
(Xie Te)

736
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,719
Is it ready now?

737
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,199
(Yeah. Pretty much.)

738
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,560
Xie Te.

739
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:58,919
Mr. Gu.

740
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,919
The bedroom's ready.

741
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,840
Go check it again.

742
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,639
Don't leave anything

743
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,719
about me.

744
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:08,360
Consider it done.

745
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:09,120
Okay.

746
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:11,879
Mr. Gu.

747
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,760
You've lived here

748
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:14,760
for a few years.

749
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:15,919
The decoration is amazing.

750
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,239
Isn't it a pity to rent it out

751
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:19,840
at such a low price?

752
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,040
Don't worry.

753
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,159
Just rent the house to her.

754
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:24,040
I'll still pay you at market value.

755
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,120
Okay. Trust me.

756
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,560
Assistant Xie already told me.

757
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,080
Your girlfriend won't suspect a thing.

758
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:30,320
I'll go take some pictures
of the bedroom.
