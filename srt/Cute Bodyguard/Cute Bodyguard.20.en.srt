It's locked.

What are you saying?

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,319
It's locked.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,319
Get away.

34
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,320
My phone is on the desk.

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,600
Where's your phone?

36
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,720
Call someone to let us come out.

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,279
I wanted to do that. But I don't
keep my phone with me either.

00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,919
No way, mister.

44
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,160
Today is my one-month anniversary
with Jingjing.

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,600
I have to make this dish by myself.

46
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,199
Besides,

47
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,320
you can check it out.

48

This integrated cooking center

49
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,559
is so efficient.

50
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,839
It can stew, stir-fry
and steam at the same time.

51
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
It can make six dishes
and one soup in only 30 minutes.

52
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,320
Look.

53
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,000
Have a try.

54
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,440
That's good.

55
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:03,440
Today,

56
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,679
I'll give you a hand.

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,199
Just tell me what to do,

58
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,399
I'll do it.

00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,720
You don't even know how to use a knife.

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,759
Slow down.

61
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,080
Parboil the ribs in the pot.

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,800
Who shouts out?
[*Similar pronunciation. Heard it wrong]

63
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,720
No one shouts out. Just parboil the ribs.

64
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,759
Put the ribs in the pot.

65
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,039
Yeah, push the pot and cover it.

66
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,600
Okay.

67
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:30,720

Are you not worried, Director Du?

71
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
Shout with me.

72
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,559
What does flow feel like?

73
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,039
The flow.

74
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:05,639
Is this the wall painting of SC Group?

75
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,200
I want to feel that flow.

76
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,519
But what does flow feel like?

77
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,399
The flow.

78
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,160
Take it.

79
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:46,720
What now?

80
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,959
I'll show you the flow of arts.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,359
How did you come up with that?

82
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,000
Director Du, you should

83
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,799
tidy up the warehouse occasionally.

84
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,480
Maybe in the process

85
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,320
of tidying up this warehouse,

86
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:22,320
you'll have an idea.

87
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,880
How's it?

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,320
I guess I underestimated you.

89
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,480
Then why are you still standing there?
Let's do it together!

90
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,000
Come on.

91
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,119
Two cages of steamed buns.

92
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,760
Okay.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,640
Takeout.

94
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,880
I'd like two vegetable buns.

95
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,720
Here it comes.

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,440
That's not going to work.

97
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,000
You can't just pour it all on the plate.

98
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,200
You have to lay out the pieces for it.

99
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,000
Pour the juice on it in the end.

100
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,559
That's perfect.

101
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,200
Okay.

102
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,200
Okay.

103
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:31,799
Is it okay?

104
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,399
Okay.

105
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,079
Nice. In just a few minutes,

106
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,760
you did a nice job. It smells good.

107
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,880
Nice, I think it's okay.

108
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,359
Our Jingjing has good luck.

109
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,160
I'll take it out then.

110
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,440
(Come home quickly. Emergency.)

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,239
Gu, don't worry.

112
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,239
Maybe Jingjing is working overtime.

113
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,279
Gu,

114
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:30,600
maybe let's eat and wait.

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,600
Mister, ma'am, you'll eat first.

116
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,679
I'll call Jingjing.

117
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,440
We can't eat first.

118
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,279
It's alright.

119
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:36,959
We'd wait for you.

120
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,720
(Gu Rong)

121
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,239
What's wrong?

122
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,480
No one picked up.

123
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,399
I am afraid something happened.

124
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,959
I don't think so.

125
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,480
Well, I'll just call again.

126
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,239
Don't worry.

127
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,679
I've never seen

128
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,079
anyone as crazy as you.

129
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,000
You tried on colors on your own clothes.

130
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,000
But the results are good.

131
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,039
Done!

132
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,440
Are you okay?

133
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,760
My ankle is twisted.

134
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,799
Then don't move. Don't move.

135
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,440
You can't move if you twist.

136
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,280
What should we do?

137
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,520
We're still locked in here.

138
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,960
Don't move.

139
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,960
If that's the price of feeling the flow,

140
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm willing to take it.

141
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,440
What do you say?

142
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,880
Don't say that. Wait here.

143
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,280
I'm going to shout for someone.

144
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,960
I heard a noise right here.

145
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,159
I didn't realize there are people.

146
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,440
Director Du.

147
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,479
You two are having quite fun.

148
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,359
Indeed.

149
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:34,479
Stop chatting.

150
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:35,479
Please come and help us.

151
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,400
Okay.

152
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:36,840
I...

153
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,840
I-I wouldn't dare to touch you.

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,799
No way. My feet...

155
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,000
I got this. I hold it for you.

156
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,400
Be careful. I have broken my hand too.

157
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,359
Slow down.

158
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,840
Don't ever use your feet again.

159
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,840
Hurry up.

160
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,159
Come on, it's not a skateboard.

161
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,119
Be careful.

162
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,359
You're injured.

163
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,479
It's alright.

164
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:55,320
Is it painful?

165
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:56,080
Hang in there.

166
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,159
We'll be at the hospital in a minute.

167
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,039
It's alright.

168
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,159
Senior.

169
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,080
Han Ran.

170
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,520
What are you doing together?

171
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,880
(Outpatient)
How do you know senior?

172
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,520
We've known each other for years.

173
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,200
But I was out of the country
for a few years.

174
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,599
So I lost contact with him.

175
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,760
By the way,

176
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,840
the nurse just said

177
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,719
your hand is fine,

178
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,320
and you can leave after the transfusion.

179
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,200
Don't worry.

180
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,919
Do you want some water?

181
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,320
Okay.

182
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll help you.

183
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,919
Look at me.

184
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,239
I don't have a third hand.

185
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,520
I'll help you.

186
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,280
Is it hot?

187
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,119
No.

188
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:51,719
Okay.

189
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,400
Have more.

190
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,400
What are you doing here?

191
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,599
I will take you home.

192
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,159
But senior isn't back yet.

193
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,000
Now that you're hurt,
you should have a good rest.

194
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,760
You'll have a long holiday
starting tomorrow.

195
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,280
Senior is here.

196
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,599
What's wrong?

197
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:22,039
Nothing.

198
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,159
Will you eat it now or later?

199
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,760
You feed me.

200
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,679
You keep hungry then.

201
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,840
Gu Rong.

202
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,440
He was injured,

203
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,919
and I can't keep him

204
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,119
alone there.

205
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,239
I really just sent him to the hospital.

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,359
Don't get mad, okay?

207
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,640
Why didn't you answer the phone?

208
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,559
My phone is on the desk.

209
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,200
Then you should tell me

210
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,119
that you worked overtime.

211
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,159
By the time I knew what I was doing,

212
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,679
I was locked in the warehouse.

213
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,400
I told you it was an accident. Gu Rong.

214
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,799
Just listen to me. I...

215
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,679
Gu Rong, you...

216
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,880
What day is it today?

217
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,719
Why did my parents
make so many delicious dishes?

218
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,640
I don't know.

219
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,400
Don't be mad.

220
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,840
I was in the office

221
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,239
painting and working overtime all day,

222
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,200
and I was locked in the warehouse.

223
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,000
I didn't even eat properly.

224
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,559
Why don't you eat with me?

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,440
Don't you remember what day it is?

226
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,320
It's not your birthday.

227
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,239
Today is our one-month anniversary.

228
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,320
I forgot it.

229
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,520
So did you make all of these dishes?

230
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,719
No.

231
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:05,799
You made the dishes, right?

232
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,119
These are so delicious.

233
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,880
I did not expect that Mr. Gu

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,320
can not only work but also cook.

235
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,960
It's my favorite flavor.

236
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,479
Mr. Gu is so amazing.

237
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,159
Just like a Cooking Master Boy.

238
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,719
All right, don't get mad.

239
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,960
I swear.

240
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,239
I'll keep my phone with me at all times.

241
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,760
I'll never let you lose contact to me.

242
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,799
Look at you. You're smiling.

243
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,280
I'll be sure to keep contact.

244
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,919
Okay?

245
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:13,719
And...

246
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,000
Are my dishes really that good?

247
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,400
Very tasty.

248
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,400
That's the taste I will remember
even when I sleep.

249
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,599
The dishes taste better than those
made by my dad.

250
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,520
Then let me try.

251
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,919
Have a try.

252
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,799
The enrollment
of the winter vacation classes

253
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,880
is excellent this year.

254
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,280
But we don't have many rooms

255
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,679
left in this house.

256
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,960
How do we deal with

257
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,919
the accommodation for children?

258
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,760
Sweet Su, it's fine.

259
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,679
We can work it out.

260
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,039
Well...

261
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:56,200
Jingjing.

262
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,200
You're off work, right?

263
00:14:59,359 --> 00:14:59,919
Well...

264
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm back.

265
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:01,960
Well...

266
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,640
Look at you.

267
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,679
You didn't tell us
about working overtime.

268
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,159
Gu called you just now.

269
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:08,880
Right.

270
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,280
You didn't pick up the calls.

271
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:10,919
I...

272
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,119
He made you a table of delicious dishes.

273
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,760
Right.

274
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,400
I know.

275
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,119
So I came back right after work.

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,039
Let's eat.

277
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,599
Let's eat.

278
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,200
I'll get you some rice.

279
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,159
Great.

280
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,840
What are you doing?

281
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,559
That's enough.

282
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,359
Have more.

283
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,440
That's enough.

284
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,719
That's enough.

285
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,320
You two go back to your rooms and rest.

286
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,880
Go back to your own rooms.

287
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,960
Be gentle.

288
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,200
Did they go to their own rooms?

289
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,479
Alright, let's go to bed.

290
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,640
No, why are you dragging me?

291
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,840
Go to bed!

292
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,159
This is way over the top.

293
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,559
It's like we are having
a secret relationship at home.

294
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,440
If it goes on,

295
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,559
it's really not good.

296
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,159
I've never left the martial club

297
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,919
or my parents since I was a kid.

298
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,320
When can I be independent

299
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,320
and have my own space?

300
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:28,320
Jingjing.

301
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,320
My apartment is next to the company.

302
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,440
Let's move out.

303
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,000
That's a very dangerous idea.

304
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,840
My dad will never agree.

305
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,320
Your dad...

306
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,400
Why does your dad have to agree?

307
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,520
It is okay as long as you agree.

308
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,119
Anyway, I'm not going to return

309
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,239
my secret figure.

310
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,679
Besides,

311
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,479
we each have a room.

312
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,880
Why don't I agree?

313
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,359
Mr. Gu, right?

314
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,760
You can rest assured.
There are plenty of rooms.

315
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,760
And I already have a plan.

316
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,000
What is it?

317
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,080
Why can't you understand?

318
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,599
Didn't mister just say

319
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,960
that the martial club
will be out of rooms

320
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,239
when the children
of winter vacation classes come?

321
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,160
By then,

322
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,760
let's try to tell mister about it.

323
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,520
Will it work?

324
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,000
We'll never know unless we try.

325
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:15,880
Okay.

326
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,640
Okay?

327
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,439
Great.

328
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,439
Caixia!

329
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,504
(Su's Martial Club)

330
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,239
I turned off my alarm clock again.

331
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm going to be late again.

332
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,839
Right, mom and dad.

333
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,680
I have to work overtime tonight,

334
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,760
so I'm not going to be back for dinner.

335
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,040
Mister, ma'am.

336
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,719
And I'm not coming
back for dinner either.

337
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,400
I have other plans.

338
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,199
Jingjing.

339
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,000
What are you busy at lately?

340
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,920
Right.

341
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,160
I have to work overtime.

342
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,719
I have to work late every day.

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,680
Besides,

344
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,319
the street lamp at our intersection

345
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,199
is broken.

346
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,239
It's so dark every time I go home.

347
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,719
I almost

348
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,319
got hit by the scooter last time.

349
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,319
Right.

350
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,079
Do you have to work overtime?

351
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:07,400
It's not safe to come back

352
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,040
so late every day.

353
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,079
Yeah,
I just got in the design department.

354
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:14,439
I have to perform well,
so I need to work late.

355
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,439
And I think

356
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,680
our house is too far from where I work.

357
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:19,760
Right.

358
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,359
My girl is right.

359
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,640
Well... Indeed.

360
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,760
Then keep going.

361
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,040
Gu, if you are busy,

362
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,839
then I'll pick Jingjing up by taxi.

363
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,839
Jingjing, let's go.

364
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:34,280
Okay.

365
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,000
It's difficult
to take a taxi at this hour.

366
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:36,319
Gu.

367
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:37,520
Don't you have your own car?

368
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,959
My grandpa borrowed my car.

369
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,439
I don't know when I can get it back.

370
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,319
Company cars have been fully booked.

371
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,959
I don't have a car these days.

372
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,839
What should I do then?

373
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,560
Our house is so far from the company.

374
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:55,400
Then I have less sleep time

375
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
to take the taxi every day.

376
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,280
Right.

377
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,000
Sweet Su.

378
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,000
Right.

379
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,079
Jingjing's company

380
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,920
is quite far from home.

381
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,479
Well... what should we do about it?

382
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

383
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,760
How about this?

384
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,920
Maybe you

385
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,040
just get over it, okay?

386
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:16,920
Just get over it.

387
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,560
Young people have to take
more challenges.

388
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,239
You should take hard work.

389
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,800
Cheer up for both of you.

390
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,400
Cheer up!

391
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:23,920
I'm on your side.

392
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:25,599
Okay.

393
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,719
Let's go then.

394
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
Then we'll hurry up for the taxi.

395
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,000
All right, just be careful.

396
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:30,800
Be careful.

397
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:31,280
Okay.

398
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:32,199
Okay.

399
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,520
Two meat and two vegetable buns.

400
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:36,439
Okay.

401
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:37,959
Take a cup of soy milk.

402
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:38,520
Okay.

403
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,239
Okay.

404
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
That was really the best

405
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,319
I could do. So many hints.

406
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,040
I have never thought
my dad wouldn't take any of them.

407
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,839
I hope he's not really
picking me up tonight.

408
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,239
Your trick does not work.

409
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,239
What should we do then?

410
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,680
Let's get in the car first.

411
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,119
We haven't had the breakfast.

412
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:10,160
Let's go and buy some buns.

413
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:10,680
Okay.

414
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,400
Over there.

415
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:14,880
Which one do you like?

416
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,040
Take a look.

417
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,040
This is not a bun.

418
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,760
Finally, it is about

419
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,680
(Thanks)
material design and offline extension.

420
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,839
The above is the design

421
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,439
for 10th anniversary celebration
of Fanfun Mall.

422
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,839
Mr. Gu, director.

423
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,199
Just tell me
if anything needs to be improved.

424
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,119
Jingjing.

425
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,040
What do you think of the proposal?

426
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,520
This proposal has worked hard

427
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,479
to highlight the concept of fun.

428
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,479
But I think in general,

429
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,280
it's not straightforward enough.

430
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,400
Exactly.

431
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,959
We should notice the people we target.

432
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
It will work for young people.

433
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,199
But older people

434
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,719
are naturally resistant

435
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,119
to these new ideas.

436
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,479
How dare you

437
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,319
play tricks to me?

438
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,079
Yes.

439
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,359
If we directly use some

440
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,560
novel or trendy sculptures

441
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,119
and posters,

442
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,199
the customers probably

443
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,680
don't even know

444
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,479
what points we're trying to make.

445
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,199
We might as well just tell them

446
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,280
it's fun and you're welcome.

447
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,280
This is a good idea.

448
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:34,959
Sounds good.

449
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:37,040
A straightforward way
is really the best way.

450
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:38,760
The Group pays great attention

451
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,959
to this anniversary
celebration of Fanfun.

452
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,239
The design department's proposal
would make a great deal to it.

453
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,479
I hope next time I see

454
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,319
a real solution that works and is fun.

455
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,479
Jingjing.

456
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,319
I want you to stop by my office
after the meeting.

457
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,079
Okay.

458
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,400
Go ahead to discuss it.

459
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,199
Okay. From now on,

460
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,800
Su Jingjing will be
in charge of the whole project.

461
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,199
Director.

462
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,520
Su Jingjing has only been
in the design department for a few days.

463
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,359
Don't you think it's a little hasty

464
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,680
to give her such an important project?

465
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,719
Is it hasty?

466
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,800
Just because
this project is so important,

467
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,359
I gave it to Su Jingjing.

468
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:14,920
You all have other projects
on your hands,

469
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,760
only she can devote herself to it.

470
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,680
But she's new to the company

471
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,199
and has no experience on projects.

472
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,959
Even she devotes herself to it,

473
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:24,520
I'm afraid she can't handle it.

474
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,319
It's none of your business.

475
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,000
I...

476
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,439
I will follow up
the whole process of this project.

477
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,599
That's all for today's meeting.

478
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:37,959
Let's go.

479
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:38,959
Let's go.

480
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,560
It's okay.

481
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,599
I've already announced it.

482
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,239
Don't fail me.

483
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,239
But...

484
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,520
Stop saying that. Don't think so much.

485
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,479
I believe you. Cheer up!

486
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,479
Okay, I won't fail you.

487
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,640
Just go to work.

488
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,920
Come in.

489
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,520
I have a good news.

490
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,400
Du Yuchuan puts me in charge

491
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,599
of the proposal
for this anniversary celebration.

492
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,839
I always believe you.

493
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,800
But, designer Su,

494
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,719
I wonder if you can
think about our relationship

495
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,880
other than career?

496
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,479
Do you have any idea?

497
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,920
Right, let's make it straightforward.

498
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,359
Gu.

499
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,920
I heard you can help me

500
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,400
solve the accommodation problem
for these children.

501
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,239
Well, let's

502
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
check the house then.

503
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,719
Awesome.

504
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,439
You're so helpful, Gu.

505
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,319
Right.

506
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:07,800
I'm worrying about it.

507
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,239
Gu, Jingjing

508
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,359
has been so busy lately.

509
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,000
She's working overtime every day.

510
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,000
She's still working at this hour.

511
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,400
Right, Jingjing

512
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,680
recently took on a big project.

513
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,439
She might keep doing so

514
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,359
for the next months.

515
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,800
Mister and ma'am, don't worry.

516
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll pick her up in a minute.

517
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:28,599
Okay.

518
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,560
Is the company not far from here?

519
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,560
Right, it's just next to this place.

520
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:33,119
Great. Look at the environment.

521
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
So beautiful.

522
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,359
Honey, look at the painting.

523
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,520
Abstractionism.

524
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,119
You know it?

525
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,560
Yeah, I do.

526
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,400
Nice.

527
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,479
Good, the underfloor heating is nice.

528
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,400
It's ventilated and big. Nice!

529
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,359
This house

530
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,760
is so good and trendy.

531
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,239
Right, the house appliances

532
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
are all brand new.

533
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,439
We can even hire a housekeeper

534
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,160
to clean and cook.

535
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,359
Good.

536
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,400
The food safety is the most important.

537
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:14,680
I like the elegant decoration.

538
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,319
So many rooms!

539
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,479
We won't be so crowded.

540
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,560
Right. There are enough rooms.

541
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,439
We can live separately.

542
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,599
Good, Gu.

543
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:28,359
Is this nice house yours?

544
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,640
Yes.

545
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,160
Because I think...

546
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:36,119
Mister, ma'am.

547
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,839
If you're willing

548
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:39,479
to give me someone that is so important,

549
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,599
I think the house
is the most basic thing.

550
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,160
Nice boy.

551
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,199
Good.

552
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,439
The house is nice,

553
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,359
but with only one disadvantage.

554
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,400
It's too far from the Martial Club.

555
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,439
It's not convenient
for the children to come.

556
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,119
Mister, ma'am.

557
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:00,959
Let's sit and talk.

558
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:01,880
We can talk in a comfortable way.

559
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,680
Okay, have a seat.

560
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,280
Have a seat, please.

561
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:05,680
Okay.

562
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Have some water.

563
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,839
Large table.

564
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,239
Mister, ma'am.

565
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:22,119
Actually, I'm not planning

566
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,560
on letting the children move in here.

567
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,520
What do you mean?

568
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,599
I mean...

569
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,239
Let's spare the rooms
in the Martial Club

570
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,560
for the kids.

571
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,079
And then,

572
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:36,560
I'll move in here with Jingjing.

573
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,719
He'll live with Jingjing...

574
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,640
Right.

575
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,160
Are you crazy? Do you want to die?

576
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,119
I'll cut you to death with my falchion

577
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,920
and make your birthday
into your death day.

578
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:49,880
Do you believe it?

579
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,160
How can you talk like that?

580
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,040
Don't be mad at him.

581
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:53,560
No.

582
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,560
Su, listen to me.

583
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,479
Nothing to be discussed.
Go home with me.

584
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,520
I'm telling you. You are not kind.

585
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,319
Stop talking like that.

586
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:02,400
Your bag.

587
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,520
Gu, that's a great idea.

588
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,199
Let's go! Don't talk to him.

589
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,359
Just too soon.

590
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,040
Be careful, ma'am.

591
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,040
Let's go.

592
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,160
You're lucky that Master didn't cut you

593
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,079
with his falchion.

594
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,359
I'm not asking you
to make sarcastic remarks.

595
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,160
Brother-in-law,
Master is a martial artist.

596
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,199
You did it straightforwardly to him.

597
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,839
Will it end well for you?

598
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,439
So?

599
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,079
So on this matter,

600
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,599
you have to conquer
the unyielding with the yielding.

601
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,839
You must show Master
your utmost sincerity.

602
00:27:56,528 --> 00:27:58,000
(Clock)

603
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,199
I have to go pick up Jingjing.

604
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,439
I see now.

605
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
You just used me.

606
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,160
I'm leaving.

607
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,359
Make yourself at home
and do whatever you want.

608
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,160
Bye.

609
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:32,920
So serious?

610
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:37,359
Why are you here?
I didn't hear you coming.

611
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,680
I am here to pick you up from work.

612
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,199
What did my dad say?

613
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:44,959
How about the proposal?

614
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,400
It is said

615
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,400
if one is frustrated in love,
then he'd be proud in work.

616
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,199
But now

617
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,439
my dad didn't let me move out.

618
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,839
God didn't

619
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,359
help me with my work either.

620
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,239
I beg for just a little inspiration.

621
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,439
Let's go home first.

622
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,719
I prepared you something.

623
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,079
That might give you an idea.

624
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,719
What is it?

625
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,040
You'll find out when you get back.

626
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,479
Alright.

627
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,599
Let's go.

628
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:20,048
(Su's Martial Club)

629
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,439
This is the new forest series.

630
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:26,479
Look.

631
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:28,520
This is sure to help you

632
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,400
find inspiration.

633
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,479
You can focus on your career.

634
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,319
I'm looking forward to your works.

635
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,920
I'm just going to focus on
us living together.

636
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,040
Who's living with you?

637
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:43,959
You.

638
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,040
Right. Blind box.

639
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,079
I got the inspiration. You know me.

640
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,360
(Famous designer Lin Yaozhong)

641
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,479
For this anniversary celebration,

642
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,959
we want to cooperate

643
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:31,560
with Mr. Lin Yaozhong,

644
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,359
a famous artist in Singapore,

645
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,359
to co-brand

646
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,719
and produce relevant blind boxes.

647
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,880
We will carry out

648
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,800
an immersive distribution
exhibition in the mall

649
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,640
and set up blind box machines

650
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,400
in every corner of the mall

651
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,800
to sell the new products

652
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,640
in the way of letting
customers treasure hunt,

653
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,280
so as to improve the interaction.

654
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,160
Now the Internet is so developed

655
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,680
that many players
will choose to shop online.

656
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,160
So what kind of advantage

657
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,560
can we have in this anniversary

658
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,520
to attract those customers

659
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,760
to come and buy?

660
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,280
In fact, for the true blind box fans,

661
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,160
the purchase experience between
online stores and physical stores

662
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,880
is totally different.

663
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,880
And for this anniversary,

664
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,239
we'll have

665
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,760
an extreme attraction for fans,

666
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,400
which is the blind boxes
of secret figure

667
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,520
that Mr. Lin Yaozhong

668
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,000
specially designed for the anniversary.

669
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,040
This secret figure

670
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,520
can only be obtained

671
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,640
from the anniversary blind box machines.

672
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,839
So I believe this collaboration

673
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
can let our mall

674
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,719
transform into

675
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,839
a way of more youthful fashion.

676
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,040
Conquer
the unyielding with the yielding.

677
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
(I'm going to go home
and prepare food and wine)

678
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,000
(to celebrate your plan's approval.)

679
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,439
(Xie Te will come to pick you up.)

680
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,160
Ask me to drink?

681
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,640
What? Does he want to get me drunk

682
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,359
and take my daughter from me?

683
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,079
Tell him it's impossible.

684
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,800
What are you talking about?

685
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:45,760
Wine tastes man.

686
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,560
Gu just wants to have a few more drinks.

687
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,839
If he gets drunk,

688
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,439
it'll give you a chance

689
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:53,800
to test him, right?

690
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,160
The boy gets himself drunk.

691
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,680
What does he think about all day?

692
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,000
Honey.

693
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,280
Can he be the president

694
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,839
of such a big group?

695
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,040
I don't think
there's anything wrong with this kid.

696
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,079
Su.

697
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,479
Let me be honest with you.

698
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,119
I quite like

699
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:23,160
Gu.

700
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:27,000
Look at you.

701
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,280
Hold it back.

702
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,119
He's kind of cute, right?

703
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,760
Right.

704
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,040
I'll take advantage of it

705
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,560
with these eyes of mine,

706
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:41,760
and take a good look at him.

707
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,839
(You'd better tidy up the martial club,)

708
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,880
(especially master's falchion.)

709
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:06,800
(In case he gets drunk
and actually fights you.)

710
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,719
It smells so good.

711
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,399
Gu.

712
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,560
A lot of dishes.

713
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,120
Yes.

714
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,840
Well, I'll go change my clothes.

715
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,399
Okay.

716
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:38,080
I'll be right back.

717
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:38,600
Okay.

718
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,719
Jingjing said she has to work overtime,

719
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,840
so she won't come back for dinner.

720
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,199
Here I come.

721
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,639
What a table of dishes!

722
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,520
When will Jingjing be back?

723
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:14,719
Did she message you?

724
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,399
Ma'am, please take a seat.

725
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,600
Jingjing said she has to work overtime,

726
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,360
so she won't come back for dinner.

727
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:22,439
Then let's eat first.

728
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,560
There's no need to wait for her.

729
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,879
No way.

730
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,840
These dishes are
all Jingjing's favorites.

731
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,679
I wanted to make her a treat.

732
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,199
She has had a hard time recently.

733
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,439
It's okay, mister and ma'am.

734
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,600
You two eat first.

735
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,520
I left some food for Jingjing.

736
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,520
I'll send them to her later.

737
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,919
You'll send them to her?

738
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,600
You haven't eaten either.

739
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:45,679
It doesn't matter.
Jingjing is not here. I...

740
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,080
Alright.

741
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,679
Then you'd go stay with Jingjing.

742
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,600
Right, ma'am.

743
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,520
Do you have

744
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,840
brown sugar and warm paste?

745
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:01,000
Jingjing said she doesn't feel well.

746
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,000
Yes!

747
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,239
I'll go get it.

748
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,879
You see?

749
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,280
Gu cares about Jingjing so much.

750
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,800
Gu.

751
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,520
Here, brown sugar and warm paste.

752
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,840
Here.

753
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:25,399
Thank you, ma'am.

754
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,520
Then I'll go stay with Jingjing.

755
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,520
Goodbye, mister and ma'am.

756
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,439
Be careful.

757
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,239
Okay.

758
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,360
You should have some.

759
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,280
Okay.

760
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,719
Such a nice boy.

761
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,600
You can't have a long face all the time.

762
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:55,199
Gu is very concerned about Jingjing.

763
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,520
(Han Ran)
(Brother-in-law, how is it going?)

764
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:09,320
(Does it work?)

765
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,360
(It was over before I even started.)

766
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,159
(You might think of some other ways.)

767
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,800
Our house is
far away from their company.

768
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,360
Will the dishes get cold
when Gu arrives?

769
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:36,479
The quality of the crisper
I bought is very good.

770
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,520
Even if he takes a little time more,

771
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,040
the dishes won't get cold.

772
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,479
I wonder if you're really stupid
or just playing dumb.

773
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,280
Don't you know what I mean?

774
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,080
I get it. You just want me

775
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:57,159
to allow two of them to move out.
