(Always be prepared)

28
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:05,879
Am I his grandson?

29
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,960
Did you see him?

30
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,000
He smiled from ear to ear.

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,679
Judging from the bad temper,

32
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,720
I am sure you are.

33
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:17,759
I am not as unreasonable as he is.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,479
The pastry he bought smells great.

35
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,000
Do you want to try it?

36
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,880
No.

37
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,919
What brings you here, Senior?

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,919
Come on in.

39
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,440
Master made your favorite dishes

40
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,960
and let me send them over.

41
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,839
That's what I've been waiting for.

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,919
Come on. Dad made dishes for us.

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,240
Share it out.

44
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:54,679
What's this? Rice?

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,399
Here.

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,520
It's all your favorite. Try it.

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,600
It feels just right.

48
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,720
The only thing bad about moving out

49
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,080
is that we can't eat Mister's dishes.

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,520
So you have to go back often.

51
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,759
Master and Mistress
speak of you two every day.

52
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,119
I've been busy recently.

53
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,839
We'll go back
when we finish these things.

54
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,000
Speaking of which, I forgot

55
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:33,080
to submit the design draft.

56
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,119
You guys go on.

57
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Just finish the meal.

58
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,440
I'll be back soon.

59
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:44,039
Don't say I didn't warn you.

60
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,000
I had a drink
with Du Yuchuan the other day.

61
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,119
He seems to have fallen for Jingjing.

62
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,479
What?

63
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,399
You grew up with Jingjing.

64
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,160
Why didn't you get together?

65
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,559
Jingjing is like my little sister.

66
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,279
We know each other too well.

67
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,240
She is

68
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:00,039
and will always be like a sister to me.

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,479
I lost just because

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,919
I met Jingjing too late.

71
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,199
And Gu Rong beat me to it.

72
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:13,759
Seriously? Are you falling for Jingjing?

73
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,759
What?

74
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,679
Am I no better than Gu Rong?

75
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,839
H-How dare he!

76
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,839
I think he is serious.

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,079
Just tell him that he's off his game.

78
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,079
You know who I am.

79
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,359
I can't say that.

80
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,959
But I think the silly girl

81
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,079
hasn't noticed that.

82
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,720
We talked about their relationship
last time.

83
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,600
And it went not well.

84
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,720
I don't want her

85
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,119
to think that I am

86
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,279
unreasonable and jealous.

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,799
Brother,

88
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:48,320
didn't you just grow up in jealousy?

89
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,359
I don't think he is

90
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,040
confident about it.

91
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,519
He actually feels a bit inferior.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,559
Really?

93
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:00,799
I think he is

94
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,959
the most high-profile in the company.

95
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:03,839
Sometimes,

96
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,600
people would show off

97
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,440
what they don't have.

98
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,200
His father passed away
when he was in high school.

99
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,399
He and his mother

100
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,519
didn't have much money

101
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,880
and must have suffered a lot.

102
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,640
I didn't know that until recently.

103
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,839
Okay. Enjoy your meal. I gotta go.

104
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,839
You had nothing.

105
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,679
I'll let you get back to your date.

106
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,359
Do not let Jingjing do the cleaning.

107
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
Tell him that he's off his game.

108
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,760
Do it yourself.

109
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,720
What?

110
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:36,920
I'm telling you to tell him.

111
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,119
Well, Jingjing.

112
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Let me ask you a question.

113
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:24,679
Okay.

114
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,640
Do you

115
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,839
feel tired as my girlfriend?

116
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,600
No. Why do you say that?

117
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,079
If someone

118
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,760
pursues you now,

119
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,440
will you leave me?

120
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,200
No fever.

121
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,519
Why is the fever talking?

122
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,720
Of course not.

123
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,119
That's good.

124
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,320
Remember your words.

125
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,359
You promised.

126
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,079
What's wrong with you today?

127
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,760
You rarely

128
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,760
cared about me so much.

129
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
You never

130
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,959
said that before.

131
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
What's got into you?

132
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,399
Don't get cocky.

133
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:18,399
How's the draft going?

134
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,760
I feel like something's missing.

135
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:26,679
It's not cool and cute enough.

136
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,200
I'm stuck here.

137
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,920
I think this one is good.

138
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,079
What do you think?

139
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,679
Why don't you modify it on that basis?

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,559
Director.

141
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,440
Here.

142
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,399
Is it ready?

143
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,399
Yes.

144
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:18,640
Mr. Gu.

145
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
Mr. Gu.

146
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,440
The anniversary is in three days.

147
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,239
Have you completed your drafts?

148
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,839
Each of us produced a draft.

149
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,239
This one is good.

150
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,440
It's Su Jingjing's work, right?

151
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,880
Where is she?

152
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,640
Mr. Gu, Jingjing went to the warehouse.

153
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,080
Produce the final draft
as soon as possible.

154
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,119
We have to

155
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,159
leave time for the factory.

156
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,159
Has Lin Yaozhong authorized?

157
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,799
Use the draft for now.

158
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,359
The anniversary is crucial.

159
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,640
It shouldn't go wrong.

160
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,000
Besides, your work

161
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,400
is to make

162
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,280
the anniversary perfect.

163
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,559
Whatever you hear

164
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,280
or see,

165
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,239
keep it in the office.

166
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,440
If anything

167
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,000
leaks out again,

168
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,919
I don't mind
firing the whole department.

169
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,919
Su Jingjing doesn't have to know this.

170
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,440
Go back to work, guys.

171
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,599
(Mr. Huang)
(Have you got what I need?)

172
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,880
What's wrong?

173
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,559
It's almost there.

174
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,960
But I'm stuck.

175
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,840
Look, I've decided on the clothing

176
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,239
for its lower body.

177
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,080
But I can't find

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,080
anything suitable for the upper part.

179
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,440
I feel like something's missing.

180
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,440
That's it.

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,359
Look. The doll is chubby.

182
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,400
It looks cute in a crop top,

183
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:30,039
right?

184
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,280
Does it feel right?

185
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,400
Yeah. It's so cute.

186
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,039
Let's make it
and see what it looks like.

187
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,559
Sure.

188
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:42,249
♪This is our exclusive memory♪

189
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:46,131
♪This is our own sweetness♪

190
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:48,304
♪I think of you♪

191
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:50,128
♪Everything about you♪

00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:53,415
♪Without realizing♪

193
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:57,479
♪This is our exclusive memory♪

194
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,080
That's it.

195
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,159
And its nose.

196
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,919
And its nose.

197
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,571
♪You are the one♪

198
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:08,016
♪In my life♪

199
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,919
We made it.

200
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,599
It's been so hard to make it.

201
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,280
The anniversary will count on it.

202
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:16,679
Great.

203
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:35,248
(My music)

204
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,960
(But if Lin doesn't authorize it,)

205
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,520
(and we hide it from him,)

206
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,280
(aren't we using his name illegally?)

207
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,679
(We have no other options.)

208
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,200
(If we reach that point,)

209
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,159
(we have to go to court
with him anyway.)

210
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,119
(It's no difference for the Gu Group.)

211
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:57,719
(Has Lin Yaozhong authorized?)

212
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,080
(Use the draft for now.)

213
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,479
(The anniversary is crucial.)

214
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,799
(It shouldn't go wrong.)

215
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,159
(Besides, your work)

216
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,799
(is to make)

217
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,679
(the anniversary perfect.)

218
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,559
(Whatever you hear)

219
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,520
(or see,)

220
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,320
(keep it in the office.)

221
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,080
(If anything)

222
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,599
(leaks out again,)

223
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,640
(I don't mind
firing the whole department.)

224
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,960
(After everything
that Bai Anrou had done)

225
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,719
(for Gu Group over these years,)

226
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,799
(she was abandoned with no mercy.)

227
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,159
(Do you think
you can end up being better?)

228
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:41,168
(Save)

229
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,119
According to reliable sources,

230
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,760
Fanfun was to work with
Singaporean artist, Lin Yaozhong

231
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,159
for its anniversary

232
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,080
but failed because of a dispute.

233
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,919
The new blind box

234
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,159
is just a replacement.

235
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,200
Please explain that.

236
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,640
Does Chairman Gu know about that?

237
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:20,799
What's the dispute?

238
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,479
Please answer our questions.

239
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,679
Has Mr. Lin authorized it?

240
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,039
Yeah. What if you were accused?

241
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:25,919
Yeah. What if you were accused?

242
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,719
First, thank you for your attention

243
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,919
on the Gu Group and Fanfun.

244
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,479
What you just mentioned

245
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,799
is untrue.

246
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:46,840
Lin Yaozhong.

247
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,080
Hello, everyone. I'm Lin Yaozhong.

248
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,799
I'm honored to work with Gu Group

249
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,679
and cut the ribbon
at the opening ceremony.

250
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,799
Besides,

251
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,239
there's good news.

252
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:11,039
For today's celebration,

253
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,440
Miss Su Jingjing of the Gu Group and I

254
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,760
jointly designed

255
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,239
a limited edition secret figure.

256
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,960
It's not a common limited edition,

257
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,799
but a brand new one

258
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,599
that you've never seen.

259
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,200
Yeah.

260
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,599
Not only that,

261
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,200
we have 50 limited edition dolls

262
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,479
here today

263
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,359
in the blind box machines

264
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,000
all over the mall.

265
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,200
What's more, we designed

266
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:46,159
many immersive activity centers.

267
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,960
I believe everyone here,

268
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,479
whether you get
the limited edition or not,

269
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,840
will feel the happiness

270
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,440
you've never felt before today.

271
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,320
Thank you.

272
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,799
I now announce

273
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:25,080
the start of the anniversary of Fanfun.

274
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,359
Welcome to

275
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,479
a brand new Fanfun life.

276
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,400
Great.

277
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:45,960
Please.

278
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:46,640
Thank you.

279
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,719
Here you are.

280
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,359
So cute.

281
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:49,880
It's so beautiful.

282
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:50,760
So beautiful.

283
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:52,840
So pretty.

284
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,040
You are in such a hurry.

285
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,640
The opening ceremony just started.

286
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,359
Mr. Gu.

287
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,239
Thank you

288
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,560
for your advertising,

289
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:28,079
which made Gu Group a trend again.

290
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,839
What do you mean, Mr. Gu?

291
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,680
Just drop the act.

292
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,880
I meant for you to think

293
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,760
that I fell out with Lin Yaozhong

294
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,119
to see what you want.

295
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,280
You didn't quit

296
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,640
because

297
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:52,119
you want to make a big deal
out of our dispute.

298
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,239
Right?

299
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,000
When did you start doubting me?

300
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,319
When you led me to doubt Zhang Ting.

301
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:03,880
No matter who in the Design Department

302
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,400
disclosed the designs,

303
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,680
as the director
of the Design Department of Gu Group,

304
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,119
it's my fault.

305
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,000
If you need someone to blame,

306
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,640
then blame me.

307
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,760
Director Du, this is not your fault.

308
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,079
The top priority

309
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,719
is about finding out the truth.

310
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,160
You can't escape
the responsibility in management.

311
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:22,920
But now is not the time

312
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,079
to discuss your responsibilities.

313
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,199
I understand.

314
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,839
But the designs are decided
by Design Department

315
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,560
and Lin Yaozhong personally.

316
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,239
All members in the Design Department
have signed

317
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,560
a strict confidentiality agreement.

318
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,800
All designs and confidential documents
handled by the Design Department

319
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,800
will never be disclosed.

320
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,800
By rights, such problems
should not arise.

321
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,479
Unless...

322
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,800
Unless what?

323
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:49,199
Unless one faces the lure
of greater benefits,

324
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,599
one would take such a risk.

325
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,319
Tell me more about
your internal division of labor.

326
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,199
Who can get

327
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,199
Lin Yaozhong's design draft?

328
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,839
Zhang Ting is in charge of

329
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,359
the receipt and delivery
of the design draft.

330
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,800
She is also in charge of
contacting the printshop.

331
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:12,560
So now the biggest suspect
is Zhang Ting.

332
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,160
In the monitor footage,

333
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,719
you went to Director Du's office
to get the flash drive.

334
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:24,959
Who told you to?

335
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,560
Zhang Ting.

336
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,439
What's more, Zhang Ting resigned today.

337
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,000
I can't be exonerated now.

338
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,760
Zhang Ting resigned?

339
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
You've always been objective.

340
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,680
You never defended your staff.

341
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:45,359
But you asked us to pacify it

342
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,599
while leading us to doubt Zhang Ting.

343
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,000
Zhang Ting?

344
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,319
Surprise, Director Du.

345
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,400
It was you
that leaked the designs to Mr. Huang,

346
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,079
pinned it on Jingjing,

347
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,439
and made Zhang Ting take credit, right?

348
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,800
You pretended to be an angel.

349
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,319
I would be too stupid

350
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,239
if I trusted you.

351
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,800
The step of making
Zhang Ting take credit

352
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,439
was deadly wrong.

353
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,520
Mr. Lin,

354
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,800
the Gu Group takes full responsibility

355
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,959
for the leakage of the designs.

356
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,520
I apologize again.

357
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,359
Mr. Gu, it won't work

358
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,560
even if you came here in person.

359
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,520
I will get to the bottom of this.

360
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,520
A corporate giant

361
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,760
made such a huge mistake.

362
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,959
Just wait

363
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:49,280
for my attorney's letter
together with Dimon.

364
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,959
That's why

365
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,599
I came here today.

366
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
I will find out who leaked the designs

367
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,400
and clean up our own mess.

368
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,479
But I believe that the person

369
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,199
is also important to you.

370
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,079
What do you mean?

371
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,239
I investigated Dimon

372
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,119
right after the leakage.

373
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,359
I found that Dimon's boxes

374
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,760
were printed the day

375
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,839
after we decided on

376
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,719
the size of the dolls.

377
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:27,839
But you hadn't finished

378
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,199
your designs at the time, right?

379
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,959
At that time...

380
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,800
You mean Du Yuchuan...

381
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,839
It can't be him.
We have a great relationship.

382
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,520
It was him

383
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,280
that invited you to work with me, right?

384
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,280
But if it was him,

385
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,839
you would have also

386
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,520
trusted an ingrate like us.

387
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,199
What I want is simple.

388
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,920
Just send us an attorney's letter

389
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:12,479
and make the person think

390
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,040
that our deal is broken.

391
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,359
Do as he planned.

392
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,520
We will get him on the hook then.

393
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,719
We can continue our deal.

394
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,199
I will invite you

395
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,400
to cut the ribbon.

396
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,199
But we can't use the designs

397
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:30,719
that were already leaked out.

398
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,560
Yes. Would you please create a new one?

399
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:35,239
Mr. Gu,

400
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,680
I can help you with the lawsuit

401
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,239
and I promise that I won't sue you.

402
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,880
But I can't

403
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,000
design a new one

404
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,319
in such a short time.

405
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:49,359
Then could you please

406
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,160
authorize us to design

407
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,839
the figure?

408
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,000
With all due respect, Mr. Gu,

409
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,119
I have no idea what the level

410
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,160
of your designers is.

411
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,199
I won't easily grant authorization

412
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,760
in case you tarnish my reputation.

413
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,640
Why don't you have a look at this?

414
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,359
It's our designer's work.

415
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,839
Mr. Gu, you came prepared.

416
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,520
You have

417
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,800
long suspected me.

418
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,479
Du Yuchuan.

419
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,239
You are senior to me.

420
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,160
I appreciate your help
and encouragement.

421
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,439
And I look up to you.

422
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,239
You were the only role model for me.

423
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,719
I cherished

424
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:59,040
our friendship.

425
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:00,920
But you

426
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:04,040
disappointed me.

427
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,920
Du Yuchuan, why did you do so?

428
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Why?

429
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,199
Mr. Gu,

430
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:22,880
not everyone was born

431
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,359
with a silver spoon like you.

432
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,719
I'm just an ordinary guy.

433
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,079
I fought my way to become a director.

434
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,760
I've always believed

435
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,640
that I can succeed

436
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,079
if I work harder than others

437
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,160
since I was little.

438
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,719
But I found out later

439
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,160
that life is unfair.

440
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,719
No matter how hard I tried,

441
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,160
I will only be a designer.

442
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,119
The talent and passion were in vain.

443
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,760
When I was stuck,

444
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,040
Mr. Huang of Dimon gave me a chance

445
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,599
to make my dream come true.

446
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,280
He funded me,

447
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,719
exhibited my work in Europe,

448
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:11,439
and ended my obscure life in Gu Group.

449
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,680
That day,

450
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,319
Mr. Huang came to me.

451
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,640
Look at you,

452
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,359
a famous designer who studied abroad.

453
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,839
How stylish you are.

454
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,800
You should be better off.

455
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,479
What do you mean by that?

456
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,000
These are the designs

457
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,760
rejected by Gu Groups in these years.

458
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,959
I like these designs.

459
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,719
I'll pay a pretty price

460
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:11,439
to buy them if you like.

461
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,199
Besides, I can fund you

462
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:15,119
to establish a studio

463
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,880
and attend international exhibitions.

464
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,479
Do you mean all that stuff?

465
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,680
You suffered in the Gu Group.

466
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,599
They didn't recognize your value.

467
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,160
When I saw you today,

468
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,640
I knew that you are

469
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,040
an ambitious young man.

470
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,959
If you think you are unrecognized,

471
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:41,439
you can tell us.

472
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,280
The company would talk to you.

473
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,680
But you didn't.

474
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,439
Let's go.

475
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:53,199
Lin Yaozhong is waiting
for my explanation.

476
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,160
We have to end this quickly.

477
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,000
Okay.

478
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,800
We are going to sue Mr. Huang.

479
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,040
It would be much easier

480
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,479
if you can take the stand.

481
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,880
I will do it

482
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,719
to atone for what I did.

483
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,800
Read this.

484
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:36,520
Sign it if you have no questions.

485
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,976
(Declaration)

486
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,119
Welcome back.

487
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:03,920
Welcome, Director Zhang.

488
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,920
Welcome back, Director Zhang.

489
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,239
Welcome back, Director Zhang.

490
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,359
Thank you.

491
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,199
Jingjing is actually the one who made

492
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:14,000
the anniversary design come true.

493
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Don't say that.

494
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,239
You are experienced

495
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:17,520
and senior to me.

496
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,319
I hope we can start over

497
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,760
after the whole thing.

498
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,119
Sure.

499
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,079
Okay. Since everything has passed,

500
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,599
just turn the page.

501
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,560
From now on,

502
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,119
let's make the department better,

503
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:34,719
okay?

504
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,760
Okay.

505
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,560
Fighting.

506
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Fighting.

507
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,696
(Gu Rong)

508
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:47,000
(Chief He said Grandpa feels unwell.)

509
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:48,520
(We should go back now.)

510
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,439
What?

511
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:00,959
Grandpa.

512
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:02,640
Grandpa,

513
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:03,800
how are you feeling?

514
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,199
Let's go to the hospital.

515
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,839
No... No need.

516
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,680
I don't want to go to the hospital.

517
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,199
Please,

518
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,040
let's go to the hospital.

519
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,359
I've had two bypasses of my heart.

520
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,719
I can't bear more surgeries.

521
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,680
It's just a change of beds.

522
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:38,839
Old people shouldn't go to the hospital.

523
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,000
I would become a ghost

524
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,119
if I can't make it.

525
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:49,359
Grandpa, don't say stuff like this.

526
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:59,760
Gu Rong, Jingjing,

527
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,680
I have something to tell you.

528
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,119
You worked together

529
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,920
and went through the crisis this time.

530
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,959
I feel assured to leave the company

531
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,280
to you.

532
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:33,560
I only have one wish now.

533
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,479
What is it, Grandpa?

534
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:39,839
Jingjing,

535
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,000
can you promise me?

536
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,359
What is it, Grandpa?

537
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,880
I-I want a great-grandson.

538
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:56,719
Grandpa, we haven't married yet.

539
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,839
Then get married.

540
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,560
Grandpa.

541
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,040
Grandpa.

542
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:01,719
Grandpa.

543
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,479
I promise.

544
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,479
Water.

545
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:05,040
Okay.

546
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,479
Have some water.

547
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,160
I promise.

548
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,599
Grandpa,

549
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,800
you put on starch to fool us?

550
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:33,920
Grandpa,

551
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,880
how could you frighten us like that?

552
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,599
You promised.

553
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:43,239
I didn't because you fooled me.

554
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,000
Although I fooled you,

555
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,239
I did

556
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,520
mean it.

557
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,040
I have to wait at least one year

558
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,760
for you to get married,

559
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,359
complete the steps,

560
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,599
and go on your honeymoon.

561
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,400
You're thinking too far.

562
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,199
Look,

563
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,479
if he failed to get you pregnant

564
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,719
this year,

565
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,239
I'll have to wait another year.

566
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,160
The doctor says

567
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,199
that the success rates

568
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,599
are low because of stress.

569
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,280
I-I remember

570
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,760
that I have work to do.

571
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,239
Grandpa, if you are okay,

572
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,640
I'll have to go.

573
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm busy.

574
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:16,880
You promised.

575
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:17,839
I didn't.

576
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,880
What were you talking about?

577
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,319
What was I talking about?

578
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,079
Then do it on your own.

579
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,040
You are taking advantage of your age.

580
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,280
I'll go. Bye, Grandpa.

581
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,680
How was it? Did I act well?

582
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,439
Yeah. You did really well

583
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,680
but were caught.

584
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,160
So what?

585
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,239
I brought it on the table

586
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,800
once and for all.

587
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,880
Yes. You are the wisest.

588
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,439
Out.

589
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,439
Grandpa said

590
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,920
you promised him.

591
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,040
What should you do?

592
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,319
You are really his grandson.

593
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,400
He pretended to be ill like you did.

594
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,400
Did you two agree to bully me?

595
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,319
I'll eat my words.

596
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,280
I don't want to get married.

597
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:27,920
My career just started.

598
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,359
Let alone having a child.

599
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,079
I won't. I won't.

600
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,359
I didn't expect him to do this, either.

601
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:36,520
I can't even recognize him

602
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,040
since you knew each other.

603
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,000
Now you know

604
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,719
that old people
are precious to their families, right?

605
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,319
Have you learned it?

606
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,920
It's late. Let's go home.

607
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:52,920
They are off work.

608
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,959
I haven't seen my parents
for a long time.

609
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,119
Since we are off work,

610
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,160
why don't we visit them?

611
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,439
Sure. Let's go.

612
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,560
Okay.

613
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,479
It's the smell of home.

614
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,560
Are you happy?

615
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,439
Yes.

616
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:11,919
Uncle Li.

617
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,560
Jingjing and Gu are back.

618
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,320
Yeah.

619
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,679
It became thinner.

620
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,439
Right?

621
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,919
Yeah.

622
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,639
They're back.

623
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:22,479
You became thinner.

624
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,439
Jingjing and Gu are back.

625
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,080
Ms. Chen.

626
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,080
Look at the bags.

627
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,639
It seems like you have married.

628
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,439
Almost.

629
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,199
Congratulations.

630
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,719
Look how great the couple is.

631
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,280
Uncle Gu,

632
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,479
have you brought me anything delicious?

633
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,199
Yes.

634
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,800
Here. The bag of candies is yours.

635
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,719
Look at you.

636
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,159
You've got so many cavities.

637
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,360
I'll tell your grandma.

638
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,320
You're back.

639
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,439
We're back.

640
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:44,600
They rarely come back.

641
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:56,000
(Su's Martial Club)

642
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,639
Come on.

643
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,399
There're already enough dishes.

644
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,879
Well, the holiday is over.

645
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,159
The students have left.

646
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,879
All rooms are empty now.

647
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,080
I think

648
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:15,120
Jingjing can move back.

649
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,159
I know what you mean.

650
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,520
Jingjing, look at you.

651
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,600
You haven't got married yet.

652
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,159
Isn't it inappropriate for you

653
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,199
to live in someone else's home?

654
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:27,679
It's hard for you to explain.

655
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:31,080
Should you move back?

656
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,360
Then...

657
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Then we'll get married.

658
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,399
It can't be treated lightly.

659
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,520
How could you

660
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,719
not talk to us about it?

661
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,479
Yeah.

662
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,080
Right.

663
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,320
Mister, Ma'am, don't worry.

664
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,399
That's why I'm here today.

665
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,199
Well...

666
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,280
What are you talking about?

667
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:54,080
Why are you so shy?

668
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,360
Gu,

669
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:56,879
I'm telling you.

670
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,560
It's not right to do so.

671
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,639
Marriage is quite important.

672
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:03,520
You said it slightly.

673
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,439
Why don't you

674
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
talk to us beforehand?

675
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:07,479
Our daughter

676
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,800
has grown up.

677
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,959
You want to marry her
without talking to us?

678
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,479
I'm telling you.

679
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:16,040
The mood I'm in right now...

680
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,959
Calm down.

681
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,959
Calm down.

682
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:21,439
Don't be mad.

683
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,360
I feel so great.

684
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,760
Are you playing comedy?

685
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:29,479
He and I

686
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,719
are totally fine with it.

687
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,040
We agree.

688
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,520
See? Ma'am is sensible.

689
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,520
Of course.

690
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm a lovely mom.

691
00:36:40,919 --> 00:36:41,919
We've agreed.

692
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:42,520
Okay.

693
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:42,919
Okay?

694
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,000
Great.

695
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,800
That's it. Marry me as soon as possible.

696
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:47,520
Yeah.

697
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,639
I haven't said anything.

698
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,239
Your parents have agreed.

699
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:51,080
What do you want to say?

700
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,879
She is so shy.

701
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,280
Here's the thing.

702
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:56,520
It's a good day today.

703
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,239
Should we have a drink?

704
00:36:59,159 --> 00:36:59,919
Again?

705
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,840
Of course.

706
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,840
Just a few.

707
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,439
Drink some.

708
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,280
Don't get drunk.

709
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,239
Really?

710
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,239
Really. We have to.

711
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,360
Come on.

712
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,040
How could we miss it on such a good day?

713
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,719
Come on.

714
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,840
I want some too.

715
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,239
Get me a glass too.

716
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,080
Have a drink together.

717
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,120
I want to drink some too.
