Thank god I got here early.

I'll powder my nose.
This is a chance of a lifetime.

No way my senior will like you.

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,319
He likes someone

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,600
who's tender and cute.

34
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,919
Go.

35
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,119
Let go.

00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,559
Are you alright?

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,320
Please stand away, miss.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,080
Are you okay, Mr. Gu?

39
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,800
We're late.

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,479
Let's go.

00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,080
Wait!

42
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,479
Stop there!

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,839
You can't hear me.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,320
But you can't even see?

45
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,639
You caught on my clothes.

46
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,360
Miss.

47
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,919
This is not a smart way

48
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,960
to get my attention.

49
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,440
Your attention?

50
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,199
Do you think I'd want to talk to you

51
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,520
if you didn't tear my clothes?

52
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,160
Buy her some clothes.

53
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:06,720
Yes.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,320
I don't want clothes.

55
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,479
I want sincerity.

56
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,520
An apology.

57
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,080
You...

58
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,119
Excuse me, miss.

59
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,679
Today, you are here

60
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,480
for the announcement

61
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,839
of the new chairperson

62
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,799
of Gu Group.

63
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,359
I'm an old man now.

64
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,720
For my health,

65
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,079
I have to step down

66
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,119
from the office.

67
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,519
From tomorrow on,

68
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,519
Gu Rong

69
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,839
will be the new chairman.

70
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:37,640
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,200
I won't accept the position.

72
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,600
You are the only successor
of the family Gu.

73
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:45,079
You have to accept it
whether you like it or not.

74
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,279
I'm sorry, grandpa.

75
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,279
This is not where my ambition lies.

76
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,440
Also, I'm quitting my current job.

79
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,359
Han Ran's new book!

80
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,359
It's so difficult to get a copy.

81
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,679
Great.

82
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:02,839
My day's ruined.

83
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,239
What a nutcase.

84
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,640
What should I do?

85
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,839
Han Ran's here!

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,320
Han Ran!

87
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,399

You are so handsome! Han Ran!

92

Han Ran!

93
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,119
No way.

94
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,359
I can't meet him like this.

95
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,559
Only a few copies left.

96
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,399
Come quickly if you want one.

97
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,399
I want one.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,160
I want one.

99
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:49,904
(Carefree and Content)

100
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,200
(I like you, senior.)

101
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,320
(Can you feel it?)

102
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,399
(I've kept it a secret
for so many years.)

103
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,880
(I want you to know it one day.)

104
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,200
(A heart?)

105
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:31,279
(You like me too?)

106
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,920
(Bilateral love.)

107
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,600
(I'm so happy.)

108
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,119
It's you again?

109
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,760
He's here.

110
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,480
Hurry up!

111
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,079
Stop him!

112
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,359
We can't let him run away this time.

113
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,119
Don't make us do it in the violent way.

114
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,160
You are outnumbered.

115
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,279
Where can you go?

116
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
You won't get away today.

117
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,440
Get out of my way.

118
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,440
My book.

119
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,720
You can't run away.

120
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,559
Just come with us.

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,799
We don't care if it's public place.

122
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,880
You have to come with us today.

123
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,880
(Kidnapping in broad day light?)

124
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,320
(Are they from a gang?)

125
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,760
(Today is for your punishment.)

126
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,640
What are you doing, miss?

127
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,279
Step away.

128
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,279
What are you doing?

129
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,359
You misunderstood.

130
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,079
Misunderstood?
You are kidnapping people.

131
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,399
Watch out.

132
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,839
The book signing session is cancelled.

133
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,519
Please leave in order.

134
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,480
No way.

135
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,720
It's cancelled.

136
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,079
Sorry.

137
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,519
Why can't you go home

138
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,119
and do whatever you want?

139
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,440
Do you have to make a scene here?

140
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,679
I am sorry.

141
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,359
That's it?

142
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,600
Chief.

143
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:13,279
Miss.

144
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,679
- Chief, watch out!
- Your nose!

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,119
It's bleeding.

146
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,440
Blood!

147
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,040
Blood?

148
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,679
Let's go.

149
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,519
Hurry up!

150
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,320
(Is Mr. Gu's illness cured?)

151
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,119
Mr. Gu, why are you...?

152
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,400
To the hospital.

153
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,880
Okay.

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,640
She's fine.

155
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:47,679
She fainted because of the blood.

156
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,039
She can go home after she wakes up.

157
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,559
Bad guy!

158
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,159
Mr. Gu, I paid the fees.

159
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,159
But now I probably need a doctor.

160
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,159
He was trying to molest me.

162
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,880
I wanted to punch him.

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,760
Miss.

164
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,760
You do have
a lot confidence in yourself.

165
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,159
Mr. Gu.

166
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:42,840
Maybe I should hire a bodyguard for you.

167
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,719
Otherwise Chief He

168
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,320
will try everything to get you.

169
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,239
Mr. Gu.

170
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,880
What are you thinking?

171
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,640
I'm thinking about the woman

172
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,840
who hit you today.

173
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,000
I think I'm fine with
physical contact with her.

174
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,559
Yeah.

175
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,200
I was wondering why you looked fine

176
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,280
when you held her today.

177
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,559
I don't know.

178
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,119
Maybe you should hire her

179
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,320
as my bodyguard.

180
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,559
Seriously?

181
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,840
I'm not allergic when touching her.

182
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,520
And she's a good fighter.

183
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,679
Isn't that great?

184
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,479
Find out who she is.

185
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,080
Okay, Mr. Gu.

186
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,880
Su! Hurry up!

187
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,760
How can you leave like this?

188
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,599
Your apprenticeship is not finished yet.

189
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,479
Isn't that right?

190
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,679
You can't leave now.

191
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,400
Say something, Su.

192
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,679
You don't need to beg them to stay.

193
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,599
Do they think
they can come and go at will

194
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,760
in Su's Martial Club?

195
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
I'm telling you.

196
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,400
Once you step out of that door,

197
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:52,239
don't bother coming back anymore.

198
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,799
Yes, master.

199
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,919
We'll remember that.

200
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,159
Take care, Master and Mistress.

201
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,880
- What are you doing, Liang?
- Ding.

202
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,239
What is this, Ding?

203
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,479
If you leave,

204
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,159
Mistress and I would feel empty inside.

205
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:11,640
And our house will also be empty.

206
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,400
If you leave,

207
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,280
who would rent my house?

208
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,960
There's still a set
I haven't taught you.

209
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,559
Right. A set.

210
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,599
- A set.
- Don't bother, Master and Mistress.

211
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,599
We are determined.

212
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:22,840
- Well, Ding!
- Let's go.

213
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,599
Ding. Liang.

214
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:24,679
Liang!

215
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,520
Ding! Liang!

216
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,640
This way.

217
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,159
Are you sure the martial club is here?

218
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,080
Good wine needs no bush, Mr. Gu.

219
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,840
A good club can be located poorly.

220
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,000
I've seen it with my own eyes.

221
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,479
Just come with me.

222
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,080
Mr. Gu, such kind of family

223
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,440
always values manners.

224
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,840
So I prepared a fruit basket

225
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,280
for you.

226
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,760
We give them the basket.

227
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,000
Sweet talk a bit.

228
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,599
Then it's done.

229
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,599
That's enough.

230
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
We're here to hire a bodyguard,

231
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,359
not to learn the moves.

232
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,080
It's not necessary.

233
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,880
What's her name again?

234
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,359
Su Jingjing.

235
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,479
Balut, sir?

236
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:25,479
It's freshly made.

237
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,799
Have a try.

238
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,400
No, thank you.

239
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,719
Have a try.

240
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,520
Really. Thank you.

241
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:27,919
Fine.

242
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,640
Thank you.

243
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,159
Listen.

244
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,599
If this doesn't work,

245
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,400
you are fired.

246
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,239
Got it?

247
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,159
Mr. Gu.

248
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,960
We're almost there.

249
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,359
Have some tea.

250
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:49,719
Thank you.

251
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,159
Here we are.

252
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,200
I'll cut to the point.

253
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:56,400
Mr. Gu wants to hire Su Jingjing
as his bodyguard.

254
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,880
Mr. Gu, right?

255
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:02,039
Where do you work?

256
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,520
It's Gu...

257
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,359
A small investment company.
We just got started.

258
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,119
Mr. Gu.

259
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,880
Why do you want my daughter
as your bodyguard?

260
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,039
Is there anyone after you

261
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,960
looking for trouble?

262
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:17,799
Not really.

263
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,799
No way.

264
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,239
Mr. Gu is successful.

265
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,559
People get jealous.

266
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,719
You don't really know Jingjing.

267
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,719
Like my wife said,

268
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,960
why do you want to hire her?

269
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,359
Here's the thing.

270
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,520
I met your daughter
by chance a few days ago.

271
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,960
I saw she's a good fighter.

272
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,440
So I did some research.

273
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,239
She's from a martial arts family.

274
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,760
That's even better.

275
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,400
See? They found out everything.

276
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes.

277
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,760
Back to the point.

278
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,880
Jingjing

279
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,039
is the 18th generation of our family Su.

280
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,679
She bears the expectation

281
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,960
of our whole family.

282
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,960
You don't have to worry about that.

283
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
The salary will match up

284
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,640
to her work.

285
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,200
How dare you come here, bad guy?

286
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,640
I just knew.

287
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,320
You are not good people.

288
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,159
Nowadays,

289
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,960
nobody will assign an easy job to us.

290
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,159
Get out.

291
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,520
You misunderstood, mister.

292
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:45,840
That's right.

293
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,320
What really happened is...

294
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
How dare you defend him?

295
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,320
Do you know what happened?

296
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,760
I saw it with my own eyes.

297
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,359
His hand was almost here.

298
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:56,039
Which hand was it?

299
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,359
Calm down, mister.

300
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,239
Out of my way, okay?

301
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:58,919
We can talk.

302
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,840
Put it down.

303
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,119
Were you involved?

304
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,679
I was.

305
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,200
What?

306
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,960
I wasn't.

307
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,080
Do you think this is funny?

308
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,200
Dad, enough talking.

309
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,960
Just throw them out.

310
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,440
Okay.

311
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,760
I'll leave, okay?

312
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,599
Stay away from us.

313
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:12,559
Don't.

314
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:13,640
Let's go.

315
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,440
The fruit!

316
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,039
What's happening there?

317
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:25,799
(Su's Martial Club)
They got thrown out.

318
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:34,799
Mr. Gu.

319
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,440
Maybe we should have another try.

320
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,440
If we explain it well,

321
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,880
it might still work.

322
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,760
What?

323
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,479
You haven't had enough?

324
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:45,799
Go get the car.

325
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,479
Mr. Gu.

326
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,520
Mr. Gu.

327
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,919
Don't run!

328
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,440
Mr. Gu!

329
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:05,799
Mr. Gu!

330
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,400
Mom.

331
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:09,400
There's no hot water.

332
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:14,479
Mom.

333
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,679
Dad must have forgotten the bills again.

334
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,440
The water always runs out
when it's my turn.

335
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:36,320
Mom, help me.

336
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:38,080
The soup got into my eyes.

337
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,880
Hurry up, mom.

338
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,599
He always forgets the bills.

339
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,960
The water always runs out
during a shower.

340
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,520
So annoying.

341
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,920
That's enough.

342
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,599
Who are you?

343
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,079
Why were you yelling?

344
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,359
Jingjing.

345
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,760
What are you doing?

346
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Where is my sword?

347
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,800
You are a bad guy, a scum.

348
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,199
It was your daughter who got onto me.

349
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,800
I mistook you as my mom.

350
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,119
Why didn't you say anything?

351
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,199
You were in your bath robe.

352
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,000
If you found out it was me,

353
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,119
you'd call me a bad guy again.

354
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,800
I'll kill you.

355
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:58,880
Stop there!

356
00:17:58,959 --> 00:17:59,719
Su Zhengkui.

357
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,400
Yes.

358
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,479
Take it away.

359
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,040
Yes.

360
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,319
I was just trying it out.

361
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,119
I don't care

362
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,599
what kind of illness

363
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,880
you have.

364
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:10,839
You came here

365
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,880
without a warning.

366
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,839
Now so many conmen are out there.

367
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,680
I have to say

368
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,040
I can't tell if you are one of them.

369
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,280
Do I look like one?

370
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,079
Hard to say.

371
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,119
I'll pay up front.

372
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,439
Let me break the ice here.

373
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,359
Well.

374
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:34,640
Jingjing

375
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,160
is still a maiden.

376
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,520
She can't be with you all the time.

377
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,839
She has to come home at night.

378
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:41,959
You don't need to worry about that.

379
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,959
I can live here.

380
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,520
Don't rent it to him, mom.

381
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,800
The apprentices are all gone.

382
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,040
I can't feed the three of us

383
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,119
with only my paycheck
from the beauty parlor.

384
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,199
If he lives here,

385
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,560
I'll have no private space.

386
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,719
What good does that bring us?

387
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:56,959
Are you making any money?

388
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,119
I told you

389
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,160
not to study

390
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,560
the animation design or something.

391
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,359
You can't find a job.

392
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:04,119
But you wouldn't listen.

393
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,760
You were so stubborn.

394
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,079
I am looking for a job.

395
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,959
It's the industry's fault.

396
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,800
That's why

397
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,000
you need some sideline work.

398
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,920
I'll have this room.

399
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,839
No way.

400
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,280
Well...

401
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
This is my room.

402
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,000
Mr. Gu.

403
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:25,040
You like this room?

404
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,680
You have a good taste.

405
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,880
I said no. This is my room.

406
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,239
Then where should a distinguished tenant

407
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,160
live?

408
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,000
The distinguished tenant is so shiny.

409
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,560
Of course he should have

410
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,000
the less bright room.

411
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:37,880
No way.

412
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,640
I'll pay ten percent more.

413
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
No way.

414
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,160
That's it then, Mr. Gu.

415
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,199
When are you moving in?

416
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,319
Now.

417
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,599
That's quick.

418
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,560
Mr. Gu.

419
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,719
We adjusted the contract

420
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,359
as your will.

421
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,119
Please check.

422
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,560
Party A Gu Rong.

423
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,079
Party B Su Jingjing.

424
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:12,280
Party B must always be on call

425
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,479
and follow Party A wherever he goes.

426
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,319
The distance between Party B and
Party A shall not exceed one meter.

427
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,280
So I have to accompany you
to the bathroom?

428
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,239
In theory, yes.

429
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,439
But in reality,

430
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,400
I'll call you if I need you.

431
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:29,520
Party A will decide
the working hours of Party B.

432
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,479
Party B must stay on call 24/7.

433
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,479
Party B's work exceeding eight hours

434
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,839
will be paid at the overtime rate.

435
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,880
The working hours are not clear.

436
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,599
Do I need to accompany you

437
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,719
when you're sleeping?

438
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,040
I didn't say that.

439
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,319
Don't try anything improper to me.

440
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,079
You...

441
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:47,959
What?

442
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,400
You want to hit me?

443
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,160
Well...

444
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,839
I want to stress that.

445
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,160
It's all in the contract.

446
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,359
I'm Party A.

447
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,079
No need to worry about the money.

448
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,880
I just need you
to fulfill your obligations.

449
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,800
Can you do that?

450
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,119
Yes, yes.

451
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,219
Martial artists never lie.

452
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:05,119
Sign it.

453
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,839
It doesn't work.

454
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,520
It failed again.

455
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,920
Try this one.

456
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,400
(Freezing my cards again?)

457
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,920
(Why can't they try something else)

458
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
(to get me back?)

459
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,400
Why doesn't it work?

460
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,239
You don't have money.

461
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,119
So no deal. All is good.

462
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,160
Why is it?

463
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,439
Look.

464
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,280
I'll have my assistant send the money.

465
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,719
Why doesn't it work?

466
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:50,280
I can't believe it.

467
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,119
He has no money.

468
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:54,199
Just shut up.

469
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,119
No one answered, right?

470
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,079
Then you should leave,

471
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,680
my distinguished tenant.

472
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,239
Hold on.

473
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,880
I'll leave my watch here

474
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,040
and bring the money tomorrow.

475
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,880
Your watch? Is that a good idea?

476
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,760
Really? What kind of watch is it?

477
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,160
Let me see.

478
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,880
Do you think it's appropriate?

479
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,839
Maybe not.

480
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,959
Wait... Okay.

481
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,079
What?

482
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,000
Deal.

483
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:29,839
Dad!

484
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,880
He doesn't even have any money.

485
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,199
How could he have an expensive watch?

486
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,359
What does that mean, Su Jingjing?

487
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:37,319
You mean my watch is fake?

488
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,599
I know people like you.

489
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:40,400
Don't play dumb with me.

490
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
You are the kind who would try to

491
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:43,160
pick up girls with a fake watch.

492
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,400
I've seen a lot of fake socialites.

493
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,640
But fake magnates are not any less.

494
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,079
Do I need to

495
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,280
use a fake watch

496
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,560
to pick up girls?

497
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,280
It fits.

498
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:53,000
Don't say that.

499
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,000
He's still here.

500
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,920
Easy. It caught my skin.

501
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,719
Excuse us.

502
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:56,479
It caught my skin.

503
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,400
Dad!

504
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,479
I gave them such a good watch

505
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,199
just to live in this crappy place.

506
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,319
They're all new. Go on.

507
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,520
How can you live in this place?

508
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,760
Get it straight, Mr. Gu.

509
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,000
No one is begging you to stay.

510
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,520
You chose to.

511
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,239
How can you still use this toothpaste?

512
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,800
Then don't.

513
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:52,560
Just do this.

514
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,239
Then you can use it.

515
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,000
What is this?

516
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,880
Can't you just get a new one?

517
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,719
Haven't you heard of
the "five second principle"?

518
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,400
It's still clean within five seconds.

519
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,359
You can use it.

520
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,760
Let me emphasize this.

521
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,839
Did you pay the rent?

522
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,680
Every second you spend here

523
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,920
would be from our generosity.

524
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,640
You have no money.

525
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,520
(It's five thirty in the morning.)

526
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,839
(How can we be dispirited?)

527
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:00,280
(How can we be lazy?)

528
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:03,760
(Only the early birds get the worms.)

529
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,160
(Only the early worms get the spirit.)

530
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,920
(The withered flowers will not blossom.)

531
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,599
(The passed time will not be relived.)

532
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,199
(It's five thirty in the morning.)

533
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,760
(How can we be dispirited?)

534
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,119
You just found out how handsome I am?

535
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,959
Don't have any anticipations.

536
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,800
Are you stupid?

537
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,880
Then what are you looking at?

538
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,359
I find you more down-to-earth now

539
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,040
after a night in my home.

540
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,280
What's with that noise?

541
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,119
Can I have some sleep?

542
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,800
It's time for morning exercise.

543
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,040
That's our rule.

544
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,959
What kind of rule is that?

545
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,560
Everyone who lives here

546
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,040
must have morning exercise
every day at five thirty.

547
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,359
No exceptions.

548
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,880
Who made that rule?

549
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,239
Caixia.

550
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,680
So where is she?

551
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,599
In bed.

552
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:03,920
My mom makes the rules.

553
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,880
We practice them.

554
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,959
I knew it.

555
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:06,880
I need to talk to her

556
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,239
about the rules.

557
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,719
Bad idea.

558
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,359
She'll only make more rules.

559
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,760
Only the early birds get the worms.

560
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,880
Morning, dad.

561
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:16,359
Morning.

562
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,199
Young man.

563
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,160
You don't regularly exercise.

564
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:22,839
Right?

565
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Well.

566
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,000
You can join our club.

567
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,760
I'll teach you.

568
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,359
Dad.

569
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,000
Did you forget he has no money?

570
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,319
Never mind.

571
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,959
Keep an even pace, you two.

572
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,560
You don't want to mess your breath.

573
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,319
You didn't learn how to fight

574
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,439
from your dad, right?

575
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,000
How did you know?

576
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,760
My dad is my teacher in name.

577
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,959
But actually,

578
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,040
I learnt more from my mom.

579
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,359
I didn't know she knows how to fight.

580
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:05,000
My mom is keeping
a low profile for my dad.

581
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,599
She believes

582
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,599
that women shouldn't be conspicuous.

583
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,479
But we should learn some moves

584
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,719
so no one could bully us.

585
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,520
Morning.

586
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:18,479
Why so many questions?

587
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,640
Just run.

588
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,520
Why are you running so fast?

589
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,479
You would too

590
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,239
if some people are constantly after you.

591
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,640
Did you borrow money from a loan shark?

592
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,479
Or did you mess with the wrong guy?

593
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,199
Is it going to affect us?

594
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,239
Don't look at me like that.

595
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,599
I know I'm charming.

596
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,479
You ran too fast.

597
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:54,239
Young man.

598
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:56,520
Exercises are very important.

599
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,880
Mister.

600
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,280
Your hand.

601
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,520
My hand's fine. My feet hurt.

602
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,079
Really bad.

603
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,280
He has problems.

604
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,359
Oh, I forgot.

605
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,680
Sorry. You have problems.

606
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:17,904
(Xie Te)

607
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,680
Why didn't you pick up yesterday?

608
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,280
Chief He was right next to me

609
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,800
when you called me yesterday.

610
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,959
They are keeping
an eye on me very closely.

611
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,160
It took me a lot of efforts
to get around him

612
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,760
and fetch stuff in your home.

613
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,079
Do you want to keep your job?

614
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,319
Did you get everything?

615
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,680
I got toothpaste, stereo, humidifier,

616
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,839
(Checklist)
cleaning robot, sleep aids, and sensor light.

617
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,640
I only need an aroma diffuser now.

618
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
There's a bank card in the drawer
in the living room.

619
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,000
Bring that too.

620
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,280
Found it.

621
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,680
You are so clever, Mr. Gu.

622
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,520
The chairman would never have thought

623
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,119
that you have another card

624
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,800
except his additional card.

625
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,560
Okay. Stop sucking up.

626
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,319
Just bring the stuff.

627
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,800
Okay. I'll send them over

628
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,119
after I get the aroma diffuser.

629
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,280
No. Bring them now.

630
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,839
I can't stand her any longer.

631
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:11,040
You are not having
a good time there, Mr. Gu?

632
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:13,520
Yes. I'm having a wonderful time.

633
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,640
Just send it to the address I gave you.

634
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,520
Be careful.

635
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,359
Sure thing.

636
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,319
Thank you.

637
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:35,359
Who is it?

638
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,479
Take a guess.

639
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,680
Chief He.

640
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,079
Why are you here again?

641
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:46,640
Can't we just spare each other?

642
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,199
That's what I want too. Let's go.

643
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,680
Hold him. Let's go.

644
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,599
What are they doing over there?

645
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:05,239
What are you looking at?

646
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,280
Keep it down.

647
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,160
Is this necessary?

648
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,880
I'm not a criminal.

649
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,319
This gives the wrong image.

650
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,239
Then why were you running away?

651
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:16,880
(Gu Rong)

652
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:22,199
(The subscriber you dialed
cannot be reached now.)

653
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,880
Go upstairs and wait there.

654
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,520
Tell me if there's anything.

655
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:32,439
Okay.

656
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,520
Now talk.

657
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,439
Where is Mr. Gu?

658
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,680
Chief He.

659
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,040
Mr. Gu hasn't contacted me yet.

660
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,400
I want to know where he is too.

661
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,479
Don't try to fool me.

662
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,319
Why did you go to his place
if he didn't contact you?

663
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,119
I just wanted to see if he was back.

664
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,760
And then you caught me

665
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,880
when I found out he wasn't.

666
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,239
Everyone in the company knows

667
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:01,199
that you are always with him.

668
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,520
Assistant Xie.

669
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,800
I beg you.

670
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,680
Just give me a little information

671
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,359
about Mr. Gu.

672
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,199
So we can give something
to the chairman.

673
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:11,920
Please.

674
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,640
Yeah.

675
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:16,640
But I really don't know anything.

676
00:31:22,192 --> 00:31:23,216
(Mr. Gu)

677
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,880
Mr. Gu!

678
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,439
(Do you want to get fired?)

679
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:32,479
(Can't you pick up faster?)

680
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,319
Gu Rong.

681
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,280
(Do you know
that everyone in the company)

682
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,160
(is worried about you?)

683
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:38,040
I didn't ask you to worry about me.

684
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,439
Tell grandpa

685
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,959
that there's no way
I'd take over the company.

686
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,479
It's really childish of you

687
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:43,560
to run away from home.

688
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:45,119
Can you take some responsibility?

689
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,079
He hung up?

690
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:49,839
Miss Bai.

691
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,359
Why didn't you ask him where he is?

692
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:52,800
Are you blaming me now?

693
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,160
He didn't mean that.

694
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:59,599
Don't worry, Miss Bai.

695
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,160
This is the internet era.

696
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,640
I'll find him in no time.

697
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,119
Chief He.

698
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,640
Thank you.

699
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,079
That's just my job.

700
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,040
Look.

701
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:13,000
I'll tell you as soon as

702
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:13,959
I find out where he is.

703
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,239
(Bai Anrou)
(If you don't want to get caught,)

704
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,599
(turn off your GPS.)

705
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:32,368
(Turn off)

706
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,520
This watch is really so expensive?

707
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,920
If this watch is not a fake one,

708
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,680
why would he rent our house?

709
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,880
That makes sense.

710
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:51,040
This might be a fake one.

711
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,880
Coming.

712
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,359
Hello. Does Mr. Gu live here?

713
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,640
Yes.

714
00:32:58,719 --> 00:32:59,680
This is his package.

715
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,680
You can give it to me.

716
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,560
Thank you.

717
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:08,199
Gu, your package.

718
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,520
It's heavy.

719
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,479
You are squandering money
when you don't even have any?

720
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:18,400
Open it for me, Su Jingjing.

721
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,520
Am I hearing this right?

722
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,119
You didn't pay the rent.

723
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,199
And now you are ordering me

724
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,920
in my house?

725
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,479
Don't talk like that.

726
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,040
Don't worry, ma'am.

727
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:34,319
I said I would pay the money today.

728
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,359
And I will.

729
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,479
That's good.

730
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,239
But,

731
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,719
I need Su Jingjing
to go to the bank with me.

732
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,400
Me? I'm not going.

733
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,199
You are not the boss.

734
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,680
Now we have online banks,

735
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,640
WeChat Pay and Alipay.

736
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,280
Why would people go to the bank?

737
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,880
I'm not stupid.

738
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,319
Fine.

739
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,280
If she can't come with me

740
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,439
to the bank,

741
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,319
I won't be able to

742
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,599
pay you the money.

743
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,400
They won't believe you.

744
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,000
Of course she's going with you.

745
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,160
She's your bodyguard.

746
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,479
Jingjing, go.

747
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,560
Mom!

748
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:10,320
I just knew that I'm not

749
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,360
your real daughter.

750
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:12,239
Oh, ma'am.

751
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:13,879
Do you have a hat

752
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,199
that can cover up your face?

753
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,520
Hat?

754
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,840
Actually I do.

755
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,280
Is that guy playing the ultraman?

756
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,439
It's ironman.

757
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,800
Look how he's dressing.

758
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,040
Yeah, fancy.

759
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,239
He's tall and handsome.

760
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:46,600
I want no one's attention.

761
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,159
Not that I want attention.

762
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,520
No one's forcing you.

763
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,479
(Jingjing.)

764
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,080
(That guy's acting strange.)

765
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,199
(To make sure you're safe,)

766
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,600
(I put a rolling pin in your purse.)

767
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,159
If he's really a bad guy,

768
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,520
how can this mini rolling pin

769
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,719
help me?

770
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,080
Why are we riding the bus?

771
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,199
Dude.

772
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,719
You are going to the west of the city.

773
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,639
I'm living in the east.

774
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,159
Should I walk 30 kilometers?

775
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:21,320
Call a taxi.

776
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,600
Do you have money?

777
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,639
I'll pay you back when I get the money.

778
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,360
But who can I go to

779
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,840
if you don't get it?

780
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,840
I have money.

781
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:31,760
Yeah?

782
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,639
The bus is here.

783
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:39,040
Come on, mister.

784
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,399
You are making a man feel safe.

785
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,800
You are not making a woman feel safe.

786
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,520
That was a compliment.

787
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,439
Shut up if you are really grateful.

788
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,040
Why do you have to

789
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,719
go all the way here to withdraw money?

790
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:28,000
Is there even a bank here?

791
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,840
There is. I looked up.

792
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,000
Are you going to withdraw a billion?

793
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,199
Why don't you ask them

794
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,479
to send a cash truck to my home?

795
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,439
I don't want any unwanted attention.

796
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,840
Why did you take my phone?

797
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,399
I need directions. Mine's dead.

798
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,479
(What does he want?)

799
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,879
(Can it be what I thought?)

800
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,360
(Either money or me?)

801
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,320
(But all I have)

802
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,360
(is beauty.)

803
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:01,479
(I don't have money.)

804
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,679
(What an evil person.)

805
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,600
(We even took him in for one night.)

806
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,760
(I should get him first.)

807
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,239
Here we are.

808
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,560
Where?

809
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:20,399
Then what are you waiting for? Go.

810
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,439
Do it for me.

811
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,439
Me?

812
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,520
Why can't you go?

813
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,919
Is this card frozen too?

814
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,199
This card is good.

815
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,719
I didn't use it much.

816
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,199
If the card is good,
then you are not good.

817
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:33,560
Are you going to run away

818
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:34,800
when I'm in there?

819
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,280
Yeah, and leave you all the money.

820
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,320
You are not that stupid.

821
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,879
The password is 000627.

822
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,959
Withdraw 20000 for me.

823
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,959
One, two, three, four, five, six,

824
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,199
seven...

825
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,159
Why does he have so much money?

826
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:08,919
Oh, my God.

827
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,159
You would too

828
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,639
if some people are constantly after you.

829
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:25,840
(This card is good.)

830
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:27,159
(I didn't use it much.)

831
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,919
Acting weird, loads of money,

832
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,879
and avoiding attention.

833
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,000
I was right.

834
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,439
Gu Rong

835
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:38,879
is an outlaw.

836
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,239
Su Jingjing.

837
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,000
You can't give up your principles

838
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,800
just for some money.

839
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,719
The law judges everyone.

840
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:50,439
Wait till I bring you

841
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,080
to justice.

842
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,679
