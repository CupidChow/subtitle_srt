Let's go back.

00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
They should be worried.

32
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,679
Cause someone was wasting time.

33
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,559
I was wasting time?

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,320
I told you to dress normally.

35
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,119
You wouldn't listen.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,199
You just had to put on your fancy pants.

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,520
If it weren't for me,

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,279
they would've got you long ago.

39
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,399
You are so noisy.

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,520
I'm noisy?

41
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,679
-It's me who saved you.
-Shut up.

42
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,039
Okay.

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,679
(It's really difficult for me.)

48
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

49
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,440
I understand.

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,800
Hello.

52
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,960
Who are you looking for?

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,839
Hello.

54
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:00,919
I'm looking for Gu Rong.

55
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,320
Is he here?

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,919
Ai Mi.

57
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,080
It's been so long.

58
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,720
Maybe something happened to them?

59
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,720
Don't imagine the worst thing.

60
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,559
I'll text her.

61
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,752
(Where are you?)

62
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,119
Ms. Bai.

63
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,639
What's going on?

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,119
Why is someone after him?

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,039
Why is he running?

66
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,119
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,080
I can't disclose anything

68
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,119
in the company.

69
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:35,080
Ai Mi.

70
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,279
I'll go to the police office.

71
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,440
We can't sit here waiting.

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,440
No.

73
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,720
Don't go to the police.

74
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,000
What does that mean, Ms. Bai?

75
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,119
I mean, you don't have to.

76
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,320
Senior.

77
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:49,399
Jingjing!

78
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,199
Jingjing.

79
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,039
Where did you go?

80
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,360
You didn't answer your phone.

81
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,600
Where were you?

82
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,679
With him.

83
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,679
What's going on?

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,039
Why did you have to run?

85
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,679
Ms. Su.

86
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,160
You didn't take care of Mr. Gu well.

87
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,800
I was there too.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,360
Someone was after him.

89
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,240
What's it got to do with Jingjing?

90
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,000
Ms. Su is working for Mr. Gu.

91
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,000
It's her job to take care of him.

92
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,479
Jingjing is just an assistant.

93
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,919
She's not his nanny.

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,559
Ms. Su is...

95
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,440
Enough.

96
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,519
It's nothing alarming.

97
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,119
That guy was my employee.

98
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:19,760
I fired him.

99
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,200
And he wants to go back to the company.

100
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,600
I didn't want to be pestered,

101
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,640
so I asked Su Jingjing to take me away.

102
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,119
Jingjing.

103
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,239
Is that so?

104
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,920
It is.

105
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,760
What happened today

106
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,359
has nothing to do with Su Jingjing.

107
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,799
Yes.

108
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,600
Just like he said.

109
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,480
Well, no one got hurt or anything.

110
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:49,959
I think we can leave it at that.

111
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,359
I'll go upstairs.

112
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Jingjing.

113
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,119
Han Ran.

114
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,799
Mr. Gu already explained.

115
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,239
That must be the case.

116
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,119
Jingjing is safe.

117
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,519
Let's leave it.

118
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,040
I still have other plans.

119
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,559
I'll go home now.

120
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,519
Gu Rong.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,839
I need to talk to you.

122
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,679
Are you really going to
stay here in a long term?

123
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,839
Yes, for a while.

124
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,279
Why do you want to tell me?

125
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,799
Do you remember
the acquisition of Hualin?

126
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,440
Yes.

127
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,480
I paused it today.

128
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,720
You can take charge of that.

129
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,040
There's no need to tell me.

130
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,640
Grandpa is really unwell lately.

131
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,079
You are not there. I'm all alone...

132
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,040
Anrou, with your ability,

133
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,679
grandpa has nothing to worry about.

134
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,000
Moreover, there are so many
senior members in the company.

135
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,200
Everyone knows what you are capable of.

136
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,359
Don't restrain yourself.

137
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,679
Just do it.

138
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,519
You've done a lot
for the company lately.

139
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,359
I thank you on behalf of grandpa.

140
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,480
I know why you hired Ms. Su

141
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,200
as your bodyguard.

142
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
But why do you have to

143
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,640
keep it from her senior?

144
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,640
I promised her to keep it a secret.

145
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,959
And this is just between the two of us.

146
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,920
There's no need to let him know.

147
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,559
Ms. Su seems kind of special.

148
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:13,279
Yeah.

149
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,040
She's pretty interesting.

150
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,480
Right.

151
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,760
Chief He knows you live around here now.

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,279
He will put more men around this place.

153
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:31,519
Your grandpa will find
here sooner or later.

154
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,320
You have a better chance

155
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,880
if you get out of the city.

156
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,760
It's easier to hide when
you are constantly moving.

157
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,279
And you can take it as a trip too.

158
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,760
I'll think about it.

159
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:50,799
I'll be on my way then.

160
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,679
Why did he help me out?

161
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,160
Senior.

162
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,679
How are you? Are you hurt?

163
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,279
No, I'm fine.

164
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,000
Jingjing.

165
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,760
I have something to tell you.

166
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,359
Have a seat, senior.

167
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,399
You too.

168
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,880
Jingjing.

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,679
I don't think Mr. Gu treats you

170
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,119
like how an employer

171
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,679
treats his employee.

172
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,399
I feel like there's something strange.

173
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,480
No. There's not.

174
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,079
We are just like

175
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,239
an employer and an employee.

176
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,040
Clear as day.

177
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,279
That's good.

178
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,279
Mr. Gu and we

179
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,079
are from two different worlds.

180
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,559
This is just one of his spurs.

181
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,359
Do you understand what I mean?

182
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:00,600
Yes. My parents let him in
because he paid a lot.

183
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,320
Why are you still like a little girl

184
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,959
when you've all grown up?

185
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,720
You are an adult now.

186
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,959
I can't pry into your life.

187
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,119
But I hope that

188
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,640
you will always

189
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,480
set your safety as priority.

190
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:16,239
Okay?

191
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,600
It's strange enough

192
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,880
that he lives here.

193
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,720
Now we know that
some people are after him.

194
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,320
And that Ms. Bai

195
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,440
just blamed it all on you

196
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,079
without even asking what happened.

197
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,839
We don't know what they are doing.

198
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,760
But don't get yourself involved, okay?

199
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,919
And don't let them bully you.

200
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,760
Got it?

201
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
Don't worry. Who would dare bully me?

202
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,039
That's more like it.

203
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:48,719
Mistress.

204
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,320
Ran.

205
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,760
I made soup

206
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,479
with lotus root and ribs.

207
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,119
Stay for dinner.

208
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,359
You have to.

209
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,080
Mistress.

210
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,799
It'll be ready soon.

211
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,919
Jingjing.

212
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,200
My last book signing is in a few days.

213
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,559
Do you want to go with me?

214
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,359
Take it as a short trip.

215
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,280
I would love to.

216
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,359
That's a deal then.

217
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,760
Have some tea, senior.

218
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,359
Come in.

219
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,039
Mr. Gu.

220
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,799
What?

221
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,359
You are reading?

222
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,039
I prepared some food.

223
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,400
Do you want some?

224
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,679
I don't want to make my hands dirty.

225
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,479
I'll do it for you.

226
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,679
Here, Mr. Gu.

227
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,400
Are your hands clean?

228
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,440
I'll clean them.

229
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,640
Here.

230
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,599
This is so sour.

231
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,239
Well, have some biscuits then.

232
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:33,000
Or have some yogurt. That'll help.

233
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:36,520
You really want to go with him so much?

234
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,760
Give me a few days off, please.

235
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,479
I promise.

236
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,080
I'll work twice as hard when I'm back.

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,080
No.

238
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,000
Fine. You evil capitalist.

239
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,400
I didn't say you can't go.

240
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,919
You'll let me go?

241
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,039
Because I'm going too.

242
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,960
You are not exactly taking a vacation.

243
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,400
Why do you want to go?

244
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,799
I want to take a trip.

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,799
It's boring to stay here all the time.

246
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,159
It's just a book signing session.

247
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:20,440
Why are you bringing so much stuff?

248
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,840
I even brought a 6 feet third wheel.

249
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,679
You should be grateful

250
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,880
that I gave you a paid vacation.

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,919
One more gripe,

252
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,880
and I'll show him

253
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,880
the video.

254
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,919
Fine, you win.

255
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,719
You are coming too, Mr. Gu?

256
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,239
You don't mind, do you?

257
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,200
And you are not off work.

258
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm going on a trip with you.

259
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,479
Your boss always comes first.

260
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,520
Can you do it?

261
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,479
I can do it.

262
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:55,479
I want more sincerity.

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,359
I can do it, Mr. Gu.

264
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,000
Look at me.

265
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,039
I can do it, Mr. Gu.

266
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,760
Let's get in.

267
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,799
Okay.

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,799
Jingjing, sit in the back with Mr. Gu.

269
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,880
I would like that too.

270
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,960
You have work, senior.

271
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:12,320
I can sit in the front.

272
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,799
You should have a rest in the back.

273
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,479
I'll do it.

274
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,159
Look at that car.

275
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,039
It's so cool.

There's only one bed?

287
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,679
I didn't know you'd come

288
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,000
when I booked the hotel.

289
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,359
This place is in peak season now.

290
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,080
There's no room left.

291
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,280
Maybe you can sleep on the couch.

292
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,799
Why don't you find another hotel?

293
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,640
You don't have to share a room with me.

294
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,000
You think I want that?

295
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,880
What's for dinner, senior?

296
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,320
My friend recommended a restaurant.

297
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,400
It should be good.

298
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,039
Let's try it out.

299
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,880
Everything you pick must be good.

300
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,799
This is your outfit
for the signing session?

301
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,039
It's a bit crumpled.

302
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,880
I'll ask the hotel staff

303
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,640
to iron it for me.

304
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,719
I'll do it for you.

305
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,200
Thank you then, little one.

306
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,119
No problem.

307
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,799
Senior, I...

308
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
What is it, Mr. Gu?

309
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,919
There's only one bed in his room.

310
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,400
I can't sleep on a couch.

311
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,239
What should we do then?

312
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,760
You can come with me to another hotel.

313
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,320
No. I'm not going anywhere.

314
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,840
You are my bodyguard.

315
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,760
You should be with me all the time.

316
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,039
Don't make this difficult for me.

317
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,960
My senior is here.

318
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,400
I can't just leave him.

319
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,719
So what now?

320
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,760
Well, you can't sleep here.

321
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,239
Maybe I can.

322
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,799
You wish.

323
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,320
You can sleep on the bed.

324
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,640
What? Come again?

325
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,280
What's this smell?

326
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,280
The suit!

327
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,479
What should I do?

328
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,280
Do you know this brand?

329
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,520
I do.

330
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,520
Is it expensive?

331
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,320
Can I buy another one of this?

332
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,599
It's customized design.
What do you think?

333
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,080
I shouldn't have come here.

334
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,239
No. I shouldn't have brought you here.

335
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,960
Get ready, Jingjing.
We're going to dinner now.

336
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,400
What should I do? I'm screwed.

337
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,400
Is this your emergency plan?

338
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,239
Zip it. I'll think of something.

339
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,239
Have a seat.

340
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,039
You can sit here, Jingjing.

341
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,200
What would you like?

342
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,400
What about this?

343
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,200
Hello. We're ready to order.

344
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,119
Coming. Welcome. This is your apron.

345
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:55,640
Hello, your apron.

346
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,840
Hello.

347
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,320
Excuse me.

348
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,479
Are you Han Ran?

349
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:01,840
Yes, I am.

350
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,880
God. I'm your fan.

351
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,880
I love your books.

352
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,680
Thank you.

353
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,680
Can I take a picture with you?

354
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,359
Okay.

355
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,959
Thank you.

356
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,920
I'll help you with this.

357
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,680
The oil will splash for a bit.

358
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,599
Okay, thanks.

359
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,319
That's Han Ran over there.

360
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,680
Look at his signature.

361
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,000
Mr. Han. Doesn't it bother you

362
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,160
when strangers touch you?

363
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,239
Mr. Gu.

364
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
I don't have Haphephobia.

365
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,920
Jingjing. You overheated it.

366
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,119
What? I didn't.

367
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:53,479
Oh, you mean the food.

368
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,000
I didn't see it.

369
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,079
I'll do it.

370
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,079
Are you feeling unwell, Jingjing?

371
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,680
No.

372
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,560
You look a little anxious.

373
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:07,479
I...

374
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,160
I probably didn't rest well.

375
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,280
I probably didn't rest well.

376
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,280
Then have some more.

377
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,040
And have a good night's sleep.

378
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,000
Here. Have this.

379
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,079
(Send me the address of
the men's clothes design studio.)

380
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,479
Ms. Li. Hello.

381
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,280
Tomorrow afternoon? Wait a second.

382
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,199
I have to check my schedule.

383
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:41,479
Su Jingjing, come here.

384
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,199
What?

385
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,040
What will you do with that suit?

386
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,239
Can you stop mentioning it?

387
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,680
I'm anxious enough.

388
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:11,504
(Men's clothes design studio.
No. 156 Nanhu Road.)

389
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,319
This address is...

390
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,239
You know what it is.

391
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,839
You saved my life.

392
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,359
So now I'm a good person?

393
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,520
Yes. You are the kindest in the world.

394
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,599
Because you look like a walking corpse.

395
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,439
I don't want you to make more trouble.

396
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,719
You did a good thing,

397
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,400
but you just had to make that face.

398
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,880
I'll remember this though.

399
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,839
Bring the suit there.

400
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,079
Someone knows what to do.

401
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:47,640
Right away. Thank you.

402
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,520
(That thing I told you
to ask Dr. Zhang about.)

403
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,119
(How is it?)

404
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,920
Are you Ms. Su?

405
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,839
Yes.

406
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,079
Mr. Gu has informed us.

407
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,479
Can I see the suit?

408
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,599
The damage is more
serious than I thought.

409
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,520
Are you in a hurry?

410
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,479
Yes. The sooner the better.

411
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,959
I see.

412
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,160
The best way to do it

413
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,800
is to make a new sleeve.

414
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,160
I asked the best tailor to stay

415
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,839
after Mr. Gu told me about this.

416
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,359
Don't worry.

417
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,479
You won't notice a thing

418
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,079
after he's done.

419
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,560
Thank you so much for this.

420
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,520
The cost is...

421
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,040
Mr. Gu already paid.

422
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,839
But this may take a while.

423
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,040
Maybe you can go home.

424
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
And we'll send it to you

425
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:50,959
after it's done.

426
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,719
It's okay. I can wait here.

427
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:54,479
Okay. This way.

428
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,839
Thank you.

429
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,439
Now I owe him even more.

430
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,880
We'll do the interview

431
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,479
before the signing session.

432
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:08,599
Right.

433
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,079
I want the vibe to be more relaxed.

434
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,000
Okay. See you tomorrow. Ms. Li.

435
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,680
Mr. Han. I told you.

436
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,079
I can't sleep on the couch.

437
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,599
Mr. Gu.

438
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,800
Don't you think you
should keep a distance

439
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,359
from your employee's private life?

440
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,359
Distance?

441
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,400
Such a sweet guy like you.

442
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,839
Being all gentle and nice

443
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,680
to every girl

444
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,520
that comes your way.

445
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,359
Do you know what distance means?

446
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,319
Such a playboy like you.

447
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,319
Do you know what manners mean?

448
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,040
You probably like it a lot

449
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,119
being surrounded by girls, right?

450
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,319
Mr. Gu, people like you

451
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,079
shouldn't come to ordinary life.

452
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,920
Your spur of the moment

453
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,880
is unbearable to ordinary people.

454
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,560
Especially Su Jingjing.

455
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,160
Who are you to her?

456
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,280
I'm her senior.

457
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:03,760
I'm done arguing.

458
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,760
Have the bed. I'll sleep on the couch.

459
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,959
You've already sat on it.

460
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,760
I don't want it.

461
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:35,079
(Only people as naive as her)

462
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:37,119
(can be fooled by this kind of guy.)

463
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,599
Where is she?

464
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,199
(Sorry.)

465
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,800
(The phone you dialed is not answered.)

466
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,839
Why isn't she picking up?

467
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,560
Silly woman.

468
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,920
She can't still be
at the tailor shop, can she?

469
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,479
Now she's sacrificing her sleep

470
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,199
for that guy?

471
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,920
Employee lost during a business trip

472
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,479
should be counted as a work injury.

473
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,359
As an employer,

474
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:56,319
it's only natural to find her.

475
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,000
But she's doing this

476
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,160
for her senior.

477
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:00,599
What's that got to do with you?

478
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,520
Never mind.

479
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,119
Where is she going to find
a better boss than me?

480
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,479
She just doesn't cherish it.

481
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,800
I just knew.

482
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,800
Silly woman.

483
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,040
You are having
a sweet dream, aren't you?

484
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,760

I'll leave this here.

520
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,439
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

521
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,959
Just don't make any more trouble for me.

522
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:21,520
Jingjing.

523
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,439
I can't believe this.

524
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,640
I would have thought this is a new suit

525
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,280
if I didn't know.

526
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,199
I'm glad that I didn't screw it up.

527
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,359
Of course you didn't.

528
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,880
I'll go out in this later.

529
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,680
You have work later?

530
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,319
I forgot to tell you.

531
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:39,760
It was a short notice.

532
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,359
An interview this afternoon.

533
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:44,280
Is it going to take a long time?

534
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,839
I don't think so.
It should be over before five.

535
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:49,199
That's good.

536
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
I want to go out later.

537
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:52,000
Come with me, Su Jingjing.

538
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,719
Okay. Jingjing.

539
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,439
Be careful, okay?

540
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,640
I'll contact you when I'm done.

541
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,239
I'll make arrangements for tonight.

542
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,319
Come on.

543
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,920
Do you like the cream

544
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,760
I bought for you?

545
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,319
I do. You can give me another set.

546
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,000
(Welcome to lake island)
You are going to the lake island too?

547
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:33,439
Do you know about this?

548
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:35,199
What?

549
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,680
I started to prepare so long ago.

550
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,079
How did you know?

551
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,319
I didn't.

552
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:45,160
But even this hotel
is named lakeside hotel.

553
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,239
It's not that difficult to put together.

554
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:51,760
Fine.

555
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:58,520
This one.

556
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,040
This looks good.

557
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,800
This one is good.

558
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:02,839
Look at this.

559
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:04,599
Which color do you want?

560
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,959
Get this one for me, please.

561
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,439
I like the red one.

562
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:08,920
Thank you.

563
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,479
I want the blue one.

564
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:12,920
Blue it is, then.

565
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:13,599
Okay.

566
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,599
You want red?

567
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,800
(Last ship: 18:00)
Now it's half past two.

568
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,640
One hour to the island.

569
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,160
One hour for setting up.

570
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,079
He's off work at five.

571
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,040
And one hour

572
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,640
for him to come here.

573
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,640
There should be enough time.

574
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:34,280
And my stuff.

575
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:37,839
Photos. Candles.

576
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,000
I have those.

577
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,880
(Mr. Gu. Dr. Zhang replied.)

578
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,599
(He told me to congratulate you first.)

579
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,599
(You may have found the cure)

580
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,199
(this time.)

581
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,400
What does it mean?

582
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:53,079
(I wanted to talk to him in person.)

583
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,560
(But it's his day off.)

584
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,119
(I wanted to go to his home.)

585
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,319
(But it started to rain.
I'm still waiting for it to stop.)

586
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,400
Get to the point.

587
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,359
(He said, keep touching, keep watching.)

588
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:04,959
(It's the best)

589
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,839
(if you can bring her to him.)

590
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,479
Keep it up.

591
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:16,080
(Let's have a trip together.)

592
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,119
Work is hard.

593
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:35,056
(Ai Mi's Toy Shop)

594
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,439
Hello.

595
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:47,079
Sorry. I'm blocking the entrance.

596
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,680
It's okay.

597
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,959
Not much customers
on a rainy day anyway.

598
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,439
Do you want to come in?

599
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,359
Don't bother.

600
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,479
I can just stand here.

601
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,640
The rain should stop soon.

602
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,439
Here.

603
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,040
Thank you. But...

604
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:38,920
It's okay. Just bring it
the next time you pass by.

605
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,959
Bye.

606
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:02,320
(Ai Mi's Toy Shop)

607
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,000
Stand back.

608
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,319
Let's go.

609
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,920
(Keep touching, keep watching.)

610
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,599
Why are you staring at me?

611
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,839
Is there something on my face?

612
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,560
I was thinking,

613
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,560
why you bring a suitcase

614
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,400
to the island.

615
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,040
Are you going to move here?

616
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,319
I have a plan.

617
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:06,760
What?

618
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,479
Guess I can tell you.

619
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,040
I will confess here.

620
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,600
To Han Ran?

621
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,159
Yes. You sound shocked.

622
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:27,199
Why do you want to confess now?

623
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,919
Why not?

624
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,239
I always wanted to do it.

625
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,600
This is a good opportunity.

626
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,600
I will give him a surprise.

627
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,080
It'll probably be a shock.

628
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,239
I wouldn't have helped you
with that suitcase

629
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,360
if I knew what's in it.

630
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:46,800
What did you say?

631
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,120
I said go faster.

632
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,520
I didn't ask for your help.

633
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,000
This is not a good sign.

634
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,600
Are you sure you will confess today?

635
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:03,040
You jinx.

636
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,080
Su Jingjing.

637
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,000
I want a coke.

638
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,199
I don't have it.

639
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,959
You clearly do.

640
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,439
I'll give you back ten boxes
if you give me one can.

641
00:35:27,984 --> 00:35:32,336
(Not to be liked by all people,
just to be your special)

642
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,879
Why don't you drink water? It's better.

643
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,199
No, I want coke.

644
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,399
Well, no.

645
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,919
What's the big deal with a coke?

646
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,199
I'm your creditor.

647
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,000
Love always comes first.

648
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,959
Do you understand?

649
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,320
What? He's going to love you

650
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:55,679
if he drinks your coke?

651
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:57,879
You will be thirsty to die
if you don't drink it?

652
00:35:58,399 --> 00:35:59,959
Yes. Give it to me.

653
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,719
No.

654
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:01,959
Give it to me.

655
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:04,000
Give it back.

656
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,360
Give it back.

657
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,159
Give it...

658
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,719
No.

659
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,760
Give it back.

660
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,320
Are you three?

661
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,360
Why did you take my coke?

662
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,120
It's all wet.

663
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,600
Not my fault.

664
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,320
You shook it too much in your suitcase.

665
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:55,320
Are you stupid?

666
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,760
Who dries photos like that?

667
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,520
Just give it to me.

668
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,919
You should check the almanac.

669
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,760
All the signs are telling you

670
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,439
that today's not the day to confess.

671
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:10,560
Today's not the day to bring you here.

672
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,000
All you do is making troubles.

673
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,320
Leave me alone.

674
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:15,320
I have work to do.

675
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,919
Are you setting up a wedding?

676
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,760
I haven't thought about wedding yet.

677
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:05,120
What's the point of all these photos?

678
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,560
They have a point to me.

679
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,959
Can you even tell them apart?

680
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:11,439
Why can't I?

681
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,800
How hard can that be?

682
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:15,120
Look at these photos.

683
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,439
Your poses and expressions

684
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:17,719
are identical in all of them.

685
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,199
Can't you see?

686
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,840
I look good from this angle.

687
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,080
This is just a trick girls have.

688
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,320
You wouldn't understand.

689
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,639
You've never smiled like that to me.

690
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,360
Why should I?

691
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:32,879
I'm your bodyguard.

692
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,760
Aren't you tired from
pretending to be a lady?

693
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,000
I am not.

694
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,199
You can pretend for now.

695
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,520
But you can't pretend forever.

696
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,280
I don't think

697
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,120
you understand what love is.

698
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,800
Fine. You've tried it.

699
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,719
You know so much about it.

700
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:53,800
Nowadays a rich guy like you...

701
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,080
I haven't tried it.

702
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,719
Then why are you lecturing me?

703
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,120
This is the fridge theory.
Don't you know?

704
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,679
What does that mean?

705
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:08,159
I haven't tried it.

706
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,600
But I've seen it.

707
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,159
You never had a girlfriend?

708
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:20,040
I can't believe it.
