(Leave me alone)

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,399
You can use this phone for now.

29
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,919
Xie's number and mine are in it.

30
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,199
You can call him if you need anything.

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,520
Or me.

32
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,279
Okay. Thank you.

33
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,000
Your forehead...

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,839
It's no big deal.

35
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,160
Be careful.

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,919
That girl...

37
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,000
Her name is Su Jingjing.

38
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,320
She's fine too.
Just can't stand the sight of blood.

39
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,720
But you just took her in your arms.

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,960
I seem to be fine

41
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,600
with touching her.

42
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,919
Is that why

43
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,039
you chose to live here?

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,839
Sort of.

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,320
How long do you plan to stay here?

46
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,080
I don't know.

47
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,320
Not for a while though.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
I think grandpa needs some time

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,119
to reconsider who should

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,399
take over the company.

51
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,880
After he gets the answer,

52
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,080
I'll be back.

53
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,199
But I don't think it's safe here.

54
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,839
Not safe? No.

55
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,240
It's downright dangerous.

56
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,080
You see?

57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,800
What did I say?

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,360
Did you use the rolling pin?

59
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,520
Of course.

60
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,360
Mom, we can't keep him here anymore.

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

62
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,440
Wait.

63
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:43,399
I don't think

64
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,199
it makes sense.

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,119
Why?

66
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,240
Let's go through what happened.

67
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,639
Why bother?

68
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:53,160
You hit him, right?

69
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,679
And he sent you back.

70
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,160
Does that make any sense?

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,320
Well, it's weird indeed.

72
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,199
Right?

73
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,919
I know.

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,119
He's playing a trick.

75
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,679
He sent me back home

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,199
to gain your trust.

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,720
And then

78
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,000
he can take us all.

79
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,000
Didn't you see the woman
looking for him?

80
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,600
She's not ordinary people.

81
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,960
And the way she looks at him.

82
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:17,760
He probably owes her a lot emotionally.

83
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,239
- Let me tell you.
- Dear.

84
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:20,799
Say no more.

85
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,040
I have to throw him out today.

86
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
That's right.

87
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,600
- He has to go today.
- Is that necessary?

88
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,239
I'll take one too.

89
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,359
Slow down, you too.

90
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,239
It's really not necessary.

91
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,559
If you do this,

92
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,519
grandpa will be so upset.

93
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
He's been running the company

94
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,399
for so many years.

95
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,160
He wants to relax now.

96
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,839
It's understandable.

97
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,200
I understand.

98
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,040
But I think

99
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,799
I'm more cut out to be
a professional manager.

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,320
I have my own life.

101
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,839
I don't like other people
planning it for me.

102
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,040
I'll try to find a way

103
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,320
to make him understand that.

104
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,279
Mu Lan joined the army for her father.
You go first.

105
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,239
Who's gonna go?

106
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,480
Maybe I should go?

107
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:03,959
No.

108
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,440
You cowards.

109
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,760
Go.

110
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,399
Geez.

111
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:07,799
I'll do it.

112
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,160
No matter what,

113
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,079
you are still the only successor
of the Gu Group.

114
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:12,359
You should...

115
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,559
W-What did she just say?

116
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,799
S-She said

117
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,440
Gu Rong is the only successor
of the Gu Group.

118
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,480
The only...

119
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,559
Successor...

120
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,519
The chairman of Gu Group

121
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,399
attended the gala
with his grandson, Gu Rong.

122
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,799
The only one

123
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,559
grandson.

124
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,600
Is that him?

125
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:58,000
Give it here.

126
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,880
Let me see.

127
00:05:59,119 --> 00:05:59,839
Is it?

128
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,959
Yes.

129
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:01,959
It's him.

130
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,959
The haircut.

131
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,920
The nose.

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,440
The elegance.

133
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,200
The small eyes.

134
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,119
That's definitely him.

135
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,880
You see?

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,519
No wonder he was so confident yesterday.

137
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:12,040
He said money is not a problem.

138
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,320
He's right.

139
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:14,559
You two

140
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,320
almost drove away

141
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,799
such a good tenant.

142
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,359
How can you say that?

143
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,079
If I didn't let him leave the watch,

144
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,359
he wouldn't have stayed here.

145
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:27,040
How much is the watch worth?

146
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,079
How much...?

147
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:28,959
I...

148
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,119
You clearly never had any good things.

149
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,079
Hold on.

150
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,679
Enough about the watch.

151
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,799
Does it mean I have to work for him

152
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,239
once he has paid the money

153
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,559
and the contract becomes effective?

154
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,760
Is that so?

155
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,279
I guess so.

156
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,480
That's it.

157
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,040
That's what it means.

158
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,519
Yeah.

159
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,720
Check the amount.

160
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,600
Yeah.

161
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,559
That's not

162
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,480
necessary.

163
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
My watch...

164
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:58,559
It's here.

165
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,799
Here.

166
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,760
Easy.

167
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,559
Here it is.

168
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,359
Thank you.

169
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,000
Well then.

170
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:11,519
The contract is effective now.

171
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,559
So now,

172
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:13,600
can I live in her room?

173
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,959
No problem.

174
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,200
It's great.

175
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,000
Su Jingjing.

176
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,160
Clean it up for me.

177
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,760
Jingjing.

178
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,559
Use your hands.

179
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,399
Don't kick it.

180
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,559
I can't get it up.

181
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,839
It can't go through.

182
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,079
The door is in the way.

183
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,200
Lift it up.

184
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,359
If it can go in, then it can go out.

185
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,200
Can't you see it's stuck?

186
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:31,679
Of course it will get stuck

187
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:32,799
if you keep it horizontal.

188
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,799
Why don't you lift it up vertically?

189
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,359
Su Jingjing.

190
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,040
Did you pay any attention
in your geometry class?

191
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,040
You know what?

192
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,640
She never passed geometry exams

193
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,359
in high school.

194
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,519
What's wrong

195
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,760
with the sofa being here?

196
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,040
Why do you want it out?

197
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,799
Because it's pink.

198
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,839
What's wrong with pink?

199
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,640
No color I hate

200
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,200
can be in the place I sleep.

201
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,399
Hurry up.

202
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,320
And clean all of those too.

203
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,399
I wasn't gonna leave them to you anyway.

204
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,720
Well.

205
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,239
Jingjing.

206
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,480
Can you two stop?

207
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,559
I'm stuck here.

208
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,679
The frame is hurting me.

209
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,640
Come on.

210
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,959
Up.

211
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,679
Gu.

212
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,440
The beddings

213
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,160
are all new.

214
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,079
Take them.

215
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,880
Thank you.

216
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,239
Oh.

217
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,519
Is there a free laptop here?

218
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,519
Jingjing has one.

219
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,200
It's right there.

220
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,160
Use it.

221
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:16,720
It's okay.

222
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,399
No way.

223
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,959
It's my laptop.

224
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,119
How can you let him use it?

225
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,480
It's my privacy.

226
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,119
I'm not interested in your privacy.

227
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,279
It's just a laptop.

228
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,040
He will give it back.

229
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,399
Don't be stingy.

230
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,239
Here.

231
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:31,920
Take it.

232
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
It's okay.

233
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:33,919
Come.

234
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,760
We still have work to do.

235
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,440
Get up.

236
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,719
Why?

237
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,239
You hate pink, don't you?

238
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,760
Pink.

239
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,200
Get up.

240
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,599
Ruining the book signing isn't enough.

241
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,479
Now he even took my room.

242
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,080
Why do I have to meet him?

243
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:26,919
It's just a toy.

244
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,520
I'll pay the price.

245
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,479
Pay?

246
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,719
Can you afford it?

247
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,919
Do you think you can buy
anything with money?

248
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,039
Listen.

249
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
This thing.

250
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,479
You can't buy it with
a hundred times more money.

251
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,280
Su Jingjing.

252
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,239
Bring me a glass of 50-degree water.

253
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,479
You came all the way to my door.

254
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,559
Why can't you get the water yourself?

255
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,239
You are not missing a limb.

256
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,799
You won't go?

257
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,280
Ma'am!

258
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,520
I'll go!

259
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,039
I'll go.

260
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,679
It's too hot.

261
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,320
50-degree, remember?

262
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,239
Too cold.

263
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,880
Mr. Gu.

264
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,840
I used a thermometer.

265
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,039
Nothing more, nothing less.

266
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,080
Drink it.

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,239
You used a thermometer?

268
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,159
How can I drink the water

269
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,679
if you put the thermometer in there?

270
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,000
Mr. Gu.

271
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,919
I'm really curious.

272
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,599
Why did you leave your palace

273
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,599
to suffer in our house?

274
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:04,520
For what?

275
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,320
I don't want to take over the company.

276
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,719
That's news.

277
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:09,559
Normally,

278
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,799
the successors

279
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,960
would start a war

280
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:14,239
to take over the family business.

281
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,200
Why are you

282
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
so special?

283
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,719
I'm the only successor.

284
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,520
Oh, poor you.

285
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,719
Why don't you go ask your grandpa

286
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,080
if he wants a granddaughter?

287
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,239
I'll take over the business for you.

288
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:27,039
Okay.

289
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,320
Do it.

290
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,039
Such a weirdo.

291
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,920
All the talk about
how he doesn't want the company.

292
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,000
And the fancy way he dresses.

293
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,440
He wants everyone to know he's rich.

294
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,440
Hypocrite.

295
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
You killed my son!

296
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,840
She designs it.

297
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:59,200
No wonder she calls it son.

298
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,039
(I'm sorry)

299
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,119
(for breaking your toy.)

300
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,159
(You can decide)

301
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,679
(how I should pay for it.)

302
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
Su Jingjing.

303
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,679
Su Jingjing.

304
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
Su Jingjing.

305
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,280
You won't get up?

306
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,919
Move it.

307
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,239
Get up now.

308
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,000
You...

309
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:14,640
Where are you going?

310
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,359
What did I do?

311
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,200
Why are you in my room
in the middle of the night?

312
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,359
And you said you're not a bad guy?

313
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,919
You wanted to attack me.

314
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,559
Who's attacking you?

315
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,320
Look where your hands go.

316
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,479
Who's the bad guy now?

317
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,080
Don't flatter yourself.

318
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:32,200
This is self-defense.

319
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,479
Self-defense?

320
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,679
Look where you are right now.

321
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,200
Of course I'm...

322
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,039
I...

323
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,159
Get down.

324
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,159
I went to the wrong room.

325
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,679
I'm telling you.

326
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,400
Stop calling me bad guy.

327
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,359
Or you'll pay for it with your salary.

328
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,719
Go back.

329
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,719
Sleep.

330
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,919
Acting all bossy in my home.

331
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,280
Su Jingjing.

332
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,960
You are so stupid.

333
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,479
S-Senior.

334
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,919
Why are you here?

335
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,960
I have some free time.

336
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,440
So I decided to pay a visit.

337
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,320
Well.

338
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,239
Let's go in.

339
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,840
Master and Mistress aren't home?

340
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,239
My dad went to hand out leaflets.

341
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,799
The business is not good lately.

342
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,039
My mom is working in the beauty parlor.

343
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:34,880
This is...

344
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:37,640
The new tenant.

345
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,799
Have a seat, senior.

346
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,280
I'll make you some tea.

347
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,280
And bring some fruits.

348
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,119
Don't bother.

349
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,479
It's not a bother.

350
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,200
Why are you still eating?

351
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,239
Can't you see there's a guest?

352
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:51,880
Clean up the table

353
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and do the dishes.

354
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,119
Senior.

355
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:56,840
Wait a second.

356
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,239
I'll be right back.

357
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,280
Senior.

358
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,599
I'll be right back.

359
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,320
Did you also learn how to change faces?

360
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,840
You are great at it.

361
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,239
None of your business.

362
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,159
Your tea, senior.

363
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,440
Thank you.

364
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,919
Hello.

365
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,559
I'm Jingjing's senior.

366
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:28,919
Han Ran.

367
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,520
Gu Rong.

368
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,200
Senior.

369
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,159
Never mind him.

370
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:34,960
He has problems.

371
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,080
Well, you do.

372
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,159
I think it's called haphephobia.

373
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,440
And it only doesn't happen with me.

374
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,919
I've never heard of that before.

375
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,239
Right?

376
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,080
When we were kids,

377
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,599
I learned martial arts here.

378
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,280
Jingjing and I grew up together.

379
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,119
That's why

380
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,719
she always calls me senior.

381
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,919
Senior will always be senior.

382
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:01,960
Mr. Gu.

383
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,440
Are you here to learn martial arts too?

384
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,680
No.

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,719
But judging from the way you act,

386
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
you don't really
look like just a tenant.

387
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,520
You are right.

388
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,599
Senior.

389
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,959
Just leave him.

390
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,319
We can talk.

391
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,520
It's alright.

392
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,920
I brought you something.

393
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,479
My new book.

394
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,199
Senior.

395
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,479
I heard that your new book
is very popular.

396
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,400
Your posters are everywhere.

397
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,040
Well, that's overstatement.

398
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,920
However,

399
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,520
I already signed the book.

400
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,079
It's a shame

401
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,880
that you didn't make it
to the signing session.

402
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,560
You didn't?

403
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,239
Mr. Gu.

404
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,479
If you don't know how to communicate,

405
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:54,479
you can just shut up, okay?

406
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,000
(To Jingjing, our youth is in this book.)

407
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,280
Thank you, senior.

408
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,719
I like it so much.

409
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,400
I'll be there next time.

410
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,520
Well, you said that.

411
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,680
You have to come next time.

412
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,119
Jingjing.

413
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,199
I have a plane to catch.

414
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,400
I need to go now.

415
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,359
Already?

416
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,000
I'll visit you

417
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,479
when I come back.

418
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,439
That's a deal.

419
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll see you to the door.

420
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,520
Okay.

421
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,319
Let's go.

422
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,160
Okay.

423
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,359
Mr. Gu.

424
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,239
Goodbye.

425
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,880
I'll be on my way then.

426
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,959
See you next time, senior.

427
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,119
Later.

428
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,319
You like him?

429
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:55,800
None of your business.

430
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,119
Have you ever dated anyone?

431
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,439
Of course.

432
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,280
There are so many people
who had a crush on me.

433
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,959
A lot of people confessed love to me,

434
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,400
but for me,

435
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,319
my senior is the only one in my heart.

436
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,560
That's faithfulness. Do you understand?

437
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,400
As a man with acumen,

438
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,400
I know it from the first sight

439
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,359
that your senior doesn't
share the same feeling.

440
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,239
How can you say that?

441
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,079
When you look at him,

442
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,439
your eyes are brightened up.

443
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,280
But when he looks at you,

444
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,760
there's nothing.

445
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,680
You...

446
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,400
(Ai Mi's Toy Shop)
This is the lowest point of my life.

447
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,599
That Gu Rong is really annoying.

448
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:42,199
So your senior didn't see you that day?

449
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,400
How could I let him see me?

450
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:46,719
I just had a messy fight.

451
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:49,520
So you agreed to meet on that day.

452
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,160
But he didn't see you.

453
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,319
Did he ask why you didn't show up?

454
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,800
He did.

455
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,119
I said something came up
and I couldn't go there.

456
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,760
(Ai Mi's Toy Shop)
It took me so many efforts

457
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
to prepare for it.

458
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,479
I even bought new clothes.

459
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,040
I learned to apply makeup.
But in the end...

460
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,119
In the end,

461
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:11,439
he didn't even see you.

462
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,959
Okay. Stop crying.

463
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,359
Pick a blind box. My treat.

464
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,719
Can I always get the secret figure?

465
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,599
Stop it.

466
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:31,800
Fine.

467
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,280
(Su Jingjing.)

468
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,680
(Bring me my health products.)

469
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,400
(Did you hear me?)

470
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,040
(Su Jingjing.)

471
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,239
(Su Jingjing.)

472
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,719
(A stereo?)

473
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,839
(What a sicko.)

474
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,040
Take out all the medicines I need.

475
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,560
How would I know what you need?

476
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,800
Eat whatever you like.

477
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,520
Careful.

478
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,319
That's medicine.

479
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,719
It's all in the contract.

480
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,719
If anything happens to me...

481
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,119
It's all in there.

482
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:23,640
Loyalty.

483
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,119
Obedience.

484
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:24,839
Professionalism.

485
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,160
Let's see what it says.

486
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,719
Party B must always be on call...

487
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,959
I don't need to feed you, do I?

488
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:33,479
Mr. Gu.

489
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,760
Can't you be gentle?

490
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,959
Fine.

491
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,719
Go.

492
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,640
Get me a glass of water.

493
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,239
Yes.

494
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:39,880
Mr. Gu.

495
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,920
Serve your employer.

496
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,079
Protect your employer.

497
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,359
(Su Jingjing.)

498
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,640
(Come here.)

499
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,319
What now?

500
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,640
The electricity went out
when I plugged the aroma diffuser.

501
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:57,800
Mister.

502
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,160
Why do you use so many appliances?

503
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,560
Don't you know this is an old house?

504
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,719
Limited capacity.

505
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,400
Then what do I do?

506
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,800
I can't sleep without it.

507
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,239
Do all rich people do this?

508
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,400
Yes.

509
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,239
Ma'am!

510
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,319
Stop.

511
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,000
What is this?

512
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,719
It's an aroma diffuser
for normal people.

513
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,280
No electricity needed.

514
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,040
Good for sleeping, bad for mosquitos.

515
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,199
Two birds with one stone.

516
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,920
Use it or not.

517
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,239
I'm out.

518
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,640
What now?

519
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,920
Wrong room again?

520
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,160
I just knew you don't know how it works.

521
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:39,920
Keep your windows and doors open

522
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,839

You know what?

531
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,400
This thing is nice.

(Ai Mi's Toy Shop)

539
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,839
The rich guy

540
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,719
has got my parents on his side.

541
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,719
They would listen to everything he says.

542
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,839
Do you know how afraid I am

543
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,599
of the calling machine?

544
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,439
If I were an electrician,

545
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,160
I would've torn it apart ages ago.

546
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,599
That won't help.

547
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,040
He'll still order you around.

548
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,439
So what should I do?

549
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,040
You need to know what exactly he wants.

550
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,439
A rich guy ran away from home.

551
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,400
He just doesn't have
better things to do.

552
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,400
He doesn't know how much good he owns.

553
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,959
But why did he come to your house

554
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,439
and choose you?

555
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,760
He said,

556
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:20,520
he has haphephobia.

557
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm the only exception.

558
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,719
I think it's all a lie.

559
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,359
Liar.

560
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,239
Crook.

561
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,520
Do you know what your relationship

562
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,439
will lead to in a TV show?

563
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,119
You'll end up a couple.

564
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:44,319
He'll buy pretty clothes for you,

565
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,680
dress you up,

566
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,199
and make you a completely new person.

567
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,880
You'll look into the mirror and say,

568
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,959
god,

569
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,760
who is this girl?

570
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,079
She's so beautiful.

571
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:00,160
Gross.

572
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,479
Seriously.

573
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,439
Can you help me?

574
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,319
I think I can.

575
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:04,959
But it depends on you.

576
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,040
What is it?

577
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,400
You don't leave him at all.

578
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,959
He wants you to protect him?

579
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:09,760
Okay.

580
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,880
Then stay with him 24/7.

581
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,359
Stay with him no matter what he does.

582
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,119
See if he can stand it.

583

Where did you go?

592
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,359
What?

593
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:37,680
You are not going out anyway.

594
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,839
Can't I have some alone time?

595
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:41,880
I'm going out now.

596
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,959
Get in.

597
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:43,959
Where are we going?

598
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,199
Clothes store first.

599
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:48,400
No way.

600
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,160
Really?

601

What are you waiting for?

602
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,760
Get in.

(He's buying me clothes?)

605
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,680
(What will it be?)

606
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,199
(He spends money without a dent.)

607

(Chanel? Or Hermes?)

608

Don't worry, Mr. Gu.

614
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,760
I carefully arranged

notice a thing.

Where do you buy

620

cheap clothes here?

621
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,400
What?

622
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,719
You said I dress too fancy.

623
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,000
So I should buy something less fancy.

624
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,719
You are buying clothes for yourself?

626

Nothing.

(Ai Mi watched too many romantic shows.)

628

(Buying me clothes?)

629
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,800
(How could that ever happen?)

630
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,920

631
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,280
Okay.

632
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,599
Since you asked.

633
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,079
Are you sure about this place?

634
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,680
Seriously?

635
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,319
Yes.

636
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,520
What's this place?

637
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:21,040
Can I even wear them?

638
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,239
Why can't you?

639
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:25,000
I bought mine here.

640

You are here again, Miss Su.

A new batch just came in.

643
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,199
Look around.

644
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,040
Is there anything for him?

645
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,000
What do you think?

646
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,959
He is a good looking young man.

647
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,640
His suit looks great.

648
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,680
Well.

649
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,520
I probably don't have

650
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,599
that kind of suit.

651
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,119
It's alright.

652
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,119
Just show us

653
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,400
the newest men's clothing.

654
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,280
These are the newest.

655
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,920
Pick something you like.

656
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,040
I can't.

657
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,640
They are all ugly.

658
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Mr. Gu.

659
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,719
We are here to buy clothes.

660
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,199
Not to screw her business.

661
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,520
It looks so good.

662
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,239
He's making cheap clothes

663
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:13,280
look expensive.

I really envy you.

667
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,760
Yeah, he is.

668
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,599
Well, no.

669
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
He's not my boyfriend.

670
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,640
He's my boss.

671
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,920
Cut it out.

672
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,040
It must be an honor

673
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,359
to be mistaken as my girlfriend.

674
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,839
Mr. Gu.

675
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,760
You don't have to worry about that.

Bring the bills.

677

I'm done.

Yes.

681
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,359
I don't think it suits me that well.

682
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:55,560
Let her try them on.

683
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,439

00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,920
I can't afford even one piece.

699
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:33,880
Now I'm buying all three of them?

700
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,800
It's a present for you.

701
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,079
Your working clothes.

702
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:36,920
Ah?

703
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,359
What?

704
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,359
Keep the heels on too.

705
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,599
Okay.

706
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,839
I can't work with high heels on.

707
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,079
That's the dress code.

708
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,040
Don't worry.

709
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,359
You don't have to fight today.

710
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:05,280
Mr. Gu.

711
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:06,800
I'll stay on the watch
after I park the car.

712
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,760
Enjoy the exhibition.

713
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,680
Okay.

714
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:14,119
You want to take my arm?

715
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,239
No, I don't.

716
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:20,079
I'm just not used to high heels.

717
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,520
Just take my arm.

718
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,479
I don't want to go through
the embarrassment

719
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,760
when you fall.

720
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:33,680
(Sculpture Exhibition)

721
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,880
Sir.

722
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,680
Are you interested in this item?

723
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,280
This is the work of a young artist.

724
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,680
The reviews are good.

725
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,760
Many people are interested
in purchasing this piece.

726
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,199
Is it really that good?

727
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,000
You've been watching it for 40 minutes.

728
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,640
You don't understand.

729
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,839
I don't understand?

730
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,520
My major was animation design.

731
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,439
I'm not ignorant to art.

732
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,040
These things you like

733
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:05,359
are essentially not that different

734
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,959
from my blind box figures.

735
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,520
And they are not even as cute.

736
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:10,920
The sculpture shouldn't
be compared with your figures.

737
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,160
This is art.

738
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,680
Whatever in an exhibition is art.

739
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,800
And whatever in a blind box is a toy?

740
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,599
Your art also has a price.

741
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,160
In your logic,

742
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,239
it's just a more expensive toy.

743
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,280
That's not right.

744
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:28,800
A figure is also finished

745
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,479
after countless efforts and failures

746
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:33,000
in a grinding process

747
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:35,239
by its creator.

748
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Besides,

749
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,400
I know my share of sculptures.

750
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,199
This piece you like so much

751
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,040
is inspired by The Kiss,

752
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,680
a work of the Romanian sculptor,

753
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,560
Constantin Brancusi.

754
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,239
Circular and line engraving.

755
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,160
It used a center line

756
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,520
to divide the stone into two parts,

757
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,920
which are the two people.

758
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,599
But The Kiss

759
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,079
is two people holding
each other tightly.

760
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,959
Their arms stretch out horizontally

761
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:59,040
which break the vertical center line,

762
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,079
and make it look like

763
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,119
they are tied together by a rope.

764
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,719
They are facing each other,

765
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,880
which forms an eye in the front.

766
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:10,239
And there is a point in the center line

767
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,800
which forms the only
connection of their faces

768
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,280
and makes it look like they are kissing.

769
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,479
But this piece here.

770
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,280
The sculptor is doing
the opposite thing.

771
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,560
I feel like this sculptor

772
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,599
has never had physical contact

773
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,119
with people.

774
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,359
I don't think it's a good piece.

775
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,719
What is it?

776
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,160
Am I wrong?

777
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,800
Don't go.

778
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,959
The conversation is not over yet.

779
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,439
300 thousand, gone.

780
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:02,880
Ma'am.

781
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,040
There are only two solutions

782
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,000
to exhibits damaging.

783
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:07,479
You either pay the full price

784
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,199
or we go on court.

785
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,760
Which do you prefer?

786
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,880
I'm so sorry.

787
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,599
I'll pay for it.

788
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,400
But can you give me a few more days?

789
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,119
Ma'am.

790
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,439
We're not doing charity.

791
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,079
If you can't pay for it,

792
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,640
we'll send our lawyer to talk to you.

793
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:24,760
I...

794
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,199
Wait.

795
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,839
I'll pay for it.

796
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,520
Jingjing.

797
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,520
Where did you go in that pretty dress?

798
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,880
So pretty.

799
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,439
I just made the plum juice.

800
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,560
Do you want some?

801
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,479
Mr. Gu.

802
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,319
Ms. Chen's plum juice is quite good.

803
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,239
Have a try.

804
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,319
My treat.

805
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:57,800
I want two.

806
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,479
Okay.

807
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,079
Mr. Gu.

808
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:04,760
Have a seat.

809
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,600
Here.

810
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,199
Try it out.

811
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Thank you.

812
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,120
He's a handsome guy.

813
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,080
Mr. Gu.

814
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,360
Thank you.

815
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,280
Thank you for helping me there.

816
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,560
I'll pay you back.

817
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,239
But can you keep it a secret

818
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,639
from my parents?

819
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,919
They are getting old.

820
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,639
I'm afraid it's too much of a shock.

821
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,080
I can keep the secret.

822
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:45,520
But the money...

823
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:46,840
Please don't refuse.

824
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,199
I'll think of some way to pay you back.

825
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,959
This is a matter of principle.

826
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,479
I wasn't going to refuse.

827
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,320
I wanted to say,

828
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
you pay me back in my way.

829
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,000
What way?

830
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,360
Don't overthink.

831
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,679
I'm not interested in you.

832
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:08,439
I just want you to be my bodyguard

833
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,639
until you pay off your debt.

834
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,919
How long will that take?

835
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:16,040
With your salary and bonus...

836
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,239
Maybe five years.

837
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,679
Five years?

838
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,639
So I have to see you every day

839
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,040
for the next five years?

840
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,560
Or you can just give me 300 thousand.

841
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:29,840
I just started to think
you are not that bad.

842
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,520
But I was wrong.

843
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,959
You can refuse.

844
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,399
Then I'll refuse to keep your secret.

845
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,840
If your mom knows

846
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
how much money you owe,

847
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,760
how will she react?

848
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:43,320
Are you trying to kill your parents?

849
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,760
What did I ever do to you?

850
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,600
Fine.

851
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Five years then.

852
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,199
You can start.

853
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,600
Start what?

854
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,040
I'm recording.

855
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,600
What if you go back on your words

856
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,600
when there's no proof?

857
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,439
You crook.

858
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,520
Watch your language.

859
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,040
Now I'm your boss

860
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,479
and your creditor.

861
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,800
You can start.

862
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,439
My name is

863
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,840
Su Jingjing.

864
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,520
I broke a sculptor on an exhibition.

865
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,040
Gu Rong paid 300 thousand yuan for me.

866
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,360
(I hereby promise)

867
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,000
(to be his bodyguard
for free for five years.)

868
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,120
(I will serve him,)

869
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:39,800
(obey him,)

870
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,560
(and protect him.)

(Su's Martial Club)
Jingjing.

872
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,639
You should go get
a facial at the parlor.

873
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,800
I'm a natural beauty.

874
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,159
I don't need a facial.

875
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:51,479
(WeChat message)
Let me tell you.

876
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,000
Girls don't have to

877
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,520
look perfect.

878
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,800
(Send you a copy for backup)
But your elegance

879
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,560
is always important.

880
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,080
Take me as an example.

881
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,320
That's elegance.

882
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,919
Mom.

883
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,000
If I bring a friend
to the beauty parlor,

884
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,159
do we get a percentage of the money?

885
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,320
Of course.

886
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,719
The more expensive

887
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:15,560
the service is,

888
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,000
the more money we get.

889
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,239
What's the most expensive service?
