29
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,239
This is so good.

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,239
You have a recipe?

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,760
It tastes great.

32
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,800
Can you tell me the recipe?

33
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,039
Miss Su.

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,759
You want the recipe

35
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,080
so you can make it for him?

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,600
No. I want it

37
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,240
so my dad can make it for me.

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,440
Okay.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,080
Have mine. I didn't touch it.

40
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,679
I'll pass.

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,759
I lost my appetite.

You don't want it? Give it to me.

Don't waste food.

44
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,360

Okay.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,639

(Fried Rice Recipe)

50
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,279
Xie Te, thank you so much.

51
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,800
After I learn it,

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,880
you and Ai Mi can come

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,759
for seafood fried rice.

54
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:31,600
Okay.

55
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,639
Mr. Gu.

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Did you have a good talk with Miss Qin?

57
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,119
I did.

58
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,679
Mr. Gu, objectively speaking,

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,399
I don't think she suits you.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,080
Why?

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,119
Xiaoxiao is a pretty girl.

62
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
She's very nice, and very capable.

63
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:58,080
You said no to me.

64
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,800
But she wouldn't.

65
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
I should take this opportunity

66
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,240
and get closer to her.

67
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,199
Come on.

68
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:10,600
Forgot your haphephobia?

69
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
As long as you have it,

70
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,119
you won't be able to
get close to anyone.

71
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,519
You are the only exception.

72
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,519
But you said no to me, didn't you?

73
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,920
Mr. Gu, I don't think it worked.

74
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,279
You don't say.

75
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,559
What should I do now?

76
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,600
Mr. Gu, you already tried everything

77
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:06,920
I can think of.

78
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,040
Well, try harder then.

79
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:12,040
Don't even think about
seeing your girlfriend

80
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,920
before you help me through this.

81
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,200
Mr. Gu.

82
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,079
This is just between

83
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,600
the two of you.

84
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,320
What's it got to do with me?

85
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Are you really sure about her though?

86
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,679
Of course.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,160
Or why would I go through
so much trouble?

88
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,040
Well then.

89
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,079
I guess you have to
be harder on yourself.

90
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,279
How about making her worry about you?

91

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,200
(Is this too much?)

93
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,040
(It might leave a scar.)

94
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,839
(Maybe something else.)

95
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:28,920
(No rain in this whole month?)

96
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,760
(Artificial rainfall?
Sounds like too much fuss.)

97
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:47,799
This is so cold.

98
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,440
Why did you barge in
when I'm having a shower?

99
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,440
Why didn't you close the door
when you're having a shower?

100
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:06,839
I closed the door.

101
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,239
I just didn't lock it.

102
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,320
Don't you know the lock is broken?

103
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:15,559
You're having a shower?

104
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,320
Why is here no steam at all?

105
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,839
You took a shower with cold water?

106
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,799
What's that got to do with you?

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,239
You want to come in with me?

108
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,160
I'm not interested in you.

109
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,799
And I'm interested in you?

110
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,040
Look at yourself.

111
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,559
You should be glad I'm not picky.

112
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,559
Who are you to be picky?

113
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,720
Please.

114
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,720
Be picky.

115
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,519
Anrou, Xiaoxiao. They're great.

116
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,320
Pick them.

117
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,799
Yeah. They are great.

118
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,799
What? Are you jealous?

119
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,880
I'm jealous?

120
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,239
How dare you even comment on my body?

121
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,760
Do you see yourself?

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Did your pecs get smaller?

123
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,959
See for yourself.

124
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,760
Having it too good in my house?

125
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,359
How do you know my pecs got smaller?

126
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,839
You've peeped at me before?

127
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,399
If you want to see it so much,

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,399
just admit that you like me.

129
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,040
Then you can see it whenever you want.

130
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,640
No need to sneak around.

131
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,959
I like you?

132
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,519
That body?

133
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,959
With zero abs?

134
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:19,279
I wouldn't want to see it
even if you beg me to.

135
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,079
I like you? No way!

136
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,119
Is it that hard to just admit it?

137
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,520
I don't have abs?

138
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,400
What do you know? Woman.

139
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,400
Don't play with fire.

140
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,320
(Peeping on me. Laughing at my body.)

141
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,400
(Are abs really that important?)

142
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,559
(Being hard on myself? Easy.)

143
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,400
(Time to bring out the big guns.)

144
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,599
Mr. Gu.

145
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,679
I want to get sick.

146
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,159
You are pretty sick now, Mr. Gu.

147
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,080
My point is,

148
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:11,039
I thought I walked into
a morgue or something.

149
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,679
I know love is precious,

150
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,000
but don't freeze yourself to death.

151
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,440
Do you want the newspaper

152
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,960
to write about your passing

153
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,239
saying that Gu Rong from the Gu Group

154
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,159
froze himself to death at a young age

155
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:28,000
just to draw a girl's attention?

156
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,880
You would want that, right?

157
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,719
So you can get out of this sooner.

158
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:38,440
No. I'm your most loyal assistant.

159
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,799
Go get the thermometer.

160
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,679
No way.

161
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,039
I'm too sturdy to get sick.

162
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,799
Why do I even bother?

163
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,159
Anyway,

164
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,760
your sole purpose is to make her worry.

165
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,840
It's good

166
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,359
as long as she believes it.

167
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,280
What's your idea?

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,599
Wait here, Mr. Gu.

169
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,200
I'll go get something right now.

170
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,880
This is all for your love.

171
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,719
What is this?

172
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:07,919
On my forehead?

173
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,880
Do you feel the heat?

174
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,000
You want me to fake it?

175
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,599
Yes. It's enough to convince her

176
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,039
as long as you don't get caught.

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,960
Just wait and see how worried she'll be

178
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,479
after she finds out you are sick.

179
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,400
Only then she'll understand

180
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,919
her own feelings.

181
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,919
By then, you'll be everything

182
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,479
she can think about.

183
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,599
45 degrees? I'd be long dead.

184
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,200
Just tear it off later.

185
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:15,679
Maybe I can leave earlier today?

186
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,559
Leave?

187
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,080
You gave me the idea.

188
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,840
You have to play it through.

189
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,320
What?

190
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,719
What?

191
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,280
I can't play solo.

192
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,280
No way.

193
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,000
Now, make yourself look like

194
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:29,479
you are worried to death.

195
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,840
Go downstairs and tell her

196
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,000
that I'm sick,

197
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,119
and that it's very serious.

198
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,919
Yes. A bit more sadness.

199
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,520
That's it. Go.

200
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,599
Mr. Gu!

201
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,599
Jingjing, do you have febrifuge here?

202
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,320
You have a fever?

203
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,280
Not me. It's Mr. Gu.

204
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,280
Gu Rong has a fever?

205
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah. It's pretty serious.

206
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,440
Go see him.

207
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,159
I thought he was so robust,
having a cold shower in the winter.

208
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
What does it read?

209
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,559
38.5 degrees.

210
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,400
I told you it's serious.

211
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,520
Having a cold shower in this weather?

212
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,719
Of course you'll get a fever.

213
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,440
Who do you think you are? Ironman?

214
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,320
Why are you still yelling
at me when I'm sick?

215
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,960
Get up. I'll send you to the hospital.

216
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,719
No. I feel so bad. I don't want to move.

217
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,400
I feel so bad.

218
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,960
That's right.

219
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,919
Whenever he got a fever,

220
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,440
he'd just take the medicine

221
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:13,359
and rest at home.

222
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:17,960
Yes. Do you have febrifuge here?

223
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,400
We rarely have a cold here.

224
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,599
Let alone a fever.

225
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:22,760
We don't have medicines.

226
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,679
Well...

227
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:26,400
Get some febrifuge for me, Xie Te.

228
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:27,440
Okay.

229
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,400
I'll go.

230
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:34,760
Why do you care about me
so much all of a sudden?

231
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,159
Care about you?

232
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:37,880
Did the fever make you stupid?

233
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,239
Then why do you want to go?

234
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,559
I'm more familiar

235
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,119
with the pharmacies around here.

236
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,280
And I get paid by you.

237
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:48,159
That's the least I can do.

238
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
What now?

239
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,880
I... I'm hungry.

240
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,760
Su Jingjing.

241
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,440
Make seafood fried rice for me.

242
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,719
But the recipe is meant for my dad.

243
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:06,119
I didn't learn it. I don't know how.

244
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:08,799
He's not home.

245
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,799
Just learn it now.

246
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,719
I'm so hungry.

247
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,000
That's right.

248
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,400
Look how sick he is.

249
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,640
You won't reject him, right?

250
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,919
Fine. Just rest here.

251
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
I'll do it.

252
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,544
(Recipe for seafood fried rice)

253
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,239
Bring this to him.

254
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,079
Okay.

255
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,199
You're not bringing it yourself?

256
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,280
I need to clean this up

257
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,800
and go to the pharmacy with you later.

258
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:38,680
You bring it.

259
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,520
Okay. Wait for me then.

260
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,680
I'll drive you there.

261
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,040
Mr. Gu.

262
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,319
She made it by herself?

263
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,280
I saw it with my own eyes.

264
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,599
Come on.

265
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,800
It's not good?

266
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:40,319
Never mind.
Her intention matters the most.

267
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:42,520
Yeah.

268
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,439
Perhaps...

269
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,239
Well...

270
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,359
Don't force yourself.

271
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You'll do it?

272
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,359
Maybe not.

273
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,680
Hello.

274
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,520
Can you give me something for fever?

275
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,439
I want it down as soon as possible.

276
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,119
Okay.

277
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,839
This will take it down quicker.

278
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,680
This one has less side effect.

279
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,040
I'll take both.

280
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,359
And a box of fever pads.

281
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:36,040
Okay.

282
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,400
There's a bag in the compartment.

283
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:01,616
(Supermarket bill: heating pads)

284
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,359
Mr. Gu is sick.

285
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:17,520
I bought some heating pads

286
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,359
to keep him warm.

287
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,760
And stick it on his forehead

288
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,599
to keep it warm?

289
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,920
Xie Te, I know you are
Ai Mi's boyfriend.

290
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,520
But if you dare lie to me with Gu Rong,

291
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,000
I won't go easy on you

292
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,760
with my fists.

293
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,439
I...

294
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,040
(What are you doing?)

295
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,719
(I'm recording.)

296

(What if you go back on your words)

297

00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,439
(You crook.)

299
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,520
(Watch your language.)

300
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,079
You got the medicine?

301
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,040
Yeah.

302
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:54,800
You think this is funny?

303
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:56,239
What?

304
00:21:59,199 --> 00:21:59,800
Have it.

305
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,160
You still won't stop?

306
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,280
Eat it.

307
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,599
Mr. Gu.

308
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,199
You really ate it?

309
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,959
I'm really sick.

310
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,800
You'll die doing that.

311
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,760
Don't you know?

312
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:50,520
What are you doing?

313
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,359
Spit it out.

315
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,079
I'm not lying.

316
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:55,839

00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,119

331

You two...

333
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
Tell me what's wrong.

334

Selling herself...

00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:52,680
Stop there!

345
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,280
Mister.

346
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,079
Explain!

347
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,880
What's that about?

348
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,800
Sweet Su!

349
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:58,479
Stop!

350
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,040
Mister.

351
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:00,800
Don't run!

352
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,520
I can explain.

353
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,520
Don't bother.

354
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,119
I heard it all.

355
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:04,920
Let's just talk.

356
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,439
You said selling herself
to pay off the debt.

357
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,920
She's selling herself! Christ!

358
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,520
Where's my sword?

359
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,239
What are you doing?

360
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:13,239
I'll kill you!

361
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:13,880
Calm down.

362
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,599
Dad!

363
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,640
Listen to me.

364
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,079
I owe him 300000.

365
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,319
I'll work for him for five years.

366
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,359
I'm not selling anything.

367
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,800
Don't try to fool me.
I heard everything.

368
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,640
And you... you two even kissed!

369
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,880
That was an accident.

370
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:30,760
No, it wasn't. Gu.

371
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,160
Gu Rong.

372
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,599
You already have Miss Bai.

373
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,319
Why did you kiss Jingjing?

374
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,719
Don't you have enough already?

375
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,119
You are so bad!

376
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,239
And to think that I helped you!

377
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,119
I was so blind!

378
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,959
Su Zhengkui. What did you say?

379
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:49,000
You helped him?

380
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:50,160
How?

381
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,719
Dad!

382
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
You helped him?

383
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:52,520
No.

384
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,040
No.

385
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,800
I'm not with Bai Anrou.

386
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,880
It's true that I like Jingjing.

387
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,520
You can ask Xie Te. Tell them!

388
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,000
Tell us.

389
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,199
I... I swear to god...

390
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,839
Mr. Gu and Miss Bai

391
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,400
are in no way emotionally involved.

392
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,280
It's totally a one-side thing
from Miss Bai.

393
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,400
Yeah.

394
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,800
And the 300000?

395
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,319
Yeah.

396
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:18,920
How come Jingjing

397
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,280
owes you 300000?

398
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,280
Shut up.

399
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:24,400
Xie Te.

400
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:25,640
Tell us.

401
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:26,760
Tell us.

402
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,119
Tell us.

403
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:29,640
Speak.

404
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:34,079
Mr. Gu brought Jingjing

405
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,520
to a sculpture exhibition.

406
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,199
And she broke his...

407
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,880
Just tell them

408
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,959
where the debt

409
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,199
came from.

410
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,079
Don't say anything else.

411
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,079
Wait.

412
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:48,599
Don't say anything else?

413
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,439
Is there anything I don't know about?

414
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,760
Xie Te. You'd better tell the truth.

415
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,880
Otherwise... Go on!

416
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,599
Kill him!

417
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:03,400
Well.

418
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:05,439
And you broke the sculpture

419
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,400
made by Mr. Gu.

420
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,560
Made by him?

421
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,640
You mean the one I broke

422
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:14,839
was made by him?

423
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,719
So the 300000

424
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,719
has always been his?

425
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,400
Not for anyone else?

426
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:23,079
Why did you do that?

427
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,719
In theory, yes.

428
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,520
Don't come to work tomorrow.

429
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,599
Mr. Gu.

430
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,439
They forced me to tell.

431
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,520
Shut up.

432
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:33,000
Dad.

433
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,000
Weren't you gonna give him a lesson?

434
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,359
Do it.

435
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,640
I'll kill you! You bad guy!

436
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,000
Calm down!

437
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,520
We live in a civilized society.

438
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,199
Let's just talk. Okay?

439
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,959
Cool it.

440
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,680
Society saved your life!

441
00:26:59,199 --> 00:26:59,880
I can take it.

442
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,400
Just take it.

443
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,239
I really can't.

444
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:13,392
(Su's Martial Club)

445
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,040
Su Jingjing.

446
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,400
You made me so mad.

447
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:45,959
Do you realize what you did?

448
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,640
You rarely make trouble,

449
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,400
but only make big trouble.

450
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,040
Don't you know

451
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,199
our financial situation?

452
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:53,760
Did I raise a daughter

453
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,359
or a trouble?

454
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:58,119
It was an accident.

455
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,160
Besides,

456
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:03,000
I broke it during work hours.

457
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,319
Gu Rong must be somehow responsible.

458
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,800
Spare me your reasoning.

459
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,439
You have a good appetite.

460
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,680
How can you?

461
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,000
We're going broke here.

462
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,319
And you made so much for dinner?

463
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,880
Like father, like daughter.

464
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,800
You both know how to waste money.

465
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,479
Xia, you said this yourself.

466
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,479
Gu Rong is paying for a room and food,

467
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,280
and also Jingjing's salary.

468
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:39,719
We can't kick him out.

469
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,520
Right?

470
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:43,199
We have to keep him fed
with standard meals.

471
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,160
Now food is here. Where is he?

472
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,599
Why didn't he come down?

473
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,199
How dare he come down?

474
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,560
If he comes down, I'll...

475
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,479
How dare you

476
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,920
still enjoy your dinner?

477
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,359
Bring it up to him.

478
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:00,920
Why me?

479
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,119
Why not?

480
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,280
You owe him 300000.

481
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,599
Remember?

482
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,239
Fine.

483
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,560
You don't seem worried at all.

484
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,880
Dear. The trouble only gets worse

485
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,400
if you are afraid of it.

486
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,239
Don't get yourself worked up.

487
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,479
How's that gonna help?

488
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,719
Right?

489
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,800
Can you send me to the hospital?

490
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,280
Stop it.

491
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:48,239
I knew you are faking.

492
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm not. I'm really sick.

493
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,079
Did you use the heating pad again?

494
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,239
You want me to take your temperature?

495
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,199
I didn't do it this time.

496
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:00,479
I'm really...

497
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,319
Gu Rong.

498
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,599
Do I look really funny

499
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,439
when I'm worried about the debt

500
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,040
or about you?

501
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:09,160
Please.

502
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:10,800
Don't take advantage of
other people's kindness.

503
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,760
Okay?

504
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,880
Why can't you believe me?

505
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,599
Alright. Keep faking it.

506
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,479
I brought the dinner. Suit yourself.

It's me, Xie Te.

Who is it in the middle of night?

513
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,959
Now of all times?

514
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,479
Mister.

515
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,520
I'm so sorry.

516
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,239
Sorry to bother you.

Ai Mi. Xie Te.

00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,160
What is it?

519
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
Why are you here?

520
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,000
Mr. Gu is sick.

521
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,239
I'm here to take him to the hospital.

522
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,560
He's doing this again
in the middle of the night?

523
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,959
It should be real this time.

524
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,400
We should go check him.

525
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,880
Fine. Let's go.

526
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:14,800
Just go.

527
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:15,839
Go.

528
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:19,199
I don't understand

529
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:21,959
these young people.

530
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,160
Why didn't he

531
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,199
just tell us?

532
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,239
Alright. Let them be.

533
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,119
Made them come all the way.

534
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,079
(Su's Martial Club)
Let's just go back to bed.

535
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,224
(Su's Martial Club)

536
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,760
Are you okay, Mr. Gu?

537
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,920
You should do it, Jingjing.

538
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,199
You are not faking it again, are you?

539
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,160
Su Jingjing.

540
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,839
Can't you see his face?

541
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,319
That's right.

542
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:50,800
He...

543
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:51,880
Just go.

544
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,280
Come on.

545
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,599
It's so hot.

546
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,079
I told you.

547
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,199
I'm really sick.

548
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,359
Come on. Bring him to the hospital.

549
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,040
I'll get the car.

550
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,719
You...

551
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,560
Come on.

552
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,599
Now you believe me, don't you?

553
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,040
Is he okay?

554
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,680
Yes.

555
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,680
I'll go pay the fees.

556
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,119
Come sit down.

557
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,000
You must be tired getting him here.

558
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:06,959
I'm fine.

559
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,880
Don't blame yourself.

560
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:16,040
I thought he was faking it.

561
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,719
It wouldn't have been so serious

562
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:20,359
if I found out sooner.

563
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:23,479
Xie Te said

564
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,920
that Mr. Gu really cares about you.

565
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:27,599
Think about it.

566
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,959
He's a guy born with a silver spoon.

567
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,680
Now he's trying to surprise you.

568
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,199
And he's trying everything

569
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,760
to get sick,

570
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:36,280
just so you'll care for him more.

571
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:39,560
Jingjing. He did so much.

572
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,800
You are really not moved at all?

573
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,439
Stop it. Ai Mi. I don't know.

574
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,119
Let me think about it.

575
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,439
The doctor said he's good
to go home tomorrow.

576
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,679
This is his medicine for a week.

577
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,560
He has to take it on time.

578
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,479
And he can't drink alcohol.

579
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,320
Thank god you two came.

580
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,639
I can't imagine how bad
it'd be if you didn't.

581
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,679
He's a grown man.

582
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,560
Why did he do such a childish thing?

583
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,199
That's right. Why did he do

584
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:39,520
something so stupid?

585
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,399
I guess that's what
love makes people do.

586
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:43,439
Yeah.

587
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,320
Can you forgive him

588
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,520
for lying to you?

589
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,840
It's really understandable.

590
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,919
Fine. I never said I won't forgive him.

591
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,600
You two should go back
and have some rest.

592
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,040
He's resting.

593
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,360
We shouldn't talk here.

594
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:08,719
Take care then.

595
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,639
We're off.

596
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,879
Take care of him.

597
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,719
Okay.

598
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,320
You don't know.

599
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,320
Mr. Gu has an unfortunate childhood.

600
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,639
It's true he's
the successor of Gu Group.

601
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,800
But you don't know
he lost his parents at five.

602
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,439
The Chairman has his
focus on the company.

603
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,280
So he was basically an orphan.

604
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,639
What happened to his parents?

605
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,399
They were the victims
of an airplane crash.

606
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:05,560
That's unfortunate.

607
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,199
But well,

608
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,399
now you are with him.

609
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,959
You can care for him.

610
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:13,159
I feel much more reassured.
