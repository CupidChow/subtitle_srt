You can pretend for now.

But you can't pretend forever.

30

I don't think

31
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,599
you understand what love is.

32
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,279
Fine. You've tried it.

33
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:55,199
You know so much about it.

34
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,279
Nowadays a rich guy like you...

35
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,559
I haven't tried it.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,199
Then why are you lecturing me?

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,599
This is the fridge theory.
Don't you know?

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
What does that mean?

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,639
I haven't tried it.

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,080
But I've seen it.

You never had a girlfriend?

42
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:24,520
I can't believe it.

43
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:31,360
I almost forgot the important thing.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,240
I've seen that blog post too.

48
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:05,600
These bloggers are

49
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:06,880
a bunch of liars.

50
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:09,320
In the comment section,
many said they went there.

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,360
And it's all a lie.

52
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:15,119
You can't see the aurora at all.

53
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,839
Really? But I think

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,000
it's not really about seeing the aurora.

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,399
The most beautiful thing

56
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,559
is to wait for the aurora.

57
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,880
Well.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,679
You writers are the most romantic.

00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,360
It's done, Mr. Han.

the most beautiful thing.)

63

Of course your legs will be numb

64
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:50,799
from making all these stuff.

I was just helping you get up.

77
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,000
Can't you be more careful

78
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,720
when you were helping me?

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,519
Can't you be more careful?

80
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,880
Anyway,

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,239
can't you just replace them

82
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,000
with smaller ones to make up for it?

83
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:50,640
What do you know?

84
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,519
These 99 candles

85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,720
carry my best wishes.

these cheap candles

88
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,640
can grant your wishes?

89
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,040
I...

90
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,359
This is what I think is romantic.

91
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,440
Do you understand?

92
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,519
I put my heart into it.

93
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,079
Is it really something

94
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,359
to be disdainful of?

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,640
I didn't mean that.

96
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,119
So what did you mean?

97
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,760
I just don't understand.

98
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,880
The photos just now.

99
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,679
And now the candles.

100
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,239
You just have to make troubles for me?

101
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,959
Gu Rong.

102
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,000
What good can you get

103
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,559
if my confession fails?

104
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,519
Of course I can.

105
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,000
Then you can put
your whole heart into work

106
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,000
and be a good bodyguard.

107
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:47,920
You...

108
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,239
I'm done talking to you.

109
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,239
Mr. Gu.

110
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,040
Please stay within this circle.

111
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,399
Have your drinks, and enjoy the view.

112
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,040
And we go about our own businesses.

113
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,000
For your safety,

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
please do not step out of this circle.

115
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
What are you doing? I'm not Monk Tang.

116
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,880
But you are more difficult to deal with.

117
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,239
If you get tired,

118
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:44,559
you can stand, sit, or lie there.

119
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,559
Whatever you want.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,559
Are you sure I can't get out?

121
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,720
Yes.

122
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,320
I can use a helping hand with this tent.

123
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,000
Is there anyone around

124
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,279
to help me out?

125
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,080
No one's around. There's only me.

126
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,200
I want to take a rest.

127
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,080
Can you help me
when you are done resting?

128
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,119
You said I can't get out of this circle.

129
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,320
But you didn't listen

130
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,679
when I told you to leave my home.

131
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,799
I didn't know someone like you

132
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,400
would know how to build a tent.

133
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,640
What's wrong? Can't I?

134
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,679
Nothing.

135
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,679
But why are you bringing

136
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,119
a tent here?

137
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,440
You're staying here?

138
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,599
What do you know?

139
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,719
I can sit in the tent with my senior.

140
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,799
And we can enjoy the beautiful view.
Isn't that romantic?

141
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,840
They all do that in the TV shows.

142
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,760
If it's a tent for you two,

143
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,239
then you can build it yourself.

144
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:31,159
What's the matter with him?

145
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,000
It's five.

146
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,320
Senior should be off work by now.

147
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,799
Why didn't he call me?

148
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,960
I brought all things but the power bank.

149
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Why are you failing me now?

150
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
What is it?

151
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,400
Can I borrow you phone, Mr. Gu?

152
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,760
I'll give it back in a second.

153
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,359
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

154
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,799
What's that?

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,799
Wasps! Run!

156
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,080
Into the tent! Go!

157
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,559
Your phone...

158
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,000
Hurry up!

159
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,919
I don't know if they've left or not.

160
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,719
What's wrong with your foot?

161
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,880
Why is it swollen?

162
00:11:58,479 --> 00:11:59,400
It's fine.

163
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,080
I sprained my ankle just now.

164
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,640
Why didn't you tell me?

165
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:05,880
You can't move after that happens.

166
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't you know?

167
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,280
What should I do then?

168
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Watching the wasps attack you?

169
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,320
It's my fault.

170
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,280
I'll find something for compress.

171
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,280
No need. It's so cold now.

172
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,039
Let's go back now.

173
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,159
But you can't move with a sprain.

174
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,039
I used to get injury every day.

175
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,520
I know how to treat this.

176
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,080
You are right.

177
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,559
But if we don't go now,

178
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,320
we won't make it to the last ship.

179
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:35,119
It's not even six.

180
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,880
The last ship is at eight, isn't it?

181
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,159
It's at eighteen o'clock.

182
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,679
What?

183
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,320
What?

184
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,919
Eighteen.

185
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,232
(Last ship: 18:00)

186
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,559
Eighteen o'clock.

187
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,119
We are still on the island!

188
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,880
Well, well.

189
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,640
Now we are really staying here.

190
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,919
I hope your new book

191
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,559
will make a good sell.

192
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,280
Thank you.

193
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,440
Okay, goodbye.

194
00:13:28,304 --> 00:13:29,680
(Jingjing)

195
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,239
(Sorry! The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.)

196
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,239
What's going on?

197
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,840
Why did you light them up?

198
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,520
For lighting.

199
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,359
Are you afraid of darkness?

200
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:51,239
What?

201
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,159
Can't I light the candles if I'm not?

202
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,640
You spent so much time on this.

203
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,880
It'd be a waste
if we don't light them up.

204
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,359
Give the compress to me.

205
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,239
Thank you.

206
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,039
This is the first time
you say that to me.

207
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,799
Are you hungry?

208
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,400
I only have this.

209
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:49,880
Eat it.

210
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,799
If I knew this would happen,

211
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,320
I should have brought food

212
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,359
instead of those fancy stuff.

213
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,119
Give me one of those.

214
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,000
Sparkler?

215
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:28,200
You've never played this before?

216
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,479
My grandpa wouldn't let me.

217
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,119
Why?

218
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,280
Fireworks

219
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,960
are against his life philosophy.

220
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,039
He always tells me
to make something grand

221
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,479
and everlasting.

222
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,239
Not the kind of beauty that's short-lived

223
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:51,080
and turns into ashes soon after.

224
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,080
He doesn't even allow fireworks

225
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,000
at celebrations of the company.

226
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,559
I thought you can do whatever you want

227
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:02,280
when you were born rich.

228
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:06,159
But it turned out you can't.

229
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,559
Sometimes ordinary people
can live happier.

230
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,520
That's just one

231
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,719
of the many things.

232
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,919
Here.

233
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,080
You're right.

234
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,760
It's going to be a waste anyway.

Hello. Can you check

if Miss Su in 8202 is back?

258
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,560
Please wait a moment.

259
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,800
Sorry, sir.

260
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,199
Miss Su is not back yet.

261
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,719
Thank you.

262
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,040
You're welcome.

263
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,560
Mr. Gu.

264
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,359
Mr. Gu.

265
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,920
Can you ask a few local people

266
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,400
to help me look for them?

267
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,920
Please?

268
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,560
Okay. I'll try.

269
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,479
Well.

270
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,680
You didn't build this thing in vain.

271
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,160
It's just a little jammed.

272
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:54,000
Well. It does the job.

273
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,239
What a day.

274
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,839
I told you it wouldn't work.

275
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,199
You jinxed it.

276
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,319
You are so silly.

277
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,640
You don't even know how he's feeling,

278
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:09,920
and you want to go straight to confess?

279
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,400
You need to tell them if you like them.

280
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,920
Otherwise you'll regret one day.

281
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,839
But at least you need
to know if he's interested.

282
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,760
We are not kids anymore.

283
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:25,719
We've grown up.

284
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,000
It's not possible to be
together without a worry

285
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,760
like when we were kids.

286
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,520
I'm afraid that I can't stay
by his side anymore

287
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,959
if I don't confess.

288
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,119
You really like him so much?

289
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,280
We grew up together.

290
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,280
I trust him the most.

291
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,479
You like him because you trust him?

292
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,800
Are you looking for
a boyfriend or a bodyguard?

293
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,119
What about you?
Is there anyone you trust?

294
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:09,719
Xie Te? Or Miss Bai?

295
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,280
Bai Anrou?

296
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,359
I trust her at work.

297
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,439
But I don't think she sees you

298
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,800
merely as a colleague.

299
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,599
You like her?

300
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,079
Why?

301
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,239
A beautiful, charming,

302
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,800
and smart woman like her

303
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,680
should have a lot of admirers.

304
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,400
If I were like her,

305
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,239
my mom would be so happy.

306
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,280
She's all right.

307
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,319
But I don't feel anything for her.

308
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,640
Who do you feel something for then?

309
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,479
You never had a crush

310
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,880
on someone, right?

311
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:01,280
Well. It makes sense.

312
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:03,520
A narcissist like you
only likes yourself.

313
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,239
Keep your nose in your own business.

314
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,000
I think Han Ran's no good.

315
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,920
You'll only end up
making fuss about him.

316
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,000
Don't say that.

317
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,719
What if he says yes

318
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,479
after I confess to him?

319
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,839
You can come to our wedding.

320
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,040
Don't forget

321
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:22,640
to bring a nice gift.

322
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,239
Thanks in advance.

323
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,800
Aren't you tired?
You didn't sleep at all last night.

324
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:46,000
I have trouble sleeping.

325
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:48,839
Now there's no aroma diffuser or music.

326
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,599
Why would you need those?

327
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,680
There are so many flowers outside.

328
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,400
The air smells nice enough.
And the natural sounds.

329
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:59,560
You listened to these
in your device, right?

330
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,160
Now they are all real.

331
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,920
Lie down and close your eyes.

332
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:09,800
Lie down.

333
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,599
You'll fall asleep in no time.

334
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,719
Okay?

335
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,079
(You never had a crush)

336
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,079
(on someone, right?)

337
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,199
(I have a crush on her?)

338
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,359
You said you have trouble sleeping.

339
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,959
It seems you had a pretty good sleep.

340
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,640
I don't know why.

341
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,119
Eleven already? The signing session!

342
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,800
The hotel staff said

343
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,040
Miss Su's still not back yet.

344
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:26,800
My friends here

345
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,640
didn't find anything either.

346
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:30,839
Talk to the organizer.

347
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:34,079
Let's call it a day

348
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:34,920
when I'm done here.

349
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:35,800
Okay.

350
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,160
This way.

351
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,719
Thank you.

352
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,640
Thank you, Mr. Han.

353
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,599
Hello.

354
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,920
That's it for today.

355
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:46,560
Let's go then.

356
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll text him now.

357
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,119
Senior! Senior!

358
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:55,359
Jingjing! Where were you?

359
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,680
I spent the whole day

360
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,680
on the lake island with Mr. Gu.

361
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,719
You stayed overnight?

362
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,800
Did anything happen?

363
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,199
No. Nothing.

364
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:17,880
Mr. Gu. Can you please explain

365
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,160
what happened?

366
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,920
I have nothing to explain.

367
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,959
I can't reach her
every time she's with you.

368
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,520
And this time, she even
spent the night outside?

369
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,119
No. It's my fault.

370
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,239
I planned for us to go to the island.

371
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,160
And I thought
the last ship leaves at 8 PM,

372
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:35,160
but it's actually 18.

373
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:37,199
I stirred up the wasps,

374
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,760
and almost got ourselves attacked.

375
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,560
Mr. Gu protected me all the time.

376
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
My phone died,

377
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,760
and I dropped his phone into the lake.

378
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:47,640
Jingjing.

379
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,920
Will you ever stop

380
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,560
being so careless?

381
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,520
Why did you bring a suitcase

382
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,040
to the lake island?

383
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,199
She...

384
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,199
I...

385
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,520
I remembered the time wrong.

386
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,560
I thought

387
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,439
that when you were done,

388
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,280
we could have a picnic
there or something.

389
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,920
Okay, let's go.

390
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,239
Come on.

391
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:19,160
What happened to your foot, Mr. Gu?

392
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,319
I almost got attacked by the wasps,

393
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:26,880
so he sprained his ankle
while protecting me.

394
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,560
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

395
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,199
Mr. Gu.

396
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,680
Now your phone's gone.

397
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,680
Is my video gone too?

398
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,040
I have a backup.

399
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,280
And you need to buy me a new phone.

400
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:55,400
(Su's Martial Club)

401
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,239
Mr. Gu.

402
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,239
Are you sure

403
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,160
you don't need to go to the hospital?

404
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,119
It's nothing.

405
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:02,000
No need for the hospital.

406
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,280
There's no need.

407
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
I knew what it is

408
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,119
right away.

409
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,280
This is...

410
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,239
It is the medicine for sprain

411
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,719
produced based on our secret formula.

412
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:22,640
You'll be back on your feet
in three days.

413
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,680
It works even better

414
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,479
with my secret massage technique.

415
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,040
What a shame.

416
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,239
You can't experience it.

417
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,000
Thank you, mister.

418
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,000
Come on. Rub it now.

419
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,520
How does it work?

420
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,119
Rub it on your ankle.

421
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:47,800
Harder. How is it?

422
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,640
It feels better now.

423
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,479
I told my wife long ago

424
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,319
that we should get a patent for this.

425
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,000
I wanted to talk about this
long ago, Mr. Gu.

426
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,040
Sweet Su.

427
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,640
Did you notice

428
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,040
that Jingjing is weird today?

429
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,800
She didn't even have dinner.

430
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,400
She probably wants to lose weight.

431
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,040
No. She's unhappy.

432
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,560
Can't you see?

433
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,760
Gu.

434
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,400
Did anything happen

435
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:17,920
during the trip?

436
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,439
No.

437
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,040
You're overthinking.

438
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,400
- Just go.
- It's strange.

439
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,680
She's down all day.

440
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,760
Look.

441
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:30,040
She even threw away her favorite toys.

442
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,680
These kids make their parents

443
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,640
worried sick.

444
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,680
When will it be over?

445
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,760
Go buy some clay, Xie Te.

446
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,400
Okay.

447
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,359
Mr. Gu.

448
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,319
Can you check this for me?

449
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,839
Is there something wrong with it?

450
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,920
Why doesn't it look like yours?

451
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:32,680
Mr. Gu. Mr. Gu?

452
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:37,040
Isn't this yourself?

453
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,400
It looks good.

454
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,079
Well.

455
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,160
I don't understand this.

456
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,319
Why do you and Su Jingjing

457
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,800
both like making this?

458
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,920
Clay figure is one of the oldest forms

459
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:55,719
in the art of sculpture.

460
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,640
In human history,

461
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,560
humans are made with clay and water

462
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,920
no matter by God
or by the goddess Nu Wa.

463
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,040
This is the oldest recognition

464
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:07,760
of humans with themselves.

465
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,079
You can't get it.

466
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,239
So?

467
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,479
So what?

468
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,560
Human emotions are included

469
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,959
in clay figures.

470
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,000
It's the hope for love and beauty.

471
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,640
Look.

472
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:26,040
There's a term for loving couples.

473
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,000
You in me and me in you.

474
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,359
You in me and me in you?

475
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,160
Never mind. I can't understand anyway.

476
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,719
I won't waste these materials.

477
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,160
I'm off. Mr. Gu.

478
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,079
I should give you a name.

479
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,680
Ugly Xie Te.

480
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,439
Okay. Goodbye.

481
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,800
Bye. I'll give you a discount next time.

482
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,640
Okay.

483
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,680
Ai Mi.

484
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,800
It's you.

485
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,560
Can I see your shop?

486
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,479
Of course. Welcome.

487
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,680
So many toys. How is the business?

488
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:51,160
It's fine. They are all old customers.

489
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,359
I don't see much new faces.

490
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,920
That umbrella...

491
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,400
- You can keep it.
- You remember...

492
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,800
Any advice for my shop?

493
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,680
Well...

494
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,920
I don't know much about toys.

495
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,680
But I have an idea for you.

496
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:20,599
Go ahead.

497
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,640
I think you can add a new attraction.

498
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,920
You can provide the place and materials

499
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,319
for clay figure moulding.

500
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,920
Clay figure?

501
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,400
Yes. In a fancy way,

502
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,239
clay figure is the oldest form

503
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,599
of the art of sculpture.

504
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,640
In all the legends,

505
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,599
humans are made with clay and water

506
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,119
no matter by God
or by the goddess Nu Wa.

507
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,520
This is the oldest recognition
of humans with themselves.

508
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,479
I see you do a lot of thinking.

509
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,160
I just think

510
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,400
couples might want to try it.

511
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:56,640
Isn't there a term,
you in me and me in you?

512
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,920
What does that mean?

513
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,680
Nothing.

514
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:10,359
I just had a little thought

515
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,880
after my first moulding.

516
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,079
You made this?

517
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes. I tried to make
a small version of myself.

518
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:23,040
As my first try, it's a little ugly.

519
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,599
It is.

520
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,119
But it's special.

521
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,319
It's ugly in a cute way.

522
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:34,079
That's in trend, isn't it?

523
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,760
Do you like it?

524
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,319
You can have it.

525
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,560
Thank you.

526
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:57,400
I'll be on my way then.

527
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:00,280
The bag.

528
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,280
Bye.

529
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,520
Bye.

530
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,600
Love?

531
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,399
You in me and me in you?

532
00:34:20,912 --> 00:34:23,760
(What does it mean when a guy
gives a girl his own clay figure?)

533
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:27,120
You in me and me in you.

534
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,159
We are made with the same clay.

535
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:38,360
You live in me and I live in you.

536
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,800
God. Was he confessing love to me?

537
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,360
That's way too soon.

538
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Is this love at first sight?

539
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,679
Stop it.

540
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:18,280
This is its head.

541
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,879
It should be done now.

542
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:32,560
Okay.
