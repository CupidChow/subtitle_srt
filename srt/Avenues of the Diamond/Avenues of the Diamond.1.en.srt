1
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,725
My mom gave her to me,

2
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,894
that’s why I always
bring her around.

3
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,645
She’s a model.

4
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,273
She’s so pretty, right?

5
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,986
You’re so pretty, too!
Are you a model?

6
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:31,448
I’m not. But someday,
I will be one.

7
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,127
Sam is seriously a big deal now!

8
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,547
There’s no one bigger than her
in the industry.

9
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,104
And I heard how famous designers

10
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,608
are dying to have her
wear their creations.

11
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:26,180
Every brand wants her.

12
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:29,950
Whatever product she touches,
it sells out.

13
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:39,676
What can we say?

14
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:43,186
Samantha Vera is the epitome
of grace and beauty.

15
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:48,584
Samantha!

16
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,109
- Miss Samantha Vera!
- Samantha!

17
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,110
- Excuse me!
- Samantha!

18
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:52,620
Ms. Samantha Vera!

19
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,970
- We’re also from the Philippines!
- Hi Kababayan!

20
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,325
Miss Vera, I’m a big fan,
but I have to ask...

21
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,120
is it true that you
already have a child?

22
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:04,415
Interesting question.

23
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,458
Thank you.

24
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,459
Excuse me, Samantha.
From here...

25
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,460
Excuse me!

26
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:13,510
I have to ask, is it true
that you have a child?

27
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:18,315
She definitely has a kid.
Poor child, being kept a secret.

28
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:19,358
I wonder who the father is.

29
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:20,943
Why do we even care
if she has a child?

30
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:21,736
Maybe she’s a mistress;

31
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:22,819
that’s why she’s
not saying anything.

32
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,530
People are so judgmental.

33
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:29,808
It’s none of our business
whether she has a child or not.

34
00:02:33,164 --> 00:02:36,448
People just love commenting
on other people’s business.

35
00:02:46,094 --> 00:02:47,094
Ma’am,

36
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:48,846
have you seen the video?

37
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:51,849
Do you want me to tell
the agency to take it down?

38
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:53,935
It’s okay.

39
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,146
It's all over
social media already.

40
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:59,065
There’s no use taking it down.

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,150
People can be so harsh.

42
00:03:01,484 --> 00:03:03,152
You looked stunning that night…

43
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:05,779
And yet, all they talked about

44
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,220
was whether
you already have a child.

45
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,369
But, what if we
release a statement?

46
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:13,663
So they’ll finally shut up.

47
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:16,002
You’ve already been dragged
into so many issues.

48
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:18,166
No, it's okay, Francine.

49
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,253
Don’t waste your time
on baseless rumors.

50
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:24,132
By the way, please clear
my schedule for tomorrow.

51
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:26,925
I want to spend
some time with Avi.

52
00:03:26,926 --> 00:03:27,927
Okay, ma’am.

53
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:30,929
Just be careful with the media

54
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,330
and all the
gossipmongers out there.

55
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:33,557
Yes.

56
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,399
I want to go to the mall now.

57
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,985
Dr. Lana still needs
to check you up, baby.

58
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:47,654
But I promise after this,
we’re going to the mall

59
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:50,490
and I’ll buy you
your favorite ice cream!

60
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:51,868
Pinky promise?

61
00:03:52,535 --> 00:03:54,162
Pinky promise!

62
00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:57,290
Hi!

63
00:03:58,207 --> 00:04:00,710
Sam, I’m so sorry
for having you wait.

64
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:03,421
It’s okay, Doc.
We actually arrived too early.

65
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:06,214
Hi, Avi!

66
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:07,759
Come here, come here!

67
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,845
Take a seat.

68
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:12,805
So,

69
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:13,931
how are you?

70
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:16,976
I'm okay. I drank the syrup,

71
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,395
but it tasted yucky.

72
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,938
Very good! Okay then,

73
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,608
let me check your throat.

74
00:04:25,568 --> 00:04:26,277
Okay, say “ah.”

75
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:27,277
Ah!

76
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:29,238
Okay.

77
00:04:30,907 --> 00:04:33,241
Her throat isn't
swollen anymore,

78
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:35,578
but is Avi still coughing?

79
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:38,206
Not really, Doc.

80
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:40,958
Just a little.

81
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:42,292
Okay.

82
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:44,504
Doc, they’re looking
for you in the ward.

83
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,677
Sorry, I didn’t know
you had a patient.

84
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,888
No, wait,

85
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,473
I’ll introduce you to her.

86
00:04:56,182 --> 00:04:58,266
This is Samantha Vera,

87
00:04:58,267 --> 00:04:59,435
the model.

88
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:10,947
Do you recognize her?

89
00:05:16,244 --> 00:05:18,830
Of course, he recognizes me.

90
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,166
Unless he really
forgot about me.

91
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:30,674
And this is Dr. Clyden Ramirez.

92
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:33,136
He’s a pediatric resident.

93
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:39,785
And this cute little girl
over here is Avrielle.

94
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,479
Av… Avrielle?

95
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:47,900
We know each other already, Doc.

96
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:53,656
Hi, Maui.

97
00:05:57,785 --> 00:05:58,786
Hi, Cy.

98
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,752
How do you guys know each other?

99
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:08,588
Common friends?

100
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:14,610
She was...

101
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:15,887
my fiancée.

102
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,718
Vera, rotten! Vera, corrupt!

103
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,470
Kick him out! Kick him out!

104
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:42,347
Vera, rotten!

105
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:43,807
Vera, corrupt!

106
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:45,017
Vera, rotten!

107
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:48,812
- Senator, are you really involved...
- Get away from us!

108
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:50,355
Kick him out! Kick him out!
Vera, rotten!

109
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:51,773
Vera, corrupt!

110
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:53,525
Kick him out! Kick him out!

111
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:55,111
Vera, corrupt!

112
00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:57,279
Sam, just don’t mind them.

113
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,030
Kick him out! Kick him out!

114
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,657
Vera, corrupt!

115
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:02,701
Kick him out! Kick him out!

116
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:05,746
Vera, corrupt!

117
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:07,664
Kick him out! Kick him out!

118
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:09,374
Vera, rotten!

119
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,084
Vera corrupt!

120
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:12,752
Where’s the car?

121
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:15,463
Vera, rotten! Vera, corrupt!
Kick him out! Kick him out!

122
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:16,841
Vera, corrupt!

123
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:18,967
Kick him out! Kick him out!

124
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:19,968
Vera, rotten!

125
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:20,970
Vera, corrupt!

126
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:23,054
Kick him out! Kick him out!

127
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:24,473
Vera, rotten!

128
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:27,517
They're just using your dad
for political reasons.

129
00:08:27,518 --> 00:08:28,601
Look at them!

130
00:08:28,602 --> 00:08:29,603
Vera, you’re rotten!

131
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,152
Justice for the
victims of drugs!

132
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:37,945
Let’s go!

133
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:39,864
Are you a leader
or a drug dealer?

134
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:42,032
Vera, rotten!

135
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:43,867
Kick him out! Kick him out!

136
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:45,327
Vera, rotten!

137
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:46,911
Vera, corrupt!

138
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:48,747
Kick him out! Kick him out!

139
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:50,081
Vera, rotten!

140
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:51,667
Vera, corrupt!

141
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:04,763
Thank you.

142
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:13,814
Hi, Naomi!

143
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:18,277
School starts next week, right?

144
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,695
Yes, Mom.

145
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:22,782
So, you're in your
second year in college,

146
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,991
how does it feel?

147
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:26,077
I feel excited, Dad.

148
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:28,199
Excited to start my classes.

149
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:29,789
That’s good.

150
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:31,790
But you do know
it’s not too late

151
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,043
to shift to Political Science
if you want?

152
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:36,253
Following your
father’s footsteps.

153
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:40,383
I’m happy with my course, Dad.

154
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:42,967
Make sure you maintain
your dean’s list.

155
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:44,845
You’re just taking
Communication, anyway.

156
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:46,847
Yes, Dad. I will.

157
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:49,474
By the way,

158
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:52,018
I’m going back
to my condo unit tonight.

159
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,379
Why don’t you
spend the night here?

160
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:55,814
There’s still the weekend
before school starts.

161
00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:56,815
It’s okay, Dad.

162
00:09:57,191 --> 00:10:00,069
I still need to buy
some school stuff anyway.

163
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:02,029
If you say so.

164
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,198
Soon, you won’t be
needing that condo.

165
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:11,080
Dad, about the rally earlier…

166
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:13,081
Why are they accusing you of...

167
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:14,916
My gosh, Maui!

168
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,501
Let’s not talk about that,

169
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:18,320
we’re at the dinner table.

170
00:10:18,587 --> 00:10:20,588
I already told you,

171
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,674
that’s just propaganda
from your dad’s rivals.

172
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:24,093
They’re just jealous!

173
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:29,598
You shouldn’t concern
yourself with those things.

174
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:31,808
What you should
focus on right now

175
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:33,477
is your upcoming engagement.

176
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,314
Engagement?

177
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:41,776
Do you remember when I told you

178
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:44,155
that you’ll be marrying
the son of my best friend?

179
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:47,074
The owner of Ramirez Medical?

180
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:49,618
Well, his name is Clyden.

181
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,871
He’ll be graduating soon.

182
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,081
BS Biology. Cum Laude.

183
00:10:54,582 --> 00:10:55,583
Maui,

184
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:57,710
this is the real deal.

185
00:10:58,502 --> 00:11:00,212
I think it’s about time
that you meet.

186
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:03,006
We’ll be attending his
graduation party next week

187
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:04,467
and I want you to join us.

188
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:08,137
Think of it as
your engagement day.

189
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:10,764
I thought they'd
already forgotten that.

190
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:12,850
They were actually serious.

191
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:17,645
You have to look
your prettiest, Maui.

192
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:20,399
No. No. No. I don’t want to
get married to that guy.

193
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:24,195
Please don’t take
my freedom away.

194
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:27,656
Maui?

195
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:29,825
Yes, Mom?

196
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:31,869
You okay?

197
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:33,537
Yes.

198
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:31,678
Hi, Sam!

199
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,804
Hi!

200
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:34,347
- Sam!
- Hey!

201
00:12:34,348 --> 00:12:36,182
Nice seeing you again!

202
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:37,768
How’s your summer vacation?

203
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:39,895
My vacay was fun. You?

204
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:41,564
How are you guys?

205
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,571
I’ll be there, of course!

206
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:50,906
Especially at the party!

207
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:54,702
Glad to know that!
A party without Sam is boring!

208
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,090
- Hi!
- Hi!

209
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,051
Hello!

210
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:14,095
How are you guys?

211
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,014
- Good!
- Good!

212
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:17,307
Wow! There’s really no one
like The Samantha Vera.

213
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:18,683
The school year just started

214
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:22,520
and you already have
so much going on!

215
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:25,232
It’s because everyone wants
Sam in their organization.

216
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,984
Plus, she throws
the best parties.

217
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:29,611
Life’s just better
when you’re happy.

218
00:13:29,612 --> 00:13:31,238
Of course. Girls,

219
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:34,240
have you decided
which track to focus on?

220
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:37,372
I’m thinking of
doing advertising.

221
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,203
I’ll do journalism

222
00:13:39,204 --> 00:13:42,291
so I can put my inner
gossip girl to good use.

223
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:47,420
I think I’ll take media
studies and film.

224
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:48,631
How about you Sam?

225
00:13:51,425 --> 00:13:52,426
I’m still not sure.

226
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,552
Well, no rush since we have

227
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:56,596
the whole school
year to think about it.

228
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:57,597
Yes.

229
00:14:00,392 --> 00:14:02,977
Let’s go to Pop-up
this Friday after class!

230
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:06,648
I’m messaging early because
I know some of you are busy

231
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,609
—aka Sam.

232
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:16,199
I’ll be there loves, see you!

233
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,825
Girls, let’s go to our class?

234
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,266
- We might be late.
- Okay, let’s go!

235
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:46,938
Sam?

236
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:49,900
I’m Tristan!

237
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:52,861
We met at
a house party last year.

238
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:55,072
Yes, Tristan.

239
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:56,824
I remember you.

240
00:14:57,449 --> 00:14:58,866
Nice seeing you here.

241
00:14:58,867 --> 00:14:59,867
Are you on your own?

242
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:02,662
Yes.

243
00:15:02,955 --> 00:15:04,832
Can I buy you anything?

244
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,502
Thank you but
I’m waiting for my friends.

245
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:09,920
It’s too bad.

246
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:12,755
But at least you’re here
with your friends

247
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:14,633
and not a boyfriend?

248
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,347
Yes, I’m single.

249
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:23,141
Well, since you’re single,

250
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:25,185
do you mind if
I get your phone number?

251
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,981
Of course.

252
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:37,573
See you around.

253
00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:48,125
Soon, I won’t be able to do
these things anymore.

254
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:49,709
I hate this.

255
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,213
Clyden? Who the hell
is that guy?

256
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:55,799
What does he even look like?

257
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,727
This dude is so private as fuck.

258
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:08,812
That’s suspicious.

259
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:16,653
Is this him?

260
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:23,118
This can’t be him, right?

261
00:16:23,535 --> 00:16:24,828
Right?

262
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:35,839
Hey! Samantha Vera!

263
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:39,009
I didn’t know those
were your type.

264
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,429
That’s an invasion
of privacy, Sev.

265
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:45,057
Who’s that?
Why are you stalking him?

266
00:16:45,516 --> 00:16:48,560
Just some random dude.

267
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,063
Some random dude? Jeez!

268
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:53,524
He’s your boy toy, isn’t he?

269
00:16:58,695 --> 00:16:59,988
I’m getting engaged.

270
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:02,032
Huh? What the hell?

271
00:17:02,658 --> 00:17:03,866
We haven’t even
started drinking,

272
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,577
and you’re already drunk.

273
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:09,831
I’m getting engaged, Sev.

274
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:11,458
To a random stranger.

275
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:14,419
And I’m scared.

276
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:16,213
I’m really scared.

277
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:18,632
Shit!

278
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,177
Are you serious?

279
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:23,720
Are you okay?

280
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:25,848
Did they force you?

281
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:29,101
I had to agree
in exchange for my freedom.

282
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,687
The only reason my parents
allowed me to live in a condo

283
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:35,399
and choose my own course
is because.

284
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:37,734
I agreed to this engagement.

285
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:46,702
What if

286
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:48,662
he’s ugly?

287
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,415
Shit, that would suck!

288
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,959
Sev, I’m not even thinking
about his looks.

289
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,546
I’m just scared that
he might not be a good person.

290
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:00,506
What if you get married

291
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:02,133
and he looks ugly?

292
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:04,802
And his breath stinks?
And he has a bad attitude?

293
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:05,928
He might be smart and rich,

294
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:07,431
but what if he looks disgusting?

295
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:10,934
Now, I’m starting to think
about those things.

296
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:14,187
Sev, those weren’t even
part of my concerns earlier.

297
00:18:14,897 --> 00:18:15,897
Okay.

298
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:17,316
How about this?

299
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:19,985
Meet him first.

300
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:22,195
See if he’s your type.

301
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:24,071
If not,

302
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:26,324
tell your family
I’m your boyfriend.

303
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:29,119
If they try to
make you marry him,

304
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:31,079
just say you’ll elope with me.

305
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:34,457
Come on, use me!

306
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,208
You guys always do it anyway.

307
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:37,502
I’ll take care of it!

308
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:42,465
That’s an impossible plan,

309
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:44,216
but thank you, Sev.

310
00:18:44,217 --> 00:18:45,677
It made me laugh.

311
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:50,599
But seriously, Sam…

312
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,018
If you need someone to talk to,

313
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:54,645
I’m here, okay?

314
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:56,355
Don’t be shy.

315
00:18:59,274 --> 00:19:00,483
And if

316
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:02,860
those guys are really your type…

317
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:04,905
- Gym bros like me…
- Shit.

318
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:07,156
Just let me know,
I know a lot of guys.

319
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:08,617
Sevi! Stop it!

320
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:11,161
Stop! You’re so annoying.

321
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:17,291
Welcome to college life, kids!

322
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,752
Finally, you’ll start maturing!

323
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:20,504
Just like me.

324
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:22,129
You’re so full
of yourself, Yanna!

325
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,006
You're only a year
older than them,

326
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:25,800
and you act like
you're so mature.

327
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:27,885
Hey! Well, of course,
I’m studious, you know?

328
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:29,553
As if! I saw you
playing billiards.

329
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:30,554
Ohhh.

330
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:32,264
Well, congratulations!
You have eyes.

331
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:34,392
Guys, come on. Wait…

332
00:19:34,393 --> 00:19:37,561
This is Sevirous.
He’s a scholar.

333
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:38,938
Show them. Show them.

334
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:40,731
Yes, man. Let’s go!

335
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,775
And he kept being pursued

336
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:45,903
to join the basketball team,
now that’s Sevi!

337
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:47,029
What now, guys?

338
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,281
I’m going to face off
with your basketball teams.

339
00:19:49,282 --> 00:19:50,866
You all can just cry about it!

340
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:53,035
- Really, now?
- You all can just cry about it.

341
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:54,370
Sevi, that’s great.

342
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:55,914
You know what?
I’ll cheer for you.

343
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,667
Are you serious, Sam?

344
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:01,585
Now I feel guilty
about trash talking.

345
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,796
And my trash talk
was on point, too.

346
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:06,591
Oh. How about you three?
How’s architecture?

347
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:08,385
Easy.

348
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:12,764
And we’ll take it easy
until graduation.

349
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:14,432
Hey! Come on, guys.

350
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:16,100
We might jinx ourselves
and next thing you know,

351
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:18,352
we’ll be crying over our plates.

352
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:20,604
No one’s going to cry
in this family, okay?

353
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:23,942
That’s just architecture.
You’re Via, Kierra, and Luna.

354
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,027
You guys are amazing!

355
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:27,611
Look at Sevi.
He’s in engineering,

356
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:29,488
but all he thinks
about is basketball.

357
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:30,823
Ah, basketball.

358
00:20:30,824 --> 00:20:34,744
Whatever! You scholars of the
people should just keep quiet!

359
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:35,704
Am I wrong?

360
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:36,538
OMG!

361
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,331
You guys know how hard it
was to get into his university.

362
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:41,250
It was so easy for me. I mean…

363
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:42,085
Right?

364
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:43,085
So arrogant.

365
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,089
He’s blushing again.

366
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,842
- Let’s toast!
- Let’s just toast, guys!

367
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:51,302
Let’s toast!

368
00:20:51,303 --> 00:20:53,805
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

369
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:19,622
Tomorrow is Clyden’s
graduation party.

370
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:21,500
Don’t forget.

371
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:46,775
Sam, let’s go?

372
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:55,324
Hi, Naomi!

373
00:21:55,325 --> 00:21:56,618
How’s your studies?

374
00:21:57,202 --> 00:21:58,537
Why do you even care?

375
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:02,540
Naomi, she’s asking
you politely.

376
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,208
Don’t be rude!

377
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:05,961
Answer properly!

378
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:07,628
Mom, it’s okay.

379
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:08,922
No, it’s not okay!

380
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:12,676
If we tolerate her rudeness,
she’ll keep doing it.

381
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:16,512
Naomi,

382
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:18,597
are you going to
apologize to your sister,

383
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:20,308
or do I have to
ground you again?

384
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:22,519
Mom, I said it’s okay.

385
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:24,354
S-Sorry.

386
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:27,983
No, Naomi, it’s okay.

387
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:30,484
Come on, get dressed.
We're going to a party.

388
00:22:30,485 --> 00:22:31,736
Oh no…

389
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:33,405
She's not coming. It’s just us.

390
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:36,616
Why? Mom,
we can’t leave her here.

391
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:38,145
Yes, we can!

392
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:39,703
What?

393
00:22:40,162 --> 00:22:42,706
You want to show off your dad’s
bastard child to everyone?

394
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:44,207
- Mom!
- Let’s go!

395
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:08,231
Senator Vera is here.

396
00:23:08,523 --> 00:23:09,482
Chris!

397
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:11,734
- Sam, smile.
- Senator Vera!

398
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:13,527
Stephen Vera, wow!
Glad you can make it!

399
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:14,528
You’re going to get
married to a Ramirez.

400
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:15,613
And with your lovely wife too.

401
00:23:15,614 --> 00:23:16,448
- Hi!
- Hi!

402
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:17,240
Hi there!

403
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,200
Hello!

404
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:19,534
How are you?

405
00:23:19,826 --> 00:23:20,910
We’re good.

406
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:22,411
You know, I wouldn’t
miss this for anything.

407
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:24,163
Congratulations to your son.

408
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:25,957
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

409
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:28,585
You know, he’s the
only one that I could trust.

410
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:31,629
Oh, by the way,
is this Samantha?

411
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,880
- Yes.
- Is this really her?

412
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:33,924
Yes!

413
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,593
This is Dr. Christopher Ramirez,

414
00:23:37,594 --> 00:23:38,970
the owner of Ramirez Medical.

415
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:40,162
Remember, Maui?

416
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:42,924
And of course, Chris,
this is my daughter,

417
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:44,975
Samantha Maureen Vera.

418
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:46,977
Wow, what a
beautiful young lady.

419
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:48,270
Thank you, sir. Hello, sir.

420
00:23:48,271 --> 00:23:49,939
Hello, how are you doing?
Pleased to meet you.

421
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,815
I’ve heard a lot of
good things about you.

422
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:52,858
Thank you.

423
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:55,653
Wait, I’ll introduce you
to my son. Okay?

424
00:23:55,654 --> 00:23:56,655
Wait.

425
00:23:57,072 --> 00:23:58,073
Clyden?

426
00:23:58,657 --> 00:23:59,658
Clyden?

427
00:24:13,004 --> 00:24:17,092
Oh, shit. He’s exactly my type.

428
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:30,272
Get over here.

429
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:38,487
Clyden, you’ve met
the great Senator Vera.

430
00:24:38,488 --> 00:24:39,530
- Senator.
- Hello.

431
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:42,090
- And his lovely wife.
- Hi! Hi, Clyden.

432
00:24:42,462 --> 00:24:45,131
And his lovely daughter,
Samantha.

433
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:46,913
Nice to meet you.

434
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,793
Nice to meet you as well.

435
00:24:55,797 --> 00:24:57,048
Get to know each other.

436
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:58,466
Mingle.

437
00:24:58,758 --> 00:24:59,800
Okay?

438
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:02,387
Come on, let’s leave them
so they can talk.

439
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,460
Okay.

440
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:12,801
What the fuck?

441
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:16,459
Why is he looking at me
like that? Is he judging me?

442
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:18,194
Samantha, right?

443
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,281
Yes.

444
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:22,906
How shall I call you?

445
00:25:22,907 --> 00:25:24,283
I don’t know.

446
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:25,617
Babe?

447
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:27,787
Since we're
getting married, right?

448
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:33,534
Physical appearance?
Exactly my type.

449
00:25:34,002 --> 00:25:35,471
Attitude?

450
00:25:35,496 --> 00:25:36,789
Hell no.

451
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:45,843
What the hell
is that guy’s deal?

452
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:47,828
Why is he so fucking rude?

453
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:51,088
Is he acting that way because
he’s just as frustrated as I am?

454
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:54,287
For sure he also
got forced into this.

455
00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:57,364
If that’s the case,
then I can’t blame him.

456
00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:09,662
Sam!

457
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:12,415
Can we talk?

458
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:15,990
Is he going to apologize?

459
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:19,714
Yes, sure.

460
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:23,259
You’re the child
of a corrupt politician.

461
00:26:23,718 --> 00:26:26,888
I’ve attended numerous
protests against your dad.

462
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,598
He’s the worst.

463
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,394
He has no business
being in public service.

464
00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:34,311
We're just not
going to get along.

465
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:35,312
Well,

466
00:26:35,814 --> 00:26:37,328
I don’t like you either.

467
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,652
You’re an asshole
who is so full of himself.

468
00:26:40,985 --> 00:26:42,486
Just because
you graduated cum laude

469
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:44,989
doesn’t mean you can
look down on everyone else.

470
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,991
How can you say that about me?

471
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:48,826
Do you even know me?

472
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:50,870
Well, you’re judging me
based on my parents.

473
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:52,830
You don’t know me either.

474
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:54,791
I don’t need to know you.

475
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:56,207
I know people like you.

476
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,378
My god!

477
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:01,297
You really are something, huh?

478
00:27:02,632 --> 00:27:04,169
We can’t marry each other.

479
00:27:04,384 --> 00:27:05,384
I agree.

480
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:07,421
Why did you even accept this?

481
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:11,958
I made a deal, okay?

482
00:27:12,183 --> 00:27:14,060
My college program, condo unit,

483
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:15,731
car, and a lot more.

484
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,148
Why are you blaming me?
You accepted this, too.

485
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:19,914
I can’t disappoint my dad.

486
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:22,402
I’m the best son
among the three.

487
00:27:23,945 --> 00:27:25,195
Lame.

488
00:27:25,196 --> 00:27:26,197
Wow,

489
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:30,093
coming from someone who
asked for superficial things?

490
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:32,194
Superficial things?

491
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:34,649
That’s the only freedom
I’m holding on to.

492
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,608
You don’t know my struggles.

493
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:40,092
And you know mine?

494
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:43,180
I’m never judgemental of people,

495
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:45,082
but I’m treating him this way.

496
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,761
Maybe I’m just projecting
my frustrations onto him.

497
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:55,727
- Hey, I’m sorry—
- You know what?

498
00:27:56,269 --> 00:27:58,395
Let’s just act like
we’re on good terms

499
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,857
and that we’re falling in love
in front of our parents.

500
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:02,816
We have to fool them

501
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:06,279
that we have a deep connection
until someone makes a mistake

502
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,049
and then we end the engagement.

503
00:28:08,656 --> 00:28:09,908
Let’s say…

504
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:12,464
You cheated on me.

505
00:28:12,872 --> 00:28:13,832
Me?

506
00:28:13,865 --> 00:28:14,824
Why me?

507
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:16,087
I could never cheat.

508
00:28:16,456 --> 00:28:17,623
And it can’t be me.

509
00:28:17,624 --> 00:28:18,708
It’s your idea.

510
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,501
Whatever.

511
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:21,753
Let’s just think about it
when the time comes.

512
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:23,192
Right now,

513
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:24,972
the more we resist,

514
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:27,252
the more they’ll push
the engagement.

515
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:30,703
So, we have to act like
we really like each other.

516
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,974
Okay?

517
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:37,519
Fine.

518
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,854
Let’s go back inside.

519
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:41,665
What?

520
00:28:42,202 --> 00:28:43,287
What are you doing?

521
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:44,312
Yuck.

522
00:28:44,484 --> 00:28:46,611
Of course,
you need to hold my hand.

523
00:28:52,158 --> 00:28:53,493
Are you nervous?

524
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:55,011
Why is your hand wet?

525
00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:56,036
Yuck.

526
00:28:57,832 --> 00:29:00,883
Seems like things are
going well between you two.

527
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:03,962
All that's missing is a ring.

528
00:29:04,837 --> 00:29:06,798
You don’t have to
worry about that, Stephen.

529
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
Cy,

530
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:12,774
go to your room because I have
something for you and Sam.

531
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:14,097
Sure, Dad.

532
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:15,639
Let’s go.

533
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:17,724
Go!

534
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,299
They’re engagement rings.

535
00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:51,509
So corny.

536
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:52,969
Why are there two rings?

537
00:29:53,973 --> 00:29:55,307
You’re wearing one, too?

538
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:56,375
Apparently.

539
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:01,704
So, the whole world
knows I’m engaged.

540
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,513
Let’s just wear it
and remove it after.

541
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:05,538
Give me.

542
00:30:06,901 --> 00:30:07,901
Let me.

543
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:18,118
What?

544
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,193
Give me your hand.

545
00:30:46,564 --> 00:30:47,774
Don’t get all giddy.

546
00:30:50,652 --> 00:30:51,694
Feeling...

547
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,447
Now put mine on.

548
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,699
Can’t you wear it yourself?

549
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:58,534
Come on.

550
00:30:59,744 --> 00:31:00,744
Fine.

551
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:14,300
There. We’re done.

552
00:31:14,884 --> 00:31:17,052
We’ll just have to wear it
in front of our parents.

553
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:18,053
Otherwise,

554
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:19,680
I’ll remove this.

555
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:20,681
Why?

556
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:22,213
Do you have a crush on someone?

557
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:23,726
Or are you seeing someone?

558
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,519
A lot,

559
00:31:25,728 --> 00:31:27,313
and it’s none of your business.

560
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:30,066
And don’t worry,

561
00:31:30,608 --> 00:31:32,068
I also won’t mind your business.

562
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:34,361
Let’s just mind
our own business.

563
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:35,362
As we should.

564
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,246
Well? Is he ugly?

565
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:45,248
No.

566
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:47,458
Does his breath stink?

567
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:51,837
No, and he’s not disgusting.

568
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:52,839
So, he’s nice?

569
00:31:53,506 --> 00:31:55,924
He is a total asshole.

570
00:31:55,925 --> 00:31:57,300
Well, damn,

571
00:31:57,301 --> 00:31:59,345
he looks exactly
like an ass hole.

572
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:05,100
Good thing is,

573
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:07,103
he also doesn’t want
to get married to me.

574
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:09,939
At least we’re on
the same page, right?

575
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:12,733
We decided to just pretend
in front of our parents

576
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:14,485
until we can end the engagement.

577
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:17,779
And Sev, good thing
I won’t be seeing him

578
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,781
anytime soon.

579
00:32:19,323 --> 00:32:22,410
I really can’t stand that guy,
he’s so freaking rude!

580
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:24,327
You know,

581
00:32:24,328 --> 00:32:26,830
I can totally feel how bad
his attitude is

582
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:28,666
for you to rant like that.

583
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:32,335
Just let me know if
that asshole does something,

584
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:33,795
- I’ll take care of him!
- Thanks, Sev.

585
00:32:33,796 --> 00:32:35,006
You’re the best!

586
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:37,884
Okay, bye.
I’ll talk to you soon!

587
00:32:51,189 --> 00:32:53,107
You’re the child
of a corrupt politician.

588
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:56,360
I’ve attended numerous
protests against your dad.

589
00:32:57,195 --> 00:32:58,404
He’s the worst.

590
00:34:30,162 --> 00:34:31,247
Naomi!

591
00:34:39,672 --> 00:34:41,548
What the hell is wrong with you?

592
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:43,342
There was a motorcycle.

593
00:34:56,022 --> 00:34:57,023
Shit.

594
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:05,907
Hi, baby!
Where did you come from?

595
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:09,702
You’re so cute!

596
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:13,204
Who’s your owner?

597
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:14,582
- Summer!
- Cute...

598
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:17,417
Sit.

599
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,837
What the hell
are you doing here?

600
00:35:20,963 --> 00:35:22,715
Why are you
in our neighborhood, huh?

601
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:24,257
Are you going to our house?

602
00:35:24,258 --> 00:35:25,676
What’s with the attitude?

603
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:27,720
You should thank me.

604
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:31,318
I came here ‘cause
you left this at our house.

605
00:35:32,153 --> 00:35:33,321
My parents told me...

606
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:35,298
Well, forced me

607
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,563
to give this back
to you in person.

608
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:11,681
Thanks.

609
00:36:11,682 --> 00:36:12,807
You can leave now.

610
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:18,062
Does it hurt?

611
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:21,482
Not really.

612
00:36:23,192 --> 00:36:24,235
Let me help you.

613
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,528
I'll be going
to your house anyway.

614
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:27,780
I'm parked there.

615
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:29,991
I can walk on my own.

616
00:36:30,366 --> 00:36:31,784
Your pride’s way up there, huh?

617
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,411
Want me to carry you?

618
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:34,911
Fine!

619
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,830
Go.

620
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:37,957
Come here.

621
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,514
Thank you.

622
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:06,901
Ouch!

623
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:16,703
Ouch!

624
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:28,841
Are you using me
as a guinea pig?

625
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:31,218
Hey, I’m not your patient.

626
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:32,927
No.

627
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:35,765
Because you’re my fiancée.

628
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,191
Done?

629
00:37:46,484 --> 00:37:47,276
Yes.

630
00:37:47,276 --> 00:37:48,276
Thanks.

631
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:50,404
Next time, that'll cost you.

632
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,616
You know what,
let’s not see each other

633
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:56,868
- unless there’s a date —
- Unless we have a date?

634
00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:57,869
No!

635
00:37:58,204 --> 00:38:00,498
Be serious.
Unless our wedding has a date.

636
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:04,501
Fine.

637
00:38:05,294 --> 00:38:07,088
I’ll see you
when I need to see you.

638
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:15,179
Sam?

639
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:16,763
What?

640
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:19,266
By the way...

641
00:38:20,476 --> 00:38:22,019
You can date other people,

642
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:23,437
I don’t mind.

643
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:26,941
I don’t need your permission.

644
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:29,985
But if this will
help you sleep at night,

645
00:38:30,444 --> 00:38:32,278
you can also date other people.

646
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:33,279
I don’t date.

647
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:37,159
I don’t have time for that.

648
00:38:40,913 --> 00:38:41,580
Summer!

649
00:38:41,872 --> 00:38:42,872
Let’s go!

650
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:43,998
Summer!

651
00:39:08,983 --> 00:39:10,276
I’m done!

652
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:13,194
I just can’t get
past this, damn it!

653
00:39:13,195 --> 00:39:15,613
Don’t you have any,
like, motivation?

654
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:16,656
You want motivation?

655
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:18,575
- Yes, girl!
- A handsome motivation?

656
00:39:18,576 --> 00:39:19,576
Yes.

657
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:20,911
Luna doesn’t need that.

658
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,912
- Huh?
- Are you jealous?

659
00:39:22,913 --> 00:39:23,913
You’re such a killjoy!

660
00:39:25,207 --> 00:39:27,543
How many people are you
talking to on that dating app?

661
00:39:28,544 --> 00:39:30,754
Around four or five.

662
00:39:32,923 --> 00:39:34,592
It doesn't seem like
four or five, though.

663
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:37,135
Well, I’ve met some
of them already,

664
00:39:37,136 --> 00:39:39,430
but there was no spark,
so I turned them down.

665
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:41,306
But they're so persistent.

666
00:39:41,307 --> 00:39:42,850
They keep messaging me.

667
00:39:44,602 --> 00:39:45,602
Look!

668
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:47,354
He’s asking for a second date.

669
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:49,857
Yes, he’s a good guy.

670
00:39:50,149 --> 00:39:51,149
Kinda cute,

671
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:54,028
has that golden retriever
energy actually.

672
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:55,571
That’s you.

673
00:39:55,572 --> 00:39:58,323
But you know, I don’t feel
that strong connection.

674
00:39:58,324 --> 00:39:59,532
More like just friends,

675
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:00,409
like Sevi.

676
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:01,409
Oh, wow.

677
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:04,579
Heard that, Sevi?
You just give off friend vibes.

678
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,872
No wonder your crush
doesn't like you back!

679
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:06,873
You’re nuts!

680
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,085
Wow, Sam! You're such
a serial first-dater.

681
00:40:11,086 --> 00:40:13,756
You only flirt at the beginning?

682
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:15,381
- She’s right.
- Really, Sam?

683
00:40:15,382 --> 00:40:18,135
Sam! Aren't there
any cute guys there?

684
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:21,638
None, no one interesting either.

685
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:23,599
At least I gave them
a chance, right?

686
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:26,851
It’s just that I don’t feel
that strong feeling

687
00:40:26,852 --> 00:40:28,187
for any of these guys.

688
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:30,956
Or you're just not
ready for commitment?

689
00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:33,566
Are you speaking
from experience?

690
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:34,567
Bitch!

691
00:40:35,986 --> 00:40:37,238
Bull’s eye.

692
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,780
Eat.

693
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:41,075
I like that.

694
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:44,536
This is the best kwek-kwek I’ve ever had.

695
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:49,833
Is it good?

696
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:50,833
It’s good.

697
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:53,378
How can I have
a serious relationship

698
00:40:53,379 --> 00:40:55,130
if I’m technically engaged?

699
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:19,738
Hey!

700
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:20,781
You okay?

701
00:41:21,824 --> 00:41:22,866
What do you mean?

702
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:24,285
What do you mean?

703
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:25,786
You've been quiet
there for a while!

704
00:41:28,163 --> 00:41:29,290
What happened?

705
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:31,624
You can tell me about it.

706
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,751
You know that, right?

707
00:41:37,506 --> 00:41:39,883
Remember when
I mentioned before that.

708
00:41:40,676 --> 00:41:42,469
I’ll be engaged to a random guy?

709
00:41:43,595 --> 00:41:45,139
- Remember?
- Yes.

710
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:47,307
Well,

711
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:48,851
I already met him.

712
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:50,769
- Huh?
- And it’s happening.

713
00:41:51,186 --> 00:41:53,272
Huh? So they were serious?

714
00:41:53,897 --> 00:41:55,023
I thought it was just
some nonsense

715
00:41:55,024 --> 00:41:56,191
your parents were spouting.

716
00:41:57,192 --> 00:41:59,945
Yanna, they want to control
every aspect of my life.

717
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:03,615
But the guy doesn’t
want to get married,

718
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:08,120
so we're planning to end
the engagement eventually.

719
00:42:08,787 --> 00:42:09,913
But wait,

720
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:11,498
you don’t like the guy?

721
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,501
Let me see a picture!
Is he cute? Hurry!

722
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:20,007
Well, objectively speaking,

723
00:42:20,382 --> 00:42:22,801
he is a bit attractive.

724
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:25,929
A bit?

725
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,389
You’re nuts!

726
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:28,890
He’s so good-looking!

727
00:42:28,891 --> 00:42:30,099
If you don’t want him,

728
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,934
then I’ll go to the wedding.

729
00:42:31,935 --> 00:42:33,187
You’ve hit the jackpot!

730
00:42:33,562 --> 00:42:35,022
- Jackpot? Huh?
- Yes!

731
00:42:35,356 --> 00:42:36,273
Girl!

732
00:42:36,274 --> 00:42:38,274
Yanna, he has a bad attitude.

733
00:42:38,275 --> 00:42:39,650
- Yuck!
- Really?

734
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:42,029
- Yes.
- Well, no one’s perfect.

735
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:45,531
Just pray to God
that he's good in bed.

736
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:47,076
Hey! No!

737
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:48,202
No!

738
00:42:48,203 --> 00:42:50,411
No way I’m getting
married to that guy.

739
00:42:50,412 --> 00:42:51,412
Shocks.

740
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,539
That wedding can’t
push through, you know.

741
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,542
I won’t let that
wedding push through.

742
00:42:57,336 --> 00:42:59,088
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

743
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:01,661
I think you guys
suit each other.

744
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:02,882
Huh?

745
00:43:03,425 --> 00:43:06,260
No, I don't like him.
I love my freedom more.

746
00:43:06,261 --> 00:43:07,387
And also, come on,

747
00:43:07,388 --> 00:43:09,264
I still want to flirt
with guys, you know.

748
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:11,307
Well then, let’s flirt!

749
00:43:11,308 --> 00:43:13,309
- Let’s flirt!
- Let’s flirt!

750
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,645
But we need to flirt...

751
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:17,772
- responsibly!
- Responsibly!

752
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:18,565
Yes!

753
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:21,484
Because we still have a lot
of dreams to chase, right?

754
00:43:21,485 --> 00:43:22,693
Exactly!

755
00:43:22,694 --> 00:43:26,781
Of course, our dreams are still
more important than guys!

756
00:43:26,782 --> 00:43:27,949
- Right?
- Correct!

757
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,077
- Right?
- Dreams over guys!

758
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:32,663
- Yes!
- Yes!

759
00:43:47,845 --> 00:43:48,846
Oh my god.

760
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:53,058
- Oh my god, Yanna.
- What’s this?

761
00:43:53,517 --> 00:43:54,917
What is this?
What am I going to do?

762
00:43:56,478 --> 00:43:58,188
Wait Yanna, calm down.

763
00:43:58,689 --> 00:43:59,689
Okay?

764
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,940
Calm down.

765
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:04,444
I’ll call my doctor
to have you checked

766
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:05,988
immediately so we know.

767
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:09,199
I don’t want this Sam.

768
00:44:09,616 --> 00:44:12,411
Hiro doesn’t want this.
I can’t have a baby now.

769
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:15,122
Yanna, let’s go
to the clinic first, okay?

770
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:17,124
Don’t be scared.

771
00:44:17,749 --> 00:44:18,959
I’m here with you.

772
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:21,920
Be strong, Yanna.

773
00:44:24,006 --> 00:44:25,591
It’s okay… It’s okay.

774
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:31,472
It's okay.

775
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,238
Guys!

776
00:44:49,656 --> 00:44:51,365
We still have
a lot of drinks, okay?

777
00:44:51,366 --> 00:44:53,952
The night is young.
Let’s all toast!

778
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:55,369
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

779
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,080
You guys, You should drink guys!

780
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:00,583
Hi, ladies!

781
00:45:00,584 --> 00:45:02,126
- Hi!
- Hey, Sam!

782
00:45:02,127 --> 00:45:03,629
You’re all so gorg, huh?

783
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,963
What are you drinking?

784
00:45:05,964 --> 00:45:08,090
- Champagne.
- Champagne, the classic.

785
00:45:08,091 --> 00:45:09,343
We’re the same.

786
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:11,637
Cheers!

787
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:15,306
Girls, no one’s stopping

788
00:45:15,307 --> 00:45:18,018
until Sam’s
completely drunk, okay?

789
00:45:18,477 --> 00:45:19,853
We’ll keep on drinking.

790
00:45:20,187 --> 00:45:21,604
If that’s the case,

791
00:45:21,605 --> 00:45:23,856
then we’re all gonna
get drunk tonight.

792
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:25,107
You know how long it takes

793
00:45:25,108 --> 00:45:26,734
for Samantha Vera to get drunk.

794
00:45:26,735 --> 00:45:27,735
Yes.

795
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:29,112
Girls,

796
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:30,656
you just need more practice.

797
00:45:31,156 --> 00:45:33,366
Besides, if I get drunk easily,

798
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:35,118
who would entertain the guests?

799
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:37,663
Okay, Ms. Social Butterfly.

800
00:45:39,456 --> 00:45:40,540
Cheers!

801
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:42,167
- Okay, again.
- Cheers to that!

802
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,502
Okay, let’s dance.

803
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:45,087
Let’s dance!

804
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,754
We’re gonna dance first.

805
00:45:45,754 --> 00:45:46,505
Sure!

806
00:45:46,506 --> 00:45:48,632
- We’re gonna dance!
- We’re gonna dance!

807
00:45:57,434 --> 00:45:59,519
That could have
been Yanna and I.

808
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,824
I miss her so much.

809
00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:04,189
I wish she was here.

810
00:46:05,857 --> 00:46:06,977
- I’ll just go there.
- Okay.

811
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,070
Hey!

812
00:46:12,823 --> 00:46:14,283
Good to see you guys.

813
00:46:21,707 --> 00:46:22,707
Hey.

814
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:25,960
Glad you came.

815
00:46:25,961 --> 00:46:27,837
Yes, we were just
stuck in traffic,

816
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:29,214
but we still made it.

817
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:35,761
If you’re looking for Luna,
don’t worry.

818
00:46:35,762 --> 00:46:36,847
She’s not coming.

819
00:46:37,097 --> 00:46:38,557
She's busy with her academics,

820
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:42,644
and maybe it's her
way of getting over you.

821
00:46:43,604 --> 00:46:47,065
Don’t worry, I’m not looking
for her anyways, right?

822
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,320
I’ll get our drink.

823
00:46:52,237 --> 00:46:54,323
Sam, chill!

824
00:46:56,116 --> 00:46:58,577
My friend’s heartbroken, too,
so cut him some slack.

825
00:46:58,952 --> 00:46:59,953
The pain’s still fresh.

826
00:47:00,454 --> 00:47:02,247
So sorry about that, Adi.

827
00:47:03,165 --> 00:47:05,000
I know he’s having
a hard time too.

828
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:07,084
If only those two
knew how to communicate,

829
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:08,462
this wouldn’t have happened.

830
00:47:09,046 --> 00:47:10,839
They wouldn’t be
avoiding each other.

831
00:47:12,382 --> 00:47:13,382
Right!

832
00:47:14,176 --> 00:47:15,843
Remember when you
confessed to me back then,

833
00:47:15,844 --> 00:47:18,430
and I rejected you? We didn’t
avoid each other, right?

834
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:22,976
That’s ‘cause I didn’t
like you that much.

835
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,771
Wow, are you
still bitter about it?

836
00:47:28,106 --> 00:47:29,358
Don’t listen to him.

837
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:31,109
Oh wait.

838
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:34,320
Why aren’t you here
at our family dinner?

839
00:47:34,321 --> 00:47:35,321
Oh shit.

840
00:47:35,364 --> 00:47:36,364
What happened?

841
00:47:37,407 --> 00:47:38,866
Sorry, Adi. I have to go.

842
00:47:38,867 --> 00:47:40,369
I have to go. Bye!

843
00:47:48,543 --> 00:47:49,544
Maui!

844
00:47:51,672 --> 00:47:52,673
Dad…

845
00:47:56,593 --> 00:47:58,804
We couldn’t wait for you.
You took too long.

846
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:01,431
Did you forget
we had dinner tonight?

847
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:05,602
Sorry, Dad. I had an org event.

848
00:48:08,939 --> 00:48:10,399
I got your grades today.

849
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:12,442
Really, a B?

850
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,402
You get one more of those

851
00:48:14,403 --> 00:48:16,321
then you have
to quit all your orgs.

852
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:20,242
I’m sorry, Dad.

853
00:48:21,118 --> 00:48:22,118
I understand.

854
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:24,578
I don’t want you to be sorry.

855
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:26,039
I want you to do better!

856
00:48:30,043 --> 00:48:31,253
Now that you're here,

857
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,547
I want to talk about something.

858
00:48:35,632 --> 00:48:36,632
What is it, Dad?

859
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:37,634
Your Uncle Chris and I

860
00:48:37,635 --> 00:48:39,344
have already set
a date for the wedding.

861
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:40,929
Dad,

862
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:42,847
I’m still studying.

863
00:48:42,848 --> 00:48:43,807
And so?

864
00:48:43,808 --> 00:48:46,059
You’re about to graduate,
and so is Clyden.

865
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,395
As soon as
he finishes med school,

866
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:50,147
you’re getting
married right away.

867
00:48:51,356 --> 00:48:52,023
Look,

868
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:54,443
I think the two of you should
be seeing more of each other.

869
00:48:54,901 --> 00:48:58,196
Next week we’re gonna have
dinner with the Ramirez Family

870
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:00,865
and we're going
to discuss the plans

871
00:49:00,866 --> 00:49:02,409
for your engagement, okay?

872
00:49:03,952 --> 00:49:04,952
Yes, Dad.

873
00:49:15,505 --> 00:49:17,215
Fix it already.

874
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:19,843
Hi!

875
00:49:19,844 --> 00:49:22,261
- Stephen’s here.
- Chris!

876
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:23,263
Thanks for coming.

877
00:49:23,555 --> 00:49:25,514
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you!

878
00:49:25,515 --> 00:49:27,684
- Hello.
- Hi!

879
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:29,728
- How are you doing?
- Come over here.

880
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,270
Charles, Colin...

881
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,273
- Hi!
- Come here.

882
00:49:35,317 --> 00:49:36,317
Hello.

883
00:49:38,403 --> 00:49:39,403
Samantha,

884
00:49:39,488 --> 00:49:40,781
you got even taller!

885
00:49:41,615 --> 00:49:43,575
What a fine lady you have here.

886
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,287
- Boys!
- Introduce yourselves.

887
00:49:48,955 --> 00:49:49,955
Hi, Colin.

888
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,291
Samantha Vera.

889
00:49:53,877 --> 00:49:55,462
Hi, I’m Charles!

890
00:49:57,088 --> 00:49:58,715
Finally, nice meeting you.

891
00:50:01,176 --> 00:50:02,176
Hey!

892
00:50:03,804 --> 00:50:04,971
I missed you, love.

893
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:11,352
What happened during those
2 years I didn’t see him?

894
00:50:11,353 --> 00:50:12,771
He looks more attractive.

895
00:50:13,021 --> 00:50:14,688
And he smells nice.

896
00:50:14,689 --> 00:50:15,689
Love?

897
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,484
I said I missed you.

898
00:50:20,237 --> 00:50:21,613
Why would you miss me?

899
00:50:21,822 --> 00:50:24,240
Didn’t we just talk last night?

900
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:26,535
That’s how crazy I am for you.

901
00:50:27,494 --> 00:50:28,786
Okay, love birds, let’s go!

902
00:50:28,787 --> 00:50:30,996
- Let's go eat.
- Come on, let’s eat.

903
00:50:30,997 --> 00:50:32,373
- Come on guys, Have a seat.
- Have a seat.

904
00:50:32,374 --> 00:50:34,208
This is so cringe.

905
00:50:34,209 --> 00:50:36,920
How the hell am I going
to survive this night?

906
00:50:38,004 --> 00:50:39,004
Thank you.

907
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:50,307
Thanks, Mom.

908
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,060
Thank you.

909
00:50:54,145 --> 00:50:54,855
Okay.

910
00:50:54,856 --> 00:50:57,148
You should try this.
This is Mom’s specialty.

911
00:51:07,909 --> 00:51:08,909
Okay…

912
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:11,955
It’s okay.

913
00:51:11,956 --> 00:51:12,956
Say, “ah.”

914
00:51:13,957 --> 00:51:15,292
It’s okay.

915
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,177
This jerk.
He’s doing this to annoy me.

916
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:34,978
How’s med school, Clyden?

917
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:37,772
It’s been great, Senator.

918
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:39,810
I’m actually learning a lot.

919
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:41,275
That’s good.

920
00:51:41,276 --> 00:51:44,237
The Philippines could use
future doctors like you.

921
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:48,782
You do know that I used to serve
in the public health industry

922
00:51:48,783 --> 00:51:50,243
before becoming a senator?

923
00:51:50,577 --> 00:51:51,578
I know, sir.

924
00:51:52,495 --> 00:51:54,748
I’ve heard you’ve done
a lot of great things

925
00:51:55,081 --> 00:51:56,374
during your time there.

926
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:57,250
- It’s true.
- Yes.

927
00:51:57,251 --> 00:51:58,251
The public health industry

928
00:51:58,252 --> 00:51:59,544
is very close to my heart.

929
00:51:59,961 --> 00:52:03,088
So, if you have any
suggestions as a med student,

930
00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:05,008
my office is always open, okay?

931
00:52:05,717 --> 00:52:07,010
I’ll keep that in mind, sir.

932
00:52:09,846 --> 00:52:10,846
Fake.

933
00:52:10,847 --> 00:52:12,247
I’m sure you’ll
enjoy talking to Cy.

934
00:52:13,141 --> 00:52:15,518
My son has a lot of great ideas.

935
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:17,395
That’s how smart he is.

936
00:52:17,812 --> 00:52:20,940
But I can't compare
my two kids like that.

937
00:52:20,941 --> 00:52:23,901
Charles didn't graduate

938
00:52:23,902 --> 00:52:25,403
with Latin honors.

939
00:52:25,904 --> 00:52:28,490
And Colin here didn’t
even pass med school.

940
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,742
So, I had to pull some strings.

941
00:52:33,578 --> 00:52:34,704
Thanks

942
00:52:35,372 --> 00:52:37,791
for embarrassing us in
front of your guests, Dad.

943
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,292
I guess dinner tastes better

944
00:52:40,293 --> 00:52:41,543
when there’s a son
being embarrassed.

945
00:52:41,544 --> 00:52:42,712
Watch your words.

946
00:52:43,046 --> 00:52:44,089
Wow,

947
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:47,859
the kiss-ass guy,
already defending.

948
00:52:47,884 --> 00:52:50,136
Charles, now is not
the time nor place.

949
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:05,193
I’m sorry about that.

950
00:53:05,402 --> 00:53:06,402
You see

951
00:53:06,736 --> 00:53:08,154
why Cy is my only hope?

952
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,395
Don’t worry, you know

953
00:53:10,615 --> 00:53:12,574
every family has
someone like that.

954
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,160
Just like Maui here.

955
00:53:15,412 --> 00:53:17,538
I guess I’m not the
only one suffering

956
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:19,582
from a dysfunctional family.

957
00:53:58,361 --> 00:53:59,987
Hey, are you okay?

958
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:06,254
Just wanted to check in on you.

959
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,966
About Charles,

960
00:54:10,967 --> 00:54:12,844
do you guys
always argue like that?

961
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:15,512
Yes.

962
00:54:16,681 --> 00:54:17,681
Why?

963
00:54:19,517 --> 00:54:20,727
Are you judging us?

964
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:22,770
Chill.

965
00:54:22,812 --> 00:54:24,230
I’m not here to argue.

966
00:54:25,065 --> 00:54:26,857
I’m just asking ‘cause.

967
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:28,317
I’m surprised how your dad
embarrassed

968
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:29,444
your brother like that.

969
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:31,361
Don’t worry,

970
00:54:31,738 --> 00:54:35,075
I’m also surprised that your dad
cares about the health industry.

971
00:54:37,035 --> 00:54:38,745
What a fucking hypocrite.

972
00:54:40,622 --> 00:54:42,373
Dude, what’s your problem?

973
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:44,751
What’s your problem?

974
00:54:45,585 --> 00:54:47,337
I was just sitting here
quietly on my own.

975
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:49,297
You’re the one who came over.

976
00:54:51,257 --> 00:54:52,258
I can’t...

977
00:54:52,634 --> 00:54:55,220
I can’t fucking stand you,
you know?

978
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:57,180
The feeling is mutual.

979
00:55:00,016 --> 00:55:02,685
I’m so excited to
break the engagement.

980
00:55:03,603 --> 00:55:04,771
So am I.

981
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:10,902
When you’re done
with your tantrum,

982
00:55:11,152 --> 00:55:12,529
go downstairs, okay?

983
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:14,739
Our parents want to talk to us.

984
00:55:29,754 --> 00:55:31,131
Oh good. You’re back.

985
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:34,592
We were just talking
about your engagement.

986
00:55:36,636 --> 00:55:38,721
We’ve decided that

987
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:40,849
as soon as Clyden
finishes med school,

988
00:55:41,182 --> 00:55:43,601
we’ll go straight ahead with
the wedding. Is that alright?

989
00:55:44,811 --> 00:55:46,437
Yes. That's all right.

990
00:55:47,021 --> 00:55:47,897
See?

991
00:55:47,898 --> 00:55:49,273
I told you
he’ll agree with that.

992
00:55:49,274 --> 00:55:50,524
So why wait any longer?

993
00:55:50,525 --> 00:55:52,026
And we were also thinking,

994
00:55:52,652 --> 00:55:54,404
because your wedding
is one year away,

995
00:55:55,071 --> 00:55:56,738
it’s good for you two

996
00:55:56,739 --> 00:55:57,739
to stay under one roof.

997
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,411
So, what do you think?

998
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,664
And we’ve talked to our agent,

999
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:06,665
we bought you a house.

1000
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:07,834
Yes!

1001
00:56:08,918 --> 00:56:10,712
No fucking way.

1002
00:56:11,087 --> 00:56:12,881
What the hell?

1003
00:57:16,027 --> 00:57:19,280
To be fair,
she’s conventionally beautiful.

1004
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:32,082
But she’s not my type.
She looks like a spoiled brat,

1005
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:34,254
always partying and drinking.

1006
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:49,352
Be in our event next week.

1007
00:57:49,644 --> 00:57:52,604
You know?
To strengthen the connections.

1008
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:54,274
Sam, you should come.

1009
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:56,608
I would love to, Governor.

1010
00:57:56,609 --> 00:57:59,821
But, I have org
activities next week.

1011
00:58:00,571 --> 00:58:01,572
Another org event?

1012
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:03,950
Can't you skip it?

1013
00:58:04,242 --> 00:58:06,576
Now this party is
a good opportunity for you

1014
00:58:06,577 --> 00:58:09,622
to meet new people
and widen your connections.

1015
00:58:10,581 --> 00:58:13,334
What kind of organizations
are you joining, anyway?

1016
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,461
It’s mostly
socio-civic organizations.

1017
00:58:16,462 --> 00:58:20,757
We hold fundraising events for
marginalized communities, sir.

1018
00:58:20,758 --> 00:58:23,176
We actually have
a fundraising event next week.

1019
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:24,678
So it's for charity, huh?

1020
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:25,680
Never mind it, then.

1021
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:30,393
You can use it to boost your
name for the next election.

1022
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:36,732
Here's the plan...

1023
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:39,901
No helpers, no drivers, nothing.
To avoid gossip.

1024
00:58:39,902 --> 00:58:42,196
So, if you don't have
any better suggestions,

1025
00:58:42,613 --> 00:58:44,239
let's just stick to the plan.

1026
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,534
Do whatever you want.

1027
00:58:47,536 --> 00:58:49,494
For now, let’s just do what they want.

1028
00:58:49,495 --> 00:58:51,455
I can ask Dad to buy me makeup.

1029
00:58:51,456 --> 00:58:52,457
Now, leave.

1030
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:56,919
Maybe I should've loved
Kalix more.

1031
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:03,426
If you want to share anything
with us, just let us know.

1032
00:59:05,303 --> 00:59:06,553
I’m okay, Sev.

1033
00:59:06,554 --> 00:59:07,555
Don’t worry about me.

1034
00:59:08,431 --> 00:59:09,724
Can we talk now?

1035
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:14,561
Game, game.

1036
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:16,773
Cheers!

1037
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:22,443
Sam. Sam.

1038
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:28,034
Hi!

1039
00:59:28,785 --> 00:59:29,785
Who are you?

1040
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,444
Here is my friend also.

1041
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,041
He’s my ex-crush actually.
