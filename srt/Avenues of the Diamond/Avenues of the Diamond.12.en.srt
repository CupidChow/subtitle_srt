1
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:11,458
Is Avi still coughing?

2
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:12,818
Not really, Doc.

3
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:14,928
Doc, they’re looking
for you in the ward.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,192
We know each
other already, Doc.

5
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:24,820
She was my fiancée.

6
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:26,764
Go, Auntie! Go!

7
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,577
Be careful, Avi.

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,822
- Auntie… Auntie!
- Oh my god.

9
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,872
Baby! Avi!

10
00:00:34,897 --> 00:00:36,495
Rich, I need to take her
to the hospital.

11
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:39,189
There's one nearby,
Ramirez Medical.

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,079
It’s okay.

13
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,912
There’s no more bleeding.
You’re okay.

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,416
Can I join you?

15
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:49,679
My… My wha—

16
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:51,559
Oh! Are you okay?

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,784
Haze, don’t you
have a girlfriend?

18
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,988
- Take a video.
- Hurry up. Here.

19
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:01,481
- All right.
- Let her go.

20
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:03,062
- So stingy!
- This way please.

21
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:12,367
Let’s sit down first.

22
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:13,861
Let’s wait for them to leave.

23
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:25,904
I’m sorry.

24
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:29,013
They’re not usually this wild.

25
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:32,095
Maybe because they still
couldn’t get anything from me

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,914
with those rumors going around.

27
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:36,433
Rumors.

28
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,606
I heard your conversation
with your friend.

29
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,339
You didn’t go for surgery?

30
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:46,174
No.

31
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,342
It’s gonna take me
five years more—

32
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,557
And I guess I was...

33
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:52,290
impatient.

34
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,915
I wanted to prove
myself quickly.

35
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,934
Ah, okay.

36
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:01,339
He wanted to prove
himself quickly?

37
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,660
To whom? His parents?
His siblings?

38
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:07,629
To me?

39
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:14,202
By the way, congratulations
on passing the boards.

40
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,551
Better late than never.

41
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:17,837
Thanks.

42
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,441
I’m sure your parents are proud.

43
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:24,815
Congratulations on
all your success, too.

44
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:26,983
Thanks.

45
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:32,047
Thank you for saving me earlier.

46
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,850
I think I can take it from here.

47
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,251
I’ll go ahead.

48
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:46,980
Hey, Sam. You left your—

49
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:03,205
They didn’t get any scoop
from you. Right, Sam?

50
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:05,123
Nothing really.

51
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:06,750
I was able to hide.

52
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:11,944
Actually, the guy you were with
in Japan is a hot topic.

53
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,121
The gossip sites and
vloggers are all over it now.

54
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:18,190
Anything for
the views, right? Jeez!

55
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:21,973
I even thought you
started this new rumor

56
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:24,751
to cover up the ones
about Avi being my daughter.

57
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:28,162
I wish, but someone
beat me to the idea.

58
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:31,099
It did take the spotlight off
the whole issue with Avi.

59
00:04:32,776 --> 00:04:35,509
So, who was that guy
in the picture with you?

60
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:37,174
Haze Juarez.

61
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:39,532
You guys probably know him.

62
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:41,927
Of course.
I know all the hot men.

63
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:45,122
He’s FlyAsia’s CEO.

64
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:47,140
And he’s a pilot, too.

65
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,929
I heard about Akihiro Juarez?

66
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,211
Are they brothers?

67
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:52,355
Yup.

68
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:55,388
Hiro is Avrielle’s dad.

69
00:04:56,678 --> 00:05:01,359
So, Avi is a Juarez.

70
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,789
Oh my.

71
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,336
So much tea!

72
00:05:04,574 --> 00:05:06,493
You really know a lot
of high-profile people, Sam.

73
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:09,020
A supermodel and a socialite!

74
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:10,932
But seriously, Sam,

75
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:13,429
you need to stop
taking interviews.

76
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,295
You’ve got a big
fashion show coming up,

77
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:18,338
and people should be talking
about your modeling career,

78
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:19,906
not your love life.

79
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,784
Exactly. Stay away
from drama for now.

80
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:25,089
Avi’s birthday is coming up,

81
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:28,415
and I’m sure
I’ll see Haze there.

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,219
Just steer clear
of Haze for now

83
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:33,661
to avoid gossip, okay?

84
00:05:39,885 --> 00:05:41,845
- Is the food ready?
- Yes, it’s all set.

85
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,870
Thank you.

86
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,836
- Hey!
- Hi!

87
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:50,603
Sit down.

88
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:52,939
Why are you doing that?

89
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:55,483
Didn’t you hire helpers for today?

90
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:56,918
Come on, I just want to help.

91
00:05:56,943 --> 00:05:58,612
It’s my daughter’s birthday,
after all.

92
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:00,055
Wow.

93
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,491
Jeez, stop laughing
and help me out here.

94
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:05,482
Can’t you see
I’m already struggling?

95
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:08,028
- Help me, my hands are starting to hurt.
- Okay.

96
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:09,511
There you go.

97
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:12,175
So—

98
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:13,977
A few days ago,

99
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:17,351
I went to see Raylee
near Ramirez Medical.

100
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,550
I got caught in the middle
of a bunch of vloggers.

101
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:23,200
And…?

102
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:27,081
Clyden helped me
get away from them,

103
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:30,390
and he congratulated me
for making it as a model.

104
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,237
How did that make you feel?

105
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:36,691
Actually—

106
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:38,235
it felt nice.

107
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:40,588
I thought he was mad at me,

108
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:43,589
but maybe there’s still
a chance for us to be civil.

109
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:45,454
Or even become friends.

110
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,982
After all, he’s Avi’s
regular pediatrician

111
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:52,267
So, you’ll be seeing
each other regularly?

112
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:53,967
Yes.

113
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,650
No big deal.

114
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:58,070
We’re just regular friends.

115
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,841
Not special?

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Whatever.

117
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:03,802
Let’s just inflate this already.

118
00:07:03,827 --> 00:07:05,107
Your guests are about to arrive.

119
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:06,404
- Faster.
- Okay.

120
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,241
Wow, yours is huge.
How did you—

121
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:09,557
Was it supposed to be small?

122
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:11,627
I thought you liked them big?

123
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,700
I already have one.

124
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,028
Happy birthday to you!

125
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:37,210
Happy birthday to you!

126
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:42,399
Happy birthday,
happy birthday…

127
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:46,527
Happy birthday to you!

128
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:49,734
Thank you everyone!

129
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,684
Happy birthday!

130
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,060
Make a wish.

131
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,517
Wow!

132
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:03,092
Yay!

133
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:08,042
Okay, everyone…

134
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:09,551
You can have your seats.

135
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,325
And kids,
you can play again.

136
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,370
Okay?

137
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:13,562
Go, go, baby, go.

138
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:14,589
Stay here.

139
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:16,271
I have an announcement to make.

140
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,978
- Really?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:20,093
Uh...

142
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,116
So, everyone…

143
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:24,049
We’d like to
thank you for coming.

144
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:25,717
It means a lot to us.

145
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:29,060
Especially since
it’s Avi’s first birthday

146
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:32,127
with all of us complete,
as a family.

147
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,021
And because today
is such a special day,

148
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,096
we have an
announcement to make,

149
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:39,688
as a family.

150
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:41,237
Huh?

151
00:08:41,262 --> 00:08:42,806
What kind of announcement?

152
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,206
You’ll see there are
envelopes under your plates.

153
00:08:57,642 --> 00:08:58,642
Oh my god!

154
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:01,127
We’re getting married
in a few months.

155
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:05,228
Congratulations!

156
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,836
Must be nice.

157
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,823
Some people really have it all.

158
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:11,238
Don’t start with the
“must be nice” drama,

159
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:12,306
you all better show up, okay?

160
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,850
I want full attendance,
all right?

161
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:16,711
Hopefully all your
schedules line up.

162
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:27,921
- Just sit down already.
- Here, come on.

163
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:29,409
Sit here, Sevi.

164
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:32,230
Stop being emotional.
Come here.

165
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:35,661
Cheers!

166
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:38,331
Thank you.

167
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:42,769
Where’s the birthday girl?

168
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:44,132
She fell asleep.

169
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,838
Probably got tired from
all that dancing, huh?

170
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:52,398
I’m very happy for you and Hiro.

171
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:56,749
Look, if I’m not the
maid of honor, I’m not coming.

172
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:58,100
Come on,

173
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,294
who else would I even
choose as my maid of honor?

174
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,156
So, what now? You and
Avi are moving in with Hiro?

175
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:10,435
Most likely.

176
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,595
That means I won’t get to be
with Avi all the time anymore.

177
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:17,579
What am I gonna do now?

178
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:21,458
What if I just move to New York?

179
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:24,037
I’ve been wanting to live
there for so long anyway.

180
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,496
And now that you
and Avi have Hiro,

181
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:27,809
I can do the move.

182
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:28,999
What?

183
00:10:29,024 --> 00:10:30,692
Jumping straight to New York?

184
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:33,571
You can always visit
us anytime you want.

185
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:37,228
You’re not just my best friend, okay?

186
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:39,494
You’re family to me and Avi.

187
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:43,025
You’re just drunk!

188
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,290
That’s why you’re talking
about all that moving nonsense.

189
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,985
No, I’m not. I’ve actually been
thinking about it for a while.

190
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:52,940
I didn’t even know you
were already apartment hunting.

191
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,824
Are you sure about this?

192
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,324
What about the people in
your life here in the Philippines?

193
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,884
Well, you’re right.

194
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:04,492
We can always see each other.

195
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:06,920
Just one word to Hiro and

196
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:08,949
you’ll find yourself
flying to New York already.

197
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:10,298
Wow.

198
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:14,683
And I can always visit
Manila whenever I can.

199
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,491
I’ll always support you in
whatever decisions you make in life.

200
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:22,227
But you have to be
really sure about it, okay?

201
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,563
Deep down, what do you really want?

202
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:30,580
Look at you!

203
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:32,452
You’re drunk.

204
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:33,937
You’re definitely drunk now.

205
00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:36,746
I’m not drunk.

206
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:38,701
Well, I can still walk, see?

207
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:41,097
- Look.
- Uh-huh...

208
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:43,103
Wait, I’ll just go to the restroom.

209
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:44,707
- I’m not drunk.
- I’m not drunk.

210
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:46,852
- I’ll get back to you.
- That’s always how it starts.

211
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:06,605
It seems like you’re always drunk

212
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,006
when we see each other, huh?

213
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:22,828
What?

214
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,052
You might fall for me even more.

215
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:31,723
Hey!

216
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,736
You okay?
Feeling dizzy?

217
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:38,538
I want to sleep.

218
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,524
Sleep with me.

219
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:43,015
What?

220
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:46,019
Sleep with me, please.

221
00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:47,687
I miss you.

222
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:49,883
I miss you, Clyden.

223
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:58,323
You’re really losing it, huh?

224
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:01,034
Begging someone to sleep with you.

225
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:06,271
I haven’t had sex for years.

226
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:07,716
Really?

227
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,261
You know,

228
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,909
if you told me that sober…

229
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:14,047
I will gladly accept it.

230
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:16,549
I’m curious—

231
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:21,688
Do you guys do it with other
women after you break up?

232
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,497
After my last breakup,

233
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,641
I just can’t do it with other guys.

234
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:28,699
What’s “it”?

235
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,335
Can you elaborate?

236
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:31,497
Is it—

237
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:32,734
Is it sex?

238
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,820
Are you asking me about sex?

239
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:38,106
Why are you saying it out loud?

240
00:13:38,488 --> 00:13:39,488
But, yeah!

241
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
So?

242
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:42,828
Well—

243
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:45,272
I do it with other women,

244
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,659
depending on my mood.

245
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:50,750
It’s also because my last breakup
didn’t really affect me that much.

246
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:55,797
But, anyway—

247
00:13:55,822 --> 00:13:57,073
I don’t know about your man.

248
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
Wait,

249
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,009
why are you curious?

250
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:01,843
Nothing.

251
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,805
I wanted to feel good.

252
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:07,558
But your answer
made me feel worse.

253
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:11,383
But I know how to
make you feel good.

254
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:15,181
Sleep.

255
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,402
Sleep will make you feel good.

256
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,988
Don’t overthink.
I’m not gonna do anything.

257
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:24,701
Unless you want me to.

258
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:27,244
You know what,

259
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:29,430
you’re just like your brother.

260
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:31,510
That’s why Yanna got pregnant.

261
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:33,158
Both of you are—

262
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:35,601
something.

263
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,927
I can bring you home if you like,

264
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:41,929
but someone might
snap a photo of us again.

265
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:44,687
That’s just gonna add
to your list of issues.

266
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:47,532
Thank you but,

267
00:14:47,611 --> 00:14:50,113
I’ll just ask my
assistant to pick me up.

268
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:51,977
Bye.

269
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:07,140
Now, give me a soft smile

270
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:08,720
but keep those
eyes fierce, okay?

271
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:09,877
Yeah. That’s it.

272
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:11,925
Yeah. That’s really good.

273
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:12,956
Keep it there.

274
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:14,467
Oh, that’s nice.

275
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:15,876
Looking good.

276
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:20,226
Keep moving.

277
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,845
That’s really good.

278
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,456
Yeah, hold it there.

279
00:15:32,713 --> 00:15:36,175
I’m feeling a bit worse
because of how hot it is out here.

280
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,719
I didn’t get much
sleep last night

281
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:41,551
since I came from
Avi’s birthday party.

282
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:45,126
Sam, you need to rest.

283
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:46,699
Maybe skip the gym today.

284
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:50,124
I can’t. The fashion
show’s coming up,

285
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,830
and I can’t afford
to miss a workout.

286
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:54,206
Are you sure?

287
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,541
Take some vitamins.

288
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:09,214
- Oh my gosh!
- What?

289
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,391
My cardholder is missing.

290
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,258
All my credit cards
were in there.

291
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:16,389
- Okay.
- Geez...

292
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:20,117
Maybe you just left it
somewhere, or forgot it.

293
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,610
I don’t remember
how and when I lost it.

294
00:16:26,622 --> 00:16:28,290
The last time
I brought it was—

295
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:31,685
I think I can take it from here.

296
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,205
I’ll go ahead.

297
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,470
Maybe I left it with him.

298
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:41,799
With who?

299
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:44,164
Oh, shit.

300
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:49,637
I wonder if this
is still his number.

301
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:52,181
It’s been a while
since I last called him.

302
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:54,242
All right, we’re going
to wrap up the shoot

303
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,539
so you can rest.

304
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,078
We’ll leave you here.

305
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:59,146
- Come on. Let’s go.
- Okay, okay.

306
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,580
Hello?

307
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,630
Hi.

308
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:21,446
It’s Sam.

309
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:22,848
Yeah, I know.

310
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:25,605
So...

311
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,716
He still has my
number saved, huh?

312
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:31,044
Sorry to bother you,

313
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:35,267
but did you happen to see a
cardholder the last time we met?

314
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,184
It’s a brown monogram—

315
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:38,352
Yes, I have it with me.

316
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:39,932
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

317
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:43,078
Thank goodness,
it fell into good hands.

318
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,573
Are you sure it did?

319
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,432
Stop fooling around.

320
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:50,602
I’ll just pick it up
later, okay?

321
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:53,535
I’ll text you before
I head to the hospital.

322
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:55,503
I’m going to the gym first,
hope that’s okay?

323
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:58,636
Or maybe I can
have my driver get it?

324
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,540
No. I’d rather you get it.

325
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:05,515
Okay... Okay.

326
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:41,970
I’m here at the hospital.
Where can I find you?

327
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:52,296
I have a lot
of patients right now.

328
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,449
I might not be able to reply,
but you can wait for me, if you like.

329
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,049
Just let me know where.

330
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:42,560
Sam.

331
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:45,438
Sam?

332
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:48,107
Sam!

333
00:19:50,151 --> 00:19:51,151
Hey.

334
00:19:52,936 --> 00:19:55,015
I’m sorry. I fell asleep.

335
00:19:56,314 --> 00:19:57,314
Um...

336
00:19:58,928 --> 00:19:59,929
Your cardholder.

337
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:04,832
I have to go now,
I still have a lot of patients.

338
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:06,894
Thanks.

339
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,168
Me too, I’m heading home.

340
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,419
Sam?

341
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:24,727
Oh my god.

342
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:01,310
What were you doing all day?

343
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:03,674
When did you start
feeling dizzy?

344
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:08,145
Well, I drank last night.

345
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,741
I woke up early
to go to a shoot.

346
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:14,193
I was under the sun for hours.

347
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:18,910
After that, I ate a salad
before heading to the gym.

348
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:21,926
I felt really tired, and...

349
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:23,494
went straight here.

350
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:27,748
Fell asleep while waiting,
and when I woke up,

351
00:21:27,748 --> 00:21:28,833
I felt sick.

352
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,377
Didn’t you drink enough water?

353
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:33,593
Didn’t I tell you?

354
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:36,663
Once you drink alcohol,
you get dehydrated.

355
00:21:38,221 --> 00:21:41,224
You’ve had enough,
believe me.

356
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:44,265
And you’ll get dehydrated,
that's bad for your kidneys.

357
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:48,018
Did you know your kidneys
filter the toxins in your body?

358
00:21:48,118 --> 00:21:50,079
Including alcohol, by the way.

359
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:53,491
So if you overdo it,
they’ll really get damaged.

360
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:56,986
You’re so cute when
you go all medical on me.

361
00:22:04,743 --> 00:22:05,995
You’ve got a really high fever.

362
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,124
You should take better care
of your health next time.

363
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:12,260
Okay.

364
00:22:12,922 --> 00:22:14,673
All right, I still have
patients to see.

365
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,488
Um, I’ll just come back later
with your meds.

366
00:22:19,892 --> 00:22:21,435
There’s also food
and water here.

367
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,265
Wait, where are we?

368
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Um...

369
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:34,846
We’re still at the hospital.

370
00:22:35,024 --> 00:22:37,735
You’re in my study
and sleeping quarters.

371
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,136
My parents gave it to me.

372
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:42,876
But don’t worry,
just make yourself comfortable.

373
00:22:43,332 --> 00:22:44,340
Hmm...

374
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:45,365
And here.

375
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:48,897
Wear this so you don’t get cold.

376
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:50,706
Thank you, Cy.

377
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,336
I mean, thank you, Doc.

378
00:22:56,587 --> 00:22:58,380
All right, get some rest.
I have to go now.

379
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:20,808
There really are perks
to being the owner’s kid.

380
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:24,156
This place feels so him.

381
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:26,715
He’s still so organized.

382
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:48,744
I wasn’t there when
you achieved your goals.

383
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:54,270
Now I remember why
we had to break up.

384
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:58,565
You needed to be
the doctor that you are now.

385
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:02,800
So this is your
future without me.

386
00:24:03,737 --> 00:24:05,656
I’m proud of you
and happy for you.

387
00:24:20,555 --> 00:24:21,555
Wait,

388
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:24,344
all of these
are my covers.

389
00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:26,373
He has them?

390
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,647
Why?

391
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:16,545
Hey…

392
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:19,021
- Are you okay?
- Just rest.

393
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:20,647
You’re sick.

394
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:23,398
Uh...

395
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,315
Are you comfortable
having me here?

396
00:25:26,445 --> 00:25:29,281
I can sleep on the couch.
You can stay here on the—

397
00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:31,884
A kid died, Sam.

398
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:36,309
I’m sorry.

399
00:25:38,698 --> 00:25:40,105
She was close to me.

400
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:45,255
When I visited her room,

401
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,610
she was already having
trouble breathing.

402
00:25:47,907 --> 00:25:50,159
And then she,

403
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,929
she was already—

404
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:54,476
I’m sorry.

405
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,963
Is this your first time
witnessing someone’s death?

406
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,644
No.

407
00:26:05,229 --> 00:26:08,273
This usually happens
with critical patients.

408
00:26:11,949 --> 00:26:13,117
But kids…

409
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,870
seeing them suffer

410
00:26:17,813 --> 00:26:20,524
is something
I’ll never get used to.

411
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:24,503
That’s why I wanted
to quit in the first place.

412
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:31,427
Cy, you can’t save everyone.

413
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:35,013
Yeah, but,

414
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,724
as long as we still can,

415
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:43,214
as long as we’re able,
we can’t give up.

416
00:26:44,606 --> 00:26:46,400
Someone's life is on the line.

417
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:49,820
It’s not something we can
just let go of that easily.

418
00:26:53,157 --> 00:26:56,243
Keep going for those
you can save, Cy.

419
00:26:58,537 --> 00:27:01,021
For those you can heal and help.

420
00:27:02,124 --> 00:27:03,876
That’s how it should be, right?

421
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:05,402
That’s why you became a doctor.

422
00:27:06,336 --> 00:27:08,213
Remember why you started.

423
00:27:09,923 --> 00:27:10,971
Thanks, Sam.

424
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:21,304
Anyway, you look tired.

425
00:27:22,347 --> 00:27:24,850
I’ve been awake
for 38 hours now.

426
00:27:26,023 --> 00:27:27,858
So you really need to rest.

427
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:29,860
Actually, you need it more.

428
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,528
You need to rest now.

429
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:34,239
I still have a lot
of paperwork to finish.

430
00:27:45,804 --> 00:27:47,347
Go on, get some rest.

431
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:49,212
I’m okay.

432
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,741
Okay.

433
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:51,024
Cy, I’m ready to go.

434
00:28:52,545 --> 00:28:53,545
Oh...

435
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:00,951
You didn’t use my cards
or anything, right?

436
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:02,919
Excuse me?

437
00:29:03,637 --> 00:29:06,598
Well, when I said it fell
into good hands,

438
00:29:06,623 --> 00:29:09,028
you said,
“Are you sure it did?”

439
00:29:09,668 --> 00:29:12,040
So I was just thinking,
maybe you bought something

440
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:14,372
with the cards, you know?

441
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:17,197
If I were to use your cards,

442
00:29:17,676 --> 00:29:20,679
I’d use them to buy
food for our dogs.

443
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:23,849
Of course, their mom’s gotta
contribute too, right?

444
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:27,352
Our dogs?

445
00:29:29,187 --> 00:29:31,481
So, who’s taking care of them?

446
00:29:31,797 --> 00:29:32,797
Colin.

447
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:35,102
Okay.

448
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:36,544
All right, I’ll go ahead.

449
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:40,115
We can meet up again soon
so I can return your sweater.

450
00:29:40,215 --> 00:29:41,967
I promise, I’ll have it
washed first.

451
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:43,492
Okay.

452
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,937
Hey, um, thanks for listening to me.

453
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:48,707
I just really needed
someone to talk to.

454
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,834
Thank you for taking care of me.

455
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:57,215
It’s nice to have someone
to remind me

456
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,368
to take care of myself
once in a while.

457
00:30:00,427 --> 00:30:02,220
Take care of yourself,
too, okay?

458
00:30:02,245 --> 00:30:03,246
Yeah, of course.

459
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:05,015
I’ll see you soon.

460
00:30:05,974 --> 00:30:06,974
Maui.

461
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:09,435
Yes?

462
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:12,481
Do you have a boyfriend?

463
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,956
Why would he even ask this?

464
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,574
Maybe he saw
the rumors online?

465
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:20,739
I don’t.

466
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,591
And Avi’s not my child,

467
00:30:22,616 --> 00:30:24,743
she’s my best friend’s daughter.

468
00:30:26,995 --> 00:30:29,578
- Okay.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

469
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:33,560
Do you really think
I have the time

470
00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:35,342
to entertain somebody else?

471
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:40,842
Okay. I’ll go now.
Thank you.

472
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:41,867
Okay.

473
00:30:42,844 --> 00:30:43,844
Take care.

474
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:45,597
You too.

475
00:30:56,693 --> 00:30:58,669
Maison Lorent captivated the fashion world

476
00:30:58,694 --> 00:31:01,073
with its latest collection
during New York Fashion Week.

477
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:03,507
The runway featured powerful
silhouettes in black,

478
00:31:03,532 --> 00:31:05,283
from sharp tailored coats

479
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:07,936
to sheer layering
and sculpted tulle minis.

480
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,305
Critics praised the collection as

481
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,947
“confident, minimalist,
and unapologetically modern,”

482
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,391
with Maison Lorent once
again proving its place

483
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,002
- at the forefront of high fashion.
- I love the volume on the hair.

484
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:19,959
Great work. Stay relaxed.

485
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:24,886
Still feeling nervous?

486
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:29,725
You know, everyone wants you
to walk their shows.

487
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:33,172
I’m serious. What?
This has been the...

488
00:31:33,645 --> 00:31:35,385
nth time you’ve worked for us?

489
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,108
Did you bring a companion?

490
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:40,067
To watch you?

491
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:41,653
A beau, perhaps?

492
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,179
Maui.

493
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:45,615
Yes?

494
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,142
Do you have a boyfriend?

495
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:50,906
It’s just me.

496
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:52,998
Oh, come on.

497
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:55,851
Why don’t you find
a New Yorker boyfriend

498
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:57,160
when you move over here?

499
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:00,630
Anyone would be
happy to have you.

500
00:32:02,774 --> 00:32:04,693
Anyway, Sam.
You’re going to do great.

501
00:32:04,718 --> 00:32:06,136
This is New York Fashion Week.

502
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:07,621
Let’s make it happen, okay?

503
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:09,644
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

504
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:13,538
This is it, Sam.

505
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:15,526
Your biggest show so far.

506
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:17,390
You got this.

507
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:18,647
Thank you.

508
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,259
Models, let’s go!

509
00:32:20,358 --> 00:32:21,860
Five minutes to show time!

510
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,307
Let’s go!

511
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:53,279
Sam, focus on your walk.

512
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,658
One step at a time.

513
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,732
And most importantly,
enjoy! Yeah.

514
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:18,558
And if I’m not in the audience
and you’re nervous,

515
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:23,399
just imagine I’m there yelling
and cheering for you.

516
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:26,511
Guys, let’s go! Line up.

517
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:41,000
We’re live on broadcast
and streaming.

518
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:42,816
First look—

519
00:33:43,608 --> 00:33:44,608
Go.

520
00:34:31,874 --> 00:34:34,182
I’ll always be your
number one fan, Sam.

521
00:34:36,872 --> 00:34:38,498
Samantha Vera, let’s go!

522
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,318
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

523
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,678
I’m glad you liked it.

524
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,747
Sam, great job. High-five!

525
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:23,186
- Great job.
- Thank you.

526
00:36:23,211 --> 00:36:24,371
You looked amazing out there.

527
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:28,775
Haze! What are you doing here?

528
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:31,416
This is definitely
not your thing.

529
00:36:31,935 --> 00:36:33,353
How did you end up here?

530
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:36,341
Well, a friend invited me.

531
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,667
Who am I to turn it down, right?

532
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,174
- Here.
- Wow, thank you.

533
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,371
You’re so sweet.

534
00:36:47,182 --> 00:36:50,809
Makes me wonder if
you’re already falling for me.

535
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,340
Sorry to disappoint you,

536
00:36:59,411 --> 00:37:03,041
but I don’t fall for people who
are busy falling for their ex.

537
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:05,245
Wait, what?

538
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:08,416
Am I that transparent?

539
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:11,561
Am I the only one
in denial that I still love Cy?

540
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,861
I’ll be right back.

541
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:21,961
I just have to talk to a friend.

542
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:23,947
Okay. I’ll see you later.

543
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:45,094
Slay! So proud
of you @itsamantha!

544
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:48,014
That’s my BFF!
She owned the runway!

545
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,959
So proud of you, auntie.

546
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:52,560
Good thing
you didn’t trip!

547
00:37:52,585 --> 00:37:54,604
Congrats, Sam! Slay!

548
00:37:54,629 --> 00:37:58,720
So beautiful!
A goddess!

549
00:38:00,826 --> 00:38:02,912
Couldn’t be
prouder of you, Sam!

550
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:14,522
Did he watch?

551
00:38:18,044 --> 00:38:21,172
I guess it’s fine
if I check his stories.

552
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:22,924
After all,

553
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:25,206
we didn’t even
unfollow each other.

554
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:51,246
How hard is it to say,
“you did good”?

555
00:38:52,078 --> 00:38:54,622
A congratulatory message
wouldn’t hurt.

556
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:36,443
Wear this so
you don’t get cold.

557
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:43,521
It’s so silly of me to admit,

558
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,900
but I really do miss him.

559
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:57,336
Hi. I’m back in Manila.

560
00:39:57,718 --> 00:40:00,131
I’m free tomorrow
to return your sweater.

561
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,875
I won’t be at
the hospital tomorrow,

562
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,666
but we can meet somewhere else.

563
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,801
I’m going to see him tomorrow!

564
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:16,307
Cy. I miss y—

565
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,072
Let me know.

566
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:27,256
Oh no.

567
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,966
I didn’t mean to send that!

568
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:30,718
How to unsend?

569
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:12,093
It’s okay to be afraid.
Everyone’s afraid of pain.

570
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:15,760
He’s here. Yay!

571
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:16,948
Well, does it hurt?

572
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:18,197
Before I forget…

573
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:21,519
You can keep it.

574
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:24,271
What?

575
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:27,231
Then why did you
agree to meet me?

576
00:41:27,398 --> 00:41:28,733
Isn’t it obvious?

577
00:41:30,152 --> 00:41:31,362
I wanted to see you.

578
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,173
You and Haze are trending.

579
00:41:34,198 --> 00:41:36,779
Your photos during the
fashion show are circulating.

580
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:37,826
Special delivery.

581
00:41:38,313 --> 00:41:39,606
Do you have a girlfriend, Cy?

582
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:42,524
Not looking for one.

583
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:46,039
Sucks to be single, huh?

584
00:41:48,379 --> 00:41:49,797
Watch your words, man.

585
00:41:51,424 --> 00:41:53,968
I can’t believe we’re
doing yoga right now.

586
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:57,179
Screw you.

587
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,850
Screw all of you!

588
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,163
I felt so alone and left out.
