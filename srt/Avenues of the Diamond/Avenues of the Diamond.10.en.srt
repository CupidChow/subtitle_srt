1
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:18,268
I think this might be
the start of our busy era.

2
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,271
We promised to have our regular
date every Sunday, right?

3
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,627
I know you’re a Ramirez.

4
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,279
But lives are on the line here.

5
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,696
It’s our date night.

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,905
Do you still want to go?

7
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,616
Should we skip? 'Cause I’m sleepy.

8
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,326
Isn’t Clyden gonna look for you?

9
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,245
Don’t you guys
have a celebration today?

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,083
How’s your therapy lately?

11
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,793
Are you taking your meds?

12
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,253
What more do you want from me?

13
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,780
Is it true?

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,674
The accusations against you?

15
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,342
You benefited
from my money, too!

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,345
It’s not good to act out
on your emotions, Maui.

17
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,425
You don’t know a thing about
what I’m going through right now,

18
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,619
so don’t act
all high and mighty!

19
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,666
Auntie—

20
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,739
I’ll make this short.

21
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:10,558
Cy has a brighter
future ahead of him.

22
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,864
I just don’t want him
getting dragged

23
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,699
into your family’s mess.

24
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:19,025
Some goodbyes hurt
more than others.

25
00:01:19,307 --> 00:01:21,222
Because you don’t want to let go,

26
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,166
but you know that you have to

27
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,087
even if you want
to keep holding on.

28
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,965
These past few weeks,

29
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,051
I’ve had to say
some of the hardest

30
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,447
and most painful
goodbyes of my life.

31
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,692
So please, as a mother,

32
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,361
I’m begging you,

33
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,947
stop the engagement.

34
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,868
He only agreed
with everything because

35
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,829
he didn’t want you
to end up with Charles.

36
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:03,498
Huh?

37
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,791
Yeah, because when
they were younger,

38
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,417
Charles used to beat him up.

39
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,504
And maybe he was scared that

40
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,089
the same thing
might happen to you.

41
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:13,024
You know,

42
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,712
Cy has the softest heart
among my children

43
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,887
despite his tough attitude.

44
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,432
He might be acting based
on his emotions right now.

45
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,393
He loves you so much

46
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,728
that he might even
end up helping your father.

47
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,150
Even though your father is
the person he hates the most.

48
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,406
Auntie, I understand
what you’re saying—

49
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,869
but please, give me some time.

50
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,830
Everything’s just too much
for me right now.

51
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,708
So I hope you can
understand me too.

52
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,836
Of course. I’ll let you
think about it.

53
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,462
I have to go.

54
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,424
I’m so sorry I have to
drag you with all of this.

55
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,552
I just want the best for my son,

56
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,138
and I know you want
the same for him.

57
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,945
I understand.

58
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,794
How long will we let
these corrupt politicians

59
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,463
- run and destroy our country?
- How can we still trust

60
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,882
- a family with issues like this?
- Senator Vera doesn’t

61
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,050
- deserve to be in power.
- The Vera family

62
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,134
will never change.

63
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,761
Look at their kids,

64
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,847
they’re the next generation
of thieves and corrupt officials!

65
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,515
Sam Vera is my schoolmate.

66
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,850
She’s a party girl.

67
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,061
What a shame if it turns out
she was using taxpayer money

68
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,978
to fund her lifestyle!

69
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,897
This family has
so many issues!

70
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,775
Is it true that Senator Vera
has a child out of wedlock?

71
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,027
Word is, the kid’s living
in their mansion,

72
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,654
but they’re being
quiet about it.

73
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,530
They belong in jail,
not in the Senate!

74
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,244
Auntie Jaida is right.

75
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,329
I have to protect him.

76
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,414
I’ll never forgive myself

77
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,251
if he gets dragged
into my family’s issues.

78
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,670
I...

79
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,047
I have to let him go.

80
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,717
Hi, love.

81
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,968
Hi.

82
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,725
Can we talk?

83
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,896
I can’t.

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,773
I need to rest.

85
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,901
There were a lot
of patients earlier.

86
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,237
I love you.

87
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,664
This hurts more than
I ever thought it would.

88
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,042
But I have to do this.

89
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,961
Even if I don’t want to.

90
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,463
Even if it breaks me.

91
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,510
This is for your own sake.
For your future.

92
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,307
A future where
I’m no longer with you.

93
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,405
Hello, Sam. I hope
I’m not disturbing you,

94
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,157
but Naomi is still
missing her sessions.

95
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,034
I’m worried about her.

96
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,703
I heard about what happened
to your family.

97
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,126
Thank you
for informing me, Doc.

98
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,002
I’ll check on her.

99
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,800
I think this is
the illegitimate child.

100
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,593
She was spotted in
the same neighborhood

101
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,137
as the Vera residence.

102
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,934
OMG, I know her!
She goes to my school!

103
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,981
They say her mom died
from drowning.

104
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,607
I don’t even know if
it was really an accident

105
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,775
or something more.

106
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,819
What a super
scandalous family!

107
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,766
Cy?

108
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,604
Are you awake?

109
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,011
Naomi, are you there?

110
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,223
Leave me alone, Sam.
Just go away!

111
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:39,185
No, I’m not leaving.
I told you, didn’t I?

112
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,812
Open the door.
Let’s talk, please.

113
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,190
I don’t want to!
Stop pitying me,

114
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,566
I’m not some charity case!

115
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,403
What did Mom
tell you this time, huh?

116
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,116
Naomi, I’m your sister, and
I want to take care of you.

117
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,285
I’ve never treated you
as a charity case.

118
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,502
Naomi, I love you, okay?

119
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,296
You don’t deserve
to be caught up in this.

120
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,970
You’re still young, and
I want you to be happy.

121
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,806
So please,
don’t push me away.

122
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,059
Let’s fight for each other.

123
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,811
Naomi.

124
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,695
Naomi?

125
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,906
Naomi, open the door!
I’m worried about you!

126
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,285
Naomi!

127
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,454
Naomi, please.

128
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,540
Please open the door—

129
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:29,450
Naomi.

130
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,594
Please, just leave, Sam.

131
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,806
No. I told you that
I will be with you

132
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,475
throughout your healing process.

133
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,185
I’m not leaving.

134
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,356
You don’t understand.

135
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,775
You don’t understand because
no one is talking shit about you

136
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,310
for just being the daughter
of your father.

137
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:55,546
Every time I’m at school,

138
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,239
people keep staring at me.

139
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,742
And you’re no different, Sam.

140
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,120
You’re looking at me
with the same eyes.

141
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,761
Naomi—

142
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:07,706
And don’t even try to sound
like you understand.

143
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,794
My face is all over
the internet.

144
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,295
They even brought up
my mom’s death.

145
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,422
Why is this happening to me?

146
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,592
Why should I suffer?

147
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,679
I never asked to be born.

148
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,349
I didn’t ask for
all of this. So, why?

149
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,276
I’m sorry.

150
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:28,501
I’m sorry, Naomi.
You don’t deserve any of this.

151
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,523
I deserve this.

152
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,150
My mom died because of me.

153
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,486
I deserve this.
I deserve everything.

154
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,757
No, you don’t. Naomi…

155
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,216
It hurts. Why does
it always hurt?

156
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,976
I always feel sorry for living.

157
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,044
Why do I have to suffer when
all I want is to be happy?

158
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,964
I shouldn’t have left my room.

159
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,999
I should’ve stayed in my place.

160
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,992
I shouldn’t have hoped
things would get better.

161
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:01,565
Naomi—

162
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:09,437
I’m right here, Naomi.
Lean on me.

163
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,065
I wish I had never been born.

164
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,985
I wish my mom
had lived instead of me.

165
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,281
My father hid me like a monster.

166
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,909
You denied me
in front of your friends.

167
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,370
I felt so ashamed.

168
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,874
Why did I have
to live like this?

169
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,335
Why didn’t I just die

170
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,172
if this is the kind of life
she was going to leave me with?

171
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,633
I tried everything.

172
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,844
I tried pleasing your parents.

173
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,014
I followed and did
everything they wanted.

174
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,807
I even took Political Science,

175
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,143
even though that
wasn’t really what I wanted.

176
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,898
I made friends, and yet
they betrayed me.

177
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,317
Nothing good
ever happens in my life,

178
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,027
your mom was right—

179
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,780
I bring misfortune
to everyone’s life.

180
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,617
I could never be happy.

181
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,911
It feels like a sin to be happy.

182
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,247
Am I just not allowed
to be happy, Sam?

183
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,000
Naomi, stop. Please.

184
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,504
Do you remember
what you told me?

185
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,882
You’re worth more than
what they say.

186
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,259
Don’t listen to her.

187
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,887
You are worth
more than what she said.

188
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,973
So, just focus on doing
things for yourself, okay?

189
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,519
Don’t believe what my mom says.

190
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,479
Don’t believe what people say.

191
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,190
They don’t know anything
about your life, Naomi.

192
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,942
So let’s fight back.

193
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,531
We can do this without them.

194
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,991
Just the two of us,
we’ve got this.

195
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:49,862
Stop.

196
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:53,039
Stop making me hope again.

197
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:56,297
Things never get better
as long as I’m alive.

198
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,882
Everyone around me will suffer.

199
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,176
Please, Naomi.

200
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,011
Please don’t push me away.

201
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,181
Didn’t I tell you?
No matter what happens,

202
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,475
I will always be here for you.

203
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,727
And I’m not suffering
because of you.

204
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,980
No one is suffering
because of you.

205
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,649
Hope.

206
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,734
Yes.

207
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,987
Yes, hope.

208
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,239
There is hope, Naomi.

209
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,410
Sam,

210
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,288
be free.

211
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,542
Naomi, come with me.

212
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,211
I’ll take care of everything
you need. Trust me.

213
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,671
I will do some things

214
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,007
so we can get through this
without anyone’s help.

215
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,385
I’m sorry.

216
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,805
Why? Why are you saying sorry?

217
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,516
Don’t you want to come with me?

218
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,895
Naomi, I won’t leave
here until you do.

219
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,023
So, please. Just trust me.

220
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,361
Come here.

221
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,055
How’s your sleep?

222
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,891
I’m okay. I’ve been
sleeping fine, Sam.

223
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,934
That’s good.

224
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,358
Wow, you broke them perfectly.

225
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,068
I practiced a lot.

226
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,945
I’m excited to eat.

227
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,405
Let’s make a lot
so the dogs can eat too.

228
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,616
Of course, we’re all
eating together, okay?

229
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,619
It feels so good
to be back here.

230
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,997
I feel so happy
you’re back here.

231
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,666
Just feel at home, okay?

232
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,211
You’ll always have
a home here, always.

233
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,837
Thank you, Sam.

234
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,881
By the way, where’s Cy?

235
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,091
I haven’t seen him around.

236
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,010
He’s busy.

237
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,929
He has a lot
on his plate right now.

238
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,850
How about you?
How have you been?

239
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,686
I haven’t asked you yet…

240
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:23,357
I know we’re both affected
by the news about our dad.

241
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,112
Thank you for asking,
but I’m okay, Naomi.

242
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,782
Whatever happens,
I’ll make it through.

243
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,242
We’ll make it through.

244
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,952
As long as we’re together,

245
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,829
we can get through
anything, okay?

246
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,457
Thank you, really.

247
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,627
For letting me stay here.
For everything you’ve done.

248
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,045
It’s only now that I’ve felt

249
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,214
what it’s like to be
treated like family.

250
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,300
I wish I had known this sooner.

251
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,137
I wish I had let you
into my life earlier.

252
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,181
You’ll always have
a family with me.

253
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,018
You don’t ever have
to worry about that.

254
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,271
You’re the best sister
in the world.

255
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,539
Jeez…

256
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,441
Well, I am your only sister.

257
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,153
Now that we’re living together,

258
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,574
we can do this more often
in the future, right?

259
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,994
By the way,

260
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,037
can you please help me

261
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,039
with my hair
and makeup tomorrow?

262
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,791
It’s because
I have a photoshoot.

263
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,878
Of course!

264
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,547
It’s an honor to do
your hair and makeup.

265
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,916
Okay.

266
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,162
What happened?

267
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,173
I didn’t mean to.

268
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,866
Can I see?

269
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,144
Wait, let me help you.

270
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,065
Just hold it like that.

271
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,078
Put some pressure.

272
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,491
You okay?

273
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,902
- Yeah.
- Okay.

274
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,235
It’s okay. Accidents happen.

275
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:36,804
All right,
I’ll take care of this.

276
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,159
No, that’s okay.
I can still do it myself.

277
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,620
- Sure?
- Yeah. I just—

278
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:43,205
Okay.

279
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,414
Be careful.

280
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,207
Yeah.

281
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,667
If you need help,
I’m right here.

282
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,885
Okay.

283
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,975
Let me see.

284
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,768
Let me see your makeup.

285
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,270
You look good.

286
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,814
Nice. I love it.

287
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,940
You’re so good.

288
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,904
New details emerge in
Senator Vera’s plunder case,

289
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,532
including offshore
accounts tied to him.

290
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,742
Meanwhile, rumors of
an illegitimate child

291
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,954
add to the growing controversies
surrounding his family.

292
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:29,717
I’m going to Mom this afternoon.

293
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,549
Okay. Do you need
money to go there?

294
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,010
No, I’m good.
Don’t worry about me.

295
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,974
I’m so proud of you, Sam.

296
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,561
This is just
the beginning for you.

297
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,396
You’re going to be
a big star soon.

298
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,515
You too.

299
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,111
You’re already
a star in my eyes.

300
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,990
Everything I have now
is because of you.

301
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,160
Everything I do,
you’re part of it.

302
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,705
I even got the confidence
to be a model

303
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,373
with your help.

304
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,252
And when I become
a bigger model soon,

305
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,088
I’ll get you as my makeup
artist and photographer.

306
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,285
I wish.

307
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,972
You're going to be a great model

308
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,184
even without me as your
photographer and makeup artist.

309
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,645
It’s just a matter of time.

310
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,396
You’re becoming more confident

311
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,565
working with
other photographers now.

312
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,194
And if I’m not there with you,

313
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,073
just imagine I’m the one
taking your pictures

314
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,491
when you feel shy.

315
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,869
Okay, I will.

316
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,374
And if I’m not in the audience
and you’re nervous,

317
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:55,295
just imagine I’m there
yelling and cheering for you.

318
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,633
I’ll always be your
number one fan, Sam.

319
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,722
Thank you.

320
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,530
Okay, I won’t be
able to finish this.

321
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,531
I have to go.

322
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,283
Bye, Naomi.

323
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,368
Bye.

324
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,581
Sam!

325
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,918
Goodbye.

326
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,715
I’ll see you later.

327
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:52,636
Cy…

328
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,444
What happened to you?

329
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,239
Did you have a fight
with someone?

330
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,657
Wait, let’s get
that treated.

331
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,950
- Hold on.
- Don’t bother.

332
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,329
It’s not a big deal.

333
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,831
It’s just a fight
between brothers.

334
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,671
I need to rest now.

335
00:22:25,101 --> 00:22:26,158
Cy—

336
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,850
Can we talk now, please?

337
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,439
Sam, listen to me.

338
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,444
No matter what happens,

339
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,529
I’ll stay with you, okay?

340
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:48,014
I am marrying you.

341
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,995
Why are you still
fighting for us?

342
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,955
Because, I love you.

343
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,292
I love you, Sam.

344
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,670
No matter what,
no matter when.

345
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,674
I’m not giving up
on you just like that.

346
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,098
Okay?

347
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,663
Her dad’s corrupt.

348
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,416
I know, right?
I even saw it on the news.

349
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,042
Do you think she’s the same?

350
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,210
Well, what do you expect?

351
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,422
The fruit doesn’t fall
far from the tree.

352
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,134
Oh come on, girl,
let’s not be so judgmental.

353
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,512
Sam’s nice, but her sister?

354
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,680
Nevermind.

355
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,608
Okay, guys, let’s take
a five-minute break.

356
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,792
Hey, how are you?

357
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,296
Let me know when
you’re home. Love you!

358
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,718
Why hasn’t she
replied to me yet?

359
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:33,477
Don’t worry, Sam.
She’s fine.

360
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,018
But it’s already late,
maybe she’s home by now?

361
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,587
Did something happen?

362
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,591
- Hello?
- Naomi, where are you?

363
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,871
Hello?

364
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:03,631
Hello?

365
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:04,628
I’ll...

366
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,359
I’ll stay at my friend’s house,
since it’s already late.

367
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:10,177
Don’t worry about me.

368
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,094
Are you sure you're okay?

369
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,930
You know, I can pick you up.

370
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,974
Hello? Naomi?

371
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,643
Are you still there?

372
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,397
Yes. I’m okay, Sam.

373
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,942
I just want to hang out
with my friends for now.

374
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,487
We’re just stargazing.

375
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,864
The stars are so beautiful.

376
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,034
The stars are so bright.

377
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,703
But they feel so far away.

378
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,830
It’s like they’re shining,

379
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,792
but you can never
really reach nor touch them.

380
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,461
I need to go, Sam. Bye.

381
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,839
Okay. Enjoy your time there.

382
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,676
I love you, Sam.

383
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,917
I love you too, Naomi.

384
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,603
Okay, guys, let’s resume.

385
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,175
Thank you, Sam.

386
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:35,281
Thank you.

387
00:26:35,306 --> 00:26:36,630
- Thank you, Sam.
- Thank you, Sam.

388
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:37,692
Thank you.

389
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:43,910
Hello? Naomi?

390
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,145
Ma’am,

391
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,646
she’s gone.

392
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,524
Last night, she slept here.

393
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:53,361
But when I was going to
ask her what she wanted to eat,

394
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,614
she was already unconscious.

395
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,651
What do you mean?

396
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,662
Ma’am...

397
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,846
No way.

398
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,890
Ma’am...

399
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,416
No way.

400
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:11,046
I called an ambulance,
but it was too late, Ma’am.

401
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,424
They said Naomi wasn’t breathing
anymore when they got here.

402
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,389
I wanna go there.

403
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:23,975
Where?

404
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,979
To the moon.
Or just beside it.

405
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,191
I wanna be one of the stars.

406
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,362
Do you think
there’s pain there, Sam?

407
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,532
I’m not sure,
but I hope there’s none.

408
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,868
Thank you for making me happy,

409
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,079
even for a short period of time.

410
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,115
Sam!

411
00:27:47,188 --> 00:27:48,397
Goodbye.

412
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,020
Naomi.

413
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,815
Naomi.

414
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,123
There’s so many of you!

415
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,960
But not one of you noticed!

416
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,380
None of you
were doing your jobs!

417
00:29:18,477 --> 00:29:20,692
None of you even noticed
that the girl’s gone!

418
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,375
Naomi’s gone!

419
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,846
Get out of my sight, all of you!

420
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,959
- I’m sorry.
- We’re sorry, ma’am.

421
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:28,372
Damn it!

422
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,059
No one wanted this to happen.

423
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,078
Shit!

424
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,485
Shit, Naomi.

425
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,991
Naomi…

426
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,407
I’m sorry.

427
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,912
Oh my god, I’m sorry.

428
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,665
I’m sorry.

429
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,714
Sam—

430
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,007
Naomi.

431
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:27,960
Naomi, how can I live now?

432
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,715
How can I live without you now?

433
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,982
I’m sorry.

434
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:43,445
I’m sorry.

435
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,561
I can’t believe
this is happening, Yanna.

436
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,287
I hope this is just a dream.

437
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,537
I wish I could just wake up
from this nightmare.

438
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,997
Please, Yanna.

439
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,916
Yanna…

440
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,504
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

441
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,425
I’m sorry.

442
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,724
You can get some rest now.

443
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,102
You’ve been the one
handling almost everything.

444
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,069
It’s the least
I can do for Naomi.

445
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,782
‘Cause she suffered a lot.

446
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,292
I’m here if you need me, okay?

447
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,380
I would look good in this.

448
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:43,435
This one?

449
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,420
Yeah. Go try a different pose.

450
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,613
Let’s just take a selfie.

451
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,761
Hi.

452
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,724
How do I start this?

453
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,313
If you’re watching this,
I’m probably—

454
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,273
Nevermind.

455
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,691
Hi, Sam.

456
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,569
I miss you.

457
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,239
Of course, this video
is for you, dummy.

458
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,243
I’m here to ask if you have
already improved your walk.

459
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,120
Just kidding.

460
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:47,001
I don’t know how it would
sound less painful for you.

461
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,296
If ever you’re crying right now,

462
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,507
stop it or you won’t
be able to focus

463
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,508
on what I’m about to say.

464
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,051
So, okay…

465
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,767
Sam,

466
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:09,148
I’m sorry I pushed you away
a lot of times

467
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,860
when all you wanted
was to save me.

468
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,949
So, please stop acting
like you care about me.

469
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,201
I really care about you, Naomi.

470
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:26,415
I never really wanted
to push you away or hurt you.

471
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,336
What the hell is wrong with you?

472
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,760
Thank you.

473
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,512
But I was afraid

474
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,850
that being with me would be
more painful for you.

475
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,526
The death of my mom
still lives inside me.

476
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,196
The guilt from it.

477
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,031
I have been living my life

478
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,867
with nothing but pain.

479
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,706
I was in the darkness
for a really long time.

480
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,877
A lot of times,
I compared myself to you.

481
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,630
Actually, I envied you.

482
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,967
Naomi, if you want more makeup,

483
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,552
you can ask me for some.

484
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,096
I don’t need you
to buy me makeup, okay?

485
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,139
Now, leave.

486
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,518
I wanted to have
everything you had.

487
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,522
I have always thought
that you’re so lucky

488
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,608
because you have everything.

489
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,819
That’s why I was mad at you.

490
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,699
I was such a lonely kid.

491
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,371
I had been suffering for
so many years now until—

492
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,249
until that day.

493
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,543
Naomi? Naomi?

494
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,544
Help!

495
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,879
- Naomi?
- Naomi?

496
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,343
You were so persistent
that I had to let you in.

497
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,427
And you know what?

498
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,221
You made me so happy.

499
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,020
You made me explore
so many things.

500
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,856
You helped me heal.

501
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,652
You never left my side.

502
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,989
You were there for me
when no one else was.

503
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,995
You became my mother-figure—

504
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,791
and I couldn’t thank you
enough for that.

505
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,127
You were my hope.

506
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,630
You were my only hope.

507
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,676
If you’re still blaming
yourself for what happened,

508
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,136
please know that you did enough.

509
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,596
You were more than enough

510
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,139
at some point,

511
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,142
I felt like I wanted
to get through it.

512
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,478
You made me stronger,

513
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,523
but there were still times
when I would break down

514
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,650
no matter how happy I was.

515
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,902
It wasn’t because of you.

516
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,446
Do not blame yourself.

517
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,950
Do not live like me.

518
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:11,163
That feeling is the feeling
I had to bear for so many years.

519
00:38:12,752 --> 00:38:15,099
Sam, I already told you this,

520
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,546
but you will become
a great model someday.

521
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:23,577
Please, live for
yourself this time.

522
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:25,636
Choose yourself,

523
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,139
because I know
you’re completely drained.

524
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,768
Do the things you want
and be happy.

525
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:35,593
Genuinely happy.

526
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,097
I’m saying this now,

527
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:21,859
and I will never get tired
of repeating this up there,

528
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:23,400
in the sky.

529
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,690
I am so proud of you.

530
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:32,775
I am now a star, and
I will shine bright for you.

531
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,540
Look up when you miss me,

532
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,959
and I will look down
when I miss you.

533
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,421
I love you, Sam.

534
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,387
Hi, what’s your name?

535
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,971
Naomi.

536
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,974
I’m Sam, do you want to borrow?

537
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,727
Here, you can play with her.

538
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,563
Do you like her?

539
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,316
My mom gave her to me,

540
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,235
that’s why I always
bring her around.

541
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,528
She’s a model.

542
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,279
She’s so pretty, right?

543
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,199
You’re so pretty, too!
Are you a model?

544
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,828
I’m not. But someday,
I will be one.

545
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,084
Let’s play.

546
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,517
You asked me if
I think there’s pain there.

547
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:41,355
I hope not.
I hope there is none.

548
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,190
And here, too.

549
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,611
I could only
wish that you didn’t leave.

550
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,937
I love you, my brightest star.

551
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,221
I’m sorry, I wasn’t there.

552
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,682
I’m sorry you had
to go through this alone.

553
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,726
It’s okay.

554
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,230
It was my choice
not to tell you.

555
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,732
How did you know though?

556
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,610
Your mom called.

557
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,154
She told me to check on you.

558
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,198
You weren’t answering her calls.

559
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,413
Cy, can we talk now?

560
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,844
We can’t.

561
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,966
No. Let’s talk now.

562
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,759
Stop avoiding it.

563
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,886
We both know
where we’ll end up—

564
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,638
Married, Maureen.

565
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,640
That’s where we’ll end up.

566
00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:43,420
Cy, please.

567
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,230
Let’s end this.

568
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,648
Please.

569
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,150
Maui, you’re just tired.

570
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:52,778
We can talk about this
some other time.

571
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,321
- Clyden!
- Sam! Fuck!

572
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,575
I will never leave you.

573
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,412
If you don’t want me
anymore, I don’t care!

574
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,583
Even if you push me away
or try to make me leave—

575
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,251
I’ll stick with you

576
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:09,842
because that’s
what I promised you.

577
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,799
So, please,

578
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,594
stop telling me to end this.

579
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,597
It’s not going to happen.

580
00:43:28,827 --> 00:43:30,204
I was using you.

581
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,075
My mom told me to stay with you

582
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,161
‘cause we needed
your family to save me.

583
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:46,915
I had to hold on to you
to secure my future.

584
00:43:49,741 --> 00:43:51,325
But now, I realized that

585
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:54,145
I want to secure my own
future without your help.

586
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,301
I want to live for myself now.

587
00:44:01,748 --> 00:44:02,916
Use me, then.

588
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,452
What?

589
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,103
Use me. I don’t care, Sam.

590
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,317
Use me. Just don’t
leave me, please?

591
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,369
How can I use you

592
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,871
when your father already took
the inheritance away from you?

593
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,167
I don’t have a secure
future with you anymore.

594
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:35,023
I don’t want you anymore.

595
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,135
You’re nothing without
your family’s money.

596
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,680
What?

597
00:44:44,075 --> 00:44:45,089
I’m nothing?

598
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,769
Without my family?

599
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:51,553
Yes.

600
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,607
So, just go back
to where you belong.

601
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,527
I will now do things by myself.

602
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,905
I don’t want to be
with you anymore.

603
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,323
Maui, that’s not true.

604
00:45:03,477 --> 00:45:05,396
Sam, please tell me
you don’t mean that, right?

605
00:45:06,405 --> 00:45:08,031
Love, you don’t mean that—

606
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,373
Cy, wake up!

607
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,917
I meant everything I said.

608
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,086
What else do I need to say?

609
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,880
What reason do you
want me to come up with

610
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,507
just for you to let me go?

611
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,470
That I never loved you?

612
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,222
That’s a lie.

613
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,183
I know that’s a lie.
You loved me!

614
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:33,294
That’s a lie, Maui. Come on.

615
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:35,818
You’re so desperate.

616
00:45:39,185 --> 00:45:41,187
Look at yourself.

617
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,325
Why do you keep
forcing yourself on me?

618
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,703
How many times
do I have to tell you?

619
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,372
I don’t like you anymore.

620
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,583
I don’t want you anymore.

621
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,172
And if you can’t accept that,

622
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,424
then it’s not my fault anymore.

623
00:46:01,153 --> 00:46:02,161
Maui, wait.

624
00:46:02,645 --> 00:46:04,563
Maui, let’s talk first.

625
00:46:05,608 --> 00:46:06,692
Maui.

626
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,849
- Stop.
- Love, please.

627
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,559
- Clyden, stop.
- Love.

628
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,019
- Let me go.
- No.

629
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:13,603
Let me go!

630
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,411
I was using you.

631
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,580
I don’t want you anymore.

632
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,959
You’re nothing without
your family’s money.

633
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,007
Are you really going to leave?

634
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,879
Will this make you happy, Sam?

635
00:48:28,456 --> 00:48:29,491
Okay.

636
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:53,748
All I want is
for you to be happy.

637
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,309
So, be happy.

638
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:03,907
If you’re really
going to leave me,

639
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,070
do it without crying.

640
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,950
Or else I would take you back
into my arms again.

641
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,957
I’m sorry.

642
00:49:27,557 --> 00:49:30,894
Can you sleep beside me
for one last time?

643
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,514
Please?

644
00:50:03,497 --> 00:50:04,510
Sam?

645
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,429
Can you keep the ring for me?

646
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,394
Hey, answer me.

647
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:29,985
I will.

648
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,706
You said you love me…

649
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:11,448
Maui you said...

650
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,633
You said you love me…

651
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,941
Sam, I don’t want
to watch you leave.

652
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,219
Be happy.

653
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,430
I’ll become someone
you can be proud of.

654
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,868
See you around, Love.

655
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,080
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

656
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:14,647
pray for us sinners now and at
the hour of our death. Amen.

657
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:21,601
Lord, please forgive me—

658
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,097
for whatever pain
I may have caused this child.

659
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,486
I didn’t want
any of this to happen.

660
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:36,645
I didn’t want a life lost.

661
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:42,737
I was only trying to teach her
respect and discipline

662
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:48,618
in a way I thought
would be good for her—

663
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,290
and for our family.

664
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:02,507
God, may her soul rest in peace.

665
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,509
Naomi…

666
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,649
Let’s go.

667
00:55:31,553 --> 00:55:32,762
Sam.

668
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,622
Sweetheart, thank you
for coming. I miss—

669
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:42,005
Thank you for all the things
you’ve done for me.

670
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,050
Starting today,

671
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,510
I’ll do everything by myself.

672
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,138
I won’t follow you anymore.

673
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:53,223
I won’t follow the things
you want anymore.

674
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,479
What are you saying, Maureen?

675
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,358
I’m saying that I’m not
one of your possessions.

676
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,945
I’m Samantha Vera—

677
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:10,825
and I will create a name
out there for myself.

678
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,704
Maui—

679
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,583
Haze?

680
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,749
Do I know you?

681
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,257
I give up. I can’t remember.

682
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,097
Samantha Vera.

683
00:57:12,936 --> 00:57:14,688
Yeah. Hiro’s friend.

684
00:57:14,713 --> 00:57:17,142
Yeah, and we’ve met before, too.

685
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:20,186
I guess you don’t
really remember.

686
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,398
But that’s okay. See you around?

687
00:57:24,423 --> 00:57:25,716
See you around.

688
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:24,811
Maybe someday, I’ll make your
head turn again with my walk.

689
00:59:25,487 --> 00:59:27,734
Take care of
yourself, Doc.

690
00:59:49,408 --> 00:59:50,784
Is she still coughing?

691
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:52,102
Not really, Doc.

692
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:54,641
Doc, they’re looking
for you in the ward.

693
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,974
We know each
other already, Doc.

694
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,726
She was my fiancée.

695
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,477
Upcoming bookings so far—

696
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,646
Photoshoots, Muse magazine,

697
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:10,982
Denim Haus, and fashion shows—

698
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,776
we have Noa Atelier
and Maison Lorent.

699
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,695
Go, Auntie! Go!

700
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,907
Auntie… Auntie!

701
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:20,967
Oh my god!

702
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,994
Rich, I need to take
her to the hospital.

703
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,580
There's one nearby,
Ramirez Medical.

704
01:00:28,478 --> 01:00:29,502
May I join you?

705
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,086
Are you okay?

706
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,257
Haze, don’t you
have a girlfriend?
