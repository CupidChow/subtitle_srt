1
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,178
Doc, you’re trending
online right now.

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,722
I don’t know what
you’re referring to,

3
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,557
but sir, can we please
focus on your health?

4
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,934
We’re not even close
with the Vera family anymore.

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,645
And we even cancelled
the engagement of our son.

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,311
Why aren’t you answering me?

7
00:00:24,343 --> 00:00:25,424
I’m sorry.

8
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,779
He’s already struggling with
his life without our support.

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,197
And a scandal like this

10
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,018
will burden him even more.

11
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:34,169
So please don’t add to it.

12
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,704
If you find someone else,

13
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,791
I hope she can
truly make you happy.

14
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,089
Don’t cry, baby.

15
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,596
You’re making me cry, too.
Let me hold you, bestie.

16
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:53,623
You’re making us all cry.

17
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:00,373
I just wanna say that

18
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,522
I’m really, really gonna miss you.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,903
It’s been three years since
I’ve moved to New York.

20
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:23,617
Modeling…

21
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:32,534
Partying…

22
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,417
Meeting new friends…

23
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:38,585
Travelling around the
world doing what I love.

24
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,892
I’ve already
achieved my dreams.

25
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,062
Are you happy for me, Naomi?

26
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,818
You’re not here anymore, but,

27
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:48,928
you’ve brought out
the best in me.

28
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,073
And I’m genuinely happy now.

29
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:56,118
I did have to step back from
doing runway though.

30
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,159
It just got too tiring.

31
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,453
And I still do go
to Fashion Week.

32
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,330
But only as a guest.

33
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,916
And honestly,
I’m happier this way.

34
00:02:05,343 --> 00:02:07,929
Just enjoying myself

35
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:10,213
doing what I truly want…

36
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,090
Freely.

37
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,010
And now, I get to
pursue other dreams.

38
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,263
I’m opening a club in Manila.

39
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,100
It’s actually surprising.
Haze helped me a lot.

40
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,520
And now, I’m heading home.

41
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,355
After everything,

42
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,316
I really miss getting to
share all these moments

43
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,381
with my friends.

44
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,777
And—

45
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,240
with him.

46
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,199
I haven’t really talked to Cy
for the past three years.

47
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,618
We did message a few times.

48
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,454
Birthdays. Special occasions.

49
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,291
But we haven’t messaged
again since then.

50
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,127
Maybe it’s for the best.

51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,839
Maybe he’s moved on.
I’m not sure.

52
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,217
But if it’s true,
I’m happy for him.

53
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,889
As for me, I have no plans of
getting married or having kids.

54
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,849
I’m just focusing
on myself now.

55
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,273
So—

56
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,561
I’m just excited to go home.

57
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,733
[Sam] All packed and ready!

58
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,901
[Yanna] Should we pick you up?

59
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,819
[Yanna] I’ll have Sevi pick you up.

60
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,654
[Sam] Yes, please. Thank you!

61
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,171
- Hey! It’s Samantha Vera!
- Sam!

62
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,856
Sam!

63
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,243
- Hi!
- Can we take a picture with you?

64
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:45,268
Yeah, sure.

65
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,561
Thank you.

66
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,805
Please take a
picture with us too.

67
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,399
- Thank you.
- Hello, can we take a picture?

68
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,669
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

69
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,904
Hi, guys.

70
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,239
- Hi.
- Thank you.

71
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,312
Hello.

72
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,242
- Sev!
- Welcome back!

73
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,101
Thanks a lot.

74
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,664
Oh man, I really
missed the Philippines.

75
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:09,879
A lot has changed, actually.

76
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:13,683
Just like you!
You’ve changed a lot, huh.

77
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:18,258
Maybe you’re just
talking about my muscles.

78
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,555
They got bigger, didn’t they?

79
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,346
How are you?
Have you been well?

80
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,848
You’re talking to
the new Head Engineer

81
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,642
at Valeria Construction.

82
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,144
Wow! You’re still full of yourself.

83
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,396
How about you,
how have you been?

84
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,914
You're really so famous now.

85
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,192
And you even know
my favorite actor!

86
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,820
Didn’t I tell you
to bring a fansign?

87
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,238
Is that still a thing nowadays?

88
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,906
I have his number.
I can just text him.

89
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,491
How about a video
greeting instead?

90
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,742
Just kidding!

91
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,370
But seriously, Sam, you’re
super famous here now.

92
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,705
You’ve got tons
of ads in the mall

93
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,291
and even a billboard along EDSA.

94
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,709
Big time!

95
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:53,992
Yeah.

96
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,742
Also—

97
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,842
don’t you find it weird when
people take videos of you?

98
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:08,706
I used to dream about this.

99
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:11,612
The fame, the attention.

100
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,604
But now, I’m not so sure.

101
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,024
I just hope it doesn’t
end up like before.

102
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,692
I can’t go
through that again.

103
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:21,406
Let’s go.

104
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:22,505
- Let me help you with that.
- All right.

105
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,531
Okay. Thank you.

106
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,672
Sam Vera is back!

107
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:28,750
Is she here for good?

108
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:29,734
How’s her love life kaya?

109
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,024
What is she up to next?

110
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:42,391
So, Sam, are you finally going
to renovate your condo?

111
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:43,593
It’s totally empty.

112
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:47,354
Yes, but I might need some help
so I can finish it quickly.

113
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:49,424
Want me to help you out?

114
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,141
Sure, why not?

115
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:55,466
Well, the best engineer
for the job

116
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,200
is literally right in front of you.

117
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,160
Wow. The best.

118
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,703
Sam!

119
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,121
Luna!

120
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,040
I miss you!

121
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,541
Hey, chill! Me too!

122
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,684
Ke!

123
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,438
- You’re so pretty.
- You guys too.

124
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,506
You smell so good!
You smell like—

125
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:13,090
Like a rich lady.

126
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:15,134
That’s our diva.

127
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:15,960
You’re so loud.

128
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:17,220
Aren’t you gonna
compliment me too?

129
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:19,722
But Sevi, you smell like cement.
What a moron.

130
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:21,974
Wow! Speak for yourself.

131
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:24,435
Well, anyway, are you guys
also helping Sam

132
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:25,645
renovate her condo?

133
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,395
- Huh?
- What?

134
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:27,524
You’re renovating it?

135
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:29,499
Yes.

136
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:32,026
I’m in. Luna and I will
handle the design, right?

137
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:34,153
Yes! I’ll make it look
amazing so that

138
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,532
when guys come over, bang!

139
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,327
Speaking of banging…

140
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:43,679
Well? How’s your love life?

141
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:45,414
- Haven't heard anything.
- You know what, guys—

142
00:07:45,852 --> 00:07:47,333
I’m still single.

143
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,419
Seriously? Single or just
waiting for someone?

144
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:52,088
Who was that again? That…

145
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:53,881
- Doc, Doc Clyden.
- It’s—

146
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:55,233
- Clyden?
- Him.

147
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:58,052
What? No! Come on—

148
00:07:58,052 --> 00:07:59,637
No? Seriously?

149
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,138
No contact?

150
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:05,434
I only see him through
his social media.

151
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:08,312
We kinda drifted apart,
so I don’t think

152
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:10,022
there’s any chance
for us to reconnect.

153
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,652
And besides, my love life is not
the focus right now, okay?

154
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:15,444
Right. Of course.

155
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,572
The opening of my club
is my priority right now.

156
00:08:17,572 --> 00:08:18,406
Yes.

157
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:19,907
Right? So, you guys are coming.

158
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:21,251
- When is it again?
- Yes.

159
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:22,952
Actually, it’s coming up soon.

160
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:24,704
I’m checking the place tomorrow.

161
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,997
Just make sure you come, okay?

162
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:26,998
Don’t you dare miss it.

163
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:28,833
Of course!

164
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:33,254
- We missed you!
- Me too!

165
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:35,980
Is the renovation free, though?

166
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,634
Of course! It’s you
we're talking about!

167
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:39,802
Okay!

168
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:41,887
- That’s up to the boss now.
- We’re in need, you know?

169
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:42,888
Come on.

170
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:43,889
- Yeah!
- No!

171
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:49,898
Beautiful, right?

172
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:53,357
Yes, it’s better than I expected.

173
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,160
All right, fine.
You did a good job.

174
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,966
Thank you for taking care of
the club while I was away.

175
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:01,845
Of course. All for you.

176
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:06,579
Now, I need to order
a ton of alcohol.

177
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,706
I’ll just call the suppliers later.

178
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:12,543
Have you contacted the event
organizer for the opening?

179
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:13,544
Yup, already did.

180
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,920
Didn’t I tell you?

181
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,048
I’m such a good boy.

182
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:20,259
I already ordered everything,
even the booze.

183
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:22,136
They should arrive this week.

184
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:25,890
What can I do without you?

185
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,684
Damn, that sounded so fake.

186
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:33,147
The only thing missing
now is your guest list.

187
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:34,940
Have you thought about it?

188
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:39,445
Should I invite him?

189
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:40,655
What do you think?

190
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:42,531
Who? Cy?

191
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,994
Are you still in love with him?

192
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:51,957
You two just can't
get over each other.

193
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:54,585
What do you mean?

194
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:58,005
Nothing. Invite him if you want.

195
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,676
I know you’re just making
an excuse to see him,

196
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:03,678
but go for it.

197
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,846
Who knows?

198
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:08,249
Maybe he’s just waiting
for you, too, right?

199
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,771
Anyway, if that’s
the only thing left,

200
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:15,356
I’ll head out now.

201
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,816
Okay.

202
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:18,859
You can figure that
one out on your own.

203
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,152
You’re old enough.

204
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:24,949
- Bye.
- Bye.

205
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:36,210
Yanna.

206
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,087
Sam, it’s Avi…

207
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:39,547
Why are you crying?

208
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:42,425
She fell down the stairs.

209
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:43,592
I just turned my back
for a second,

210
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:45,312
and when I looked again,
she was already unconscious!

211
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,406
What?

212
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:49,181
Where are you? I’ll go there.

213
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,467
We’re already at
the Emergency Room.

214
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:54,851
All right. I’m coming.
Send me the location, okay?

215
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,750
Bye.

216
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:07,742
Yeah! I’m here now, Haze.

217
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:11,039
Okay.

218
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,290
- Sam.
- How are you?

219
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,667
Worried about Avi.

220
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:21,589
How is she, Doc?

221
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,641
We’re still monitoring her,

222
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:34,393
but everything's going well.

223
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,395
Don’t worry.

224
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,730
Thanks, Doc.

225
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:41,178
Excuse me.

226
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:49,217
Maui.

227
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:54,748
Yes?

228
00:11:56,678 --> 00:11:58,430
Do you wanna get
some food with me?

229
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:06,454
I didn’t expect us to
see each other again

230
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:07,725
in this situation.

231
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:09,873
It’s the worst.

232
00:12:10,705 --> 00:12:12,165
Hey, but you don’t
have to worry.

233
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:14,254
Avi is in good hands.

234
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:16,647
The experts are
taking care of her.

235
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:19,099
Let’s just hope for the best.

236
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:20,162
Yeah.

237
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,771
Hey,

238
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:26,303
I went to one of your shows.

239
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:31,114
The lingerie show.

240
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:33,025
I watched it in person.

241
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,906
He saw me in my lingerie?

242
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:38,861
You looked so amazing.

243
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,836
Did I make your head
turn with my walk?

244
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:46,237
You always do.

245
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:51,574
Where’d you get
your ticket, by the way?

246
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:53,952
From Haze.

247
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,611
I just mention Haze,
and you blush immediately?

248
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:04,031
I’m blushing not because of him.

249
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:14,667
Why didn’t you call me when
you attended my show?

250
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:19,380
I just thought, maybe,
you didn’t want to see me.

251
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:20,839
But it’s okay.

252
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:24,385
Seeing you from afar was
already enough for me.

253
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:27,304
Why wouldn’t I want to see you?

254
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,714
You never contacted me.

255
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:39,408
I wanted to. A lot of times.

256
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,618
But, I didn’t want to
give you false hopes.

257
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:44,524
Maybe because you’d wait for me,

258
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:46,218
even if I had no plans
of coming back.

259
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:49,196
Even if there was no hope,

260
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:50,874
I’d still wait.

261
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:56,013
Were you waiting for me
to come back?

262
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,920
I told you to find
another woman.

263
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,089
You told me to find
a good woman,

264
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:04,184
not another woman.

265
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:10,597
And here she is now, beside me.

266
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,876
What more do you want?

267
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,392
Are we just waiting
on each other?

268
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:22,950
But I’m glad you’re here now.

269
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,668
Are you leaving again?

270
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:29,915
No.

271
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:32,328
I’m staying here for good.

272
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:38,834
By the way,
I’m opening my own club.

273
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:42,179
Really? Wow. Congratulations!

274
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:43,376
I’m so happy for you.

275
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:44,605
Where would it be?

276
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:46,108
Thank you.

277
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:48,802
It’s called Epitome, in BGC.

278
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:50,304
Yeah.

279
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:53,265
How about you?
How’s hospital life?

280
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,321
It’s fine.

281
00:14:55,976 --> 00:14:57,644
My workload’s
lighter now.

282
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:01,774
I’ve got interns and
residents under me.

283
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:06,428
So, I have a little
bit more time,

284
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,984
and my weekends are also free.

285
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,408
Thank you for the dessert.

286
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,126
No problem.

287
00:15:21,627 --> 00:15:23,478
If you’re free,

288
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:26,381
I’d really like you to come
to my club’s opening.

289
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:28,634
- It’s an exclusive party—
- That’s Samantha Vera, right?

290
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:29,927
and there won’t be
a lot of people.

291
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:31,303
Just close friends.

292
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:33,472
Yeah, I’d love to.

293
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:36,099
Let me just check
my schedule first.

294
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:42,731
Is it okay for you
to be seen with me?

295
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:45,492
Shouldn’t I be the
one asking you that?

296
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,074
Is it okay for you to be
seen with another guy?

297
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:51,907
Another guy?

298
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:58,497
More people are
starting to show up.

299
00:15:58,497 --> 00:15:59,652
I think you need to go now.

300
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:01,500
Okay.

301
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,460
- I’ll see you tomorrow?
- I’ll see you.

302
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:20,352
Such a strong couple!

303
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:22,646
So they’re still together
after all these years?

304
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:26,246
Wow! They’ve been
through so much

305
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:29,858
and they’re still solid.
True love is so strong.

306
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,993
At least there’s no more
hate or bashing now.

307
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,233
Seeing him again...

308
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:40,414
just made me realize

309
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:41,832
how much I still love him.

310
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:47,772
But...

311
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:48,965
how does he feel?

312
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,373
He was kind of vague
about everything he said.

313
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:54,362
Does he think
I have a boyfriend?

314
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:04,021
She’s recovering quickly.

315
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,440
In no time,
she’ll be back to normal.

316
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:09,926
Avi, the doctor said you’re
going to get better soon.

317
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:14,031
Hey, but don’t forget to
drink your medicine, okay?

318
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:15,073
Okay, doc.

319
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,285
Wait. I remember you.

320
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:21,061
Daddy said you only
kiss people you like.

321
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:22,831
Do you like Auntie?

322
00:17:22,831 --> 00:17:23,887
Yeah.

323
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:25,334
I like your Auntie.

324
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,045
Weren’t you the one who had
a crush on Auntie before?

325
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:35,510
Auntie, you’re here!

326
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:38,756
Of course, Auntie is
here to visit you.

327
00:17:39,263 --> 00:17:42,350
Auntie, he’s Uncle, right?

328
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:46,855
Avi, I think you
need to rest now.

329
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:48,315
Go to sleep for a bit, baby.

330
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,213
Wow, she still remembers that.

331
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,403
All right then, I’ll leave you
two for now, okay?

332
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,084
The delivery’s downstairs.

333
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:01,883
Close your eyes now, baby.

334
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:03,921
You’re not sleeping.

335
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,938
Hey, it’s nice seeing you
again today.

336
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:10,212
Same here.

337
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:12,464
It feels nice to see you.

338
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:15,634
Are you free?
Do you wanna hang out?

339
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:18,345
Sure.

340
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:20,347
Okay.

341
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:26,603
I saw them walking together in BGC!

342
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:29,189
I saw Samantha Vera
and Doc Ramirez at a cafe!

343
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:31,108
I saw them at the supermarket too!

344
00:18:45,904 --> 00:18:46,915
I’m sorry.

345
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,984
I still can’t believe
he’s here.

346
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:51,011
He even cooked tempura for me.

347
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:54,840
Let’s eat.

348
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:57,050
Thank you, Cy.

349
00:18:57,676 --> 00:19:00,318
Anyway, your birthday’s
coming up soon, right?

350
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:01,794
Do you have anything planned?

351
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:05,308
Just clear your
schedule on that day.

352
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:09,021
But wait, where are you
throwing your party?

353
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:10,068
You can have it at my club.

354
00:19:11,303 --> 00:19:12,554
Promoting it, huh?

355
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:16,611
I mean, thanks for the offer,

356
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,530
but you know
I don’t like parties.

357
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:21,908
I just wanna spend
that day with you.

358
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:23,410
Just you.

359
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:29,272
Cy,

360
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:32,335
do you have a girlfriend?

361
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:36,381
‘Cause I’m single.

362
00:19:39,384 --> 00:19:41,053
To answer your question,

363
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:42,763
yes.

364
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:47,059
Yes? You have a girlfriend?

365
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,681
Yeah. She just came back
from New York.

366
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:57,319
Really? When did she get back?

367
00:19:58,904 --> 00:20:01,782
I don’t know,
she didn’t tell me.

368
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:09,623
Am I your girlfriend?

369
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:20,926
You know what,
I owe you a lot.

370
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,721
Me doing Pediatric
Emergency Medicine.

371
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:28,407
You were the one who encouraged
me not to give up.

372
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:30,769
I don’t even know if I could’ve
handled all of it

373
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:31,771
without your help.

374
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:35,941
Come on,
that was all you.

375
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:38,318
And I’m sure
you went through a lot.

376
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:39,653
But you did it.

377
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:41,404
You made it happen.

378
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,428
- During my internship,
- Just a little more.

379
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,076
I was rotating through
different departments.

380
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:48,643
First,

381
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:51,046
I was assigned to
the OB-GYN department.

382
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,416
That’s what kept me
busy for a few weeks.

383
00:20:57,444 --> 00:21:00,280
When I got assigned
to the Surgery department,

384
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:02,599
it just got more tiring.

385
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:05,126
I witnessed death after death.

386
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:18,003
I couldn’t face the families
crying after losing their loved ones.

387
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:22,696
But...

388
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:25,240
there was no choice
but to keep going.

389
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:31,365
After hospital duty, I still had
to study for rotation exams.

390
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,103
I studied all night, squeezing
in sleep whenever I could.

391
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:42,507
At that time, there were so
many thoughts running

392
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:45,177
through my head,
I needed a distraction.

393
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,423
So it was just studying

394
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:49,848
- and hospital work for me.
- Congratulations!

395
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:50,682
Thank you, Doc.

396
00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:52,851
Good thing,
my hard work paid off.

397
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:55,604
I was recognized as one of the
top ten outstanding interns

398
00:21:55,604 --> 00:21:57,170
with exemplary performance.

399
00:21:57,195 --> 00:22:00,365
Eventually, I also graduated
magna cum laude.

400
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:04,631
But...

401
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,825
my perseverance
didn’t end there.

402
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:11,846
I topped the boards
with a rating of 91.33%

403
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:14,709
You did it all on your own, Cy.

404
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,217
And I’m so proud of you.

405
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,051
You know what kept me going?

406
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:21,904
You.

407
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:25,881
You had already achieved
so much back then.

408
00:22:26,765 --> 00:22:28,308
I also wanted to achieve more

409
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:30,581
so that I can stand on
the same level as you.

410
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:33,603
I followed your journey.

411
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:37,490
There was even one time,
I’d been awake for 29 hours,

412
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:47,350
But I still chose to
watch your fashion show.

413
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:52,952
I wanted to witness
your greatness.

414
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:07,592
You were amazing.

415
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:13,974
Congrats.

416
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:20,839
Congratulations. You did well.

417
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:29,328
Paging Dr. Clyden Ramirez.

418
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:31,222
You should have messaged me.

419
00:23:31,658 --> 00:23:32,909
I was actually waiting for that.

420
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:34,494
I thought you didn’t watch.

421
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,286
How hard is it to say,
“you did good”?

422
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:44,421
A congratulatory
message wouldn’t hurt.

423
00:23:44,713 --> 00:23:46,756
I always watched your
shows whenever I could.

424
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:50,969
It was one
of my first big shows.

425
00:23:51,665 --> 00:23:52,791
A core memory.

426
00:23:53,972 --> 00:23:56,558
But I’ve already retired
from runway shows.

427
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,644
I came back to Manila
to focus on my club.

428
00:24:02,147 --> 00:24:04,274
I already knew that you’d
eventually come back home

429
00:24:04,274 --> 00:24:05,322
to the Philippines.

430
00:24:06,276 --> 00:24:07,283
How?

431
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,030
Haze told me.

432
00:24:11,698 --> 00:24:12,949
And I’m glad he did.

433
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:16,077
I would’ve most likely
moved to New York then.

434
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:18,580
I even talked to
my dad about it.

435
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:20,925
You’re going to New York?

436
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:25,439
Are you planning to practice there?

437
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,381
Yes, Dad.

438
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:35,221
Have you really
thought this through?

439
00:24:38,954 --> 00:24:39,955
Many times.

440
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:43,897
And this isn’t just
about my career.

441
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:47,317
There’s someone in New York
that I wanna be with.

442
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:54,965
Clyden, I know we haven’t been
okay these past few years.

443
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:57,869
But despite that,

444
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:01,790
you have served the hospital
to the best of your abilities.

445
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:05,377
Even without support
from your mom and me.

446
00:25:06,943 --> 00:25:10,280
Time and time again,
you’ve proven that

447
00:25:10,305 --> 00:25:11,806
you’re an excellent doctor.

448
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,220
And a great son.

449
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:24,825
I’m so sorry for everything.

450
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,264
But if you truly want
to go to New York

451
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:31,150
to be with Samantha,

452
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:33,901
I will respect that.

453
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:38,789
Thank you, Dad.

454
00:25:39,544 --> 00:25:40,555
You’re welcome, son.

455
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:47,270
I’m so happy you and
your dad are okay now.

456
00:25:48,545 --> 00:25:51,500
Your relationship with him
has come a long way.

457
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,800
And now we’re here,

458
00:25:54,457 --> 00:25:55,624
eating together.

459
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:57,387
Yeah.

460
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:01,933
Looking back, I think
we did the right thing,

461
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:03,017
don’t you agree?

462
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:06,688
Parting ways,
even if it was painful.

463
00:26:07,428 --> 00:26:09,500
Yeah, it was painful,

464
00:26:09,983 --> 00:26:11,526
but it was necessary.

465
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:15,655
We needed that to figure out
what we really wanted.

466
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:20,785
Maybe we wouldn’t
have found clarity

467
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:24,122
about what we want
or who we are

468
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:26,458
if we hadn’t separated
for a while.

469
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:27,459
He’s right.

470
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:30,837
That distance made us realize
we never wanted to be apart.

471
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:32,922
By the way, have you
confirmed if you’re coming

472
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,466
to my club’s opening?

473
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:36,258
Yes,

474
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:38,261
and I wouldn’t miss it.

475
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:43,933
- Let’s eat?
- Okay.

476
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:56,004
Are you guys dating?

477
00:26:57,254 --> 00:26:58,364
Sam! Oh my god!

478
00:26:58,364 --> 00:27:00,200
Oh my god, you’re here.

479
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:02,619
It’s so fun.

480
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:04,537
Hi! You guys are here!

481
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:07,540
Of course, how could
we miss your opening?

482
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,001
Yeah. This is a
fresh start for you.

483
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:10,877
Yeah.

484
00:27:10,877 --> 00:27:14,631
Also I invited some friends
over for more publicity.

485
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:16,424
Really? Oh my gosh,
thank you, girls!

486
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:18,968
Get drinks and
enjoy the night, okay?

487
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:20,470
- I’ll be back.
- Okay. We’ll see you around.

488
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,597
Bye!

489
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,182
Guys!

490
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:25,808
Samantha Vera.

491
00:27:25,808 --> 00:27:27,977
Oh my god. Congratulations!

492
00:27:27,977 --> 00:27:29,938
The best club in town!

493
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:30,939
Right?

494
00:27:30,939 --> 00:27:33,358
We used to just
party at other clubs.

495
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:36,027
Now, we have our own
regular hangout spot.

496
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:38,196
Congratulations, Sam!

497
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:39,739
Seriously, Samantha Vera.

498
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:42,075
This is freaking huge!
It’s so awesome!

499
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:43,493
This place is overwhelming.

500
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:44,827
Are there any pretty girls here?

501
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,996
Why? Are you looking
for a girlfriend, huh?

502
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:50,708
Pass! Work is life for now.

503
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,794
I love how he asked
if there were any girls here,

504
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:53,795
then immediately says pass—

505
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:54,754
- and then work is life?
- I know, right.

506
00:27:54,754 --> 00:27:56,548
- Is it wrong to look?
- You don’t even do our work

507
00:27:56,548 --> 00:27:58,007
properly, Sevi.
You still owe me.

508
00:27:58,841 --> 00:28:00,260
Wait. I have an announcement.

509
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:01,511
- Wait for me.
- Huh?

510
00:28:01,511 --> 00:28:02,639
I’ll be back, okay?

511
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:04,847
Oh my gosh!

512
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:06,099
You’re delayed, you know.

513
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:07,267
You’ve been two weeks
late already.

514
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:08,334
My bad. My bad.

515
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:10,728
Everyone!

516
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:13,565
Thank you for coming tonight.

517
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:15,358
This is a dream come true.

518
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:18,528
When I was younger,
going to parties with friends

519
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:20,488
was my escape and relief.

520
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:24,834
At the club,
I forget all my problems

521
00:28:24,978 --> 00:28:26,730
and just enjoy the night.

522
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:31,481
So now, my hope is that everyone
who visits my club

523
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:32,917
feels the same way, too.

524
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,836
Let’s raise our glasses

525
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:37,171
and toast to this
brand-new start.

526
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:39,841
Welcome to Epitome! Cheers!

527
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:41,384
Cheers!

528
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:44,679
- Okay, again.
- Cheers to that!

529
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:47,682
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

530
00:28:50,727 --> 00:28:53,229
- Cheers!
- Cheers, Samantha Vera.

531
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:55,231
It's time to party!

532
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:16,377
Hey! Why did you guys
start without me, huh?

533
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:17,587
- Yanna!
- Yanna!

534
00:29:17,587 --> 00:29:18,771
Jeez!

535
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:19,797
How’s Avi?

536
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:22,034
She’s okay now, thankfully.

537
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:24,734
Where's your boyfriend?
He's not here yet?

538
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:35,797
Hi.

539
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:40,109
- Speaking of?
- Yes.

540
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:42,528
- Cy, thank you for coming!
- Of course.

541
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,114
Wow. She hugged him?

542
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:45,907
Yeah, she did.

543
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:49,327
Okay, guys!
Clyden. You remember him, right?

544
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:51,492
Did they get back together?

545
00:29:51,517 --> 00:29:52,633
I don’t know.

546
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:57,206
Cy, this is Architect Ynares—

547
00:29:57,231 --> 00:30:00,067
Architect Valeria
and Engineer Camero.

548
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:02,382
So, you’re all
in the same field.

549
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:04,258
Yes! Yes.

550
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:05,677
Hello, Doc!

551
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:07,303
- Ashianna Juarez.
- I’m sorry.

552
00:30:07,303 --> 00:30:08,488
No, just call me Cy.

553
00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:11,391
Come on, give him
a sweet little kiss!

554
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:13,768
Guys, we’re not in college
anymore, all right?

555
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:15,687
You know what,
let’s just enjoy the night!

556
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:18,606
Pull up!

557
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:19,899
Let’s go, Sev.

558
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:22,902
- Pull up!
- Pull up!

559
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:25,571
Cy! Come here.

560
00:30:27,115 --> 00:30:29,283
I’m shy. I would just...

561
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:39,502
How lucky.

562
00:30:48,177 --> 00:30:49,262
What?

563
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:53,141
Wait.

564
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:54,575
Are you dizzy now?

565
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,060
Drink some water first.

566
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:03,961
What?

567
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,237
Why? Is there something wrong?

568
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:07,243
Nothing.

569
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:12,131
You just look so pretty.

570
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:47,340
Let’s go back.

571
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:49,947
Okay.

572
00:31:50,907 --> 00:31:51,922
Wait.

573
00:31:55,921 --> 00:31:57,131
Be my girlfriend.

574
00:31:59,373 --> 00:32:00,583
Did I hear that right?

575
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:02,376
What did you just say?

576
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:05,077
Be my girlfriend.

577
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:08,007
Let’s be together again.

578
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,895
We’ve been together
for two weeks now

579
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,506
and everything has been great.

580
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:14,396
At this age
and stage of our lives,

581
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,787
everything feels aligned
for us to be together.

582
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:20,172
We finally made it.

583
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:22,795
Come on,
I don’t drive in New York.

584
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,867
I just take the subway—

585
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:24,893
Whatever.

586
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:27,837
Bye!

587
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:28,629
Bye.

588
00:33:28,629 --> 00:33:29,630
I’ll see you later.

589
00:33:46,602 --> 00:33:50,276
We now have time and
space for each other.

590
00:33:54,113 --> 00:33:54,790
Hey.

591
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:56,086
Hey.

592
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:57,118
For you.

593
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:02,622
I love you.

594
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:04,165
I love you so much.

595
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:11,700
This looks good.

596
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,071
It’s good.

597
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:28,606
Hey. Let’s go.

598
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:35,094
Hi, Sam.

599
00:34:35,602 --> 00:34:37,365
First of all, I just want
to say sorry

600
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:39,408
for all of the things
I said to you before.

601
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:43,608
I promise, I’m trying to change.

602
00:34:44,705 --> 00:34:46,290
Yeah. That’s true.

603
00:34:46,874 --> 00:34:48,626
He’s been seeing a therapist.

604
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:53,797
That’s all in the past.
And apology accepted.

605
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:56,883
I hope I still get the chance
to make it up to you.

606
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,261
Hi, Sam.

607
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:00,674
Hello.

608
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:04,058
Hi, Sam!

609
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,768
- Hello.
- Sam!

610
00:35:05,768 --> 00:35:07,407
Good to see you here. Hello.

611
00:35:07,937 --> 00:35:09,271
Hello.

612
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:11,666
Wait.

613
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:13,001
Are you guys together again?

614
00:35:13,526 --> 00:35:15,903
Yes, Mom, Dad.

615
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,844
But I’m not asking for
permission. I hope that’s clear.

616
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:22,869
Sweetheart, we know.
You don’t need our permission.

617
00:35:23,632 --> 00:35:24,633
Sam,

618
00:35:25,204 --> 00:35:26,622
can I talk to you for a moment?

619
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:29,792
Sure.

620
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:32,461
- Please excuse us.
- Okay. Go ahead.

621
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:35,481
Boys, let’s go.

622
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:39,677
Sam, I’d like to apologize for
being so harsh in the past.

623
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:42,346
I know I should have
handled it better but,

624
00:35:42,346 --> 00:35:43,347
you know…

625
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:45,692
I’m so proud of your success.

626
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:48,477
Thank you.

627
00:35:48,477 --> 00:35:51,439
And apology accepted.

628
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:54,108
Well, just call me Mom
if you’re comfortable with it.

629
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,777
Okay… Mom.

630
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,448
Anyway, just follow us
outside, okay?

631
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:01,574
I’ll go ahead.

632
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:05,094
Boys, let’s go outside.
Let’s eat.

633
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,495
- Okay.
- Let’s go.

634
00:36:06,495 --> 00:36:07,496
I’ll go check on Sam first, Dad.

635
00:36:07,496 --> 00:36:08,497
Okay, go ahead.

636
00:36:12,626 --> 00:36:13,753
Hey, how are you?

637
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,671
I’m okay.

638
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:18,883
You know, the atmosphere in
your family has really changed.

639
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:22,553
Before, it was always
full of arguments.

640
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:24,180
But now, it feels so peaceful.

641
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,223
You’re all so calm.

642
00:36:26,974 --> 00:36:29,518
Yeah. After we watched your

643
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:32,070
tell-all interview
three years ago—

644
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:37,526
we realized we all played
a part in your suffering.

645
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,733
We just wish it didn’t
have to reach that point.

646
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:43,730
After all, we’re a family of doctors.

647
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,939
We should’ve been the
ones taking care of people.

648
00:36:49,485 --> 00:36:52,947
We all did a lot of reflection
among ourselves.

649
00:36:55,685 --> 00:36:58,521
I’m happy that you were all
able to forgive each other.

650
00:36:59,256 --> 00:37:03,177
You know, not all families
get to heal like you did.

651
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:07,598
You’re a criminal!

652
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:10,312
Don’t you dare
act holier than thou.

653
00:37:10,337 --> 00:37:12,078
You benefited
from my money, too!

654
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:14,648
It’s the people’s money,
and every day,

655
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:17,273
I feel fucking bad
being your daughter.

656
00:37:27,952 --> 00:37:29,620
Are you okay? What’s wrong?

657
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:34,041
Can I see my parents?

658
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,008
Ma’am, the jail warden
has approved your request

659
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:42,299
to see your parents
in the same room.

660
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:46,929
But it will be a supervised
visit and will only last ten minutes.

661
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:48,264
Thank you.

662
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:49,390
All right.

663
00:37:57,106 --> 00:38:00,276
Hey, do you want me
to come with you?

664
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:02,278
No, it’s okay.

665
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:04,929
I need to talk to them alone.

666
00:38:04,954 --> 00:38:05,954
Okay.

667
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:43,725
Sam?

668
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:45,146
Sweetheart…

669
00:38:52,442 --> 00:38:54,688
Sam, how are you?

670
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:57,102
Sweetheart,
I missed you so much.

671
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,879
We missed you so much.

672
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:01,126
Sam, how are you?

673
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:05,078
I’m good. How about you?

674
00:39:06,623 --> 00:39:08,166
We’re fine. I guess.

675
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:10,603
Just taking it
one day at a time.

676
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:15,931
You treated us badly.

677
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,043
I was so mad at you.

678
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:22,550
I blame you for everything
that happened to us.

679
00:39:23,943 --> 00:39:26,278
You didn’t just break her,
you broke me too.

680
00:39:27,803 --> 00:39:30,097
You demanded so much from me.

681
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,369
And I wasted so much of my life

682
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:35,788
trying to reach
your expectations.

683
00:39:37,149 --> 00:39:39,203
Maui, I’m so sorry.

684
00:39:39,228 --> 00:39:40,521
We’re sorry.

685
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:44,758
Sweetheart, all we ever
wanted was to protect you.

686
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,131
Because we love you so much.

687
00:39:48,156 --> 00:39:49,616
So much.

688
00:39:49,843 --> 00:39:51,930
But your love suffocated me.

689
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,805
How could you do
that to me? To us?

690
00:39:57,518 --> 00:40:00,664
Did you ever apologize to Naomi
for what you did to her?

691
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:01,981
Yes.

692
00:40:02,606 --> 00:40:05,109
Every single day of my life.

693
00:40:07,048 --> 00:40:10,593
Every day, I ask the
heavens for forgiveness.

694
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:15,859
If only you knew
how much I cried

695
00:40:17,074 --> 00:40:18,883
because of how you belittled me.

696
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,584
And for forcing me into
things I never wanted to do.

697
00:40:24,346 --> 00:40:27,766
I was even willing to arrange
my marriage to a stranger.

698
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:31,466
If it hadn’t been Clyden,

699
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:34,145
I probably would’ve gone
through something worse.

700
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,784
How could you do that?

701
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,034
We were worried about you.

702
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,980
We just wanted to
make sure you’d be okay

703
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,648
in case something
happened to us.

704
00:40:44,648 --> 00:40:47,109
But you made it
look like I needed him.

705
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:49,403
That I used him.

706
00:40:50,237 --> 00:40:51,739
Do you really think
I wouldn’t be able

707
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:53,240
to handle things on my own?

708
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,491
Why?

709
00:40:54,992 --> 00:40:56,577
Because I’m a woman?

710
00:40:57,369 --> 00:40:58,412
No… No.

711
00:40:59,163 --> 00:41:02,750
I don’t need a husband
to save me from despair,

712
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,084
Mom, Dad.

713
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:07,004
Even up to my own wedding,

714
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:09,631
you still didn’t
give me the chance

715
00:41:09,631 --> 00:41:11,884
to make decisions for myself.

716
00:41:14,303 --> 00:41:15,846
I’m sorry…

717
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:21,226
I’m sorry to you,
to your sister.

718
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:25,189
For not being the father
you wanted me to be.

719
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:30,110
I’m sorry if I ever made you
feel like you weren’t enough.

720
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:35,115
You’ve done so much and
I’m so proud of you, Maureen.

721
00:41:37,785 --> 00:41:40,120
I just wanted to be free,

722
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:45,167
to make decisions for myself,
because I am my own person.

723
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,715
You don’t own your children.

724
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:54,385
We have feelings too.

725
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:58,263
You even forced
Naomi into a course

726
00:41:58,263 --> 00:42:00,307
she didn’t want, just to
make yourselves happy.

727
00:42:01,558 --> 00:42:02,726
‘Cause what?

728
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:06,355
You became so
obsessed with politics,

729
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:09,108
money, and everything
else that you forgot

730
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:12,444
how to be decent parents
to your own children.

731
00:42:13,862 --> 00:42:15,155
You’re right…

732
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:20,786
You’re right, Maui.

733
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,080
That’s true.

734
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:26,834
But I hope someday, somehow,

735
00:42:28,804 --> 00:42:31,482
you’ll be able to forgive us.

736
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:37,044
I hope you can
forgive me and your dad.

737
00:42:38,178 --> 00:42:40,264
We just wanted to protect you.

738
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:44,568
All I want is for you to
have peace in your heart.

739
00:42:45,436 --> 00:42:48,389
And Maui, you are
such a strong girl.

740
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:55,850
Imagine you achieved all of this
on your own, by yourself.

741
00:42:59,575 --> 00:43:01,357
And that alone is enough

742
00:43:02,507 --> 00:43:04,951
for us to be so proud of you.

743
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:13,342
What’s done is done.

744
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:16,717
Anything you say now
won’t change the past.

745
00:43:22,723 --> 00:43:25,389
I’ve already forgiven you
for everything you did to us.

746
00:43:26,518 --> 00:43:29,188
I just came here
to let go of the pain

747
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:30,397
I’ve been holding on to.

748
00:43:33,775 --> 00:43:35,068
Time’s up.

749
00:43:38,906 --> 00:43:39,907
Wait.

750
00:43:40,316 --> 00:43:42,396
Sweetheart, Maui—

751
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:46,830
Will you still visit us? Please?

752
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:50,709
I don’t know.

753
00:43:55,506 --> 00:43:57,799
Mau... Maui.

754
00:43:58,982 --> 00:44:00,576
I love you.

755
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:03,428
Mommy loves you.

756
00:44:08,826 --> 00:44:10,631
Mommy loves you.

757
00:44:10,979 --> 00:44:13,061
Mommy loves you, baby.

758
00:44:14,003 --> 00:44:15,880
Mommy loves you, sweetheart.

759
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:38,340
Hey.

760
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:41,176
Come here.

761
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:43,887
Come here.

762
00:44:47,388 --> 00:44:48,514
It’s okay, love.

763
00:44:59,945 --> 00:45:01,154
Hey…

764
00:45:02,864 --> 00:45:04,700
You did so well.

765
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:08,453
And you are so brave
for talking to them.

766
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,107
It was really hard,

767
00:45:15,353 --> 00:45:17,193
but I feel relieved now.

768
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,006
Can we visit Naomi?

769
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,670
I know it’s your birthday,

770
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:32,131
but I’m making you do
all these things for me.

771
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:34,104
Hey, it’s okay.

772
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:37,482
That’s actually where I was
planning to take us anyway.

773
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,279
I already bought
flowers for her, too.

774
00:45:42,946 --> 00:45:44,271
Hey, it's okay.

775
00:45:47,117 --> 00:45:48,389
Thank you, Cy.

776
00:45:49,115 --> 00:45:50,116
You’re welcome.

777
00:46:15,187 --> 00:46:17,731
You didn’t see me
for a long time, huh.

778
00:46:19,055 --> 00:46:21,927
Sorry, I haven’t been
able to visit.

779
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,656
But I always think about you,
wherever I am.

780
00:46:26,615 --> 00:46:29,034
That should be okay, right?

781
00:46:31,995 --> 00:46:33,580
Did you miss me?

782
00:46:35,832 --> 00:46:37,209
She still does.

783
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:40,170
She loved you very much.

784
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,885
I haven’t even said anything
yet, and I’m already tearing up.

785
00:46:49,554 --> 00:46:51,014
As you can see,

786
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:55,686
I’m here with the
person you trusted—

787
00:46:55,686 --> 00:46:58,897
the one who promised to be with
me through all the ups and downs.

788
00:47:03,735 --> 00:47:05,862
You must be happy and relieved.

789
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,659
I miss you a lot.

790
00:47:12,536 --> 00:47:15,038
Every day, I think about how

791
00:47:16,873 --> 00:47:20,419
I wish you were
still here with us.

792
00:47:23,672 --> 00:47:27,551
You probably know this
already, but I love you.

793
00:47:28,552 --> 00:47:32,305
And you’ll always
be with me in my heart.

794
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:40,605
We miss you, Naomi.

795
00:47:41,356 --> 00:47:42,858
You’re also one
of the reasons why

796
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:44,818
I keep fighting in my work.

797
00:47:45,777 --> 00:47:47,863
Why I want to save children

798
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:50,115
whenever and however I can.

799
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:53,326
I hope you’re proud of me.

800
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:55,620
Don’t worry,

801
00:47:55,996 --> 00:47:58,248
I’ll take care of your sister.

802
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:04,421
And I will never leave her,
no matter what happens.

803
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,340
I mean it this time.

804
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:18,148
Here, keep it.

805
00:48:20,361 --> 00:48:21,820
You’ll be okay, right?

806
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:29,868
I feel like you’re the
one wiping my tears.

807
00:48:33,382 --> 00:48:36,885
Naomi, I’m now free.

808
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,617
Let’s go.

809
00:49:20,765 --> 00:49:22,024
What are we doing here?

810
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:27,680
I just wanted to drop by here.

811
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:30,453
I missed this place.

812
00:49:35,512 --> 00:49:37,508
The house hasn’t
been officially sold yet.

813
00:49:37,821 --> 00:49:41,199
So, it’s still technically ours.

814
00:49:45,438 --> 00:49:46,961
I miss this place.

815
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:51,152
I miss us, in this place.

816
00:49:52,779 --> 00:49:54,364
Yeah, me too.

817
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:01,246
Let’s go to the veranda.
I’ll show you something.

818
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:02,831
Okay.

819
00:50:11,673 --> 00:50:12,966
What’s this?

820
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:16,136
Wait, just stay right there.

821
00:50:19,514 --> 00:50:20,849
Huh? Why?

822
00:50:22,183 --> 00:50:23,184
Walk to me.

823
00:50:24,352 --> 00:50:27,063
- Why?
- Just do it. Just walk to me.

824
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:30,366
I never really proposed
to you properly,

825
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,327
but I know you deserve this.

826
00:52:51,608 --> 00:52:53,793
Samantha Maureen Vera—

827
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,508
will you marry me?

828
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,807
Yes. Of course, yes!

829
00:53:21,738 --> 00:53:23,156
Let’s take a photo.

830
00:53:23,364 --> 00:53:24,365
Okay.

831
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:29,042
- Can you hold this, please?
- Okay.

832
00:53:40,673 --> 00:53:41,966
You posted it?

833
00:53:45,551 --> 00:53:46,698
What’s the caption?

834
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,932
My final walk will be
on the aisle with you.

835
00:56:02,065 --> 00:56:03,149
Ready!

836
00:56:03,149 --> 00:56:04,150
Okay, in character.

837
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:08,600
Let’s just—

838
00:56:09,871 --> 00:56:11,706
live together—
Oops, sorry?

839
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:12,854
Excuse me.

840
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:15,401
Who’s that ***?

841
00:56:15,426 --> 00:56:17,553
I don’t know who’s that *** ***.

842
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:22,293
- Cut!
- Fuc—

843
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,741
Are we visible, Direk?

844
00:56:24,766 --> 00:56:27,090
- You already know you’re not.
- Okay, cam—

845
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,424
Yes, you’re visible.

846
00:56:29,415 --> 00:56:30,744
You don’t wear briefs, either.

847
00:56:31,383 --> 00:56:32,775
So, you were checking this out?

848
00:56:33,888 --> 00:56:34,889
Move a bit.

849
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:40,450
Lick it.

850
00:56:46,985 --> 00:56:47,986
So-

851
00:56:49,862 --> 00:56:50,738
Cut!

852
00:56:50,738 --> 00:56:51,614
Yanna!

853
00:56:51,614 --> 00:56:52,615
Why did you take
so long to answer?

854
00:56:52,615 --> 00:56:55,285
You’re probably
hiding a gu-gu-do-do…

855
00:56:57,203 --> 00:56:58,204
Sorry, Direk!

856
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:02,000
Cut!

857
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,876
I really thought we’ll continue.

858
00:57:03,876 --> 00:57:04,885
Cut!

859
00:57:07,878 --> 00:57:09,588
Okay, one more!

860
00:57:12,337 --> 00:57:13,421
*** hate you!

861
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:14,971
- We said three, two, one!
- Okay.

862
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:16,135
Let’s really do three, two, one.

863
00:57:17,098 --> 00:57:18,099
Good luck.

864
00:57:18,391 --> 00:57:19,767
Why are you still awake, love?

865
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:23,396
You’re still awake, love?

866
00:57:23,396 --> 00:57:24,397
I’m sorry!

867
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:25,398
Okay, let’s go.

868
00:57:25,398 --> 00:57:26,399
Turn to the cam.

869
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:27,567
Yeah, and then that happened.

870
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:28,860
Oh shit, I’m sorry!

871
00:57:30,445 --> 00:57:31,779
Oh you wanna go again?

872
00:57:31,779 --> 00:57:32,780
No.

873
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,781
I thought—

874
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:37,118
Cut!

875
00:57:39,078 --> 00:57:40,408
I thought I’ll go again…

876
00:57:42,811 --> 00:57:43,812
Mom, Dad—

877
00:57:46,544 --> 00:57:47,086
Cut!

878
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:48,546
I didn’t know where to go.

879
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:54,177
- Hey, it’s not our turn yet!
- I’m sorry.

880
00:57:54,177 --> 00:57:56,262
Sevi, you gotta chill.

881
00:57:57,939 --> 00:57:59,089
Wait!

882
00:58:04,051 --> 00:58:05,886
I’m sorry. Just quit it!

883
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:09,859
- Well, I’m here now.
- Oh!

884
00:58:11,569 --> 00:58:12,862
I’m sorry!

885
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,868
Kidding! I’ll go Ariana—

886
00:58:18,868 --> 00:58:20,495
Hail, eat your food.

887
00:58:41,391 --> 00:58:43,351
Sorry! Sorry!

888
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:44,394
I’m really sorry!

889
00:58:47,086 --> 00:58:48,748
I said, don’t kiss.

890
00:58:48,773 --> 00:58:49,941
- Oh, don’t!
- I’m sorry.

891
00:58:49,941 --> 00:58:51,442
- Just stare at each other.
- Sorry, Direk.

892
00:58:51,442 --> 00:58:53,986
Just stare at each other.
Why are you kissing?

893
00:58:53,986 --> 00:58:55,738
You’re not following
instructions.

894
00:58:58,522 --> 00:59:00,190
I thought we were—

895
00:59:00,215 --> 00:59:01,281
Oh come on!
