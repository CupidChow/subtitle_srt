1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,460
Why hasn’t it stopped raining yet?

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:05,405
He’s so fucking handsome.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,741
Who the fuck are you?

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,214
How shall I call you?

5
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:15,448
I don’t know.

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,582
Babe?

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,151
Since we’re getting married.

8
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,685
Right?

9
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:20,920
I’m playing the lead

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,287
in this book.

11
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:25,791
And I know, many like
the fourth book the most.

12
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,659
Their expectations are so high.

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,930
And I know how successful
the first three books were.

14
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,267
So I’m feeling really, really pressured.

15
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,475
This is the story

16
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,311
of Samantha Vera
and her arranged marriage with Clyden.

17
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,980
And we’ll see here their dynamics

18
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,083
as live-in partners.

19
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,651
We’ll see their funny antics,

20
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,853
their bickering,

21
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,791
And, of course,
their cat-dog relationship.

22
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,460
We’ll find out if they’ll end up together.

23
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,229
And if the wedding will push through.

24
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,097
Every book, I get nervous

25
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,200
because everything’s new.

26
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,068
A new story.

27
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,169
A new cast.

28
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,474
So the expectations keep on getting higher.

29
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,244
Before the auditions,

30
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,745
I was hoping,

31
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:57,816
actually, I was praying that the one
who’d be chosen as Clyden

32
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:02,255
would have the same
characteristics as Clyden.

33
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,490
He’s kind. He’s caring.

34
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,793
And of course, acting well is a given.

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,131
I was so nervous that time

36
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:17,604
because I needed to do the scenes
with the different actors auditioning.

37
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,010
Of course, the first thing I did
was read the book.

38
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,080
Get the character, a grasp of Clyden.

39
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,285
My first impression of Aubrey - very shy.

40
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,289
Very, I'd say, introverted in a way.

41
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,190
My first impression of Lance,

42
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,526
I’ve said this before,

43
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,194
He’s actually really shy.

44
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,564
When Lance and I first met,

45
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,866
he was introduced to me

46
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,134
and I said, “Hi, I’m Aubrey.”

47
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,737
And he was just like, “Lance.”

48
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,372
He was so shy.

49
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,806
- Aubrey. Hello.
- I’m Lance. Nice to meet you.

50
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,807
Nice to meet you.

51
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,677
So, this is Lance.

52
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,012
Aubrey.

53
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,579
Hello.

54
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:01,747
Samantha.

55
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,619
We’ll do chem test.

56
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,561
Samantha.

57
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,562
Right?

58
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:17,897
Yes.

59
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,231
How shall I call you?

60
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,033
I don’t know. Babe?

61
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,235
That time...

62
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,772
I just had that feeling
that he really wants this.

63
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:27,359
He just had that vibe.

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,142
Even though he was nervous,

65
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,711
he was really trying
his best to do the scene.

66
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,314
And I just saw it.

67
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,683
I just imagined him and
thought, “this is Clyden”.

68
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,251
Lance is very intelligent.

69
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,553
He has depth.

70
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,255
And he’s eloquent.

71
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,090
And he’s a thinker.

72
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,493
That’s something that
he and Cy have in common.

73
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,798
Let’s all welcome,
my doctor, my Clyden

74
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,333
Lance Carr!

75
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,876
Thank you for the warm welcome, Univerkada.

76
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,012
I’m very happy and honored to be here.

77
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:10,149
And I can't wait to work with you
all, especially my Samantha Vera.

78
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,990
Finally, the Univerkada is complete!

79
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,363
Now that we have our Clyden,

80
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,665
it all feels like, this is it.

81
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,666
The time has come.

82
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,700
It’s starting.

83
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,535
We waited a long time for Clyden.

84
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,038
It’s been a long time since
she’s had a love team, so...

85
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,039
Finally.

86
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,308
I’m glad.

87
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,943
Now, she has a partner.

88
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,411
We can finally tease her.

89
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,514
And at least now, she has someone
when we’re all together.

90
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,249
She seems really happy.

91
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,718
She's been waiting for three seasons.

92
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,521
And now, her love
team partner is my friend.

93
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,189
He’s been waiting for this.

94
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,258
He’s been wanting for this opportunity.

95
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,295
The Univerkada is finally complete.

96
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:59,065
I can't wait for the adventure
you’re about to embark on together.

97
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,334
The first one I told was my mom.

98
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,870
I cried to her.

99
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,471
I got the part.

100
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,573
And I waited a long time
for an opportunity like this.

101
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,076
Really love their dynamic.

102
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,678
They're very sweet.

103
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,312
They help each other out,

104
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,379
which is important.

105
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,382
The friendship is there,
the closeness is there.

106
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,752
I got to know him more because
of the times we hung out.

107
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:24,657
Which he himself planned and organized.

108
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,059
Which is nice because...

109
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,996
If I was partnered with
someone introverted like me,

110
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,400
none of these hangouts would have happened.

111
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,404
And I think that's his way of...

112
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,706
to get to know me better.

113
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,574
So I got to know her more.

114
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:46,645
I discovered that she’s
actually really funny.

115
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,646
They just look cute together.

116
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,014
And they’re very hungry for this role.

117
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,018
And, you know, I love the collaboration.

118
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,519
And, you know,

119
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,488
how they prepare for the characters,

120
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,492
They really do it 110%.

121
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,567
Hello. Today is going to be
the workshop with Aubrey.

122
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,637
So this is a chance for me
to really grasp the

123
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,041
the character of Clyden and
get to know more of Samantha Vera.

124
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,945
We also discussed on, like,
how are we going to be on the same page

125
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,347
and how are we going
to work together as a team.

126
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,550
So we can give justice to Sam and Clyden.

127
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,052
I was really challenged.

128
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,689
Like they said, it’s okay to fail.

129
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,024
It’s okay to try and try again.

130
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,291
That’s when you’ll learn.

131
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,795
And I’m really grateful to Ms. Ana.

132
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,863
She really pushed me.

133
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,767
For me to be more comfortable
and more confident

134
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,635
in portraying Sam.

135
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,805
Her techniques really worked well for us.

136
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,541
We really went out of our comfort zones.

137
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,976
Just a leap of faith.

138
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,111
Just forget all our problems.

139
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,214
Just focus on just being us
and focus on the characters.

140
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,383
I’ve become more comfortable around her.

141
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,953
And I’m not scared of
opening up to her anymore.

142
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,821
I’m comfortable with him.

143
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:07,559
But it’s also kind of awkward in that we’re
not just co-actors, we’re a love team.

144
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,329
But I really appreciate him as an actor.

145
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,331
Are you jealous right now?

146
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,799
No.

147
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,934
Just facts.

148
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,501
He’s just a friend, right?

149
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,003
No, I think you’re jealous.

150
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:18,438
Just admit it.

151
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,674
This is not the first time Ms. Ana
has worked as my acting coach.

152
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:27,012
She’s been the acting coach
since the start of the University Series.

153
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,248
I also learned to be more free.

154
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,819
Like I know that we have our
own personal baggages that’s just ours.

155
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,254
You don’t have to bare everything.

156
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,390
But you have to loosen up.

157
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,891
You’d have to give everything.

158
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,860
You can’t just always hold back.

159
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,595
You shouldn’t.

160
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,330
Because Sam is different from Aubrey.

161
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,575
And today is our Dog Immersion Day.

162
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:00,345
We’re doing this to get
more familiar with the dogs.

163
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,513
In AOTD.

164
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,416
So I’m more ready.

165
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,143
- To be more comfortable with the dogs.
- So I get more comfortable with the dogs.

166
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,087
This one...

167
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,087
This is...

168
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,223
This is Icy.

169
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,224
And he’ll be playing...

170
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,629
So he’ll be playing Maple.

171
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,064
He was supposed to be the chow chow.

172
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,168
But he’s an Aspin.

173
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,641
Ruru.

174
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,711
- Meet Ruru, guys. The husky.
- The husky.

175
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,514
And he’s gonna play Hail.

176
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,256
Sit.

177
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,689
Sit.

178
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:50,296
Hail, or Ruru, is the calmest of the three.

179
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,264
And the last one...

180
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,065
Here he is.

181
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,466
It's your time to shine.

182
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,302
- It’s your time to shine.
- Clyden’s OG baby.

183
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,204
It’s your time to shine. Come here.

184
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,925
- Sumo.
- You’ve been trying to get attention.

185
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,813
This is Sumo, the golden retriever.

186
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,350
- And he’s gonna play?
- Summer!

187
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,652
They’re so playful.

188
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:13,819
Hello.

189
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,554
Just touch them.

190
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,957
Tomorrow you can’t flinch.

191
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,225
I know, right.

192
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,760
Okay. I’ll be able to do it tomorrow.

193
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,194
Hi, Sumo.

194
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,196
Good thing Summer and Sumo sound alike.

195
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:25,731
Yeah.

196
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,799
He really loves it.

197
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,702
He really loves us, right?

198
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:34,139
We already got to work
with Sumo on the first day.

199
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,975
- First day.
- Our first day shoot.

200
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,444
So, Sumo already knows us. Right?

201
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,846
Yeah, Sumo really knows you.

202
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,815
Just hold her. Don’t be scared.

203
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,017
Just touch him.

204
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,384
Are you scared of dogs?

205
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,179
No. Only when they’re too playful.

206
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,290
To be honest, I'm really nervous.

207
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:56,895
It's my first time to be
this close to a husky.

208
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,965
I’m already familiar with Sumo.

209
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,968
But I'm still scared
because he’s so playful.

210
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,202
I’m not used to it.

211
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,904
And Icy’s there.

212
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:06,672
I enjoyed it.

213
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:09,308
But it’s tiring because
it feels like the dog is walking me.

214
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,343
I should be the one walking them.

215
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,880
But I did enjoy the experience
and I’ve learned a lot.

216
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,114
Sit high.

217
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,449
Sit high.

218
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,184
Sit.

219
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,719
Sit high. Sit.

220
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,353
Sit high.

221
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:21,454
He’s not doing it.

222
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,954
Okay. Okay. Sit.

223
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,955
Sit high.

224
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,390
Sit high.

225
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,658
No, no.

226
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:27,926
No.

227
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:32,898
Getting better, guys.

228
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,233
Okay, one more time.

229
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,335
Let’s show it to them.

230
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,237
Ruru. Okay. Sit.

231
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,071
Sit high.

232
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,041
Sit high.

233
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,110
No. Sit high.

234
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,515
Okay! Yay!

235
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,286
Sumo.

236
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:56,889
Sumo.

237
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,258
Sumo.

238
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,193
Yeah.

239
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,030
Sit, baby. Sit.

240
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,363
Yes.

241
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:09,168
I’m glad Sumo’s grown comfortable with me.

242
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,706
He knows when I’m the one calling him.

243
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,008
Yes, I am a dog person.

244
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:17,642
Sumo.

245
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:18,977
Sumo.

246
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,311
Sumo.

247
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,013
Come here.

248
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,447
Come back.

249
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,515
See how he came back?

250
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:23,615
Sit.

251
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,520
So, it brings me a lot of memories.

252
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,056
We used to have a
golden retriever back home.

253
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,726
I’m glad Sumo’s here now.

254
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,561
I started liking them...

255
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,629
since I was a kid.

256
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,666
That’s why I really
have a soft spot for dogs.

257
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,402
Stay.

258
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,869
Close door.

259
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,337
Close door.

260
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:49,942
Stay.

261
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,110
Stay.

262
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,111
Speak.

263
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,115
We became more comfortable with the dogs.

264
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,883
Especially to Summer.

265
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,786
And we’re very excited to
have them on set with us.

266
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,054
For me...

267
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,091
I also enjoyed it,
but it was just really tiring.

268
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:09,395
But I think I’m more
confident with the dogs now.

269
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,030
I’m ready to be with them on the set.

270
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,031
Sumo.

271
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,601
Nice.

272
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,203
Sumo.

273
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,037
Oh, his leash.

274
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,037
Sumo.

275
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,273
That wasn’t scripted, okay.

276
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,682
First, I think that was auditions.

277
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,484
My posture that time...

278
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,818
I used to slouch a lot.

279
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,053
My posture wasn’t good.

280
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,821
And that was the first thing Gino noticed.

281
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,389
“You should work on your posture.”

282
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,658
“You’re a model. You
should stand like this.”

283
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:45,998
But I don’t know how to do it
because I don’t have proper training.

284
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,577
Viva enrolling me in a modeling school
was such a big help.

285
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,245
Hi, I’m Rikki Abuel Dela Peña.

286
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,848
I am the producer and director
of Manila Fashion Runway.

287
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:08,754
I'm also one of the model
mentors for Block Modeling School.

288
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,990
Where Aubrey attended.

289
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,924
We have a crash course.

290
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,394
So, it's an introduction to modeling.

291
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,965
We told the students how
competitive the modeling industry is.

292
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,803
Aside from that, we also
taught them how to pose,

293
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:30,675
proper posture, facial expression
and fashion styling for models.

294
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,678
I really learned a lot from
the modeling workshop.

295
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,913
At the workshop,

296
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:39,984
I had to wear high heels
for three hours with a straight body.

297
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,419
With a posture like this.

298
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,024
So it was really a big challenge for me.

299
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:50,395
Aubrey is actually one of our favorites.

300
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,499
We didn’t know she was a famous actress.

301
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,333
She was just so humble.

302
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,501
To the model mentors.

303
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,803
She was very obedient.

304
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,841
And she was super friendly
to all her aspiring model classmates.

305
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,610
It was a really big challenge for me.

306
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,644
But it’s really helped me.

307
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,981
I’m able to apply it everywhere now.

308
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,183
Like sometimes, when I slouch,
I immediately fix my posture.

309
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,785
Because they used to correct us every time.

310
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:14,786
“Don’t slouch.”

311
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,120
“This is how you walk.”

312
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,857
She’s quick to pick up things.

313
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,792
And she’s only attended a few classes,

314
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,328
but she already has a good walk.

315
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,462
I’ve already applied it.

316
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,029
Before a photoshoot.

317
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,266
Marco and Heaven noticed it.

318
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,601
They told me.

319
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,269
Why are you walking like this?

320
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,771
I said, “No. I learned
that from modeling class..”

321
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,908
And she said, “Oh, that’s why you
look so much like a model.”

322
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,309
And I said, “Really?”

323
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,979
And so I thought, wow.

324
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,480
So the classes really helped.

325
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,316
‘Cause even my co-actors
noticed the difference.

326
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,285
Once you’re a model,
you should own it.

327
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,855
At first glance, they’d
say, “This is a model.”

328
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,296
Of course, we just watched her
walk with her classmates.

329
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,032
And she also walked
with professional models.

330
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,003
You wouldn’t think that she
just graduated from modeling school.

331
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,739
Because she really leveled up.

332
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,308
We saw the improvements on her walk,

333
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,442
in her poses,

334
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:15,014
and most visibly, with
her facial expressions.

335
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,651
One thing that we actually noticed
with Aubrey was her height.

336
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,818
And her physical attributes.

337
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,488
She really fits the modeling standards.

338
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,090
And when she did her walk,

339
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,027
we really saw how

340
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,362
she could be successful
in the modeling industry.

341
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,698
I hope you enjoyed the show.

342
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,699
Yes!

343
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,076
I told you I’d follow.

344
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,083
I'm really happy and grateful.

345
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,618
Finally, after six days of workshop,

346
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:30,731
I was able to walk the runway
and it was successful.

347
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,123
I didn’t trip.

348
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,391
I didn’t make a mistake.

349
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,828
I enjoyed the whole journey.

350
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,429
She really put a lot of effort into this.

351
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,533
And I know that she takes pride
in whatever she does.

352
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,703
And it wasn’t Aubrey who I saw.

353
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,507
It was Maui walking.

354
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:51,249
I didn’t know Lance was here.

355
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,678
- Promise, I didn’t know.
- Promise?

356
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:54,747
Promise!

357
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,080
Promise! I had no idea.

358
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,483
It’s because of the lights.
On the runway...

359
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,719
I was looking far ahead.

360
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,254
Promise, I didn’t see Lance.

361
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,255
I Swear.

362
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:06,205
I had no idea he was here.

363
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,925
On the runway, we were taught that

364
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,957
you have to look far and straight.

365
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:14,899
So, I wasn’t able to see the audience.

366
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,469
She was just really focused on her work.

367
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,705
If I knew Lance was here,
I would have panicked.

368
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,706
How dramatic.

369
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,574
But thank you.
Thank you for coming.

370
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,144
- Thank you for making time.
- Of course.

371
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,346
I guess my takeaway is.

372
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,093
You should believe in yourself first.

373
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,850
Before anyone else believes you’re a model.

374
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,953
So first thing in the morning,
you should tell yourself, “I’m a model.”

375
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,056
“I’m confident. I’m beautiful.” Like that.

376
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,057
Wow.

377
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,094
That’s what they told us.

378
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,063
You should own your moment.

379
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,400
And to be honest,
her confidence was apparent.

380
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,603
Really. Promise.

381
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,255
It's starting to feel like it's real now.

382
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:16,227
The pre-production for
Avenues of the Diamond has begun.

383
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,830
So, the scripting has also started.

384
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,998
Before I wasn’t thinking about it.

385
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:25,971
Now, we’re focused on checking
the script, and the look test.

386
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,245
It’s been a long time since
I started feeling like Sam again.

387
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,547
We reviewed my past looks

388
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,449
from books one, two and three.

389
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,617
And there are some changes.

390
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,419
It’s become more detailed.

391
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,087
It’s my first look test.

392
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,623
And it's my first time having a partner.

393
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,094
So, we tried on different clothes,
like the past, the present.

394
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,930
What matches us, our
personalities, our characters.

395
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:56,401
I was waiting for the
look test before judging.

396
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:01,939
Now that I see him
wearing Clyden’s uniform,

397
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
Clyden’s style,

398
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,278
I can see that he really
fits the description.

399
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,513
It's a weight off my shoulders.

400
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,481
Finally they’re complete.

401
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,419
We won’t have to go through another search.

402
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,223
I was starstruck when I met Gwy.

403
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,659
When I met her, she was holding the book.

404
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,528
I always wanted a book for myself.

405
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,239
Actually she asked me if I wanted one.

406
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:31,102
And I said, only when I deserve it.

407
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,406
When I’m able to give
justice to Clyden’s character.

408
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,608
Then I would gladly accept the book.

409
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:41,698
I’m so happy Gwy was there to
see Sam’s looks from the past,

410
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,990
I mean, even when she has seen them before.

411
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,655
And the differences to the present looks.

412
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,353
Naomi looks a lot like Sam.

413
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,421
So, plus points for that.

414
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:54,559
From the look test,
you’d really see they’re like sisters.

415
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,262
When I found out she was Naomi,

416
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,330
I was just so happy.

417
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,134
When I was randomly thinking of
someone to portray Naomi, I thought of her.

418
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,571
And then at the look test,
we were really comfortable with each other.

419
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,240
As soon as we met, we already knew.

420
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,476
Aubrey and I were talking about it.

421
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,312
We feel like we both manifested this.

422
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,847
When they said she still didn’t have
a sister for Avenues of the Diamond,

423
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:17,848
I claimed it.

424
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,787
He was really looking
forward to the look test.

425
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,958
At first he was nervous, but he enjoyed it.

426
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,292
Everyone was just having fun.

427
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,363
The production staff, everyone,
were just cheering for us.

428
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,533
And they were the ones
getting all giddy about us.

429
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,435
It was a nice feeling.

430
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,438
At least his first look test
was a great experience.

431
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,941
There were times I laughed a lot.

432
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,143
Everyone was teasing us so much.

433
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,346
Aubrey!
Pretending like she doesn’t feel anything.

434
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,347
Okay.

435
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,219
It's going to be fun on set.

436
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,321
It's also going to be challenging for us.

437
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,992
It's my first time
having this kind of a role.

438
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,327
It’s so nice to do a look test with Gino.

439
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,430
It was fun.
We were able to talk a lot about

440
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,700
clothes, make up and the look.

441
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,869
Sam’s look for AOTD is crucial.

442
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,705
I was able to figure out
what works better for her.

443
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,841
Because of the look test.

444
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,247
When I found out Gino
was going to be the director,

445
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,382
I was so happy.

446
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,916
It’s not just a romcom.

447
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,618
It’s about fashion.

448
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,819
About politics.

449
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,389
It’s about a lot of things.

450
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,624
We’ll be tackling a lot of issues.

451
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,292
You can use your lips like this.

452
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,993
Actually, I got intimidated at first.

453
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,630
I first met Gino at the auditions.

454
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:43,367
And his aura was just intimidating.

455
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,838
I came back because I miss them.

456
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,441
I miss the entire cast. I miss,

457
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,676
the Univerkada.

458
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:56,181
And I really wanted to do this
because it's a different texture.

459
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,817
It's something that's close to me.

460
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,386
I love fashion.

461
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:06,158
And I love the upbeat world of Sam Vera.

462
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,427
And that's what drew me to this book.

463
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,728
And that's why I'm back.

464
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:14,298
And I'm so happy and grateful to be back
directing.

465
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,467
Avenues of the Diamond.

466
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,302
I remember him calling.

467
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,349
Liked hi messaged me on social media.

468
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,839
He said, if I’m free, I should call him.

469
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,808
Something like that.

470
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,010
So I was wondering, why should I call him?

471
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,013
Then I started feeling it,
“I think he’s my director.”

472
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,447
So I called him.

473
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,216
So he told me, “It’s
true. I’m the director.”

474
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,384
I was like, oh my god.

475
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,286
Super dramatic.

476
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,821
I was shouting at him on the phone,
“I knew it, I knew it.”

477
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:37,689
Something like that.

478
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,258
Even then, during the call,
we already talked about a lot of things.

479
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:46,964
So even then, I already saw
how much Gino has thought about it.

480
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,099
The best of the best.

481
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,801
He will give his best.

482
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,471
And he’ll get the best out of them.

483
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,872
I’d say that he has helped me a lot.

484
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,509
Every before take, he tells me

485
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,810
this is how I want you
to attack this scene.

486
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,747
We’ve become more open
and comfortable with each other.

487
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,817
I’m really happy and grateful for Gino.

488
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,119
That he’s our director.

489
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,091
He’s been a big help in
bringing out the Sam in me.

490
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,728
He is the best director for this series.

491
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:32,811
I grew up watching Bobby
Andrews and Claudine Barretto.

492
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,179
It’s been full circle.

493
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,118
From watching them every weekend on TV.

494
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,819
And now I’m finally directing them.

495
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,188
And, they're so cool.

496
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,290
They're so light to work with,
and they're very collaborative,

497
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,925
and they're the sweetest.

498
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,026
Especially Claudine.

499
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,096
Claudine is the sweetest.

500
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,497
Also, she’s a big fan of sweets.

501
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,232
So, we have that in common.

502
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,902
And, I love working with her.

503
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,905
It's such, you know,
it's such an honor to work

504
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,406
with the Miss Claudine Barretto.

505
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,909
Working with Miss Claudine and Sir Bobby.

506
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,735
Very, very nostalgic because,

507
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,246
I used to just watch them.

508
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,515
And I’ve idolized them since then.

509
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,586
Like, growing up, I used to watch Anak.

510
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:17,688
Dahil Mahal na Mahal Kita. Those films.

511
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,792
It’s really just an
honor to work with them.

512
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,361
From the first scene, of course I
knew AOTD has already begun.

513
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,682
But when I started acting with
Miss Claudine and Sir Bobby,

514
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,100
it was just so surreal.

515
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,937
Miss Claudine, the Optimum Star, is my mom?

516
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,804
And then, Sir Bobby?

517
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,573
I only used to watch them.

518
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,009
And they’re real superstars.

519
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,478
We had a scene together.

520
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,547
I was okay. I was doing a pretty good job.

521
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,050
Getting it in one take.

522
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,320
But when I was with Miss Claudine.

523
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,055
It was a dinner scene.

524
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,157
With Sir Bobby Andrews.

525
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,259
I started panicking inside.

526
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,297
It hasn’t sunk in yet that I was working
with Miss Claudine and Sir Bobby.

527
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,400
And they’re playing my parents.

528
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,434
And I’m the lead role.

529
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:08,440
The pressure, excitement and everything,
all just started piling up.

530
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,444
So that time, I couldn’t act well.

531
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,613
So Gino was making me redo the scene.

532
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,816
Then I started feeling embarrassed.

533
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,684
But they were so nice.

534
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,520
They were so patient with me.

535
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,457
Then Gino talked to me outside.

536
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,025
He asked me how I felt.

537
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,962
I said I was nervous and
just started breaking down.

538
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:35,852
You know, Abby...

539
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:40,714
She’s worked with Wenn Deramas growing up.

540
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,376
And she knows how to prepare for the role.

541
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,076
She knows what she's doing.

542
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:49,413
And, you know, it's...
When I talked to her about the role.

543
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,315
I told her it's a very sensitive role.

544
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,550
And she said she knows.

545
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:58,089
And she knows what a big impact
her role as Naomi here in the series has.

546
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,159
A lot of the youth are experiencing
this type of

547
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,827
mental illness

548
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,728
that we want to shed light on.

549
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,934
And, you know,
Abby is so strong to take on this role.

550
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,869
And, we're all rooting for her, you know?

551
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:18,442
And we just want to tell a story
that can impact this generation.

552
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:21,980
It wasn’t hard to work with Abby.

553
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,050
I mean, I know how she works.

554
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,252
I’m really looking forward
to working with Abby.

555
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,721
I know she can do the role justice.

556
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:31,989
She even asked me back then

557
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,326
if the role of my sister was already cast.

558
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,726
And I said it wasn’t cast yet.

559
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,562
Back then, I didn’t know she
was already manifesting it.

560
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:39,630
“I’ll play your sister.”

561
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,499
Like that. So she really manifested it.

562
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,836
But I’m excited because I
know Abby is a good actress.

563
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,237
And she will definitely help me.

564
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,709
Especially with the heavy scenes,
which we have a lot of.

565
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,713
So working with the whole Univerkada
is really fulfilling.

566
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,881
I haven’t really had the chance to

567
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:01,986
have real friends outside taping.

568
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,723
Friends that I could always hang out with.

569
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,660
I’m just glad I found genuine
friends at the same time.

570
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,528
It’s like they’re my family.

571
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,136
You’re too proud.

572
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,006
You want me to carry you?

573
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,206
Fine!

574
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,044
Cut!

575
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:28,245
A lot of tension I would say.

576
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,215
We’re also starting to
get more comfortable.

577
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,751
And she’s so good!

578
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,285
For me...

579
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:39,890
It’s like this every time
we start shooting a series.

580
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,692
The first scene always takes time.

581
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,727
And we did a lot of things.

582
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:44,795
But I enjoyed it.

583
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,230
It was tiring but... yeah.

584
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,166
Every day I read the script.

585
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,435
I also try to do some method acting.

586
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,039
I boought a ring which I never take off.

587
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,510
I wear glasses even though
I don’t usually wear one.

588
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:04,381
Just doing small things so
I always feel connected to Clyden.

589
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:11,021
First few shooting days was all about getting
Clyden’s nonchalance and snobby attitude.

590
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,558
Because, as Lance,
I’m really not like that.

591
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,028
I’m very expressive. Very emotional.

592
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,941
So when I was trying to get into Clyden’s
character, I had a hard time with that.

593
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:24,401
The energy I gave from
book one to book four,

594
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,303
it was all the same.

595
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:28,639
Whether I was in a supporting role,
or now that I’m the lead,

596
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,443
my energy is always super high.

597
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,713
I’m always bubbly and happy on the set.

598
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,718
Actually, it’s more tiring,
but also more enjoyable.

599
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,429
Especially the first shooting day.

600
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,020
That’s only when it started sinking in.

601
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,790
This is it. I’m the lead.

602
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,926
After how many days of shooting

603
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:52,262
they’ve really gotten a
grasp of their characters.

604
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:56,333
I’m really glad we were
guided by Gino, Ms. Ana

605
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,403
and with the help of the whole production,

606
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,038
everything feels easier.

607
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:03,575
The fourth book.

608
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:06,910
I’m happy, first of all, with Viva.

609
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,247
They don’t stop trying to do better.

610
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:15,552
I’m really, really excited the
Univerkada is getting back together.

611
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,589
Congratulations, first of all.

612
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,592
To Aubrey, I’m so proud of you.
This is your moment.

613
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,293
This is what we’ve been waiting for.

614
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,997
For Lance, please take care of Aubrey.

615
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:27,832
I love that girl so much!

616
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,134
I’m warning you.

617
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,271
I know that you both can do it.

618
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,339
Good luck. And just enjoy it.

619
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,875
Enjoy the moment.
Enjoy the process.

620
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,476
Don’t feel too pressured.

621
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:43,413
I hope you know the
whole Univerkada is here for you.

622
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,349
Because she’s been there for us throughout.

623
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,753
I'm so happy that it's
finally your time to shine.

624
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:53,090
And I'm really happy to see that you're
working with someone

625
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,561
that you seem really happy to be with
and to work with.

626
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,095
I'm just going to be here.

627
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,231
And I’m just so excited

628
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,656
because this journey,

629
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,268
whatever we’ll all go through,

630
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,804
I'm just happy that I am part of this

631
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,375
and I get to see and hear all about it.

632
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,077
Aubs, I know you can do this.

633
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,812
Aubrey deserves this so much.

634
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,850
Even off-cam, I see Sam in her.

635
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,018
I’m also very excited because

636
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:25,623
I read the book and
Gwy wrote a very beautiful story.

637
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,093
If you fall in love,
don’t stop it.

638
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,629
Just let it happen.

639
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:37,634
I’m so happy that you’re
my partner in this series.

640
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,504
We have the same goals.

641
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,138
That we want this.

642
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:45,175
We’ve been waiting for this moment,
when we’re finally the leads.

643
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,779
And I just want to thank you because.

644
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,948
You always make sure that I’m okay.

645
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,084
Let’s just enjoy this journey.

646
00:30:53,885 --> 00:31:00,357
And let’s claim that our love team,
and this series, will become successful.

647
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:05,596
And I hope this opens up
opportunities for the both of us.

648
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,966
I hope we can really push
through with everything

649
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,237
and we can overcome any
challenge that comes our way.

650
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,939
And I believe we can do this.

651
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,609
And just like what Clyden told Sam,

652
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,411
“her final walk will always be with me.”

653
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,949
But as Lance and Aubrey,
I hope this isn’t our final walk.
