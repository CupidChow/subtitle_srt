1
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:13,596
What really makes
Christmas special is

2
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,432
the people you spend it with.

3
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,058
You probably know me already,

4
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,499
so I won’t bother
introducing myself.

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,646
Do you think
there’s pain there, Sam?

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,192
It’s a ruthless
world out there, Maui.

7
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,986
Then what do you want me to do?

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,696
Should I just follow
everything you say, then?

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,490
You’re the one who
fucked up your own life.

10
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,868
Just in case anything
happens to us,

11
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,579
you need Clyden.

12
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,664
You’re the only
good thing in this world.

13
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,505
You two are so cute,
I hope you never break up.

14
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,253
Go.

15
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,714
You’re gonna miss your flight.

16
00:00:59,017 --> 00:00:59,684
Cy!

17
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,560
You really think I’d let you go
to Singapore alone?

18
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,812
Of course, I’m coming with you.

19
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,732
First out of the country
trip together.

20
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,150
We’re gonna have so much fun!

21
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,153
Yes! Singapore, baby!

22
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,619
So here’s the shots.

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,496
- Good, that’s good.
- Right.

24
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,932
- Sam, this way.
- Okay.

25
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,313
Hi, Sam!

26
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,816
- Lena, hi!
- Very nice to meet you here.

27
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,609
Nice to meet you, Lena.

28
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,277
Hello.

29
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,278
Nice to meet you
as well. Please.

30
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,278
Have a seat, please.

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,285
We’ve had a lot of
really positive feedback

32
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,828
from different brands
we showed your portfolio to.

33
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,248
You’re a real standout, Sam.

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,667
You’re exactly what
these brands are looking for -

35
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,585
versatile and fresh.

36
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,587
That’s right.

37
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,549
The demand for a model like you,
it’s really high these days.

38
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,427
And you’ve got a real future
here in this industry.

39
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,890
I mean that. We’re really
excited to work with you.

40
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,392
Thank you, I’m equally excited
to work with you all.

41
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,728
This means a lot to me.

42
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,565
But I just want to be
upfront about something.

43
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,441
Sure.

44
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,066
I’m happy to take
international bookings,

45
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,736
but I'd prefer to
remain Manila-based.

46
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,738
It’s definitely possible, Sam.

47
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,282
We can work with that.

48
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,368
But we wanna be
transparent with you.

49
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,330
The demand here
in Singapore is high.

50
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,000
You might find yourself
flying frequently in and out.

51
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,418
Could be New York, could be L.A.

52
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,545
Anywhere in the world.

53
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,634
You’re gonna have to juggle
a really tight schedule.

54
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,763
That means both
Cy and I will be busy.

55
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,224
But this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

56
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,852
I’m sure Cy will
support me on this one.

57
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,605
Yeah, it’s okay.
I can handle it.

58
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,941
Great! We’re all set then.

59
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,317
Are you free for
some headshots later?

60
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,527
Yeah, I'm ready.

61
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,696
Fantastic, thank you.

62
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,601
Can you tilt your
head to the side?

63
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,602
Like this?

64
00:05:57,892 --> 00:05:59,268
Your turn, love.

65
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,617
Hi love, you did great today.

66
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,745
Thanks for coming
with me to the shoot.

67
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,497
You eased my nerves.

68
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,623
But.

69
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,292
I feel a bit guilty because
instead of resting,

70
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,586
you still came with me.

71
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,005
Love, don’t feel guilty.

72
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,800
That’s exactly why I’m here,
to support you.

73
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,012
Okay.

74
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,226
Let me make it up
to you tonight.

75
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,853
Really?

76
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,443
How are you gonna
make it up to me?

77
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,408
I’ll shower first.

78
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,787
Hurry.

79
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,791
And hey, don’t sleep
on me, okay?

80
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,127
Of course.

81
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,733
Love…

82
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,361
Huh?

83
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,199
Oh shit.

84
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,744
Oh my god.

85
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,163
Sorry, I fell asleep.

86
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,165
Why didn’t you wake me up?

87
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,042
I was tired too.

88
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,046
That’s why I ended up
falling asleep as well.

89
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,757
I’m sorry.

90
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,467
You looked so excited yesterday,

91
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,138
and I just ended up
sleeping on you.

92
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,472
Was it really me
who was excited or you?

93
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:22,257
Hey, it’s okay.

94
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,355
We’ve got the whole day
to ourselves anyway.

95
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,983
So let’s go out on a date.

96
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,653
Sure. But first,

97
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,907
let’s finish where
we left off last night.

98
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,601
There are a lot of people here.

99
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,062
The view would
look great at night.

100
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,646
Yeah.

101
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,649
It’s so nice here.

102
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,193
But let’s still
take a picture now.

103
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,537
Have you been to
Singapore before, love?

104
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,163
Yeah, why?

105
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,381
Then why do you act
like it’s your first time?

106
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,044
You’ve been taking
photos non-stop.

107
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,004
It’s my first time with you.

108
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,592
I want to document everything,
every moment we have together.

109
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,387
What a sweet talker.

110
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,515
Come on, I really mean it.

111
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:07,977
Cy...

112
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,480
When I start getting
international bookings,

113
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,691
I’ll be busy.

114
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,988
And I’m sure, you’ll be busy
with your clerkship too.

115
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,575
Are we going to be okay?

116
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Love...

117
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,204
Of course, we’re
going to be okay.

118
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,084
It’s normal for us to be
busy chasing our dreams.

119
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,794
But we’ll work it out.

120
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:41,677
Maybe we should set a specific
day just for our quality time.

121
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,975
Yeah, we should. And it has
to be non-negotiable.

122
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,734
We shouldn’t schedule
anything on those days.

123
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,782
All right. I agree!

124
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,578
I feel scared and
excited at the same time.

125
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,581
This is it.

126
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,085
This is the start of us
making our dreams come true.

127
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,758
And I’m happy to go
through all these with you.

128
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,355
How sweet!

129
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,763
Open the package from your dad.

130
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,764
Okay.

131
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,894
It’s so nice!

132
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,603
- Yeah.
- Wow.

133
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,604
It’s nice.

134
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,108
- Let’s try it on you.
- Okay.

135
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,156
You look like
a respectable doctor now.

136
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,868
Why? Didn’t I look
respectable before?

137
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,911
I don’t know.

138
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,788
Just kidding.

139
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,082
Let me try it on you.

140
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,972
Why is your heart
beating so fast?

141
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,725
You heard wrong.

142
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,063
Your heartbeat never lies, Maui.

143
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,193
It never lies.

144
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,165
Wait, I’m sorry...

145
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,833
I got an email notification.

146
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,667
Okay.

147
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,085
It might be from the agency.

148
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,215
Oh my god.

149
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,967
Oh my god, Cy!

150
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,844
What?

151
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,012
You know
"The Lab by Blanc Doux”?

152
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,513
That popular skincare brand?

153
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,098
Yeah.

154
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,808
They want me to be
a model for their product.

155
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,518
- Really?
- Look!

156
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,519
- Let me see.
- Yeah!

157
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,860
Congratulations, love!

158
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,781
Oh my god, I’m so happy.

159
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,240
I’ve waited so long for this.

160
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,242
Thank you, Cy.

161
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,204
But I think this might be
the start of our busy era.

162
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,164
I know,

163
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,250
but we promised to have our regular
date every Sunday, right?

164
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,045
But don’t think
about it just yet.

165
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,173
Focus on the opportunity
that’s right in front of you.

166
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,593
I’m proud of you.

167
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,059
Oh my god. I’m so happy.

168
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,899
Guys, final touches.

169
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,532
And pose.

170
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,786
Nice! One more!

171
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,937
- Especially if we suspect—
- Smiling...

172
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,459
Hey.

173
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,667
Good morning. Are you going out?

174
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,294
Yeah. Early morning shoot.
And you?

175
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,629
- Just about to sleep?
- Yeah.

176
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,672
All right, you take care.
I love you.

177
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,799
I love you too.

178
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,094
- Good night!
- Good morning.

179
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,353
Love?

180
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,439
Hey.

181
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,775
Love.

182
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,697
I’m ready.

183
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,116
It’s our date night.

184
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,575
Yes.

185
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,912
Do you still want to go?

186
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,541
Should we skip?
'Cause I’m sleepy.

187
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,252
Okay,

188
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,714
- let’s just do it next time.
- Okay.

189
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,591
All right, let’s just
go to sleep.

190
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,220
Goodnight.

191
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,377
Samantha.

192
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,087
Please come here.

193
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,804
Please sit down.

194
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,983
Maui, I’m your mother.

195
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,402
So don’t treat me
like a stranger.

196
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,240
Let’s stop this petty fight
and let’s start talking.

197
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,453
I agreed to let you model,
didn’t I?

198
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,663
What more do you want from me?

199
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,458
Should I thank you for
letting me do what I want, Mom?

200
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,003
Sweetheart, it's not like that.

201
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,298
What I’m trying to say is
that I support you.

202
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,051
So, can you please stop
giving me the cold treatment?

203
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,431
Besides, your dad and I are
going through so much already.

204
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,141
Why?

205
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,643
Did something happen?

206
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,399
No, don’t worry about it.

207
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,944
You know how it is in business,
there are lots of traitors.

208
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,905
Don’t worry about it.

209
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,657
What’s important, Maui, is that

210
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,951
you and Clyden are okay.

211
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,370
Because if you
and Clyden are okay,

212
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,916
you’ll be fine.

213
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,001
Just trust me, okay?

214
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,235
You’re getting
good at this, huh?

215
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,196
It’s therapeutic, Sam.

216
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,240
Especially when
I’m doing this with you.

217
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,535
How’s your therapy lately?

218
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,955
Are you taking your meds?

219
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,708
I’m good. I’m also doing
well in school.

220
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,585
That’s great to hear!

221
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,256
How about you?
How’s your modelling gig?

222
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,302
Things have been hectic,
but I’m having a lot of fun.

223
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,846
Lately, I’ve even been
practicing my walk.

224
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,016
But I still feel
super self-conscious.

225
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,977
I often make mistakes.

226
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,313
No wonder no one’s booked me
for a fashion show yet.

227
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,483
Just be patient.

228
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,443
You’ll book a fashion show soon.

229
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,069
You’re beautiful.

230
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,406
You just need a little bit
more confidence.

231
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,409
You know why?
It’s because you slouch.

232
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:27,286
- Really?
- You need to...

233
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:27,995
- You need to—
- Yeah.

234
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,371
- I should keep my body straight?
- Yes.

235
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,580
- Like that.
- Can you show me?

236
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:31,914
Okay…

237
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,212
You know what,
I’m the older sister

238
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:38,967
but in moments like this,

239
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:40,705
you’re more mature than me.

240
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:43,379
And I’m lucky
to have you, Naomi.

241
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,091
I’m luckier to have you, Sam.

242
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:49,470
Now, keep mixing that.

243
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:53,681
Wait.

244
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:57,895
Hi, Lena.

245
00:21:58,062 --> 00:21:59,687
Sam, great news!

246
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:03,566
There is a show that needs
one more model this week.

247
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:07,278
We recommended you,
and they loved your portfolio.

248
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:09,030
They want to meet you ASAP.

249
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:12,867
Plus, Giselle will also
be there. So, are you in?

250
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:14,537
Oh my god, a fashion show?

251
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:16,246
Of course, I’m in!

252
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,498
Awesome!
Rehearsals have started,

253
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:20,500
so you need to fly here
tomorrow afternoon.

254
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:21,710
Is that okay?

255
00:22:22,294 --> 00:22:24,046
Yeah. No worries,
I’ll fix my sched.

256
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:27,590
Good. Then I’ll book
your ticket. See you, Sam.

257
00:22:27,591 --> 00:22:28,843
Yeah. See you.

258
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,260
Bye.

259
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:34,098
Oh my god, Naomi! I’m so happy!

260
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,727
I heard everything. See?
I told you, just be patient.

261
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:40,728
Yeah.

262
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:44,232
I’m so blessed.

263
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:46,152
Blessed to have you.

264
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:49,405
- So excited!
- Me too.

265
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:50,947
Okay. Go, Sam. Show me.

266
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:52,533
- Show me.
- Okay. I’ll show you.

267
00:22:55,327 --> 00:22:56,662
Like that or like this?

268
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,414
Okay.

269
00:22:58,914 --> 00:23:01,083
Sam, you need to be
more confident.

270
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:03,919
So that’s how it’s done.

271
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:08,424
But I feel like
you’re actually better.

272
00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:09,924
No.

273
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:11,134
Okay.

274
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:30,653
Dr. Ramirez, we need to talk.

275
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:32,488
Doc Lucas, what happened?

276
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:33,573
Did you inform Mrs. Cruz

277
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:35,909
that she needs to get a blood
test before the treatment?

278
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,494
It’s not noted in her chart.

279
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,200
Sorry, Doc. I wasn’t able
to relay it to the patient.

280
00:23:40,915 --> 00:23:42,041
Seriously?

281
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,668
Mrs. Cruz was supposed
to have her treatment today,

282
00:23:45,211 --> 00:23:46,170
but now we have to postpone it

283
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:48,171
because you didn’t inform her
about the blood test.

284
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:51,717
Sorry, Doc. It was really
an honest mistake.

285
00:23:52,051 --> 00:23:53,260
An honest mistake?

286
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:56,305
You know, one mistake
can cost someone’s life!

287
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:58,348
Look,

288
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:00,059
I know you’re a Ramirez.

289
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:01,977
But lives are on the line here.

290
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:05,188
Let this be a lesson.
And please,

291
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:06,589
make sure this
doesn’t happen again.

292
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:09,485
Sorry. I’m sorry, Doc.

293
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:46,146
Guess what, Yanna.

294
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,775
I used your grandmother’s
recipe for my champorado!

295
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:53,445
But I added dark chocolate
to make it extra chocolatey.

296
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:56,906
Wow, your champorado
is so fancy,

297
00:24:56,907 --> 00:24:58,534
dark chocolate and all!

298
00:24:58,742 --> 00:25:00,953
You know it tastes
even better with dried fish.

299
00:25:01,287 --> 00:25:02,913
Of course, I added that in.

300
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:05,873
Damn it, Sam. It’s only
six in the morning,

301
00:25:05,874 --> 00:25:07,274
and you’re already
making me hungry.

302
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:09,670
Why did you cook so early?

303
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:13,172
Cy’s coming home from duty soon.

304
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:16,218
It’s been a while since
I’ve had breakfast with him.

305
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:20,306
Our schedules have
been really tough lately.

306
00:25:20,597 --> 00:25:22,807
I have a flight
later this afternoon,

307
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:25,268
and I’ll be gone
for more than a week.

308
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:27,146
Is he going to take you
to the airport?

309
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:28,772
I don’t think so.

310
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:30,441
He doesn’t know it yet.

311
00:25:30,983 --> 00:25:33,234
I’ll tell him later.
You know what?

312
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:34,819
I’m so excited
to see his reaction

313
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,488
since it’s my first
fashion show.

314
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:39,992
He might get too excited
and come with you.

315
00:25:41,118 --> 00:25:42,369
Sounds unlikely.

316
00:25:42,995 --> 00:25:44,413
He’s busy with clerkship.

317
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:46,539
But you never know.

318
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,417
Last time, he actually
went with you, right?

319
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,336
Well,

320
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:54,006
it would be nice
if he could come.

321
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:57,175
Love?

322
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:00,387
Wait. I’ll talk
to you later. Bye.

323
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:02,931
Love! You’re here!

324
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,643
Good news! I have
something to tell you...

325
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:08,644
Love,

326
00:26:09,772 --> 00:26:10,898
maybe later.

327
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,400
I’m really tired.

328
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:15,527
I’m going to rest first, okay?

329
00:26:17,363 --> 00:26:18,363
Sorry.

330
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:27,081
But I’m leaving in a few hours.

331
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:46,516
Hey, love,

332
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:49,061
I finally booked my first
fashion show in Singapore,

333
00:26:49,436 --> 00:26:51,021
and I’m flying this afternoon!

334
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:54,608
I’m so nervous,
but I’m also excited.

335
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:14,043
I didn’t wake you up
because you were fast asleep.

336
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:16,170
I cooked champorado
and dried fish for you.

337
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:18,841
It’s in the fridge.
I also fed the dogs.

338
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:21,552
See you in a week, love.
I love you.

339
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:36,357
Girl, don’t worry, you got this.

340
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:39,110
You look amazing, and
you’ve improved so much...

341
00:27:39,111 --> 00:27:40,194
Especially the walk.

342
00:27:40,195 --> 00:27:41,279
Exactly!

343
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,574
It feels like you’ve
been doing this for years.

344
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,032
Thank you!

345
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:46,535
I’m still learning, though.

346
00:27:56,462 --> 00:27:57,379
Hi, love.

347
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,797
Good luck on your fashion show.

348
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:01,632
Sorry I won’t be there.
I’ll make it up to you

349
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:03,469
when you get back. I love you.

350
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:08,557
Here, so you won’t
miss me too much.

351
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:12,811
But I already miss you.

352
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,147
I’m nervous.

353
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:17,733
This is my look for the show.
Do I look okay?

354
00:28:21,403 --> 00:28:23,613
The show is about
to start in 5 minutes.

355
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:27,242
Here’s the link again!
Wish me luck, love.

356
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:34,625
He might be on duty.

357
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:39,587
Goodluck on
your first show, Sam!

358
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:42,924
I’m watching right now.
I’m so excited for you!

359
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:46,344
You must be so nervous but
remember I’m cheering for you!

360
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:48,262
Smile, be confident,

361
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:50,641
but also, don’t forget to enjoy.

362
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:57,356
Models, models, get ready!

363
00:28:57,523 --> 00:28:59,107
The show is about to start.

364
00:29:21,338 --> 00:29:22,589
Wait for it.

365
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:44,569
Doc Ramirez, you’re all smiles!

366
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,571
Is that your girlfriend?

367
00:29:47,155 --> 00:29:49,740
Yeah, I’m watching her
first fashion show.

368
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:51,075
- It’s being streamed live.
- Girlfriend?

369
00:29:51,076 --> 00:29:53,954
Oh my god, doc!
Can we watch too?

370
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,788
Are you done with work?

371
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:56,331
Yes, doc.

372
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:57,498
- We’re off duty now.
- Yes.

373
00:29:57,499 --> 00:29:58,499
All right then. Here...

374
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,625
- It just started.
- Oh, wait, Doc.

375
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:01,146
Let’s just watch
on the laptop instead.

376
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:02,421
Let me just set it up.

377
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:08,260
Beautiful circles…

378
00:30:08,468 --> 00:30:11,346
And very nice. Okay!

379
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:19,938
This is our star.
Don’t lose her.

380
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:25,234
There you go.

381
00:30:45,005 --> 00:30:47,549
And Samantha, I wanna see
Samantha right now.

382
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:52,346
Doc Ramirez, you’re being called
to report to the ER.

383
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:57,225
You guys go ahead
and keep watching.

384
00:30:57,225 --> 00:30:58,225
All right, Doc.

385
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:47,442
And everything’s stunning.

386
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,952
I guess he missed the show.

387
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:30,544
Sam!

388
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:32,797
What can I say?
You did a great job today.

389
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:34,924
Thank you. I was so nervous.

390
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:37,385
Nervous? You didn’t
look nervous at all.

391
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:40,722
I would love to have you
in my next show.

392
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:44,809
Really? Wow. Thank you.
I’d love it too.

393
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,143
That’s perfect.

394
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:47,978
I’ll tee everything up
with my agency

395
00:33:47,979 --> 00:33:50,398
- and get you all the details.
- Okay, thank you.

396
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:51,566
- Girl!
- Hey!

397
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:54,027
You were so good.
Did you have fun?

398
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:55,946
Thank you.

399
00:33:57,489 --> 00:33:58,990
So this is what
it feels like, huh?

400
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:01,742
While I was walking
on the runway,

401
00:34:01,743 --> 00:34:03,702
I felt like I belonged here.

402
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:06,038
‘Cause you do.
You’re such a natural.

403
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:08,291
I was so amazed.
You looked stunning.

404
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:10,710
By the way, are you going
to the afterparty?

405
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:12,420
I can’t.

406
00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:15,005
My flight back
to Manila is tomorrow,

407
00:34:15,006 --> 00:34:16,508
and it’s super early.

408
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:18,134
That’s too bad.

409
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,346
The guys won’t get to experience
a Samantha Vera party.

410
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:23,722
Maybe next time.

411
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:25,725
My schedule’s just
a bit tight right now.

412
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:27,685
Okay. See you soon.

413
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:28,687
See you!

414
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:41,657
Cy!

415
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:47,329
Cy!

416
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:53,377
Cy?

417
00:35:01,846 --> 00:35:02,972
Maui, I’m sorry.

418
00:35:03,431 --> 00:35:05,682
I got called into
the hospital last minute.

419
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:07,435
Let’s celebrate next time, okay?

420
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:09,645
I’ll make it up to you. Sorry.

421
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:16,360
Thanks for watching Avi,
by the way.

422
00:35:17,236 --> 00:35:19,697
I finally got
to finish reviewing.

423
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:21,032
No problem.

424
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:24,160
How is it?

425
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:26,412
It’s tough.

426
00:35:26,704 --> 00:35:27,954
It’s hard being
in my senior year

427
00:35:27,955 --> 00:35:29,540
while taking care of a baby,

428
00:35:29,749 --> 00:35:31,709
but I’ll manage.

429
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:34,420
What about you?

430
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:37,006
It’s a miracle you’ve
got free time right now!

431
00:35:37,798 --> 00:35:38,798
Yeah.

432
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:41,052
I have vacation days
after my fashion show.

433
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,347
Isn’t Clyden gonna look for you?

434
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:46,390
Don’t you guys have
a celebration today?

435
00:35:50,811 --> 00:35:52,563
Wow, that was deep.

436
00:35:53,022 --> 00:35:54,273
What happened?

437
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:56,983
Yanna, we’ve been so busy

438
00:35:56,984 --> 00:35:59,070
that we barely even
talked to each other.

439
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:02,697
Clyden wasn’t able
to watch my fashion show.

440
00:36:02,698 --> 00:36:07,328
I mean, I get why, but
I was really expecting...

441
00:36:08,621 --> 00:36:10,288
we’d at least celebrate
when I got back,

442
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:11,832
since he promised.

443
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:13,250
But nothing.

444
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,921
I feel like.

445
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:19,381
I’m in a long-distance
relationship

446
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:21,175
even though we live
in the same house.

447
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:25,888
We haven’t even had
a proper conversation in weeks.

448
00:36:28,391 --> 00:36:31,143
I just… I just
miss him so badly.

449
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:36,691
I get it. It’s really hard
when time’s the enemy.

450
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,112
But what if you
don’t wait for him?

451
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:43,447
Plan the date night yourself?

452
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,868
Even just a quick
dinner or something,

453
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:51,956
as long as you two get
to spend time together.

454
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:56,419
You both need that quality time.

455
00:36:58,337 --> 00:36:59,338
Go for it.

456
00:37:05,928 --> 00:37:08,681
Hey, when are you free
for a quick dinner?

457
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,102
I was about to message you.

458
00:37:14,103 --> 00:37:16,563
I’ll be able to get off
early today.

459
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:19,399
I’ll reserve a table for us
at a restaurant if you’re free.

460
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,152
What do you want for dinner?

461
00:37:25,865 --> 00:37:29,577
Yes, I’m free!
I would love steak tonight!

462
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:32,829
All right.

463
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:34,790
See you, love.

464
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,419
We’re having dinner tonight!

465
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:41,589
See? It worked out!

466
00:37:41,922 --> 00:37:44,507
Go on then, get moving
and doll yourself up.

467
00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:48,178
Remind your fiancé just
how irresistible you are.

468
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,220
Exactly.

469
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:51,389
- I’ll see you.
- I’ll see you. Bye.

470
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,266
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

471
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:52,850
Thank you so much.

472
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,850
Thank you.

473
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:56,186
Message me.

474
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:56,937
No need.

475
00:37:56,938 --> 00:37:58,397
It’s fine, we’ll make a video.

476
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:02,776
Bye!

477
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:40,898
Hey.

478
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:42,941
Hey.

479
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:45,860
I have a report
I need to finish.

480
00:38:45,861 --> 00:38:46,861
It came up suddenly.

481
00:38:47,571 --> 00:38:48,739
I’m sorry.

482
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:50,407
Okay.

483
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:54,578
Wait. I’ll be back.

484
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:11,595
Hi, ma’am. Here’s your steak.

485
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:15,056
Thank you.

486
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:37,955
This tastes good.

487
00:39:38,455 --> 00:39:41,125
Just like how Cy
cooks steak for me.

488
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,683
Sen. Vera Faces Plunder Charges

489
00:39:58,684 --> 00:40:02,354
as Wife Investigated
for Illegal Drug Imports.

490
00:40:06,483 --> 00:40:07,943
Hey, did something happen?

491
00:40:12,823 --> 00:40:13,824
My parents.

492
00:40:16,452 --> 00:40:17,952
I was actually
informed about that.

493
00:40:17,953 --> 00:40:19,205
Did you just find out now?

494
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:26,045
I’m sorry.
I need to see my parents.

495
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,415
Honey, you’re here.

496
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:40,309
What the hell is happening?

497
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:42,186
Mom? Dad?

498
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:44,563
Maureen, calm down, okay?

499
00:40:45,981 --> 00:40:46,982
Is it true?

500
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:50,236
The accusations
against you? Huh?

501
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:53,572
Answer me!

502
00:40:53,906 --> 00:40:56,116
Look, we have money, okay?

503
00:40:56,575 --> 00:40:59,078
Everything’s gonna be okay.
We have enough money.

504
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,788
What the fuck, Mom?

505
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:02,881
They’re already having
you guys investigated.

506
00:41:02,998 --> 00:41:03,998
What?

507
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:06,209
Are you just gonna pay
everyone off until

508
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,794
this all goes away?

509
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:10,839
Maureen, stop being a burden
and stay out of this!

510
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:13,300
Can you just listen
to your mom, Maui?

511
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:15,970
We already have many problems,
don’t be one of them!

512
00:41:16,178 --> 00:41:17,805
Just go back to your fiancé!

513
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:20,181
So, all the accusations
against you are true?

514
00:41:20,182 --> 00:41:21,558
You can’t even answer me.

515
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:24,728
Fuck. I knew it.

516
00:41:25,854 --> 00:41:26,938
I’ve known for a while
that you were involved

517
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:28,857
in something illegal,
and it’s true.

518
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:32,318
Do you even care how many people
in this country are struggling?

519
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,904
And you’re not even ashamed
of stealing from them?

520
00:41:34,905 --> 00:41:36,447
- You disgust me!
- Stop it!

521
00:41:36,448 --> 00:41:37,448
Stop it!

522
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:40,077
Stop being a burden, okay?

523
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:42,079
Stop it, Maui.

524
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:46,375
Everyone was right
about you, Dad.

525
00:41:47,793 --> 00:41:50,044
- You’re a useless politician.
- My god…

526
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:51,297
A bad father...

527
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:53,424
You’re a criminal!

528
00:41:54,883 --> 00:41:55,883
Stephen.

529
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,260
Hon...

530
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:03,475
Don’t you dare act
holier than thou.

531
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:05,477
You benefited from
my money, too!

532
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:07,062
Your education,

533
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:10,232
the roof over your head,
the clothes on your back.

534
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:12,234
That all came from my money!

535
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:13,902
That money isn’t yours!

536
00:42:14,611 --> 00:42:17,322
It’s the people’s money,
and every day,

537
00:42:17,323 --> 00:42:19,992
I feel fucking bad
being your daughter.

538
00:42:20,534 --> 00:42:21,201
Stop! Stop!

539
00:42:21,202 --> 00:42:22,202
Stop please, hon!

540
00:42:22,203 --> 00:42:23,745
Don’t you dare hurt her again!

541
00:42:23,746 --> 00:42:24,746
Naomi.

542
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,220
You fucking little child.

543
00:42:27,305 --> 00:42:28,305
Enough.

544
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:30,460
Go back to your room!

545
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:32,671
- Let her go!
- Stop it, Maui!

546
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:36,162
Don’t even try!

547
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:39,135
Stop being kind to this girl,

548
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:40,929
just because you pity her!

549
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:42,221
Pity?

550
00:42:43,303 --> 00:42:44,470
She’s my sister!

551
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,622
Oh my god. She’s not!

552
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:49,381
If you don’t stay
away from this girl,

553
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,142
I swear, what happened to
her mom will happen to you.

554
00:42:54,276 --> 00:42:56,945
Yes, Naomi. You heard me right!

555
00:42:57,237 --> 00:42:58,613
You.

556
00:42:58,762 --> 00:42:59,929
Ever since you came here,

557
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:02,623
you’ve brought nothing but
bad luck in this house.

558
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,871
Maui, let’s go.
We’re going home.

559
00:43:06,872 --> 00:43:08,498
Naomi, come with me.

560
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:09,499
No!

561
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:11,335
Naomi!

562
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,795
Where are you going?

563
00:43:14,313 --> 00:43:16,314
I’m just going to get
some fresh air outside.

564
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:17,924
You think I’m a fool?

565
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:20,260
You’re not going out!

566
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:25,682
You will never have
the same freedom

567
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:27,684
that Maui has.

568
00:43:28,727 --> 00:43:31,730
I’ve already accepted that
you’ve taken away my freedom.

569
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:35,024
What really matters to me
is that Sam cares for me.

570
00:43:35,025 --> 00:43:36,360
Oh my god!

571
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:38,612
You actually think

572
00:43:38,946 --> 00:43:40,489
she cares about you?

573
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:42,408
Oh my god, Naomi.

574
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:45,702
You’re a charity case.

575
00:43:46,495 --> 00:43:48,205
But do you really deserve it?

576
00:43:50,165 --> 00:43:54,585
After years and years
of her trying and trying,

577
00:43:54,586 --> 00:43:57,423
but you kept pushing her away.

578
00:44:01,218 --> 00:44:05,973
Now, go back to your room.

579
00:44:06,473 --> 00:44:07,474
Now!

580
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:36,587
It’s not good to act out
on your emotions, Maui.

581
00:44:40,466 --> 00:44:42,342
Do you actually hear
yourself right now?

582
00:44:43,218 --> 00:44:45,596
You say that because
you’re not in my position.

583
00:44:47,347 --> 00:44:49,474
You don’t have problems
with your parents.

584
00:44:49,547 --> 00:44:50,547
Me?

585
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:52,060
I’m not struggling?

586
00:44:53,061 --> 00:44:54,396
You don’t know a thing.

587
00:44:55,286 --> 00:44:57,727
You don’t know a thing about
what I’m going through right now

588
00:44:57,752 --> 00:44:59,921
so don’t act
all high and mighty!

589
00:45:14,082 --> 00:45:15,751
I’m sorry, I shouted.

590
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:18,670
I need to breathe.

591
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:22,174
Just give me some space, Cy.

592
00:45:48,353 --> 00:45:49,646
I read the news.

593
00:45:51,537 --> 00:45:52,538
Are you okay?

594
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:02,673
How do I endure all of this?

595
00:46:05,175 --> 00:46:06,843
Luna, it’s so hard.

596
00:46:09,263 --> 00:46:11,515
It’s way too hard.

597
00:46:17,187 --> 00:46:19,064
I’m sorry you’re
going through this.

598
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:22,985
Life really loves
messing things up.

599
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,488
There are times when

600
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,157
it really feels like the
universe is picking on you.

601
00:46:29,658 --> 00:46:31,201
But life goes on.

602
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:34,538
Everything will be
okay eventually.

603
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,375
Just hold on, okay?

604
00:46:40,085 --> 00:46:41,461
Hold on to us.

605
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:46,758
Hold on to the people who are
willing to hold your hand.

606
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:50,637
The ones who won’t let go.

607
00:47:24,171 --> 00:47:24,755
Auntie...

608
00:47:24,756 --> 00:47:26,922
Hi! Sorry I barged in.

609
00:47:26,923 --> 00:47:28,758
It’s okay po.
What brings you here?

610
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:30,468
If you’re looking for Cy,
he’s not here.

611
00:47:30,469 --> 00:47:31,386
He’s at the hospital.

612
00:47:31,387 --> 00:47:33,095
Well, I’m not here for Cy.

613
00:47:33,096 --> 00:47:34,764
Have a seat. Let’s have a talk.

614
00:47:34,765 --> 00:47:35,932
I want to speak with you.

615
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:37,591
Okay.

616
00:47:38,435 --> 00:47:40,455
Well, I’ll make this short.

617
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:42,856
To be honest with you,

618
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,567
Cy hasn’t been talking
with us at the moment.

619
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:48,736
Cy hasn’t been talking with us

620
00:47:48,737 --> 00:47:51,323
since his dad decided
to cancel the engagement.

621
00:47:52,324 --> 00:47:56,578
Well, you know what’s going on
with your family.

622
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:59,581
Of course, we’re just concerned
about our business.

623
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,541
We’re in the medical field,

624
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:04,086
and that can get political, too.

625
00:48:05,545 --> 00:48:07,673
A lot of people trust us.

626
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:11,008
And we can’t risk our family’s
reputation just to be,

627
00:48:11,009 --> 00:48:12,761
you know, associated with yours.

628
00:48:13,595 --> 00:48:14,846
I understand.

629
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:16,806
You know...

630
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,601
Cy strongly disagrees
with everything,

631
00:48:19,935 --> 00:48:23,397
but his dad threatens
to cut off his inheritance

632
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,107
if he doesn’t go along with it.

633
00:48:25,273 --> 00:48:28,068
But he doesn’t care,
he wants to be with you.

634
00:48:29,528 --> 00:48:31,446
You know, Sam,

635
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,824
Cy has a really bright
future ahead of him.

636
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:36,201
Very bright future.

637
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,161
But,

638
00:48:38,537 --> 00:48:40,956
the problem is,
he loves you so much.

639
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:45,627
I just don’t want him getting
dragged into your family’s mess.

640
00:48:46,712 --> 00:48:48,213
So please, as a mother,

641
00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:49,756
I’m begging you,

642
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:52,592
stop the engagement.

643
00:49:43,727 --> 00:49:44,811
Wait, I’ll be back.

644
00:49:51,693 --> 00:49:53,402
Chef, thank you so much, really.

645
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:56,113
Sure, sir. I’m sure
your fiancée will like it.

646
00:49:56,114 --> 00:49:57,114
Thank you.

647
00:50:45,455 --> 00:50:46,748
Please serve it over there.

648
00:50:47,499 --> 00:50:48,500
Thanks again.

649
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,762
As long as we’re together,

650
00:51:01,763 --> 00:51:03,597
we’ll get through this, okay?

651
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,219
This is the first time
I’ve ever felt like

652
00:51:05,244 --> 00:51:07,121
I was treated
as part of a family.

653
00:51:17,737 --> 00:51:18,737
Sam!

654
00:51:20,782 --> 00:51:21,950
Goodbye.

655
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:25,412
I’ll see you later.

656
00:51:42,053 --> 00:51:43,763
No matter what happens,

657
00:51:44,306 --> 00:51:45,473
I’ll stay with you.

658
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:47,392
Cy, please.

659
00:51:48,685 --> 00:51:51,605
Let’s end this. Please.

660
00:51:52,522 --> 00:51:53,981
Maui, you're just tired.

661
00:51:53,982 --> 00:51:55,525
I was using you.
