1
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,261
Hey, Adi!

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,513
Remember the time when
you said you had a friend

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,765
who was interested
in meeting me?

4
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,350
Lewis?

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,852
Is he still interested?

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,187
Can you set us up for a date?

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,856
Why are you here?

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,027
I missed you.

9
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,369
Sam!

10
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,207
Your boyfriend?

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,378
He’s my fiancé.

12
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,549
You're not even
wearing your ring.

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,843
What? I always wear it.

14
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,511
It’s always around your neck.

15
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,889
Fine. I’m going to wear it.

16
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:58,558
See?

17
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,562
I'm starting to think that

18
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,231
moving in was
actually a good idea.

19
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,817
And you’re the only person
in the world who

20
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,153
understands exactly how I feel.

21
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,079
I thought you’re
going to wait for—

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,082
How do you know when
you’re already falling in love?

23
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,003
Because I think I am.

24
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,175
Is he serious?

25
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,552
Or is he just
messing with me?

26
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,104
He is serious.

27
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,439
Honestly,

28
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,858
I don’t know how to answer that.

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,693
Because...

30
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,446
I haven’t fallen in love yet.

31
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,447
Really?

32
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,784
Why? I mean,
if you don’t mind me asking.

33
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,787
I’ve had a boyfriend before—

34
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,206
dated a few guys, too.

35
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,043
But I never really felt what
I thought love should be.

36
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,295
The kind of love

37
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,214
I saw my friends go through.

38
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,759
What kind of love have you seen?

39
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,389
You deserve this
happiness, lovebirds.

40
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,268
Kalix, you better watch out
if you make Luna cry.

41
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,311
Oh, don’t you dare.

42
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,398
I will not hurt, Luna.
I promise.

43
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,485
These two are too sweet.

44
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,779
He’s head over heels for me.

45
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,158
Hey!

46
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,784
Are you feeling giddy?

47
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,161
Bitch, no!

48
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,996
It’s just that I look
so gorgeous in the video.

49
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,458
The kind of love—

50
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,503
that’s hard to explain.

51
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,464
I can’t put it into words.

52
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,118
Let me.

53
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,635
More?

54
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,137
Yes, please.

55
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,478
Here.

56
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,314
Thank you.

57
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,280
Communication Arts graduate—

58
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,323
Communication—

59
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,158
Okay.

60
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,493
Media and content—

61
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,911
Huh?

62
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,664
Communication Arts graduate—

63
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,333
This career is in areas that—

64
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,417
Do you need anything?

65
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,296
I’m good.

66
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,631
I just have a lot
of stuff to do.

67
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,180
Hey, you don’t have to do that.

68
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,306
It’s all good.

69
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,307
It’s fine.

70
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,170
You look really busy.

71
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,380
Yes.

72
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,633
Our professor might give
a surprise quiz tomorrow.

73
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,219
You got this.

74
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,513
Here, for energy.

75
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,183
Thank you.

76
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,356
Wow,

77
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,858
you nailed the taste I like.

78
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,736
I pay attention.

79
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,907
Yours is pink.
Sometimes purple.

80
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,367
How the hell did you know that?

81
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,743
I pay attention.

82
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,193
Hey.

83
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,361
Hey.

84
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,904
How are you today?

85
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,782
Tiring than usual.

86
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,368
We had back-to-back
Lab lectures.

87
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,286
You?

88
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,582
I spent hours in the library
doing research for my thesis.

89
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,127
But I had time
to prepare you this.

90
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,129
Oh!

91
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,965
Wow! For me?

92
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,966
- What’s this?
- Yes.

93
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,217
Read it.

94
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,970
ER kit.
Emergency Relaxation.

95
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,971
- Yes.
- Wow.

96
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,266
A little something to help you
relax and de-stress.

97
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,810
There’s a neck massager,
you know—

98
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,979
a neck pillow and an eye mask.

99
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,273
It’s silk! It’s gentle
for the skin.

100
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,107
It will not cause wrinkles.

101
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,400
- Okay.
- Like that.

102
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,443
This will really help a lot,

103
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,069
especially when
I’m feeling burnt out.

104
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,906
- Thanks, Maui.
- You’re welcome.

105
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,324
I’m glad you liked it.

106
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,877
What happened?

107
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,052
Hold still.

108
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,639
The bleeding will
stop eventually.

109
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,977
- Calm down.
- Okay.

110
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,087
Hey.

111
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,047
You should eat.

112
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,341
You haven’t eaten yet.

113
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,595
You need energy for whatever
you’re stressing over there.

114
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,431
I’m not hungry.

115
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,724
Go ahead and eat first.

116
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,434
You didn’t have
to trouble yourself.

117
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,606
What’s that? Your resume?

118
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,109
You’re applying
for jobs already?

119
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,402
Not yet.

120
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,362
I still have one more semester.

121
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,947
It’s actually a bit stressful.

122
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,950
I know my parents
will help me get a job,

123
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,452
but I don’t want that.

124
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,954
I want to get hired
on my own merit.

125
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,416
You know what?
The bigger problem is,

126
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,044
I don’t even know
what I really want anymore.

127
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,296
Didn’t you want to be a model?

128
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,425
That was just
a far-fetched dream.

129
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,136
Clyden, I can’t do
modeling as a career.

130
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,471
I’ll disappoint them.

131
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,473
Stop thinking
about what they want.

132
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,975
What do you want?

133
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,148
I want to showcase clothes.

134
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,943
Redefine beauty and—

135
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,572
tell stories through fashion
on a global stage.

136
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:58,991
Yeah.

137
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,952
I want to be
an international model.

138
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,624
But, what if
I’m not good enough?

139
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,501
I’m not even in shape.

140
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,337
You’re already rejecting
yourself even before it starts.

141
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,172
You’ll never know until you try.

142
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,132
Hey, don’t doubt yourself.

143
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,260
Should I start modeling?

144
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,178
You know what,

145
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,347
you definitely have
the look and the vibe.

146
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,264
I can help you.

147
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,265
I have such a good agent,

148
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,184
and they’re always
looking for people.

149
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,020
Actually,

150
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,481
a model friend
offered to help me.

151
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,359
Well, there you go!
It’s a sign.

152
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,612
But I haven’t decided yet.

153
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,531
You know my parents—

154
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,866
Parents!
Again with your parents?

155
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,827
What about you?

156
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,287
You have your own life, Maui.

157
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,164
Follow what you want

158
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,542
and do whatever makes you happy.

159
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,044
Your career is an
important part of your life.

160
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,339
Do what you actually want to do.

161
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,884
Yes, you’re right.

162
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,053
I’ll think about it.

163
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,638
Okay.

164
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,428
- Morning!
- Morning!

165
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,721
You’re up early.

166
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,722
Are you leaving already?

167
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,183
Yes, I have a quiz
in my first class.

168
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,101
Okay, wait. Hold on.

169
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,728
I made this for you.

170
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,438
What’s this?

171
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,231
Open it.

172
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,445
You cooked for me?

173
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,238
I hope you like it.

174
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:02,948
Thank you.

175
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,949
You’re welcome.

176
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,785
Maybe you have

177
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,787
some special requests?

178
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,371
I can cook your lunch everyday.

179
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,956
Cy, you don’t have to do that.

180
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,792
Come on, I insist.

181
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,293
Fine.

182
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,880
Sushi! I want sushi.

183
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,215
Sushi?

184
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,801
Sushi—

185
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,636
Yeah, no problem.

186
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,262
I can make that.

187
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,764
That’s easy.

188
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,475
Go now, you might be late.

189
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,561
Okay, thank you. Bye!

190
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,479
Bye.

191
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,824
Sam seems to be
in a good mood today.

192
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,159
What is this?

193
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,953
It’s just food.

194
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,329
Wow, Samantha!

195
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,249
You packed your lunch
for the first time?

196
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,458
That’s awesome!

197
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,629
Did you cook that?
Let me have a taste.

198
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,005
I can rate your food.

199
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,508
No! It’s all mine.

200
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,468
It’s all yours because

201
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,012
it was cooked by your
very own personal chef?

202
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,516
Hey, you’re smiling
from ear to ear.

203
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,102
For sure, your boyfriend
made that for you.

204
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,568
I can’t believe he actually
made this for me.

205
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,325
Sam: They taste good!

206
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,287
Next time, I hope
it has fewer calories.

207
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,580
I’m on a diet.

208
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:37,832
Cy: Don’t be picky.

209
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:43,936
Oh no, girls!
We’ve lost her.

210
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,218
She’s fallen so hard.

211
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:49,007
She’s fallen so in love.

212
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:52,287
Sam, just be careful, okay?

213
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,395
'Cause after the fall
usually comes the crash.

214
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,900
And sometimes it’s a very,
very hard impact.

215
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:07,653
She’s so annoying, right?

216
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:08,846
So dramatic!

217
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:10,455
Who? Naomi?

218
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,162
Yeah, I was just
about to say that.

219
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,748
Why is she even our friend
in the first place?

220
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,416
I don’t like her vibe!

221
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,334
I agree.

222
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,878
Naomi Vera is so moody.

223
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,448
Are they backstabbing Naomi?

224
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,633
Naomi Vera is so weird, right?

225
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,760
Like, where did she even
come from?

226
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,679
They’re really talking
about Naomi. This isn’t right.

227
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,933
Excuse me.

228
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,100
Yes?

229
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,604
It’s not good to talk about
people behind their backs.

230
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,356
If you’ve got
a problem with her,

231
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,607
just say it to her face.

232
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,566
What?

233
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,233
Who are you,

234
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,526
and why are you even listening

235
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,612
to other people’s
conversations, huh?

236
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,072
I’m your senior.

237
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,411
Your orgs must be ashamed

238
00:15:54,513 --> 00:15:55,931
to have you as members.

239
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,790
What the hell? You’re weird!

240
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,750
Sam?

241
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,794
What are you doing?

242
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,963
God, you know her?

243
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,965
Well, I’m not surprised.

244
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,433
You’re both weird.

245
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,177
Right?

246
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:10,638
She suddenly shows up here
just to pick a fight?

247
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,722
What is her deal, really?

248
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,890
Go talk to her!

249
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,392
Let’s go.

250
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,314
Naomi, wait.

251
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,149
Let me explain—

252
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:25,509
- please.
- What’s your problem, Sam?

253
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,486
What exactly did
my friends do to you, huh?

254
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,405
They’re talking behind
your back, and I was just—

255
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,949
Are you planning to push
them away from me, too?

256
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,494
You just really want me
to end up alone, huh?

257
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,831
No, I was just—

258
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,623
Cut it out!

259
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,625
Stop meddling in my life!

260
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,837
Can’t you see that
the more you try to meddle,

261
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,006
the more you push
everyone away from me.

262
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,425
Dad,

263
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,301
your mom,

264
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,512
and now my friends?

265
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,847
Who’s next?

266
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,515
Jaron?

267
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,476
You want him out
of my life, too, right?

268
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,353
No, Naomi.

269
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,855
It’s not like that.

270
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,273
I was just trying to help and—

271
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,607
Please, just stop!

272
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,319
Stop playing the good sister!
It doesn’t suit you.

273
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,422
Mom: Maureen, I want you
to attend the party

274
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,466
of our business partner
this weekend.

275
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,426
I sent you three dresses.

276
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,344
Pick something
that will suit you.

277
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,722
Make sure you look elegant.

278
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,187
I don’t want to go.

279
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,401
Sam:
Cy, I’m having a bad day.

280
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,162
Sam: I feel tired.

281
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,554
Hey sorry.
Wrong send.

282
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,972
How are you?

283
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,062
Sam: Is everything okay?

284
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,655
Cy: What time
are you coming home?

285
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,160
Sam: I won’t go home tonight.

286
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,495
My friends are here
at the condo.

287
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,038
I’ll sleep here tonight.

288
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
Cy: It's better that
you sleep there.

289
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,464
Don't drive
if you've been drinking.

290
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,591
Enjoy your time
with your friends.

291
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,011
Sam: Okay.

292
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,395
Sam?

293
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,605
Hey,

294
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,441
Are you okay?

295
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,904
I just had a bad day.

296
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,740
What happened?

297
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,952
Should I tell them?

298
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,163
But I don’t want
to ruin the vibe.

299
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,459
Nothing. Just some school stuff.

300
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,253
You know, senior problems.

301
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,593
I think that’s the food.

302
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,933
What the hell
are you doing here?

303
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,976
Are you alone?

304
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,103
Yanna, you should
have called me!

305
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,855
I didn’t think about that.

306
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,025
I just hurriedly got on the bus
when I received your message.

307
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,694
Well? What happened to you?
Are you okay?

308
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,695
I’m okay.

309
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,865
Oh god, Yanna,
the whole group is here.

310
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,951
Sam, is the food there yet?

311
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,708
Oh, I thought
it was the delivery.

312
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,003
You want to come in?

313
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,882
Girls?

314
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,884
Yanna is here.

315
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,720
So, you're still alive.

316
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,680
You didn't even
bother to reach out.

317
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,809
You’re pregnant?

318
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,396
I’m sorry. I made a mis—

319
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,983
I’m so sorry, Yanna.

320
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,362
- I’m so sorry.
- I’m so sorry.

321
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,907
You were suffering alone,
and we didn’t know.

322
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,242
I’m so sorry.

323
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,204
I’m sorry,
I didn’t tell you sooner

324
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,080
because

325
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,874
I thought you all
might get mad at me.

326
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,086
I’m scared that
you might tell me

327
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,589
that I should have expected this
after all that I’ve done.

328
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,344
No. Yanna, I’m sorry.

329
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,013
We’re sorry that
you felt you had to

330
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,890
hide your pregnancy from us.

331
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,600
Yanna, I’m sorry.

332
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,561
I didn’t know what to do either.

333
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,896
Who’s the fa—

334
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,106
Nevermind.

335
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,276
Come, sit down.
That’s not important.

336
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,944
Sit here.
Hold on.

337
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,947
Be careful.

338
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,631
Cheers?

339
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,302
I’ll have water for now.

340
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,970
I can't drink alcohol yet.

341
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,140
Thanks for coming.

342
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,602
You said you were tired.

343
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,983
With everything
I’ve been through,

344
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,402
you've always been by my side.

345
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,989
So, when you’re feeling down,
I should also be by your side.

346
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,283
So, how are you?

347
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,618
I'm here to listen.

348
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,332
It's Naomi.

349
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,793
I heard some girls
were backstabbing her,

350
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,754
so I confronted them.

351
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:23,592
She saw me doing that
and she interpreted it

352
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,594
as me pushing her friends away.

353
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,681
You just did
what was right, okay?

354
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,683
You've been a good older sister.

355
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,187
Trust me,
she’ll get it eventually.

356
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,190
Just don’t get tired of being
a good sister to her, okay?

357
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,150
Thanks.

358
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,028
I think I just really
needed to hear that.

359
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,199
I thought it had something
to do with your love life.

360
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,954
Hey! Why aren’t you answering?

361
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,332
So there really
is an issue, huh?

362
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,961
Well, there’s no issue.
It’s more of a me problem.

363
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,840
Cy said he thinks that

364
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,051
he’s already
fallen in love with me.

365
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,638
What?
Then what’s the problem?

366
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,141
But I’m also

367
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,393
falling in love with him.

368
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,312
That’s perfect!

369
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,231
You’re falling
in love with each other.

370
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,982
But I'm scared of getting hurt.

371
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,402
I don’t know if
I can handle the heartbreak

372
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,569
if it doesn’t work out.

373
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,405
Come on!

374
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,366
Why are you already
thinking about the end?

375
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:33,370
Can’t you just enjoy the feeling
of falling in love?

376
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,248
Loving is amazing.

377
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,500
Being loved is amazing.

378
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,919
If you like him, just tell him!

379
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,380
If you keep waiting,

380
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,174
you might lose your chance.

381
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,180
And that's the most
important thing.

382
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,438
I really need to see him.

383
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,023
Then go! Go see him.

384
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,776
Thank you.

385
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,406
Hey, where are you going?

386
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,450
I just have to be somewhere.

387
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,425
I thought you
weren’t coming home?

388
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,178
Well, I’m here now.

389
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,140
Are you okay?

390
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,183
I’m tired.

391
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,605
I’m here.
What’s our problem, love?

392
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,984
Yes. I just want to come home.

393
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,819
To my home.

394
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,243
Who’s that?

395
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,495
My mom.

396
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,165
She’s just calling to remind me
about that event on Saturday.

397
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,124
What event?

398
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,669
A party for one
of our business partners.

399
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,338
I’m not in the mood to go.

400
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,756
Then don’t go.

401
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,426
But my mom will be
disappointed if I don’t go.

402
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,345
If I go with you,

403
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,931
will it make this party less

404
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,432
miserable?

405
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,353
A hundred percent.

406
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,022
All right, I’ll go with you.

407
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,442
Let’s just show up
and then bail.

408
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,528
- Really?
- Yes.

409
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,530
Thank you.

410
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,950
And it’s Naomi’s birthday
too this Saturday—

411
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:39,704
So, can we drop by our house and
give her my gift personally?

412
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,872
Yeah, of course.

413
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,959
But we'd better sleep now.

414
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,044
It's getting late.

415
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:46,878
Yes.

416
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,631
I need to wake up
early tomorrow too

417
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,715
‘cause Yanna visited

418
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,219
and I have to take her
back to Nueva Ecija.

419
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,555
Okay.

420
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,890
I’ll go downstairs now.

421
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,308
Cy.

422
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,477
Yes?

423
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,354
I—

424
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,234
Should I say it?
Should I confess now?

425
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,528
I appreciate everything you do.

426
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,573
Thanks, Maui.

427
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,285
I appreciate everything
that you do, too.

428
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,833
Maui, once we’re
officially together,

429
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,378
are we going to sleep
in the master’s bedroom?

430
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,258
I mean, sure.

431
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,051
If you want.

432
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,224
I’d want to.

433
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,477
Okay.

434
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:45,520
Okay.

435
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,813
Rest well, okay?

436
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,108
Okay.

437
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,947
- Good night.
- Good night.

438
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,044
Cy?

439
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,131
Hey!

440
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,466
You’re up early.

441
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,927
Didn’t I tell you I have
to head back to the condo

442
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,346
‘cause I still have
to take Yanna home?

443
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,806
Take this with you.

444
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,270
Sushi?

445
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,480
Yes.

446
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,565
Your special request.

447
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,443
This is my favorite.

448
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,944
You.

449
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,197
This looks like actual sushi.

450
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:37,906
Of course.

451
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,282
You’ve cooked this before,
haven’t you?

452
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,242
Yes, I have.

453
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,619
- Really?
- Yes, many times.

454
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,412
- Nice!
- This is basic.

455
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,206
Thanks.

456
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,500
Now, I definitely
won’t go hungry on the trip.

457
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,043
You’re welcome.

458
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,419
Wait a minute,

459
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,046
something’s still missing.

460
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,765
Let’s put this in here.

461
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,313
And this one’s
fruit juice for Yanna.

462
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,357
He cares about
my friends, too?

463
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,066
How cute.

464
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,402
Wow, you’re so thoughtful.

465
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,237
Thank you.

466
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,197
All right then. I’ll go now.

467
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,074
Okay. Drive safely.

468
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,118
Bye. Take care!

469
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,166
Preggy lady!

470
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,751
Stay there, I’ll handle this.

471
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,837
Go on, just stay there.

472
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,755
Bitch! If you two
didn’t break up,

473
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,049
you’d probably be
pregnant too, you know?

474
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:38,550
Wow.

475
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,218
Wow, this pregnant girl’s
too much.

476
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,970
Hey!

477
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,470
Hi!

478
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,930
Hey, Sam!

479
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,474
Where did you go
last night? You left us.

480
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,811
Sorry, girls.
I had an emergency.

481
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,479
But what happened last night?

482
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,897
Did Luna cry again?

483
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,067
You didn’t storm
into Kalix’s unit, did you?

484
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,361
Almost! Good thing
Ke stopped her.

485
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,029
She was about to
step into the elevator.

486
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,532
But yeah, that was the most
exciting thing that happened.

487
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,450
Nothing else.

488
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,784
Thank you for sharing!

489
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,953
- That’s all.
- Good thing you stopped her.

490
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,455
Crisis averted.

491
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,122
Right?

492
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,165
Hey! Give me a minute,

493
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,541
I’ll just get ready
so we can go, okay?

494
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,500
Hold on.

495
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,793
- Okay.
- Okay.

496
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,672
Yes?

497
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,424
Cy said to give this to you.

498
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,010
Wow!

499
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,804
Wooing the best friend, huh?

500
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:27,807
This is nice.

501
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,602
So, what else
happened last night?

502
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,313
Did you guys kiss?

503
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,610
Did you have sex?

504
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,072
No. It was just
wholesome. Come on.

505
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,075
But did you confess last night?

506
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,120
No, I didn’t.

507
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,498
Why didn’t you?

508
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,834
Maybe the moment wasn’t right,

509
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,629
and I was just waiting
for him to say it first,

510
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,214
then I would’ve said it too.

511
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,511
Sam!

512
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,805
What’s the story? Huh?

513
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,973
Do you have something to share?

514
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,100
I want to share it.
I really do.

515
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,228
But it’s just
not the right time.

516
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,272
I’ll tell my friends
when everything’s settled.

517
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,525
When it’s official.
When I’m sure.

518
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,610
I just had to go home.

519
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,238
There was an emergency
at home, that’s all.

520
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,114
Really?

521
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,379
Mom: Why are you not
answering my calls?

522
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,965
Don’t forget
the party this Saturday.

523
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,637
Sam: Yes, Mom.
I’m coming with Cy. See you.

524
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,606
Hey, calm down.
What did I say?

525
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,068
We’re just going
to show up and then bail.

526
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,069
Exactly.

527
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,114
Let me remind you,

528
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,992
I’m your fiancé.

529
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,827
I know.

530
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,121
And we don’t have
to pretend now.

531
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,789
What do you mean?

532
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,418
Come on, let’s go inside.

533
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,259
Hey!

534
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,886
I’ve been waiting for you
for a while now.

535
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,054
Come on, let me introduce you
to my business partner.

536
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,682
Mr. Barrera,
this is my daughter, Sam.

537
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,058
And her fiancé, Clyden Ramirez.

538
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,393
Hello, Sam.

539
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:41,065
I can tell by your looks that
you take after your father.

540
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,610
Nice to meet you,
Sam and Clyden.

541
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,403
You know that’s true. In fact,

542
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,947
Sam will be
graduating soon and—

543
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,949
I’m sure I'm going to be
able to convince her

544
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,618
to follow in
my footsteps, right?

545
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,537
A future politician?

546
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,538
That’s great!

547
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:59,083
Someone to continue
Senator Vera’s legacy.

548
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,919
And for sure,

549
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,880
we will be
working together, Sam.

550
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,635
Actually, I’m still figuring out
what career I want to pursue.

551
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,555
I’m thinking of something
more in the arts.

552
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,516
I’ve always had
an interest in other fields,

553
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,809
you know, like modeling.

554
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,519
Modeling?

555
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,815
Isn’t it, well…

556
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,862
Politics is more impactful.

557
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,282
That’s where
real power is made, Sam.

558
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,537
You know, Sam, she’s just
exploring her options.

559
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,248
You know, the young ones today.

560
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,043
- But she’ll come around.
- That's right.

561
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,878
I did the same thing,

562
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:48,216
I started with law before
I decided to go into business.

563
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,134
It’s okay.

564
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,430
I’m 90% decided, actually.

565
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,683
I want to be a model.

566
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,144
And I think it’s a career
that will make me happy

567
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,396
and fulfilled.

568
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,903
Please excuse us.
We’ll just grab our drinks.

569
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:13,908
Kids nowadays.

570
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,410
Yeah. I’m sorry
about that, you know—

571
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,000
I’m proud of you.

572
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,752
You’re taking little steps
to assert yourself.

573
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,921
I’m not going to lie.

574
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,673
I was nervous the entire time.

575
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,092
I’m sure my mom
is upset right now.

576
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,553
Well, let her be upset.

577
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,138
It’s your life to live.

578
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,556
Not hers.

579
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:49,777
Naomi: Help. Unit 6336.

580
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,240
Why is she there?
Why does she need help?

581
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,576
What’s that?

582
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,579
Naomi is asking for help.

583
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,207
- What?
- We need to go!

584
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,609
What the hell
are you doing here?

585
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,027
Where’s Naomi?

586
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,653
She’s having fun. Relax.

587
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,073
We’re just
celebrating her birthday.

588
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,075
Naomi?
Naomi?

589
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,618
Help, Sam!

590
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,577
Naomi?

591
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,454
-Naomi?
-Naomi?

592
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,039
Help, Sam!

593
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,459
What’s happening here, huh?

594
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,668
Naomi.

595
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,837
Sam, what’s up?

596
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,715
What the hell did you do
to my sister, huh?

597
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,050
I was just talking to her.

598
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,720
I came here to
celebrate her birthday

599
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,932
because her friends said
she really likes me.

600
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,684
I thought, why not
make her happy, right?

601
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,020
Do you think she’s fucking
happy right now?

602
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,148
Look at her! She’s crying!

603
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,568
Oh, come on!
We were playing truth or dare.

604
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,028
We just dared her
to stay in the same room

605
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,530
with Jaron for 30 minutes.

606
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,948
Shut up!

607
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,741
We’re going.

608
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,162
Don’t ever talk
to my sister again.

609
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,853
I’ll go to your room, okay?

610
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,488
What happened?

611
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,866
Did they do anything to you?

612
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,201
No.

613
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,664
He was telling me
all about his girlfriend, Rina,

614
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,375
and the things they do together.

615
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,962
He made me
feel so uncomfortable.

616
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:23,514
He even said that we could be
together without Rina knowing.

617
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,810
He made me feel
like I’m desperate,

618
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,645
I’m a fool.

619
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,856
I’m sorry.

620
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,317
I already knew
about him and Rina.

621
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,152
I should have told you,
I’m so sorry.

622
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,280
No, Sam.

623
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,907
Maybe I was a fool.

624
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,201
Maybe I was desperate.

625
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,286
No, you’re not.

626
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,245
You’re not.

627
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,789
No. Just admit it, Sam.

628
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,377
I defended my
fake friends over you.

629
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,716
I was desperate to
keep them as my friends

630
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,259
because I have no one.

631
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,470
Naomi—

632
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,431
you have me.

633
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,516
You have me.

634
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,103
You just feel sorry,
and you pity me.

635
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,773
That’s not true.

636
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,149
No. It is true.

637
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,696
Why would you want to be
with someone like me?

638
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,282
You have your friends,

639
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,327
you have your parents,
you have your fiancé.

640
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,288
I’m all alone by myself.

641
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,669
Maybe it’s better this way
because the last time

642
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,295
I had someone in my life,

643
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,675
she died because of me.

644
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,515
I’m sorry.

645
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,393
I’m sorry you’re
going through this.

646
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,479
Eighteen years of existence,

647
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,525
and half of it
was barely living.

648
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,152
I’m here for you.

649
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,738
You’re not alone.

650
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,492
And I want you
in my life, Naomi.

651
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,995
You might not accept me now,

652
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,746
but I hope that you will, soon.

653
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,417
And we’ll get through
this together, okay?

654
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,547
Remember, I’m your sister.

655
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,426
You’ll always have me
as your big sister.

656
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:30,933
Hug?

657
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,042
Happy birthday.

658
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,052
My gift.

659
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,473
I hope this makes
your day a little bit better.

660
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,978
Now, you don’t have
to borrow my camera

661
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,396
‘cause you already
have your own

662
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,107
and it’s even a newer model.

663
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,070
You’re a great older sister.

664
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,991
Thank you.

665
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,583
You’re welcome,
my little sister.

666
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:24,839
Hey.

667
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,007
How did it go?

668
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,677
We talked.

669
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,596
It was hard,

670
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,474
but we’re getting there.

671
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,476
Baby steps.

672
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,730
I’m so proud of you

673
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,483
for being a big sister to her.

674
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,905
You showed up
when she needed you.

675
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,536
You’re really
a beautiful person, Maui.

676
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,806
I love you.

677
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,613
How do you know
if you’re falling in love?

678
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,742
Maybe you have
some special requests?

679
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,577
I can cook your lunch everyday.

680
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,287
Sushi! I want sushi.

681
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,842
When you start doing
generous things.

682
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:36,887
Even if it means
losing sleep.

683
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,576
When you find yourself
putting in effort

684
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,536
you never knew you had.

685
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,423
Cy?

686
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,385
Hey!

687
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:17,803
You’re up early.

688
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,597
Take this with you.

689
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,515
Sushi?

690
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,642
Your special request.

691
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,144
This looks like actual sushi.

692
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:25,936
Of course.

693
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,438
You’ve cooked this before,
haven’t you?

694
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,189
Yes, I have.

695
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,524
I’ll just go to the restroom.

696
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,442
Okay.

697
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:37,197
I heard, the daughter
of Stephen Vera

698
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,116
is entering politics too.

699
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,329
I won't be surprised
if she ends up like him.

700
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,414
Corrupt politician.

701
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,249
When you find yourself
defending the person

702
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,627
- even when she’s not around.
- For sure,

703
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,004
they’ll turn it
into a family business.

704
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,298
Getting money from
the government funds.

705
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,050
Wow, shameless people.

706
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,510
What if the daughter is worse?

707
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,930
When it feels like
it’s your responsibility

708
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,182
to protect her honor.

709
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,643
Excuse me.

710
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,396
I overheard your conversation.

711
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,856
I don’t mean to overstep, but

712
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,442
Sam isn’t like
her parents at all.

713
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,152
She’s a good person.

714
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,821
And she’s got
a strong moral compass.

715
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,075
Even as a college student,
she’s already involved

716
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,326
in a lot of charity work.

717
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,827
And no,

718
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,622
she’s not entering politics.

719
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,208
Excuse me.

720
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,003
When you want
to take her pain away,

721
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,673
because if she’s hurting,

722
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,883
you’re hurting the same.

723
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,513
I love you.

724
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,481
When you know, you know.

725
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,316
Cy, hi—

726
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,320
Are we together now?

727
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,488
Hey,

728
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,906
are we like,

729
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,825
a boyfriend-girlfriend
thing now?

730
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,628
So, what are we doing
for your birthday?

731
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,587
Got any plans?

732
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,839
Same club as last time?

733
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,924
I plan to host
the party at BGC.

734
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,718
Don’t invite him, please.

735
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,471
Whatever happens,

736
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,640
your big sister’s here for you.

737
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,519
Happy birthday!

738
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:31,854
Lewis!

739
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,440
Wait, I think
there’s something in your—

740
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,608
- What?
- An eyelash.

741
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,993
Goodbye! Enjoy!
