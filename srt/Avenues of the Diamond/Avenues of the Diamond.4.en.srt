1
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:11,760
Sorry, I just went
inside your room

2
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,304
‘cause you weren’t answering.

3
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,557
Are you okay?

4
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,143
You look good.

5
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,563
You’re wearing our
engagement ring today?

6
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,481
I always do.

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,941
Can I call you, Maui?

8
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,986
Only my family
gets to call me that.

9
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,264
Why? Am I not family?

10
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:33,613
I’m your future husband,
to be exact.

11
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,991
Hey! Did you just
take a photo of us?

12
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:37,701
I was fixing my bra.

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,660
No, I’m not.

14
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:41,496
Girls, just let it go.

15
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:43,290
Naomi, can we talk? Please?

16
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,041
You know her, Sam?

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,835
Kind of, she's...

18
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:48,919
She’s my friend.

19
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:50,880
You really have to check, huh?

20
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:53,633
Of course, you believe
your friends.

21
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:56,386
You can’t even tell them
I’m your sister.

22
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:58,638
Do you need a hug?

23
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:03,351
Our friend here is really happy.

24
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:17,073
This is fun.

25
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:19,868
Shit!

26
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:21,494
He seems mad.

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,371
Bro, let’s order some milk.

28
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:25,415
- Go now.
- Go.

29
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:27,333
Take a shot first
to give you courage.

30
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:28,418
Go after him.

31
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:31,713
Why am I so worried
about his reaction?

32
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:33,381
I didn’t do anything wrong.

33
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:35,925
We’re not even a thing, right?

34
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:38,677
Unless...

35
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:40,388
He’s jealous?

36
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:42,891
But why would he be?

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,185
Come on, just take the shot!

38
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:49,938
Go.

39
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:52,150
Good luck!

40
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:56,154
Hey, there’s a chick.

41
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:57,404
Hey.

42
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,533
Hello! Ridge.

43
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:02,827
Clyden’s best friend.

44
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:04,203
Sam.

45
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:05,496
Sam?

46
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:09,152
Bro, I’ll just go
to the bathroom.

47
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:09,959
I really need to poo.

48
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,126
Okay, I’ll go with you.

49
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:12,127
Together?

50
00:02:13,338 --> 00:02:14,338
What?

51
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:16,216
What “what”?

52
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,094
You came here to ignore me?

53
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,969
Huh?

54
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,221
Ignore you?

55
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:23,348
What makes you think
I’m ignoring you?

56
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:25,015
Just earlier.

57
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:26,267
The club’s too big.

58
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,520
It’s normal for us
not to see each other.

59
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:30,730
Fine, you’re not ignoring me.

60
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:32,426
You just don’t want
to talk to me.

61
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:34,067
I’m talking to you right now.

62
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:38,404
Okay.

63
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:39,823
Let’s get to the point, okay?

64
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:42,116
Before you jump
to any conclusions,

65
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:44,743
the guy I was dancing
with earlier is Sevi.

66
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:45,954
He’s just my friend.

67
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,498
Who’s asking?

68
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,335
I didn’t ask about him, right?

69
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:55,671
I just thought
you might be jealous.

70
00:02:55,672 --> 00:02:56,672
Huh?

71
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,174
Me, jealous?

72
00:02:58,758 --> 00:02:59,758
No way.

73
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:02,470
Okay, you’re not jealous.

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,514
Why didn’t you tell me
you’re coming?

75
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:07,391
If you stopped ignoring
my messages and calls,

76
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,726
then maybe you would know.

77
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:12,939
Oh my gosh!

78
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:15,108
I’m sorry.

79
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:19,194
I was just busy all night,
going around.

80
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,948
I didn’t mean to ignore
your text and calls.

81
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,492
I’m sorry.

82
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,170
What are you doing?
I’m right behind you.

83
00:03:36,212 --> 00:03:37,714
Just answer it, please.

84
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,970
Hey...

85
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:49,601
I’m sorry I didn't answer
your calls earlier.

86
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:52,604
I didn’t mean it.

87
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:02,529
It’s okay.

88
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:06,492
Jeez. You just want
to be babied, huh.

89
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:07,827
What did you say?

90
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:11,748
I said,

91
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:13,541
thanks for coming!

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,168
Do you want to have a drink?

93
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:17,587
I don’t really drink.

94
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:19,506
I just came here to support you.

95
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:20,715
That’s all.

96
00:04:22,884 --> 00:04:24,301
Just three bottles.

97
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:25,011
Please?

98
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:26,304
I don’t drink.

99
00:04:27,597 --> 00:04:28,306
Two?

100
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:29,306
Maui.

101
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:32,769
Final offer, one bottle?

102
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:37,023
Fine, just one bottle.

103
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:56,436
So, how exactly
did you end up here?

104
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:58,605
I thought you were
going to study all night?

105
00:05:59,022 --> 00:06:00,064
I thought so too.

106
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:03,234
But I finished all
my readings earlier.

107
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,571
You finished everything?
In one sitting?

108
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:09,115
Fast reader.

109
00:06:10,783 --> 00:06:12,160
How arrogant!

110
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:25,227
Hi! I’m Jo...

111
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,252
Sorry.

112
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:27,666
I’m happily married.

113
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:30,844
Oops.

114
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:32,304
Okay.

115
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:36,725
You’re such a snob.

116
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:38,186
The poor girl.

117
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:42,195
I mean, it’s better than
just outright rejecting her.

118
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:43,921
So, I said I’m married.

119
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,485
And she’s not my type.

120
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:47,819
Oh yeah,

121
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:50,031
because I’m your type.

122
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:53,784
Are you drunk?

123
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:57,378
Why don’t you say “no”
if I’m not your type?

124
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,919
Because...

125
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:01,237
- Because what?
- Because you’re drunk.

126
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,407
Wait!

127
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:09,133
What’s that?

128
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,585
I wonder who that’s for?

129
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:22,397
I don’t know, maybe somebody
just left it there,

130
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:24,899
or they just forgot about it.

131
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,755
What a waste.

132
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:30,618
It’s so pretty!

133
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:32,774
The one who gave it
must be really sweet.

134
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:35,023
They brought
a bouquet to a club.

135
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:36,591
I mean, who does that?

136
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:37,619
Does what?

137
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,788
Those

138
00:07:39,512 --> 00:07:42,056
cute and sweet things.

139
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:45,241
If that were given to me,

140
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:47,797
I wouldn’t let go of it.

141
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:49,645
So nice!

142
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:55,137
Cheers!

143
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,768
Cheers!

144
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:03,169
Okay...

145
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,938
I think it’s really time
to go now.

146
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:07,395
No.

147
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,610
I don’t want to. Just...

148
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:11,737
- No.
- One more.

149
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:13,363
- Maui.
- So cute!

150
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:14,240
One more!

151
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:15,241
Let’s go now.

152
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:17,868
Sam.

153
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:25,119
Here’s the playboy!

154
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,435
- Move, bro.
- Hold on.

155
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,549
I just want to
ask her a question.

156
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,876
Ask her tomorrow.
She’s drunk.

157
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:37,931
I think she can answer
my question better

158
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:39,124
when she’s drunk.

159
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:41,515
Sam...

160
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:44,000
Do you really not know
where Yanna is?

161
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,656
- Are you sure?
- Bro, that’s enough.

162
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:53,127
Don’t take advantage
of her state.

163
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:55,004
I hope you won’t either.

164
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,416
You know this guy?

165
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:59,203
The fuck!
What’s your problem?

166
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:00,616
Tell you what?

167
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,734
Why don’t you bring Sam
back to her friends?

168
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:04,307
Where are you
bringing her anyway?

169
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:06,333
- I’m bringing her home.
- Home?

170
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:10,241
Sam, do you know this guy?

171
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,460
I’m bringing my fiancée home.

172
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,442
- Do you have any problem with that?
- Fiancée?

173
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,410
Really?

174
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:20,696
Are you fucking with me?

175
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:21,653
Hey!

176
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:23,495
Shan, calm down.

177
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:26,256
He’s really my fiancé.

178
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,818
It’s okay. Look.

179
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:32,287
Don’t tell anyone, okay?

180
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:33,636
It’s a secret.

181
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:35,280
Are you sure?

182
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,430
I’m just making sure
you know this guy.

183
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:40,135
And you...

184
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,468
Now that you’re the last person
seen with Sam,

185
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,740
if anything bad
happens to her...

186
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:47,988
you're the first one
I'm coming after.

187
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:52,504
Let's go.

188
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:54,172
Okay. Bye!

189
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:55,173
Bye!

190
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:04,742
Be careful!

191
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:06,893
Why did we have
to go home so soon?

192
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,258
Look at yourself,
you’re already drunk.

193
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:11,573
One more bottle!
It’s still early!

194
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:13,551
Maui! No more drinking!

195
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:15,314
What? Do you want to get sick?

196
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,372
Sick?

197
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:20,374
Come on, doc,
I’m fine! See?

198
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,793
You’ve had enough,

199
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:23,253
believe me.

200
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,381
And you’ll get dehydrated,
that's bad for your kidneys.

201
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:30,135
Did you know your kidneys filter
the toxins in your body?

202
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:32,595
Including alcohol, by the way.

203
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:34,263
So if you overdo it,

204
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:36,057
they’ll really get damaged.

205
00:10:38,727 --> 00:10:40,478
You’re so cute!

206
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:44,024
You’re so cute when you go
all medical on me.

207
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,320
I know I’m cute.

208
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:50,571
But, seriously,

209
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:52,615
prevention is better than cure.

210
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:58,371
Okay, doc.

211
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:38,786
Hydrate.

212
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:43,707
Okay.

213
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:48,337
More.

214
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:49,671
More.

215
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,052
More.

216
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,894
When you become a doctor,

217
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:06,189
and let’s say I get sick,

218
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:09,025
will you take care of me?

219
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:10,777
Of course.

220
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,863
But I’d rather
you don’t get sick at all.

221
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,241
So maybe ease up on the alcohol.

222
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:21,162
Okay, doc.

223
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,628
Do I smell like vomit?

224
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:32,006
‘Cause I just finished
throwing up.

225
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:36,301
No,

226
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,055
you smell good.

227
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,820
Can you feel my heartbeat?

228
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:57,365
It’s so loud and fast, right?

229
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:05,123
Are you sure it’s not mine?

230
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:15,842
You know...

231
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:23,183
It’s actually nice to have
someone beside me.

232
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:28,980
I used to have my best friend,
Yanna, you know?

233
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,521
And she was always there for me.

234
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:44,537
But now

235
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:46,748
that she’s living
in the province,

236
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:49,125
I just...

237
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:54,547
I just feel so alone.

238
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:10,688
I’m sorry.

239
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:15,026
I’m so sorry for
crying in front of you.

240
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,237
Hey, it’s okay.

241
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:19,239
It’s okay.

242
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:21,616
It’s okay.

243
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,709
Don’t be sorry.

244
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:37,882
You can open up to me
about anything.

245
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:41,785
I may not be your best friend,

246
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:43,888
but I’m willing to listen.

247
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:47,850
Thank you, Cy.

248
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:52,939
You’re never alone, Maui.

249
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:01,990
Why are you being so nice to me?

250
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:06,286
When I first met you,
you were so rude.

251
00:15:06,536 --> 00:15:09,247
I was rude because
I hate your family.

252
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:10,748
But…

253
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:12,458
But?

254
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:17,338
But you’re not your family.

255
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:26,097
Thank you, Cy.

256
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:31,352
And thank you for all the nice
things you did for me tonight.

257
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:33,688
You’re welcome.

258
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,710
Okay.

259
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,691
It’s already late.
Get some rest and

260
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:02,087
don’t forget to hydrate, please?

261
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:03,447
Okay, goodnight.

262
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:12,644
Shit!

263
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:55,770
I want something... demure.

264
00:16:57,313 --> 00:16:59,774
Oh my god.
What the hell did I do?

265
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:04,333
So there’s a house party
this weekend.

266
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:06,374
It's the birthday of
a friend of a friend.

267
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,459
Wait.

268
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:10,545
Hey, Sam. Are you okay?

269
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,007
Right, what’s going on
with you today?

270
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:16,426
Huh? Nothing.

271
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:18,052
What were you saying Nicole?

272
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:21,180
She said that there's
going to be a house party.

273
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:24,642
Basically, everyone in the
social circle is invited.

274
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:26,810
You’re not listening.

275
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:30,064
Are you thinking of something?

276
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:32,609
Or thinking of someone.

277
00:17:33,193 --> 00:17:36,445
Right, are you thinking about
that guy from last night?

278
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,948
Is he the one
who’s hard to read?

279
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,200
Is he your new boyfriend?

280
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:42,952
Is he already your boyfriend?

281
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,579
I don’t even know
what he is to me.

282
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,290
We’re engaged but it’s fake.

283
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,544
We’re not lovers, but
we’re not really friends either.

284
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:53,962
Wait, you guys are asking
too many questions.

285
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:55,590
All right, let’s go with this...

286
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,511
Is he your new boyfriend?

287
00:17:59,803 --> 00:18:01,512
What? No!

288
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,514
He’s just

289
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:03,847
someone I know.

290
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,892
Really? Just someone you know?

291
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:10,104
Or someone you want to know
more and more and more?

292
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:11,730
Right? That’s different.

293
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:13,941
Wait! Oh my gosh!

294
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:14,942
What?

295
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:18,780
I think I know him.
Is he Clyden Ramirez?

296
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:20,490
Huh? You know him?

297
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,408
Yeah. Of course, I know him.

298
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:25,619
I have this friend,
she’s a med student too,

299
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,497
and she’s always raving
about how good-looking,

300
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:30,541
hot, handsome, all that,

301
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,418
and smart he is!

302
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:34,671
And she’s totally
obsessed with him.

303
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,339
Apparently, he’s pretty well
known around med schools

304
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,341
in Manila.

305
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:39,716
Really?

306
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:41,927
Tell me more. What else
do you know about him?

307
00:18:41,928 --> 00:18:46,651
Well, he’s not exactly known
for being super friendly.

308
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,393
He mostly keeps to himself,

309
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:52,504
but he’s always with two people.

310
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:54,732
Two people?

311
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:58,610
His best friend, Ridge,
and some girl I don’t know.

312
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:03,784
She’s really pretty. Tall,
smart and in med school.

313
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,996
They do study sessions,
classes, everything!

314
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,040
I know Ridge. But the girl?

315
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,461
Who could it be?
I wonder who that girl is.

316
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:25,805
Who is she?
What does she look like?

317
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,114
Is there something going
on between them?

318
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:40,945
He has an account now.

319
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:44,407
Of course, it’s private.

320
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,252
Is this from last night?

321
00:19:57,253 --> 00:19:58,588
Review time!

322
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:01,216
Okay, Eva. It’s your turn.

323
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,051
Okay, you ready?

324
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:03,885
- Ready.
- Go, Cly!

325
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,178
- Okay.
- Let’s go!

326
00:20:05,757 --> 00:20:08,967
What is the primary function
of the loop of Henle

327
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,160
in the nephron?

328
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:14,269
The loop of Henle
is for water reabsorption,

329
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,563
and helps establish
the concentration gradient

330
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:17,564
in the kidney,

331
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,443
which allows for production
of concentrated urine.

332
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:23,403
- So smart.
- You’re good!

333
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:25,447
- So she’s smart.
- Ridge, expound.

334
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:28,242
He has never called me smart.

335
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:29,785
What's important
is that God loves me.

336
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:31,454
Lord, thank you! Amen!

337
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:39,294
Happy Birthday to the most
brilliant, kind-hearted,

338
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,129
and amazing person I know.

339
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,675
Grateful to have you and for
everything you’ve done for me.

340
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,470
Cheers to many more years
of memories together!

341
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:52,308
Wait, is there something
going on between them?

342
00:20:56,896 --> 00:20:58,606
Why am I feeling like this?

343
00:20:58,898 --> 00:21:01,401
First, I kissed him
on the cheeks.

344
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:05,113
Now, I’m feeling jealous?

345
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:10,034
No, I’m just confused.
This is nothing.

346
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:23,423
Oh my gosh he’s here.

347
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,800
I’m not ready to face him yet.

348
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:32,053
Maui!

349
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,423
Didn't see you there.

350
00:21:35,184 --> 00:21:36,602
Hi! Hey!

351
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:39,188
I was just outside
getting some fresh air.

352
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:41,482
Are you still hungover?

353
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:44,323
Yes, I actually have
a headache now.

354
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:47,910
Last night just got a little
out of hand, I guess.

355
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:50,246
Probably the alcohol talking.

356
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:53,374
Whatever happened, just
forget about it, seriously.

357
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:56,627
Forget about what exactly?

358
00:21:57,586 --> 00:21:59,422
What do you want me to forget?

359
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:02,590
Nevermind.
So...

360
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:03,591
So?

361
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:05,761
So, have you eaten yet?

362
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:08,139
Yes. Actually, I’m full.

363
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:10,808
I ate with Eva
before I went home.

364
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:12,560
Eva, huh?

365
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,646
Okay. Actually, I'm full too.

366
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:20,525
Okay.

367
00:22:31,787 --> 00:22:34,122
Why does it bother me so much?

368
00:22:34,123 --> 00:22:36,000
I’m not supposed
to feel this way.

369
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:04,110
Damn! Do you guys
know how wild

370
00:23:04,111 --> 00:23:05,070
the party was?

371
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:07,906
Sam here was so hyper!

372
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:09,240
She was sexy dancing with Sevi,

373
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:10,617
and Sevi was just
standing like a statue.

374
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:12,787
He was disgusted with Sam.

375
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:15,955
It’s too bad we didn’t
get to witness that.

376
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:19,250
Right, it’s been a while since
we all went out together.

377
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:20,376
What do you expect?

378
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:22,588
Yanna hasn’t been around.

379
00:23:22,963 --> 00:23:24,298
- Where is she?
- Right.

380
00:23:24,924 --> 00:23:26,424
Do you know
what happened to her?

381
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:27,842
Yes, where is she anyway?

382
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:29,261
Is she avoiding us?

383
00:23:31,013 --> 00:23:32,597
Should I tell them?

384
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:35,267
It’s better if it will
come from Yanna.

385
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,853
Girls, she’s just

386
00:23:38,187 --> 00:23:39,522
going through something.

387
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:42,191
And I think she
needs some space.

388
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:45,986
Going through something or
is she ghosting us?

389
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,279
Luna, it’s not like that.

390
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,697
You know something
about ghosting?

391
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:51,634
It’s when they’ve seen
your messages,

392
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:53,910
then pretend
there's a problem...

393
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:56,788
and then you find out
they're a cheater!

394
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:58,164
They already have another girl.

395
00:23:58,165 --> 00:23:59,374
That's it!

396
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,210
I think this is about
something else.

397
00:24:01,544 --> 00:24:02,461
Right?

398
00:24:02,462 --> 00:24:05,171
But really, that's
actually a big red flag.

399
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:07,507
Whether it's in a
relationship or friendship,

400
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:09,384
ghosting is never okay, right?

401
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:11,636
True! If you're done,

402
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:13,471
just say it properly, right?

403
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:15,182
Not just ghosting
out of nowhere.

404
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:17,643
I have a question.

405
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:19,394
Speaking of red flags...

406
00:24:19,395 --> 00:24:22,272
Do you think a guy
is a red flag if

407
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:25,275
he is hanging out
with two girls at a time?

408
00:24:25,276 --> 00:24:27,403
Looks like this is
about something else, too.

409
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:28,821
It depends.

410
00:24:29,488 --> 00:24:31,407
What do you mean by hanging out?

411
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,202
Well, I know a guy
who is normally

412
00:24:36,203 --> 00:24:37,204
grumpy

413
00:24:37,746 --> 00:24:40,374
but he’s being nice
and sweet to two girls.

414
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,250
Is he leading them on?

415
00:24:42,251 --> 00:24:43,252
Backburner!

416
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:45,253
- Backburner?
- Backburner!

417
00:24:45,254 --> 00:24:49,507
For example.
A guy has two girls.

418
00:24:49,508 --> 00:24:52,093
He’s keeping the second one
as an option.

419
00:24:52,094 --> 00:24:54,637
So, if the first one
doesn't work out,

420
00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:56,472
he goes to the second one.
Backburner.

421
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:57,807
And where did you read that?

422
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:00,185
Dude, it's true. Legit.

423
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:04,147
I mean, I'm just telling you
guys so at least you don't...

424
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:05,148
What do you call it?

425
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:07,443
So you don’t become
colorblind to red flags.

426
00:25:07,693 --> 00:25:10,279
Wow, you managed to
squeeze that back in, huh?

427
00:25:11,572 --> 00:25:13,323
Why? Who’s...

428
00:25:13,324 --> 00:25:15,367
Who’s the guy? Why’d you ask?

429
00:25:16,118 --> 00:25:19,246
It’s nothing.
A guy from school and...

430
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,790
he’s doing that
to one of my friends!

431
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:23,000
No big deal.

432
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,013
What time are you coming home?

433
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:44,187
Hey, I’m just curious.

434
00:25:44,188 --> 00:25:48,317
Who’s Eva? Why are you
always hanging out with her?

435
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:54,948
I don’t need to know.
It’s not my business.

436
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:56,200
We’re not a couple.

437
00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:01,789
Naomi’s Birthday -
seven days left!

438
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:08,753
It’s like, we’re a thing. But also...

439
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:10,213
They’re talking...

440
00:26:10,214 --> 00:26:11,339
- I’ll talk to you.
- Something like that.

441
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,424
I’m playing safe with you.

442
00:26:16,428 --> 00:26:19,347
- Where are you?
- I know Naomi likes photography,

443
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:21,266
so I hope she loves
her birthday gift.

444
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:25,353
Maybe shoes, but
you don’t have to.

445
00:26:25,354 --> 00:26:27,522
Is that Naomi with Jaron?

446
00:26:27,523 --> 00:26:28,523
Really?

447
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,276
I know him.

448
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:32,319
He’s a schoolmate,

449
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,946
a year younger than me.

450
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:47,750
Naomi’s turning eighteen.

451
00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:49,877
She can date whoever she wants.

452
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:50,962
But...

453
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:52,505
last time I checked,

454
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:55,008
Jaron is dating Raylee’s sister.

455
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:57,720
So what the hell
is he doing with Naomi?

456
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:03,434
- Promise.
- Okay, sure.

457
00:27:14,778 --> 00:27:15,778
So,

458
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:17,990
how are you and Cy?

459
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:21,910
We're fine.

460
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:23,370
Nothing’s changed.

461
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:25,247
By the way, look.

462
00:27:26,957 --> 00:27:28,959
Pretty bag, right?

463
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,919
Do you like it?

464
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:33,989
Mom, that’s way too
expensive for a bag.

465
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:37,098
Jeez, Maui.

466
00:27:37,468 --> 00:27:40,471
Limited edition or luxury bags

467
00:27:41,013 --> 00:27:42,431
are just like love...

468
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,683
- Here we go…
- or relationships,

469
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:46,602
it's hard to find.

470
00:27:47,644 --> 00:27:49,480
Impossible to forget,

471
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:52,190
and totally worth the search.

472
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:54,234
So, you really have to value it,

473
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:56,487
and you have
to take good care of it.

474
00:27:57,863 --> 00:27:59,073
Okay, Mom.

475
00:28:00,074 --> 00:28:01,075
By the way,

476
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:04,035
I think Naomi is going
through something.

477
00:28:04,036 --> 00:28:05,621
I don’t really care.

478
00:28:07,498 --> 00:28:09,166
How could you not care, Mom?

479
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:11,585
She lives in the same
house as you,

480
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:15,421
and she needs attention,
especially motherly love.

481
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:16,632
Oh my gosh.

482
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:19,468
Maui, I’m not her mother.

483
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:21,345
And besides,

484
00:28:21,804 --> 00:28:23,847
her mom died because of her.

485
00:28:24,556 --> 00:28:26,599
Mom, do you even hear
yourself right now?

486
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:29,119
Of course, I hear myself.

487
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:32,088
It's true. Her mom died
because of her.

488
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:34,967
Because that kid wanted to
go swimming at the beach.

489
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:38,554
I have to make this call.

490
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:42,349
Hello?

491
00:28:43,684 --> 00:28:44,852
Patrick?

492
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:48,147
Can I speak with Hannah?

493
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:51,316
I want the bag.

494
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:54,485
What do you mean, waiting list?

495
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:56,906
Where’s Hannah?
May I speak to Hannah?

496
00:28:58,031 --> 00:29:00,075
Hannah! Yes.

497
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:03,870
Yes, I want the bag.

498
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,888
The White Ostrich. Yes!

499
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:08,207
Now.

500
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:19,845
Naomi.

501
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:22,430
Naomi!

502
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:23,947
Naomi, can we talk?

503
00:29:25,476 --> 00:29:26,477
Oh my god.

504
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:30,063
I’m sorry.

505
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:31,940
Hey, it’s fine.

506
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:33,567
It's fine, don’t worry.

507
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,986
Why are you here?

508
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:38,363
I wanted to talk to you.

509
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,948
About what?

510
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:45,245
I saw you with Jaron.

511
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:47,831
Is there something going on
between the two of you?

512
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:50,626
No, we’re just friends.

513
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,252
I’m just concerned about you.

514
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:55,255
I know Jaron is
dating someone else.

515
00:29:56,131 --> 00:29:57,882
Please, don’t meddle
with my relationships

516
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,091
with other people.

517
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:00,551
I'm not a kid anymore.

518
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:02,346
I can make decisions for myself.

519
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:04,640
Even though it will hurt you?

520
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,643
Everything hurts me, Sam.

521
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:10,187
I’m already numb.

522
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:15,999
So, please stop acting
like you care about me.

523
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:18,558
Stop protecting me.

524
00:30:20,146 --> 00:30:22,199
I really care about you, Naomi.

525
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:02,072
Maui.

526
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:04,590
How’s your wound?

527
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:07,076
It’s better now.

528
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:08,077
Let me see.

529
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,337
Does it feel cold?

530
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:20,965
Actually, you should
see a doctor,

531
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,051
to make sure you
didn’t damage any nerve.

532
00:31:24,553 --> 00:31:25,554
I will.

533
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:27,806
Okay.

534
00:31:33,437 --> 00:31:34,437
Cy...

535
00:31:34,521 --> 00:31:35,521
random question.

536
00:31:37,608 --> 00:31:39,901
Why did you want to be a doctor?

537
00:31:41,028 --> 00:31:42,946
Was it because of your family?

538
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:47,409
It was at first.

539
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:54,498
Charles used to
physically hit me

540
00:31:54,499 --> 00:31:55,834
when we were kids.

541
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:58,462
Oh no.

542
00:31:59,463 --> 00:32:01,505
I’m sorry you went through that.

543
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:02,507
Thanks.

544
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:07,346
I didn’t tell
my parents about it.

545
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,972
That’s why

546
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:11,141
I learned how to treat myself.

547
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:13,852
And it also occurred to me that

548
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:18,230
I’d rather help other
people than myself.

549
00:32:18,231 --> 00:32:20,108
Kids, especially.

550
00:32:22,444 --> 00:32:24,821
That’s why you chose pediatrics?

551
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:30,118
I wanted to help
people in all aspects..

552
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:32,746
Fighting against injustice,

553
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:35,547
standing by those
who can’t defend themselves,

554
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:37,346
donating,

555
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,050
providing medical care.

556
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,010
Whatever I can do to help.

557
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,721
I have the privilege to do so.

558
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:46,765
I don’t want to just
close my eyes and act

559
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:48,142
like nothing’s happening.

560
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,356
Anyway, you should
get some rest.

561
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:55,525
I’ll prepare dinner tonight.

562
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,026
You’re cooking?

563
00:32:58,027 --> 00:32:59,027
Yes.

564
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:01,698
I’ll just call you
when it’s ready.

565
00:33:03,157 --> 00:33:04,868
Okay. Thanks, Cy.

566
00:33:15,837 --> 00:33:17,005
Let’s eat!

567
00:33:20,383 --> 00:33:22,343
Thanks for cooking.

568
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:23,887
You’re welcome.

569
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,973
I do enjoy cooking.

570
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:29,726
It's a mental break from all the

571
00:33:30,226 --> 00:33:32,020
memorizing and studying.

572
00:33:34,063 --> 00:33:35,064
Here you go.

573
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:36,649
Thank you.

574
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:40,986
Let me.

575
00:33:48,953 --> 00:33:49,953
I’m sorry.

576
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:51,039
It’s okay.

577
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:56,835
Go.

578
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:58,962
Okay, let’s eat.

579
00:33:58,963 --> 00:33:59,963
Yes.

580
00:34:10,892 --> 00:34:11,893
Sam.

581
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:16,064
Let’s mate.

582
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:17,565
Huh?

583
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:18,732
I think we should mate.

584
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:19,734
Huh?

585
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,071
Let’s date.

586
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:26,699
What?

587
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:28,117
Are you serious?

588
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:30,536
What do you mean date?
As in...

589
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:32,664
date romantically?

590
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:35,583
Yes. Let’s make this work.

591
00:34:39,253 --> 00:34:40,254
What do you mean?

592
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:42,465
What are we going to work on?

593
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:45,218
Our non-existent relationship.

594
00:34:45,843 --> 00:34:49,263
I mean, if you want to continue
living with each other,

595
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:50,806
then

596
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:52,308
we should make this work.

597
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:56,187
So,

598
00:34:57,063 --> 00:34:58,564
you want us to date?

599
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:00,733
Let’s hang out.

600
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:02,442
Hang out?

601
00:35:02,443 --> 00:35:03,735
Yes, hang out.

602
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:05,404
I mean, for example,

603
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:08,700
I cooked so
we could eat together

604
00:35:09,492 --> 00:35:11,451
and hang out like this.

605
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:12,911
He’s so confusing.

606
00:35:12,912 --> 00:35:15,747
For example.
A guy has two girls.

607
00:35:15,748 --> 00:35:18,375
He’s keeping the
second one as an option.

608
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:20,460
So, if the first one
doesn't work out,

609
00:35:20,461 --> 00:35:22,171
he goes to the second one.
Backburner.

610
00:35:23,381 --> 00:35:25,258
Maybe Luna’s right.

611
00:35:25,717 --> 00:35:27,677
Maybe I am the backburner.

612
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:30,221
First of all,

613
00:35:30,638 --> 00:35:33,391
don’t say “date me” so casually.

614
00:35:34,058 --> 00:35:36,853
Hanging out and
dating are different, okay?

615
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:38,730
Especially mating.

616
00:35:38,938 --> 00:35:40,605
Check your dictionary.

617
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:41,607
Second,

618
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:45,194
don’t worry about us
continuing to live together.

619
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,530
I’m moving back to
my condo next week anyway.

620
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,032
And lastly,

621
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:51,451
aren't we breaking
the engagement?

622
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:53,119
Isn’t that the deal?

623
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:57,373
Wait.

624
00:35:58,745 --> 00:36:00,621
So, you’re moving out next week?

625
00:36:00,646 --> 00:36:01,646
Yes.

626
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:05,279
I see.

627
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:08,192
I understand.

628
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,988
I’m just going to stay here.

629
00:36:12,613 --> 00:36:15,158
The dogs can’t live with me
in a condo, so...

630
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,076
We’ll just stay here.

631
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:19,037
Do what you want.

632
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,583
And as for the deal,

633
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:25,752
yes,

634
00:36:26,502 --> 00:36:27,545
it’s still on.

635
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:29,087
Good.

636
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:30,923
Better to keep things clear.

637
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:43,603
Ridge is calling.
Excuse me.

638
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,861
Hello?

639
00:37:12,507 --> 00:37:13,925
All right, bye now.

640
00:37:27,063 --> 00:37:28,063
Fine then.

641
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,780
Cheers!

642
00:37:37,448 --> 00:37:38,658
Cheers!

643
00:37:43,371 --> 00:37:45,330
Are you sure it’s okay
for us to be here?

644
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:47,958
Of course!
It’s an open birthday party.

645
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,876
I’ll introduce you
to the birthday girl.

646
00:37:49,877 --> 00:37:50,877
Elle!

647
00:37:51,796 --> 00:37:53,673
- Hi!
- Cheers!

648
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:55,466
Hi, girls!

649
00:37:55,466 --> 00:37:56,342
- Hi!
- This is Elle,

650
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:57,759
she goes to our neighbor school.

651
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,804
Elle, these are my friends,
Sam, Raylee and Ayessa.

652
00:38:00,805 --> 00:38:02,806
- Hi! Happy Birthday, Elle!
- Hi! Happy Birthday, Elle!

653
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:05,226
Thank you so much girls!
Nice to meet you.

654
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
Elle!

655
00:38:09,147 --> 00:38:09,981
Birthday girl!

656
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:12,315
OMG, it’s Eva!

657
00:38:12,316 --> 00:38:16,736
She’s really pretty. Tall,
smart and in med school.

658
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:19,906
They do study
sessions, everything!

659
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:21,241
So, have you eaten yet?

660
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:23,703
We ate with Eva
before I went home.

661
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:26,122
Thank you!

662
00:38:26,123 --> 00:38:27,497
I decided to get a drink.

663
00:38:27,498 --> 00:38:28,749
Yes, sure. Go ahead!

664
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:30,917
Hi, girls!

665
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:32,085
- Hi, Eva!
- Hi!

666
00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:33,463
They’re my friends.

667
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:35,046
It’s so nice to meet you.

668
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:37,175
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Enjoy the party!

669
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:39,343
- Bye!
- Bye!

670
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:41,887
Well, enjoy the night. Bye!

671
00:38:41,888 --> 00:38:43,264
- Bye!
- Bye!

672
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:50,062
So, she’s Eva.

673
00:38:50,938 --> 00:38:52,148
She’s pretty.

674
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:53,816
She doesn’t even look stressed

675
00:38:53,817 --> 00:38:55,651
even though she’s
always up late studying.

676
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:59,864
If she’s here,
maybe he’s…

677
00:39:01,365 --> 00:39:02,949
- There we go.
- Got it. Cheers!

678
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,993
…here.

679
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:15,546
What a joke?

680
00:39:15,796 --> 00:39:18,090
He said he never
takes his ring off.

681
00:39:18,299 --> 00:39:20,551
You’re wearing our
engagement ring today?

682
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:22,178
I always do.

683
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:26,933
I don’t know why this is
bothering me so much.

684
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,809
I’m not even wearing my ring.

685
00:39:29,268 --> 00:39:31,229
But he said
he never takes his off.

686
00:39:31,812 --> 00:39:34,482
But when he’s with Eva,
he doesn’t wear it.

687
00:39:34,774 --> 00:39:35,942
What a lie.

688
00:39:43,824 --> 00:39:46,452
Hey, cheers!

689
00:40:00,508 --> 00:40:01,384
Are you okay?

690
00:40:01,384 --> 00:40:02,384
I’m good.

691
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,970
It’s good.

692
00:40:05,221 --> 00:40:06,221
Right?

693
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:11,059
Girls, I’ll just go
to the restroom.

694
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,228
- Okay.
- Okay.

695
00:40:22,238 --> 00:40:23,239
Hi, girls!

696
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:26,993
Cy.

697
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:33,081
Relax, Sam. It’s okay.
It’s nothing.

698
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:34,709
There’s nothing.

699
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:37,503
I hate him!

700
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:41,507
I’m okay!
I’m okay.

701
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:49,348
Hi!
Bye!

702
00:41:01,861 --> 00:41:03,029
Why are you here?

703
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:06,539
My friend is a friend
of the birthday girl,

704
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,691
so she invited us.

705
00:41:08,692 --> 00:41:10,402
Okay, so let’s just
go home together.

706
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,319
No thanks.

707
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,738
I’m with Raylee.

708
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,906
You can drive your
friends home instead.

709
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:17,157
I think they’re drunk.

710
00:41:17,158 --> 00:41:18,451
What’s your problem?

711
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:19,868
Nothing!

712
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,079
Go, drive Eva home.

713
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,082
Eva’s not going anywhere
‘cause this is her house.

714
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,085
And the birthday girl
is her sister.

715
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:29,629
Well, good for you then.

716
00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:33,925
What’s your problem?

717
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:37,721
Are you jealous?

718
00:41:40,473 --> 00:41:41,683
Where’s your ring?

719
00:41:42,475 --> 00:41:45,227
Why did you have to lie
and say you never take it off?

720
00:41:45,228 --> 00:41:46,228
What?

721
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:48,481
Why are you asking me
about my ring?

722
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:53,028
You’re engaged to me!

723
00:41:53,903 --> 00:41:55,154
I know.

724
00:41:55,155 --> 00:41:56,531
So, where is it?

725
00:42:59,636 --> 00:43:00,637
Hey!

726
00:43:01,096 --> 00:43:02,137
What’s up with you?

727
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:04,724
- Nothing.
- You’re all smiles today.

728
00:43:06,226 --> 00:43:08,936
You know, I've noticed you've
been quite distracted.

729
00:43:08,937 --> 00:43:10,313
Are you thinking of Sam?

730
00:43:12,732 --> 00:43:15,317
Jeez! No use in denying it, bro.

731
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:16,778
I can see it on your face.

732
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,195
You like her.

733
00:43:19,072 --> 00:43:20,240
So what are you waiting for?

734
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,574
Ask her out already!

735
00:43:22,117 --> 00:43:24,786
You better hurry, or someone
else might beat you to it.

736
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:27,788
Bro, how can you say I like her?

737
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:29,331
That’s just your opinion.

738
00:43:29,332 --> 00:43:30,458
Opinion?

739
00:43:31,084 --> 00:43:33,001
This is Ridgen Alcazar
you’re talking to, bro.

740
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:34,462
I have hard fucks.

741
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:35,880
Hard what?

742
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:38,841
Fact. Fucks.

743
00:43:38,842 --> 00:43:41,386
Same thing.
They’re both hard, bro.

744
00:43:42,178 --> 00:43:43,178
Cy,

745
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:47,642
your studies are
your top priority. Right?

746
00:43:48,434 --> 00:43:50,853
But ever since you
started living with Sam,

747
00:43:50,854 --> 00:43:52,271
a lot has changed.

748
00:43:52,272 --> 00:43:53,272
Including you.

749
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:55,650
You became more…

750
00:43:56,317 --> 00:43:57,318
Considerate.

751
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,529
- Huh?
- Huh, my ass.

752
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:02,782
I said so much and
all you can say is, huh?

753
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:04,449
Here,

754
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,327
do you check if she’s eaten?

755
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:08,288
If she got home safe?

756
00:44:08,705 --> 00:44:10,832
Do you ask how her day went?

757
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,210
You’re like a machine
when you're studying, Cy.

758
00:44:14,502 --> 00:44:16,462
But now?

759
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:18,673
You get distracted so easily.

760
00:44:19,382 --> 00:44:20,592
And you know why?

761
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:23,260
Because you like her.

762
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:24,304
Yeah, boy!

763
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:27,599
Bro, think all you want.

764
00:44:28,308 --> 00:44:29,601
I’m just being nice.

765
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:30,935
Nice?

766
00:44:31,477 --> 00:44:32,769
After all the time
we’ve spent together,

767
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,690
do you really think being nice
is even in your vocabulary?

768
00:44:36,983 --> 00:44:37,983
Of course.

769
00:44:38,193 --> 00:44:39,193
As if.

770
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:41,905
And hello, man of few words?

771
00:44:42,488 --> 00:44:44,991
Just confess already,
before it’s too late.

772
00:44:48,578 --> 00:44:49,578
Okay…

773
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:52,832
Sam, date me.

774
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:54,000
Let’s make this official.

775
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,710
So bad. That’s way
too straightforward.

776
00:44:56,711 --> 00:44:57,545
Let’s date.

777
00:44:57,546 --> 00:44:59,297
Let’s take things
more seriously now.

778
00:45:00,423 --> 00:45:01,549
Let’s make it official.

779
00:45:03,051 --> 00:45:03,843
Wait, how do I even say this?

780
00:45:03,844 --> 00:45:04,969
Sam, I think we should...

781
00:45:06,429 --> 00:45:07,804
take things seriously now.

782
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,557
So awful! What are you
even saying, Clyden?

783
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:12,976
Sam.

784
00:45:14,771 --> 00:45:15,939
Let’s mate...

785
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,234
- I think we should mate—
- Huh?

786
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:22,862
Let’s date.

787
00:45:23,446 --> 00:45:24,446
What?

788
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:27,367
Ridge is calling. Excuse me.

789
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:35,832
Hello?

790
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:37,293
Cy, how was it?

791
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:39,420
Did you do it?
Did you confess?

792
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:43,257
I tried, but I got cut off.

793
00:45:43,258 --> 00:45:46,469
And she didn’t respond
the way I hoped.

794
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:48,972
Ridge, I think I messed up.

795
00:45:50,223 --> 00:45:52,517
That’s ‘cause you
didn’t ask for my help!

796
00:45:53,977 --> 00:45:56,813
But seriously, maybe it’s
just not the right time yet.

797
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,274
The moment will come

798
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:01,401
when you won’t be able
to hold it in anymore.

799
00:46:01,567 --> 00:46:03,069
Yes. Maybe you’re right.

800
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:12,744
Bro, it’s your chick.

801
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:13,746
What chick?

802
00:46:13,997 --> 00:46:14,998
Sam!

803
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:17,250
Follow her.

804
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,461
Where’s your ring?

805
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:22,087
Why did you have to lie

806
00:46:22,088 --> 00:46:23,505
and say you never take it off?

807
00:46:23,506 --> 00:46:24,506
What?

808
00:46:24,632 --> 00:46:26,926
Why are you asking me
about my ring?

809
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:31,723
You’re engaged to me!

810
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,974
I know.

811
00:46:33,975 --> 00:46:35,268
So, where is it?

812
00:46:36,311 --> 00:46:38,812
You have no reason
to be jealous, Sam.

813
00:46:38,813 --> 00:46:41,524
I’m not hiding anything.
Why would I?

814
00:46:42,191 --> 00:46:46,237
All I ever think about
is you. Always.

815
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,115
Damn, I want to
kiss you right now.

816
00:46:59,459 --> 00:47:01,251
I already moved out
from our house.

817
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:02,879
Really?

818
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:07,215
What if Clyden comes
to pick you up?

819
00:47:07,216 --> 00:47:08,968
Are you going to say no?

820
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:13,848
Hey, Adi!

821
00:47:15,058 --> 00:47:17,184
Remember the time when
you said you have a friend

822
00:47:17,185 --> 00:47:19,311
who’s interested in meeting me?

823
00:47:19,312 --> 00:47:21,272
Yes. Lewis.

824
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:24,108
Can you set us up for a date?

825
00:47:24,484 --> 00:47:25,485
Why are you here?

826
00:47:27,695 --> 00:47:28,863
I missed you.

827
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:35,286
Sam!
Your boyfriend?

828
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:39,374
You're not even
wearing your ring.

829
00:47:40,249 --> 00:47:42,418
What?
I always wear it.

830
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:45,545
It’s always around your neck.

831
00:47:45,546 --> 00:47:46,506
Fine.

832
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:48,007
I’m going to wear it.

833
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,760
See?
