00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:10,719
Hi!

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,221
Are we a couple now?

3
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,796
Are we, like, a boyfriend-
girlfriend thing now?

4
00:00:16,512 --> 00:00:18,556
Yes, we’re officially together.

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,979
You even have a lip tint on.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,072
He doesn’t even
know it’s my birthday.

7
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,117
What if he has a birthday
suprise for you later?

8
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,452
You should be mad.

9
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,496
It’s totally valid
to feel a little upset.

10
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:39,273
- Hey!
- Happy Birthday!

11
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,623
Lewis!

12
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,833
Wait. There’s a—

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,376
There’s something in your—

14
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:44,886
An eyelash.

15
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,014
I waited the whole day,
but nothing--

16
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,048
Is it okay to do it here?

17
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,258
It’s tinted.

18
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,941
Take it off.

19
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,275
So this is what it feels like.

20
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:10,824
Do you know what you’re doing?

21
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:18,644
Turn around.

22
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:48,197
There’s someone outside, Cy.

23
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:51,601
There’s someone outside.

24
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:57,482
There’s someone outside, Cy.

25
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:09,619
Aren’t you thrilled?

26
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:14,291
Aren’t you? It’s your
first time, right?

27
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,364
Yes.

28
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:18,599
But my goal is not to make you
feel like it’s my first time.

29
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,240
Wow.

30
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:55,975
Hey…

31
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,811
We need to go
back to your party.

32
00:04:58,228 --> 00:04:59,271
Yeah.

33
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:02,139
So…

34
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:04,442
how was it?

35
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:09,072
It felt good.

36
00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:12,742
But I’m tired.
I want to go home.

37
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:14,068
What?

38
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:16,329
Your party hasn’t
even started yet,

39
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:17,334
and you already want to go home?

40
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:18,915
Come on,
clean yourself up first,

41
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:20,417
and then let’s go back in there.

42
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:23,461
I’m tired.

43
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,881
Maui, come on. Let’s go back.

44
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,562
Fine.

45
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:33,387
Love?

46
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:34,555
Yes?

47
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:45,150
Happy Birthday.

48
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:47,865
What’s this?

49
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:53,074
Why are you getting shy now?

50
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:54,800
What is this—

51
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:00,467
What?

52
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,628
Yeah, the ring that you’re
wearing right now,

53
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:07,464
our parents chose it for us.

54
00:06:08,394 --> 00:06:10,604
So, I think it’s just right that

55
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:13,467
I give you a ring
that I picked myself.

56
00:06:14,763 --> 00:06:15,805
But if you don’t want
to wear it,

57
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:17,057
that’s completely fine.

58
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,843
Oh my gosh. This is beautiful.

59
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:23,092
Put it on me.

60
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,231
-Please.
- Okay.

61
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,410
I’m going to marry you.

62
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,209
Don’t be so sure, Cy.

63
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,378
Don’t give me false hopes.

64
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:50,957
What if something big happens
that forces us apart?

65
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,582
Even if the world
forces me to leave you,

66
00:06:57,222 --> 00:06:58,223
I wouldn’t.

67
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:01,476
No matter what happens,

68
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:03,978
I’ll stay right by your side.

69
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:07,690
So, do the same for me.

70
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:09,743
Okay?

71
00:07:10,902 --> 00:07:12,737
I want to stay with you, too.

72
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:17,283
You’ll always be
there for me, right?

73
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:22,747
Of course, love.

74
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:52,067
Yeah.

75
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:53,486
Thank you.

76
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:01,453
- Ke! Don’t leave me!
- Wait!

77
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:02,954
- Hey.
- Sorry, Sam. I’m leaving.

78
00:08:02,954 --> 00:08:03,746
- Huh? Why?
- Wait!

79
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:04,706
- Hey—
- Sorry.

80
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:06,808
Ke! Don’t leave me! Ke!

81
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,334
What’s happening?

82
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:13,089
- Via?
- Larkin, what are you doing?

83
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:14,966
What the—

84
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:18,161
Wow.

85
00:08:18,553 --> 00:08:20,221
I’m so confused right now.

86
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,934
Anyway,

87
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:24,642
let’s just get drinks.

88
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:26,394
Wait, but those were
your friends, right?

89
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:29,522
How chaotic.

90
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:30,565
Let’s go.

91
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,400
Wait ‘til you meet
my best friend.

92
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,949
Hey, it’s okay.

93
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:41,789
You don’t have to drink
if you don’t want to.

94
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,774
No, I want to drink.

95
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,395
Okay.

96
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:53,546
Those were strong.

97
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:57,258
It’s strong because it’s mine.

98
00:08:57,967 --> 00:08:59,719
- Huh?
- Drink this instead.

99
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,095
I ordered it for you.

100
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:04,046
Try it.

101
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:08,486
Oh, yeah. This is better.

102
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:11,981
Don’t get drunk, okay?

103
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:13,566
You used to preach about

104
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:15,276
drinking alcohol back then.

105
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:16,611
Take it easy.

106
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:17,626
It’s just for tonight.

107
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:20,823
I’m still a little embarrassed.

108
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:22,784
Embarrassed? About what?

109
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:24,536
About what happened earlier.

110
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,166
Hey, it’s okay.

111
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,594
You don’t need to feel shy
about giving me a ring.

112
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:34,996
The sex, Maui.

113
00:09:40,385 --> 00:09:41,486
It’s—

114
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:42,532
It’s okay.

115
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:44,681
You don’t have to feel shy.

116
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:45,899
That was

117
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:48,476
unforgettable.

118
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,376
Wait, are you sure
that was your car?

119
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:55,567
Oh my god. Don’t tell me
it was Ridge’s!

120
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,110
No, it’s not Ridge’s car.

121
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,945
That was an old Benz
I used to own.

122
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:00,989
That was my dad’s
graduation gift to me,

123
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:02,865
but I don’t use it
that much anymore.

124
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,620
- Cheers.
- Sam!

125
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:09,247
Girls.

126
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:11,791
Is this the lucky guy?

127
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,002
More like the lucky girl.

128
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:16,379
Sam, your man’s hot.

129
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:21,593
Cy, my blockmates.

130
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,013
Girls, this is Clyden,
my boyfriend.

131
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:27,348
- Hi, nice to meet you!
- Hi, nice to meet you!

132
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:28,600
Nice to meet you, guys.

133
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:30,852
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,146
But you’re wearing
a diamond ring?

135
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:35,023
You’re fucking engaged?

136
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,770
Yes.

137
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:39,551
Okay.

138
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:42,905
You really are
the luckiest girl.

139
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:46,367
Okay. So, we are
celebrating your birthday

140
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:49,285
and your engagement tonight.

141
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,311
Yeah?

142
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:52,749
So, what are we going to do?

143
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,292
Let’s dance!

144
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,419
Girls, let’s celebrate.

145
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:58,212
- Okay.
- Go ahead, girls!

146
00:10:58,212 --> 00:10:59,672
Okay. Let’s go!

147
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,633
I’ll be right there.

148
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:03,593
Hey, you don’t wanna dance?

149
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:04,844
- What?
- Let’s dance.

150
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:07,388
No. I’m not dancing.

151
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:09,432
But sure, I’ll go with you.

152
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,630
Okay.

153
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:15,333
You’re the only one dancing, okay?

154
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:47,889
You.

155
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:51,099
You have brought
so much joy to my life.

156
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:53,476
You’ve made my heart flutter.

157
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:55,812
You’ve made me feel things

158
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:58,064
I’ve only known
in songs and stories.

159
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:01,818
From the moment I met you,

160
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:03,903
it felt like things
in my life

161
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:05,947
were finally starting
to fall into place.

162
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:16,124
Every moment with you
feels like a reminder

163
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,293
that life has a way
of surprising you.

164
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,444
The way you look at me,

165
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:47,905
it’s as if you always see
the best parts of me.

166
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:50,533
It doesn’t matter
where we are,

167
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,286
as long as we’re together,

168
00:12:53,286 --> 00:12:54,704
I’m the happiest.

169
00:12:56,748 --> 00:12:58,791
We don’t need big gestures.

170
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,627
Just being there
for each other,

171
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,338
and doing the things we love,
are enough.

172
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:08,843
And you became my family
just when I needed one.

173
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:12,054
Remember when you asked me,

174
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:16,058
how I’d know if
I was already falling in love?

175
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:21,606
I knew I was falling in love

176
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:25,359
when I felt a love
I’d never known before,

177
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:28,823
when my fears
faded into ease,

178
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:31,184
when being with you
felt like home.

179
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,749
Easy love. That’s us.

180
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,337
Every time
I look at our photos,

181
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,049
I find more reasons to smile.

182
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:51,219
More reasons to love you.

183
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:53,304
And the best part?

184
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,700
We’re just getting started.

185
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:16,702
You've been staring
at that for a while now.

186
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:19,205
You really miss him, huh?

187
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:21,432
Of course.

188
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:24,911
He's just busy with school,
but we still make time.

189
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:27,088
That’s good.

190
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:31,008
Hey, thanks by the way,

191
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:33,594
for letting me stay here.

192
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:36,389
Come on, you're my best friend!

193
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,766
You can stay here
as long as you want.

194
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,687
Are you sure you're okay
living with two Yanna's here?

195
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,534
Of course!

196
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,691
I'd love to wake up
with my godchild around!

197
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:48,135
Wait,

198
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,912
have you thought of a name yet?

199
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:53,072
I'm still thinking about it.

200
00:14:58,244 --> 00:14:59,745
How about Avi?

201
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:01,247
Since you like aviation.

202
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,541
That could work!

203
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:05,793
Avrielle.

204
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:09,088
Kinda close to April too,

205
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,019
since we made her in April.

206
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:12,697
Yanna—

207
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:14,439
Thanks for that TMI.

208
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,650
But, yeah. Avrielle.

209
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:19,694
I love that name.

210
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,364
Her second name could be
related to the sky.

211
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:24,365
What do you think?

212
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,951
Haven?

213
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,353
Yanna, that’s so beautiful.

214
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:32,957
She has her parents’ initials.

215
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:40,840
Avrielle Haven.

216
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:44,636
Hey, she kicked!

217
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:45,572
Really?

218
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:48,353
- Baby!
- She likes the name too.

219
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,185
All right, I’ve decided.

220
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,522
At least through her name,

221
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,442
Hiro can still be
a part of our child.

222
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:04,697
Avrielle Haven,

223
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,200
your auntie is
going to spoil you!

224
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,743
Auntie?

225
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:09,911
Yeah, why not?

226
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:11,746
Okay, fine!

227
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,755
What’s with all this stuff?

228
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:22,376
Do you have a business
or something?

229
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:24,625
No. They're for the kids,

230
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,763
for the charity event
this weekend.

231
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:30,682
You’re too kind!

232
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:34,727
- Avrielle.
- Avrielle. Avi!

233
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:48,489
Sam!

234
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:49,551
Hey!

235
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:51,869
You’re finally here.

236
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:54,330
Of course, this is my event.

237
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:57,542
Guys, this is Naomi,

238
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:58,626
my sister.

239
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:00,712
- Hello.
- Hello!

240
00:17:00,712 --> 00:17:02,230
- They’re my highschool friends.
- I’m Sevi.

241
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,965
Sevi, Via, and Luna.

242
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,591
They’re all nice.

243
00:17:06,384 --> 00:17:07,385
Are you okay?

244
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:11,459
And who’s this?

245
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:13,558
This is Clyden.

246
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:15,309
My boyfriend.

247
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:16,988
Huh?

248
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,481
Hello! I'm Via.

249
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:21,725
Clyden.

250
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,627
You two are so cute,
I hope you never break up.

251
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,903
Via, I've heard that before.

252
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:28,364
You told us not to break up,
and then we did.

253
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,629
That’s bad luck.

254
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:31,242
What do you mean,
Via's bad luck?

255
00:17:31,242 --> 00:17:33,152
- You're the bad luck, Luna.
- Huh?

256
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,754
The name’s Sevi, bro.

257
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,129
Clyden.

258
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,175
It’s him. He’s the one
dancing with—

259
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,261
Why bring it up?

260
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:51,721
He doesn’t
remember it anymore…

261
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,209
Luna, by the way.

262
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:56,309
I’m Clyden.
Nice to meet you all.

263
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:58,144
You’re too formal, bro.

264
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:01,676
Aren’t you pretty?

265
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:07,754
Hey!

266
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,782
Sorry, I’m just a little late.

267
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:12,684
Hi!

268
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:13,910
This is my boyfriend.

269
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,348
Hi, bro!

270
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:19,082
You probably know me already,

271
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:20,574
so I won’t bother
introducing myself.

272
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:22,090
Wow.

273
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:24,754
I don’t know you.

274
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:32,637
That's Arkin.

275
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,306
One of my high school friends.

276
00:18:38,142 --> 00:18:40,103
Arkin Sanchez, bro.

277
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:42,973
Clyden.

278
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:46,676
Aren’t you familiar with my song?

279
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:48,293
No?

280
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,115
Or maybe you’re
familiar with this line.

281
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:55,701
Am I not enough?

282
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,454
Am I still not enough for you?

283
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:02,333
That’s one of my famous
lines from my movie.

284
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,082
You didn’t get to watch it?

285
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:08,566
You didn’t?
Or maybe you know this one.

286
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:12,902
Refreshing!

287
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:14,027
That’s a commercial.

288
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:17,181
You haven’t even seen it on—

289
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:19,725
- On TV?
- I don’t watch TV.

290
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:21,622
Sorry.

291
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:22,848
Well, that explains it.

292
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:25,873
You should try watching.
TV’s fun, bro.

293
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,879
Sometimes there’s news
and a lot of—

294
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:30,111
Let me help you.

295
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:31,320
This looks heavy.

296
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:32,613
You should help out!

297
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:33,698
You’re just laughing there,

298
00:19:33,698 --> 00:19:35,241
not doing anything useful,
no help at all.

299
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,200
- Take this!
- Moron,

300
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,746
you just embarrassed
yourself, dude.

301
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:40,621
Okay! Guys, we’re all here now.

302
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:44,041
Too bad Yanna
and Ke can’t make it.

303
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,668
All right, let’s go.

304
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:47,211
- The kids are almost here.
- Let me help you.

305
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:48,254
Let’s go.

306
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,715
- Thank you.
- Where should this be?

307
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,858
[background chattering]

308
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:52,066
Just over there.

309
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,635
Before, I used to think
Christmas was

310
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,679
all about food and gifts.

311
00:19:57,513 --> 00:20:02,018
But now, I realize it actually
means something deeper.

312
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:05,634
What really makes
Christmas special are

313
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,696
the people you spend it with.

314
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:11,861
I’m proud of you.

315
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,530
So I’m really happy

316
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,074
to be with all of you
this Christmas.

317
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:18,704
I hope

318
00:20:19,243 --> 00:20:22,413
this day becomes a happy
memory for all of you.

319
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:24,081
And whenever
you look back on this,

320
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:27,668
remember that you
deserve all the joy,

321
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:31,047
happiness,
and love in the world.

322
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,649
And to make things
even more fun,

323
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:40,401
Arkin and Sevi prepared a
special dance just for you all!

324
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:42,251
Let’s clap!

325
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:45,119
Let’s go, Sevi!

326
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,126
Cheer for them, kids!

327
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:52,380
Yes! Arkin and Sevi!

328
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:53,281
Hello.

329
00:20:53,306 --> 00:20:54,305
Hi.

330
00:20:54,904 --> 00:20:56,072
Bring Clyden here.

331
00:20:57,949 --> 00:20:58,491
Hi!

332
00:20:58,491 --> 00:20:59,617
- Clap!
- What?

333
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:01,285
I don’t dance. I don’t know how!

334
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:02,620
We have an actor with us.

335
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:03,776
Just follow his lead.

336
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:05,218
We have an actor with us.

337
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:06,977
Just follow his lead.

338
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,227
Clap!

339
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:10,954
Just follow my lead.

340
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:49,352
Hey!

341
00:22:49,352 --> 00:22:50,353
This is for you.

342
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:52,021
Smile at the cam.

343
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:55,149
- Let’s smile at the camera.
- Smile!

344
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:57,735
Okay, thank you.

345
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,448
- For you.
- Thank you, Sam!

346
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:03,866
You’re welcome.

347
00:23:04,158 --> 00:23:05,159
Wait a minute.

348
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,160
I’ll be right back.

349
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:08,425
For you.

350
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,623
Don’t forget to
smile at the cam.

351
00:23:10,648 --> 00:23:11,599
Hi!

352
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:12,833
Come on, let’s join the others.

353
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,543
I’m shy.

354
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,836
What? You're shy?

355
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:18,589
For you, smile at the camera.

356
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:19,757
I’ll get you something,
wait a bit.

357
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:21,759
Okay. Here you go.

358
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:23,427
Here, this is for you.

359
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:24,929
- Excuse me.
- Smile at Naomi.

360
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:29,266
For you.

361
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:32,186
Here. This is my gift for you.

362
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:33,771
Thank you.

363
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:35,898
You’re welcome. Open it.

364
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,902
Wow! Let’s play later, okay?

365
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:41,946
Sure. Do you know
how to play that?

366
00:23:41,946 --> 00:23:42,905
Yes, I do.

367
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,156
What’s your name?

368
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,366
Samantha.

369
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:46,951
You’re Samantha, too?

370
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:52,915
How old are you?

371
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:54,270
Nine years old.

372
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,584
Nine years old, huh…

373
00:23:57,664 --> 00:24:00,641
He’s going to be an amazing
pediatrician one day.

374
00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:31,143
Are you happy?

375
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:32,798
Did you enjoy the event?

376
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:35,583
Yes. Your friends are so fun.

377
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,103
Good.

378
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:39,797
I’m happy that you’re happy.

379
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:45,032
Sam,

380
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,803
thanks for letting me
stay at your house

381
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,346
this holiday break.

382
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:52,808
Naomi, you’re always welcome
to stay anytime you want.

383
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:55,554
And you can celebrate
every Christmas with me

384
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:56,997
until you get tired of it.

385
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:01,400
I want you to be happy.

386
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,771
Always.

387
00:25:05,946 --> 00:25:07,198
Thanks, Sam.

388
00:25:08,282 --> 00:25:10,784
But I don’t think
it's possible for someone

389
00:25:10,784 --> 00:25:12,328
to be happy all the time.

390
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:19,978
Naomi—

391
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:22,963
I know a therapist.

392
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:24,965
Do you wanna meet her?

393
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:29,303
I’m fine.

394
00:25:30,221 --> 00:25:32,515
I’m happy now.

395
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:35,851
You’re happy right now,
but what about tomorrow?

396
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,020
And the following days?

397
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:40,898
Naomi,

398
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:43,817
I wanna help you.
I’m your sister.

399
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:51,742
Okay. I’ll do it because
I don't want to see you cry

400
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:52,910
because of me.

401
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:55,959
I don’t wanna see you sad

402
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:58,428
because of me, okay?

403
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:02,461
Thank you for trying.

404
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:18,233
You good?

405
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:24,483
I’ll just take
a picture of the kids.

406
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,859
Yeah. Sure, enjoy.

407
00:26:35,411 --> 00:26:36,446
Hey.

408
00:26:36,787 --> 00:26:37,790
Hey.

409
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:41,417
I’m so proud of
everything that you do.

410
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:44,503
Thank you for pushing me.

411
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:46,265
Of course.

412
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:48,434
So,

413
00:26:49,717 --> 00:26:51,093
how did your talk with Naomi go?

414
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:55,004
She

415
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:57,057
agreed to see a therapist.

416
00:26:58,058 --> 00:26:59,310
- That’s nice.
- Yeah.

417
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:00,543
Okay.

418
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:09,737
Mom set up a dinner
with both of our families.

419
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:11,488
I wonder what it’s for.

420
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,449
Huh? Really? I have no idea.

421
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:14,867
I don’t know.

422
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:24,335
Sam’s graduation and
Clyden’s clerkship are coming up.

423
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:26,003
After that,

424
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:31,091
we can finally set the wedding
for these two, right?

425
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:34,011
And during their wedding,

426
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,722
I will announce
Clyden’s inheritance

427
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:38,766
for our family business.

428
00:27:39,051 --> 00:27:41,795
Dad, there's really
no need to rush.

429
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:43,354
You're still healthy.

430
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:45,356
It's better to be prepared.

431
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:46,815
And besides,

432
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,360
you don’t need to prove
anything to me anymore.

433
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,248
I gave you so many chances,

434
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,742
and you blew every single one.

435
00:28:01,997 --> 00:28:03,874
But I’m better than him!

436
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,501
I deserve the inheritance!

437
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:07,778
I’m the eldest!

438
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:09,296
Son, please sit down.

439
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,090
In which aspect?

440
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:12,513
What?

441
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:17,199
In which aspect are you
better than me?

442
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:18,764
- Huh?
- Love—

443
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:19,932
I just want to know.

444
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,266
Do I really have
to spell it all out?

445
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,271
Go.

446
00:28:23,394 --> 00:28:25,834
You took everything that
was supposed to be mine.

447
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,357
- The hospital,
- Stop—

448
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:29,746
the house—

449
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:33,112
Your fiancée.

450
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:35,896
What?

451
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:39,159
Does it feel good
to have my leftovers?

452
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:41,537
Fucker, don’t you dare
talk about Samantha like that!

453
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,789
You’re the one who
fucked up your own life.

454
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:45,837
And now you're
blaming it on others?

455
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:47,722
Manners please.

456
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:50,796
- Enough.
- I’m really sorry about this.

457
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:51,922
I’m really sorry.

458
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:55,076
You shouldn’t have been born.

459
00:28:56,343 --> 00:28:57,396
Harsh.

460
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:02,857
Excuse me.

461
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,623
That’s enough.

462
00:29:05,102 --> 00:29:06,019
I’m sorry.

463
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:07,104
Will you excuse us?

464
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:08,230
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

465
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,349
Hey.

466
00:29:17,202 --> 00:29:19,245
Naomi, please go to your room.

467
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:30,836
Are you okay, sweetheart?

468
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:34,131
Oh my god,
that family is so chaotic.

469
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,301
If we just didn’t need them,

470
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:40,262
right now, right then—

471
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:42,514
I would have pulled you out
of that engagement.

472
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,615
What?

473
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,892
Why do we need them?

474
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:50,089
Maui,

475
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:53,150
just in case
anything happens to us,

476
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,694
you need Clyden.

477
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:59,281
With Clyden, your future’s
gonna be secure.

478
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:01,992
So just lean on him, okay?

479
00:30:06,497 --> 00:30:09,041
That wasn’t the first time
he said that.

480
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:11,710
I’m sorry.

481
00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:16,774
The hell with that
fucking inheritance!

482
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,467
If he wants it that badly,
then fine,

483
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:20,258
let him have
the damn inheritance.

484
00:30:22,596 --> 00:30:24,598
Love, I’m tired.

485
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,310
I’m tired of always
receiving shit

486
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,729
for putting hard work
in everything that I did.

487
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,107
Do I deserve nothing?

488
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:37,319
Should I always be
considerate to those fuckers

489
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:40,280
who did nothing but to
make my life a living hell?

490
00:30:44,952 --> 00:30:48,956
You deserve everything good
in this world, love.

491
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:55,754
You’re the only
good thing in this world.

492
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,841
No, Cy.

493
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:01,510
Despite everything,

494
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,804
there are still a lot
of good things in this world.

495
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,474
And we’ll experience
them together.

496
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:11,395
Today was just a bad day.

497
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:15,816
You know what?
Christmas is coming soon.

498
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:17,531
I just want to

499
00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:21,780
celebrate and enjoy it
peacefully with you and Naomi.

500
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,824
Just us being together.

501
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:25,868
Okay.

502
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,053
Okay.

503
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:29,955
Let’s make the most out of it,

504
00:31:30,914 --> 00:31:31,953
together.

505
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:52,102
Merry Christmas!

506
00:31:54,714 --> 00:31:56,716
Okay, what is this?

507
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:57,782
Open it.

508
00:32:00,694 --> 00:32:01,987
Oh my gosh!

509
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,448
My dream heels!

510
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:05,746
Love…

511
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:09,161
I hope someday, you could
wear those on the runway.

512
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:12,585
- That really suits you, Sam.
- Right?

513
00:32:13,855 --> 00:32:14,940
Thank you, love.

514
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:16,480
You're welcome.

515
00:32:17,794 --> 00:32:20,672
So, here’s my gift.

516
00:32:25,649 --> 00:32:26,817
Wow!

517
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,391
To always remind you that
I’m always here for you

518
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:33,310
throughout your whole journey.

519
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,978
You’ve still got
a long way to go,

520
00:32:34,978 --> 00:32:36,605
but you’ve come so far already.

521
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,711
Thank you, love.

522
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,361
- All right.
- Okay.

523
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:48,408
That looks good on you, Clyden.

524
00:32:48,408 --> 00:32:49,034
- Thank you.
- I know, right?

525
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,093
Yeah.

526
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:51,168
I like it.

527
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:52,579
Of course,

528
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:55,832
we have a gift
for my favorite sister.

529
00:32:57,271 --> 00:32:58,293
Open it.

530
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:03,590
Really?

531
00:33:04,926 --> 00:33:05,884
Yeah.

532
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:09,471
A photography book? No way!

533
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,807
I’ll read this everyday, Sam.

534
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:12,641
And when I get better,

535
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:14,433
I’ll take your
modeling portfolio.

536
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:16,269
Merry Christmas!

537
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:18,021
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

538
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:21,525
Thank you, Sam.
Thank you, Clyden.

539
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:22,558
Merry Christmas.

540
00:33:23,944 --> 00:33:26,363
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, let’s eat.

541
00:33:26,363 --> 00:33:27,394
- Okay.
- Okay.

542
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:29,743
Cheers!

543
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:31,687
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

544
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:37,791
Wow! You really look
like a model, Sam!

545
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:38,801
You know,

546
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,676
I’ve been learning a lot from
the book that you gave me.

547
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:43,922
I hope I can do justice
in this shoot.

548
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,132
Okay, let’s do it.

549
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:47,196
You know what, you’re getting
better at this.

550
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:49,594
Okay, what else?

551
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:50,721
This one?

552
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:52,514
Yeah. Try a different pose.

553
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:56,309
You know what, you’re getting
good at this.

554
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:57,908
This one?

555
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:03,715
See!

556
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,778
You can really be
a professional model one day.

557
00:34:07,037 --> 00:34:08,831
- Really?
- Yeah.

558
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:11,199
I’ve been watching videos online

559
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,848
and it seems like
they're working.

560
00:34:15,245 --> 00:34:16,288
Wow.

561
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,832
You know, if I didn’t know you,

562
00:34:18,832 --> 00:34:21,251
I’d totally mistake you
for a supermodel.

563
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:23,693
Yeah. Look at these, Clyden.

564
00:34:23,718 --> 00:34:24,730
Let me see.

565
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:25,970
Gorgeous.

566
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,218
Which one?
The shots or the model?

567
00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:31,629
Both.

568
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:34,556
Oh, come on.
Okay. Your turn, Clyden.

569
00:34:34,556 --> 00:34:36,141
- Your turn.
- Oh, yeah.

570
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:38,060
- Me?
- Pose for us.

571
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,562
- Go.
- I wanna see your poses.

572
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:41,480
Okay, go.

573
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,814
- I don’t know how!
- Go, love!

574
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:43,565
Go, go.

575
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:44,357
Go.

576
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:46,988
Go.

577
00:34:47,903 --> 00:34:49,696
Wow, not bad.

578
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:50,947
That could work too.

579
00:34:50,947 --> 00:34:52,991
Could even be a dog model.

580
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,077
Dog what? You're cracking up.

581
00:34:55,077 --> 00:34:56,703
You’re just making fun of me.

582
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:58,288
- Okay, your turn!
- What?

583
00:34:58,288 --> 00:34:59,164
- No way.
- Yeah.

584
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:00,123
It's your turn,

585
00:35:00,123 --> 00:35:01,374
- It’s your turn.
- No, I’m the photographer.

586
00:35:01,374 --> 00:35:02,379
No.

587
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:03,477
I’ll take the photo.

588
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:04,941
Let’s just do a selfie instead.

589
00:35:05,545 --> 00:35:06,713
– All right.
– Okay.

590
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:19,215
Let me see.

591
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:27,901
Wait, I’ll just get something.

592
00:35:31,154 --> 00:35:33,031
So, you’re going home tomorrow?

593
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:38,328
I don’t even know if I could
call that house my home.

594
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:41,498
I’m sorry, I know the feeling.

595
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:44,042
Well, our house is always here

596
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:47,212
if you ever need a safe space.

597
00:35:47,904 --> 00:35:52,534
Did you move out of that house
to get away from me?

598
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:54,364
What? No.

599
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,265
I moved out ‘cause my condo’s
closer to school—

600
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,518
and I thought maybe
you’d be more comfortable

601
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:02,853
if I weren’t at home.

602
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,640
The truth is,

603
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,749
when you moved out,

604
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:10,110
it felt harder to breathe
in that house.

605
00:36:12,696 --> 00:36:14,781
I don’t understand
myself either.

606
00:36:15,878 --> 00:36:17,463
When you were still around,

607
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:20,095
I felt envy and anger,

608
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,413
but when you went away—

609
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:25,041
I felt fear. I felt scared.

610
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:29,421
That night on my birthday,

611
00:36:30,046 --> 00:36:32,215
I didn’t know why I texted you.

612
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:34,384
My hands moved

613
00:36:34,634 --> 00:36:36,219
before I could even think.

614
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:40,348
But you made the right choice.

615
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,977
It was actually one
of the few things I did

616
00:36:43,977 --> 00:36:46,021
that led me to good things.

617
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:52,777
I wanna go there.

618
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,041
Where?

619
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:58,325
To the moon.

620
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,118
Or just beside it.

621
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,347
I wanna be one of the stars.

622
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:22,641
You shine bright
in my eyes, Naomi.

623
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,059
Like a star.

624
00:37:28,488 --> 00:37:30,657
Do you think there’s
pain there, Sam?

625
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:32,692
I’m not sure,

626
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,778
but I hope there’s none.

627
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:41,076
Thank you for making me happy,

628
00:37:41,076 --> 00:37:43,161
even for a short period of time.

629
00:37:44,746 --> 00:37:45,747
Of course.

630
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:51,211
I’ll be here with you as you go
through your healing process.

631
00:37:52,249 --> 00:37:53,544
May this year be

632
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:55,822
a wonderful year for both of us.

633
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:58,093
I hope so, Sam.

634
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,844
I really do.

635
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:08,019
Naomi, why do you want that?

636
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:10,480
What do you mean?

637
00:38:11,564 --> 00:38:13,024
To be one of the stars.

638
00:38:21,658 --> 00:38:22,951
I’m jealous.

639
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,578
I want to shine bright
like a star.

640
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,123
Look at that star.

641
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:31,835
It gives you hope, right?

642
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:36,464
The light it emits amidst
the darkness gives you hope.

643
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:39,676
I wonder how that feels,

644
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:42,220
to look as pretty as that star.

645
00:38:42,974 --> 00:38:44,976
That when people look at you,

646
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:46,544
it gives them hope.

647
00:38:48,363 --> 00:38:50,866
You look as pretty as that star.

648
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:54,424
No, you look prettier.

649
00:38:55,587 --> 00:38:58,795
You have this radiance that
no star could ever give.

650
00:38:59,054 --> 00:39:00,931
And when I look at you,

651
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:03,366
I don’t only think about hope.

652
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,869
I think about how blessed I am

653
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:07,871
to have a sister
like you in my life.

654
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,531
You keep me going, too, Naomi.

655
00:39:11,024 --> 00:39:12,067
I do?

656
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,267
Yeah.

657
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,836
So I wish

658
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,312
you could see hope in me, too.

659
00:39:17,547 --> 00:39:18,882
I’ll be your star.

660
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:21,468
A star doesn't necessarily

661
00:39:21,468 --> 00:39:23,720
have to be in the sky
to shine, right?

662
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:28,058
You’re here on the ground,

663
00:39:28,641 --> 00:39:30,101
but I’ll be here with you.

664
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:32,697
You don’t have
to look up anymore.

665
00:39:32,722 --> 00:39:34,682
Just look for me
and I’ll be here.

666
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:36,766
I’ll always be here.

667
00:39:45,747 --> 00:39:47,708
It’s almost twelve.

668
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:51,164
- Where’s mine?
- Here.

669
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:54,417
Ten, nine—

670
00:39:54,781 --> 00:40:01,191
eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one!

671
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:04,302
- Happy new year!
- Happy new year!

672
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:08,056
- Happy new year, love.
- Happy new year.

673
00:40:09,278 --> 00:40:10,654
You guys are too sweet.

674
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,853
Happy new year, Sam and Clyden.

675
00:40:13,853 --> 00:40:16,398
I’m so thankful to start
this year with you.

676
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:19,109
More years to spend together.

677
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:20,485
I’m claiming it.

678
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,343
This will be a good year
for all of us!

679
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:26,825
Wait, let’s take a picture.

680
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:27,409
Okay.

681
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:28,392
- Okay.
- Okay.

682
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,369
Hold this.

683
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:30,954
I’ll help you with this one.

684
00:40:30,954 --> 00:40:31,978
Okay, wait.

685
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,002
Say, cheese.

686
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,463
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

687
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:43,425
That’s nice!

688
00:40:47,887 --> 00:40:49,222
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

689
00:40:49,222 --> 00:40:52,016
You’re graduating soon.
Congrats, Sam!

690
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:55,395
Thank you. You know what,
I’m so excited,

691
00:40:55,395 --> 00:40:58,189
but I’m definitely
going to miss my friends.

692
00:40:58,815 --> 00:41:00,692
Well, I might have some news

693
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,111
that might make leaving
school a little easier.

694
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:04,946
What is it?

695
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:06,865
Zenaida Models.

696
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,783
They loved your portfolio!

697
00:41:09,492 --> 00:41:10,869
They’re gonna sign you.

698
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,745
Wait. What?
Are you serious?

699
00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:14,456
Oh my god. Giselle!

700
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:16,166
I know, they're gonna
call you up.

701
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,750
Oh my gosh.

702
00:41:18,585 --> 00:41:20,170
I don’t know.
Is this really happening?

703
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,379
Oh my gosh.
I can’t believe it.

704
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:22,404
Yes.

705
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:24,215
They wanna fly you
to Singapore,

706
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,651
so you can sign the contract

707
00:41:25,676 --> 00:41:27,427
and then they’ll launch you
on their website.

708
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:28,620
Girl, you’re in!

709
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:30,680
It’s really happening!
Oh my gosh!

710
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,931
You know what, I’m so happy.

711
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:33,224
Wait, I need to call someone.

712
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:33,933
Go ahead.

713
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:35,310
I need to share this big news.

714
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:43,609
Cy! Hi, you won’t believe it.

715
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:47,030
I got the offer, the agency
is going to sign me.

716
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,698
What? Really?

717
00:41:48,823 --> 00:41:49,824
That’s great news, love.

718
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,075
I’m so proud of you!

719
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:53,620
I really can’t believe this.

720
00:41:55,163 --> 00:41:56,664
I’ll call you later, okay?

721
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:58,142
Yeah, bye.

722
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:02,021
- Cheers?
- Cheers!

723
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,258
Cheers!

724
00:42:18,554 --> 00:42:20,347
Congratulations, Sam!

725
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,416
Thank you, enjoy the party.

726
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:25,735
Sam.

727
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:27,779
This is my daughter, Sam.

728
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:31,824
And this is Clyden Ramirez,
the heir to Ramirez Medical.

729
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,618
They’re engaged.

730
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:37,531
What a young lovely couple.
When’s the wedding?

731
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:40,875
Mid next year.

732
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,545
Don’t worry,
I’ll send you the invites.

733
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,549
Next year? We haven’t
even set the date yet.

734
00:42:48,091 --> 00:42:50,301
Wow. I’m sure it will be
a grand wedding.

735
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:52,554
Of course, you know me.

736
00:42:52,554 --> 00:42:53,888
It will be the wedding
of the year

737
00:42:53,888 --> 00:42:55,557
or maybe the wedding
of the century.

738
00:42:55,557 --> 00:42:57,045
- I agree.
- Wow, that’s so exciting.

739
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,739
Mom, can I talk to you?

740
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:00,812
Excuse me. My daughter
has to talk to me.

741
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:01,896
I’ll just go to the bathroom.

742
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:03,147
- Sure.
- Excuse me, Auntie.

743
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:10,446
Mom, what do you mean
the wedding’s mid next year?

744
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:14,284
You already picked a date
without asking us first?

745
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:15,353
Yes!

746
00:43:16,411 --> 00:43:18,746
Clyden is graduating
next year, remember?

747
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:22,333
It’s so hard to
prepare for a wedding.

748
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:24,669
Let me handle everything, okay?

749
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:26,546
Just please,

750
00:43:27,046 --> 00:43:29,215
let me handle it.
Just cooperate with me, okay?

751
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,718
We need to rush
your wedding, Maureen.

752
00:43:31,968 --> 00:43:32,968
Why?

753
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:34,750
I don’t wanna rush my wedding.

754
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:37,223
Mom, I want to do
other things, too.

755
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,184
Well, you can do that.
After your wedding.

756
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,354
We talked about this
already, honey, right?

757
00:43:45,898 --> 00:43:47,942
I’m going to Singapore
this weekend.

758
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,528
I got hired by Zenaida Models.

759
00:43:52,572 --> 00:43:55,575
I’m going to Singapore
to pursue modeling.

760
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,288
Did I hear that right,

761
00:44:00,997 --> 00:44:01,997
Maui?

762
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,851
Why?

763
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,127
Because it’s what I want.

764
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,797
I’ve been working hard
for this in the past year.

765
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:11,774
No…

766
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:12,967
No! Of course not.

767
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:14,427
You are not going to Singapore.

768
00:44:14,427 --> 00:44:15,970
You are going to call the agency

769
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,680
and you're gonna tell them
that you’re not signing.

770
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:20,016
I am not going
to allow it. No way.

771
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,685
Mom, this is what I want to do.

772
00:44:22,685 --> 00:44:24,646
You can’t keep
controlling my life,

773
00:44:24,646 --> 00:44:27,106
I’ve already graduated.
I can decide for myself.

774
00:44:27,106 --> 00:44:28,900
And I cannot be your mother?

775
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,401
Who is just worried
for you, Maureen?

776
00:44:31,694 --> 00:44:34,656
Do you even know the kind
of industry you’re entering?

777
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:37,931
It’s a ruthless world
out there, Maui.

778
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:41,454
They will chew you up
and they will spit you out!

779
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:45,266
Then what do you want me to do?

780
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:48,126
Should I just follow
everything you say, then?

781
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:51,047
How will I ever grow
and be my own person

782
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:53,383
if I just follow you
my whole life?

783
00:44:54,676 --> 00:44:56,552
My life is my own, too, Mom.

784
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,221
Let me live it.

785
00:44:58,513 --> 00:45:01,057
Maureen, can you please
just be useful

786
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:03,559
to us just this once?

787
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:06,179
Be useful?

788
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:10,233
Was I only born just
to be useful to you?

789
00:45:14,737 --> 00:45:15,905
You wanna be a model?

790
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,075
Fine.

791
00:45:19,826 --> 00:45:20,914
You can be a model.

792
00:45:21,498 --> 00:45:22,624
That’s what you want?

793
00:45:23,705 --> 00:45:25,456
But make sure, Maureen,

794
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:30,294
you become a famous,
a very famous model.

795
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,672
So we can use that

796
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:34,659
for your dad’s campaign.

797
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:36,909
Right.

798
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:38,185
That’s right, sweetheart.

799
00:45:38,756 --> 00:45:41,050
You can pursue your dream
and still help

800
00:45:41,557 --> 00:45:43,601
with your dad’s campaign
at the same time.

801
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,452
You just have to be
very famous, Maureen.

802
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,645
Very famous.

803
00:45:48,813 --> 00:45:50,606
You’re unbelievable.

804
00:45:51,602 --> 00:45:52,617
Mau—

805
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,804
Hey.

806
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:22,805
Don’t listen to her.

807
00:46:23,306 --> 00:46:25,808
You are worth more
than what she said.

808
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:28,878
So, just focus on doing
things for yourself, okay?

809
00:46:31,564 --> 00:46:33,316
Can you just come live with me?

810
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,468
I can’t stand thinking about you
being stuck in this house,

811
00:46:37,904 --> 00:46:39,530
dealing with them all alone.

812
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:45,967
I can still handle it.

813
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:48,568
Besides,

814
00:46:48,903 --> 00:46:50,780
I’ve been taking your advice.

815
00:46:51,276 --> 00:46:53,612
I’m doing regular
therapy sessions.

816
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:56,437
So, I’ll be fine.
Don’t worry about me.

817
00:46:58,812 --> 00:47:00,580
Here. Keep it.

818
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,960
You’ll be okay, right?

819
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,445
Of course.

820
00:47:08,861 --> 00:47:10,362
I need to be strong.

821
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,748
I have to set
an example for you,

822
00:47:13,773 --> 00:47:16,776
and I know you look up to me,
and I can’t let you down.

823
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,006
You’re already
a great role model.

824
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:24,325
You’re the perfect
sister for me.

825
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,765
So, go after your dreams
in Singapore, okay?

826
00:47:30,954 --> 00:47:32,831
I’ll always be cheering for you.

827
00:47:57,733 --> 00:47:58,748
Hey,

828
00:47:59,694 --> 00:48:00,987
I’m so proud of you.

829
00:48:01,822 --> 00:48:03,407
I know that wasn’t easy.

830
00:48:04,323 --> 00:48:05,616
It’s because of you.

831
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,453
You made me realize
that I have a voice.

832
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:12,290
I was always the obedient child

833
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,875
with no opinions for herself.

834
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:16,936
So, I never thought I had
the courage to do that.

835
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:19,897
You’ve always
had it in you, Maui.

836
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:23,551
I still have a lot to prove,

837
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,637
to them, to myself,
that I can stand on my own.

838
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,266
So, I need to make it
in modeling.

839
00:48:30,892 --> 00:48:33,311
I never wanna ask them
for money, ever again.

840
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:35,396
And I believe in you, Maui.

841
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:39,692
And I’ll be here cheering you on
every step of the way.

842
00:48:41,027 --> 00:48:42,028
But it’s hard.

843
00:48:42,904 --> 00:48:44,280
I don’t want you to leave.

844
00:48:45,907 --> 00:48:47,950
Cy, it’s just four days.

845
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:48,986
I know,

846
00:48:49,503 --> 00:48:51,505
but no matter how close it is,

847
00:48:52,204 --> 00:48:54,457
even if it’s just four days,

848
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:57,084
I’m still gonna miss you.

849
00:48:58,044 --> 00:48:59,503
So much.

850
00:49:01,255 --> 00:49:02,393
But it has to be done.

851
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:06,677
We’ll reach our
dreams together, right?

852
00:49:08,596 --> 00:49:12,350
Let’s reach our dreams together,
for each other.

853
00:49:12,642 --> 00:49:13,657
Yeah.

854
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:40,231
Take care, okay?

855
00:49:41,466 --> 00:49:42,718
- Okay?
- Okay.

856
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:47,802
Hey, is everything okay?

857
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:49,641
Yeah.

858
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:52,723
I’m just feeling scared.

859
00:49:53,516 --> 00:49:54,642
What if I get lost?

860
00:49:54,642 --> 00:49:56,782
What if I miss my meetings?

861
00:49:56,852 --> 00:49:58,354
What if they don’t like me?

862
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,107
What if they change their minds?

863
00:50:01,357 --> 00:50:03,651
Hey, listen to me. Okay?

864
00:50:03,651 --> 00:50:06,237
First of all, stop overthinking.

865
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:07,738
They’re going to love you,

866
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:09,774
and you're going to be amazing.

867
00:50:10,702 --> 00:50:11,870
You’ve got this!

868
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:16,462
Yeah, I got this.
I was born for this.

869
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,308
That’s the spirit.

870
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:21,490
Thanks for seeing me off.

871
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:24,969
Why are you sad?

872
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:28,876
Because I’m gonna miss you.

873
00:50:29,385 --> 00:50:31,579
Maui, it’s just four days.

874
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:35,141
But it’s the longest
four days of my life.

875
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:38,094
Come here.

876
00:50:46,193 --> 00:50:48,821
Go now, you’re gonna
miss your flight.

877
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:50,448
Take care.

878
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:52,320
Okay.

879
00:50:53,701 --> 00:50:55,508
- Be careful there.
- Bye. Yeah.

880
00:50:55,578 --> 00:50:56,579
Okay.

881
00:51:12,678 --> 00:51:13,704
Hello.

882
00:51:18,466 --> 00:51:19,885
- Here you go, Miss.
- Thank you.

883
00:51:34,909 --> 00:51:35,915
Cy?

884
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,460
What are you doing here?

885
00:51:39,485 --> 00:51:41,415
You really think I’d let you go
to Singapore alone?

886
00:51:41,415 --> 00:51:42,708
Of course I'll come with you.

887
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:44,435
But how?

888
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,295
Aren’t you busy
with your clerkship?

889
00:51:46,796 --> 00:51:48,923
I have five days
before clerkship starts.

890
00:51:49,131 --> 00:51:52,093
And I wanna spend
every single day with you.

891
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,638
You really love me
that much, huh?

892
00:51:55,638 --> 00:51:57,712
Is it that obvious?

893
00:51:58,673 --> 00:52:00,935
Wait, how about your
luggage and stuff,

894
00:52:00,935 --> 00:52:01,769
didn't you bring anything?

895
00:52:01,769 --> 00:52:02,978
Don't worry about that.

896
00:52:02,978 --> 00:52:04,146
Let's just go shopping.

897
00:52:06,273 --> 00:52:08,234
Thank you for
coming with me, Cy.

898
00:52:08,901 --> 00:52:10,798
You know how much
this means to me.

899
00:52:11,779 --> 00:52:14,281
First out of the country
trip together,

900
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:16,408
we're gonna have so much fun!

901
00:52:16,408 --> 00:52:18,160
Yes! Singapore, baby!

902
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:58,117
Avi’s so pretty!

903
00:52:58,117 --> 00:53:00,035
- Of course.
- Baby Avi.

904
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,998
But did you guys know
Avi isn’t the only blessing

905
00:53:03,998 --> 00:53:05,624
in the group right now?

906
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:07,251
You’re pregnant?

907
00:53:08,502 --> 00:53:09,628
Yes, Sam?

908
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:11,005
Huh?

909
00:53:11,005 --> 00:53:12,460
- You’re pregnant?
- You’re pregnant, Sam?

910
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,866
No. I got signed to a modeling
agency in Singapore.

911
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,553
Wow!

912
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:20,598
- Wait, SG? Like, Singapore?
- Yes!

913
00:53:21,473 --> 00:53:22,892
Congratulations!

914
00:53:22,892 --> 00:53:25,139
Wow, international, huh?

915
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:27,688
Thank you guys,
I’ll be flying there soon.

916
00:53:29,023 --> 00:53:31,483
So, are you gonna be
based there now?

917
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:33,330
I’m not sure yet,

918
00:53:33,355 --> 00:53:35,899
but I’ll probably spend
a lot of time there.

919
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,199
But have you and
Clyden talked about this?

920
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:39,992
I mean, being in
a long distance relationship?

921
00:53:39,992 --> 00:53:44,205
Yeah, especially with how busy
Clyden is with med school.

922
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:45,873
Yeah, that’s true. But well,

923
00:53:45,873 --> 00:53:47,833
it’s still the same
time zone, right?

924
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:51,170
But then again, Clyden’s
usually awake at dawn.

925
00:53:51,718 --> 00:53:53,839
I just realized,
it’s really hard dating

926
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,262
med and law students.

927
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:58,385
We haven’t talked about
the details yet,

928
00:53:58,385 --> 00:53:59,929
but we’ll figure it out.

929
00:54:00,658 --> 00:54:02,868
You know, we have
a strong foundation,

930
00:54:03,294 --> 00:54:04,753
and we can work this out.

931
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:06,477
- We can make it work.
- Strong—

932
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:08,103
Wow!

933
00:54:08,103 --> 00:54:09,605
- Confident!
- Seriously though—

934
00:54:09,605 --> 00:54:12,983
Well, you guys already
managed dating

935
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,277
with different
schedules before, so—

936
00:54:15,277 --> 00:54:17,404
You’ve got this!
You both got this.

937
00:54:24,203 --> 00:54:25,120
Be careful there.

938
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,080
Bye. Yeah.

939
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,102
Okay.

940
00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:48,244
I think this is the
start of our busy era.

941
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:51,196
We promise to have our regular
date every Sunday, right?

942
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:56,735
I know you’re a Ramirez.

943
00:54:56,735 --> 00:54:58,445
But lives are on the line here.

944
00:54:59,655 --> 00:55:00,948
It’s our date night.

945
00:55:00,948 --> 00:55:02,116
Do you still want to go?

946
00:55:02,116 --> 00:55:04,451
Should we skip?
'Cause I’m sleepy.

947
00:55:06,162 --> 00:55:07,188
How are you?

948
00:55:08,247 --> 00:55:10,416
The sched’s been hectic, but…

949
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:13,018
Isn’t Clyden gonna look for you?

950
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,254
Don’t you guys
have a celebration today?

951
00:55:17,487 --> 00:55:19,063
What more do
you want from me?

952
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:22,945
I agreed to let you model,
didn’t I?

953
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:25,889
Is it true?
The accusations against you?

954
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,474
You benefited
from my money, too!

955
00:55:27,474 --> 00:55:28,809
You disgust me!

956
00:55:28,809 --> 00:55:29,868
Stop it!

957
00:55:30,602 --> 00:55:32,730
You don’t have it rough
with your parents!

958
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,751
Me?
