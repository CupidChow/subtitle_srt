1
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,267
I haven’t fallen in love yet.

2
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,483
You cooked for me?

3
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,652
Sam seems to be
in a good mood today.

4
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,363
What is this?

5
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,991
It’s just food.

6
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,452
Hey, you’re smiling
from ear to ear.

7
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,538
Cy said he thinks that

8
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,041
he’s already
fallen in love with me.

9
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,958
That’s perfect!

10
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,752
You’re falling in love
with each other.

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,003
What do you want?

12
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,963
I want to showcase clothes.

13
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,258
Redefine beauty and...

14
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,302
tell stories through fashion
on a global stage.

15
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,471
I want to be
an international model.

16
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,681
Modeling?

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,102
Politics is more impactful.

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,422
You’re really
a great older sister.

19
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,359
Thank you.

20
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,947
You’re really
a beautiful person, Maui.

21
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,545
I love you.

22
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,223
You mean that?

23
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,276
I love you, too.

24
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,555
Let’s go home?

25
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,224
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,942
Oh my.

27
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,735
Didn’t we agree to sleep
in the same room

28
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,071
once we’re official?

29
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,991
Maui, once we’re
officially together,

30
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,577
are we going to sleep
in the master’s bedroom?

31
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,829
Yeah, if you want.

32
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,372
I’d want to.

33
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,793
So, are we sleeping
together tonight?

34
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,878
Wait.

35
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,547
We said I love you
to each other.

36
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,591
Does this mean we're official?

37
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,926
But what if those 3 words

38
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,007
don’t mean the same thing for
him as they mean to me?

39
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,850
I better ask him
to define the relationship.

40
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,978
Hey! Are we...

41
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,688
Are we official now?

42
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,648
Are we like
a boyfriend-girlfriend thing?

43
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,486
Cy, hi! Are we a couple now?

44
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,280
Hey!

45
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:21,451
Hey, are we like, a boyfriend-
girlfriend thing now?

46
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,910
Shit.

47
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,414
Cy, I want to ask you if
we’re officially a couple now?

48
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,251
Are we like a boyfriend-
girlfriend thing already?

49
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,295
Shit. This is so embarrassing.

50
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,296
Okay.

51
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:36,965
Hey…

52
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,343
- Hey.
- Hey!

53
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,846
Can I...

54
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,474
Wait, before you say anything,

55
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,976
I know where this is going.

56
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,396
I know you want to ask me if
we’re officially a couple,

57
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,732
and I’m wondering
the same thing.

58
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,651
We already said
I love you to each other,

59
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,985
and I don’t take it lightly.

60
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:57,986
So,

61
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:58,988
I think

62
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,614
we’re officially together.

63
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,866
That means we can sleep
in the master’s bedroom

64
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,034
together tonight.

65
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,515
That's what we’ve
talked about, right?

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,330
I want to stick to our agreement
unless you don’t want to...

67
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,458
Sam, can I borrow
my phone charger?

68
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,254
Yeah.

69
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,423
It’s in my bag.

70
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,007
I’ll get it.

71
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,175
Hey.

72
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,723
I agree with everything
that you said.

73
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,643
Yes, we’re officially together

74
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,519
and yes...

75
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,566
I will sleep in the master’s
bedroom with you.

76
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,737
Okay?

77
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,863
Okay.

78
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,409
Good, I’ll see you there.

79
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,785
I’ll see you downstairs.

80
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,206
Shit.

81
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,509
It’s really happening!

82
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,154
Seriously?

83
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,031
We’re in the same bed
for the first time ever,

84
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,244
and he’s just going
to study beside me?

85
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,041
You're still going
to study at this hour?

86
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,334
Hm?

87
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,545
You're still going
to study at this hour?

88
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,131
Yes, I have an exam on Monday.

89
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,674
I see.

90
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,468
What time will you finish?

91
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,387
In a while.

92
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,186
Calm down, Sam.

93
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,314
Nothing spicy has
to happen tonight.

94
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,607
There’s still tomorrow.

95
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,860
But it’s a shame,

96
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,446
tonight is our first night
together officially.

97
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,016
You smell nice.

98
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,947
You even have a lip tint on.

99
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,076
This is my natural lip color.

100
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,911
Really?

101
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,873
Let me check.

102
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,448
I need to study.

103
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,832
Wait.

104
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,461
Is this your first time?

105
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,925
Don’t tell me you don't know
what to do with boobs?

106
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,302
Sam, I’m studying.

107
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,804
Just go to sleep.

108
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,723
He’s so adorable.

109
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,518
Okay.

110
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,813
After you’re done studying,

111
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,773
at least cuddle with me.

112
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,106
Good morning, Maui.

113
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,108
Good morning.

114
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,318
Do you need help?

115
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,405
Yeah, sure. I'm just
drying Summer off.

116
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,865
Hello!

117
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,492
- Here.
- Are you refreshed, huh?

118
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,162
Let’s go here.

119
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,414
- Here, here.
- Come here.

120
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,421
You’re so cute!

121
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,342
Here, too.

122
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
Sorry.

123
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,437
But why...

124
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,235
Maui!

125
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,346
I forgot.

126
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,226
This guy has been keeping his
hot body to himself this whole time!

127
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,896
But well, technically,
he’s mine now.

128
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,189
So...

129
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,401
Thank you, Lord,
for the blessing, I guess?

130
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,151
What?

131
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,861
You like what you see?

132
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,531
No, I don’t!

133
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,448
You don’t have to lie.

134
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,089
It’s okay to admit
you’re attracted to me.

135
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,371
So arrogant!

136
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,708
Wait.

137
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,209
I’ll just check my phone.

138
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,210
Okay.

139
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,754
You sprayed too much.

140
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,256
Hi, Sam.

141
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,675
Just wondering
when is your next visit?

142
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,846
I’m just asking though,
no pressure.

143
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,599
Hey, why are you smiling?

144
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,893
Naomi messaged me.

145
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,187
You should pay her a visit.

146
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,690
I’m pretty sure she misses you.

147
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,108
You think so?

148
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,108
Yeah.

149
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,152
I’ll cook food for you guys.

150
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,030
So you'll have something to
bring when you visit her.

151
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,198
Thank you, Cy.

152
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,408
You’re welcome.

153
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,327
And fine.

154
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,874
I’ll admit that
I’m attracted to you.

155
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,013
Go ahead, eat.

156
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,015
Have some more.

157
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,759
Let’s add this to your plate.

158
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,728
You know what,
Cy prepared this for you.

159
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,859
Sam, it’s my first time having
food made especially for me.

160
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,569
Thank you, Sam.

161
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,323
And to that scary guy, too.
I can’t believe he cooks.

162
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,034
Scary guy?

163
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,369
You think Cy’s scary?

164
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,331
I can’t blame you, though.

165
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,458
He looks so grumpy,
that’s why I thought

166
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,836
he was mean and
intimidating at first.

167
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,213
Grumpy?

168
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,964
- Yeah. He looks like—
- How grumpy?

169
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,424
He looks like that.

170
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,716
All the time?

171
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,468
How?

172
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,430
Scrunched up face, huh?

173
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,847
Yeah.

174
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,518
But I know he’s kind.

175
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,813
He even taught me how to use the
light settings of the camera.

176
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,357
He even encouraged me
to continue photography.

177
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,859
He likes my photos.

178
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,236
He did?

179
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,407
Yeah, that time he came up to
my room to call me for dinner.

180
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:51,120
He caught me using
your camera. So yeah,

181
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,165
he ended up teaching me
how to use it properly.

182
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,837
I didn’t know he actually
talked to Naomi.

183
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,297
But that’s such
a Clyden thing to do.

184
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,259
Sam, I’m so happy
he’s your fiancé.

185
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,554
You guys look so good together.

186
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,979
And Sam, thank you for the gift.

187
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,856
You're welcome.

188
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,358
Have you tried using it?
How is it?

189
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,030
I’m still learning
how to use it.

190
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,616
Do you have time?

191
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,578
Can I take photos of you?

192
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,122
Yeah. Sure.

193
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,582
Of course!

194
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,376
You don’t even have to ask me.

195
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,087
Don’t worry, I always
have time for you.

196
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,088
But...

197
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,592
can you do my makeup?

198
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,343
I’m not that good
at doing my makeup.

199
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,554
Not as good as you.

200
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,890
I only know the basics.

201
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,517
Really? But...

202
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,396
your natural makeup
looks good, though.

203
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,813
You think so?

204
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,232
I know so!

205
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,066
Thank you.

206
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,359
But, sure. Let’s do
our makeup, Sam.

207
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,819
Yes.

208
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,570
- After this.
- Okay.

209
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,362
Eat some more.

210
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:05,988
Okay, thanks.

211
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,148
If you want dessert, tell me?

212
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,855
We can ask someone to buy some.

213
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,160
How is it? Is it good?

214
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:13,913
Is it okay?

215
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,040
Yeah, it’s good. It’s tender.

216
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,457
I’ll tell him.

217
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,335
Sam, close them.

218
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,836
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

219
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,966
Make sure it’s aligned, okay?

220
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,970
Hold on, okay?
Trust the process.

221
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,605
Wow!

222
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,066
You’re amazing.

223
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,733
Where did you learn
how to do makeup?

224
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,653
Makeup tutorial videos.

225
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,655
And sometimes

226
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,324
I use your makeup.

227
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,662
Sam, I’m sorry. I’ve been
using it without telling you.

228
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,664
Please, it’s okay.

229
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,167
I didn’t even notice since
I don’t really use it anyway.

230
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,295
You can keep them.

231
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,054
You know what, Sam?
You could totally be a model.

232
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,514
Really? You think so?

233
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,265
Yes.

234
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,892
And I’ll study photography

235
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,937
so I can be the one
to shoot your portfolio.

236
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,567
I’ll take your word for it.

237
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,528
- Yes.
- Deal?

238
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,278
- Yes.
- Promise?

239
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,320
Okay, promise.

240
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,031
- I promise.
- Okay.

241
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,573
Now, continue.

242
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,574
Okay, wait.

243
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,837
Next time, Sam,
let’s try baking.

244
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,880
I’m craving brownies!

245
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,173
Sure! The next time I come here,

246
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,592
I’ll bring baking ingredients.

247
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,552
Okay, I'll look forward to it.

248
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,514
Wait. You also want to go
to a photography workshop?

249
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,640
I can get you a slot.

250
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,641
Really?

251
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,854
I’ll see what I can do.

252
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,481
Thanks, Sam.

253
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,898
Idiot!

254
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,776
What do you mean
the money’s missing?

255
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,195
How could it just go missing?

256
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,780
If you don’t have
the money by tomorrow,

257
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,283
you’re the one paying for it.

258
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,702
Stupid.

259
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,995
I’ll go to my room, Sam.

260
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,414
Yeah. See you soon, Naomi.

261
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,294
Sam?

262
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,630
You’re still here?

263
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,842
I’m on my way out, Mom.

264
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,469
Who were you talking to?

265
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,597
No one, just some incompetent
employee of mine.

266
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,266
Okay.

267
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,976
I’ll go ahead.

268
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,477
Okay.

269
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,854
Take care, dear.

270
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,072
I’m home!

271
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,447
Hey!

272
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,449
Hi, Sam!

273
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,283
Ridge!

274
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,285
We’ve met last time, hi!

275
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,745
Yes, sir.

276
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,414
Sorry, he just barged in here.

277
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,249
Wow!

278
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,542
Are you saying I’m being
a bother here or something?

279
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,252
Big time.

280
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,253
Jerk.

281
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,422
Hey, your makeup looks great.

282
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,132
Really?

283
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,759
- Yeah.
- Naomi did this.

284
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,427
We did a photoshoot
earlier to test her camera,

285
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,721
the one I gave her.

286
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,556
You didn’t tell me

287
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,683
that you gave her
some camera lessons.

288
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,685
Thank you.

289
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,270
And about the food,

290
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,815
she said you didn’t seem like
someone who could cook,

291
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,817
but she liked it.

292
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,154
Sorry, wait a sec.

293
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,288
I swallowed the whole chip.

294
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,582
I’m sorry.
It tasted like loneliness.

295
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,210
Too bad you didn’t choke on it.

296
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,419
How about I strangle you.

297
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,921
Are you still not done?

298
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,215
Why this asshole...

299
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,217
I’m sorry, Lord.

300
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,510
It’s obvious you’re trying
to get rid of me already.

301
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,428
Well, good thing you’re
finally picking up on it.

302
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,556
Jerk.

303
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,019
I missed you.

304
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,315
Well, well, well!

305
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,025
You’re really such a flirt.

306
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,944
You know, you were
exactly like this

307
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,655
back when we
were at the condo of...

308
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,283
Of?

309
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,700
This hand’s really nice, huh?
Oh wait, it’s my hand.

310
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,747
Such a pretty hand.

311
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,333
You said you never dated anyone.

312
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,002
Yes, I never did.

313
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:30,919
Huh?

314
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,919
No one.

315
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,463
But you were flirting
with someone?

316
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,466
Is she one of the girls
you kissed back in college?

317
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,262
Yes.

318
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,223
Yes? That’s it?

319
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,226
He’s not even going
to elaborate or explain?

320
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,273
What? Hey.

321
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,941
All right. Cool.

322
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,483
I’m heading downstairs, okay?

323
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,152
You guys continue
what you’re doing.

324
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,778
Ridge, I’ll see you later.

325
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,779
Sam!

326
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,450
I’ll just treat you to
some tapsilog later, okay?

327
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,452
I’m sorry.

328
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,540
You’re totally going
to hell, I’m telling you.

329
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,709
Bro, seriously?
You really brought that up?

330
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,710
I said I’m sorry.

331
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,088
Why do I feel mad about it?

332
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,801
It’s in the past, Sam!
Just let it go.

333
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,928
I know he kissed
a total of three girls,

334
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,054
but

335
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,140
how often did he kiss them?

336
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,228
Is he a good kisser because
he’s had so much practice?

337
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,569
You’re not sleeping here?

338
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,662
Alessandra,

339
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,163
Leanne,

340
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,540
Eva.

341
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,754
Those were the girls
I kissed back in college.

342
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,092
It was nothing serious.
I’m sorry.

343
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,010
Maui, please talk to me.

344
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,222
Eva?

345
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,224
You kissed your friend?

346
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,185
I told you it was only a dare.

347
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,354
It was my freshman year,
I was stupid.

348
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,940
That was my dumbest year.

349
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,692
And the girls you flirted with?

350
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,945
Leanne, freshman year.

351
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,197
Alessandra, sophomore year.

352
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,241
But all of those were just dares.

353
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,535
You seriously
get dared that often?

354
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,288
I told you I don't date,

355
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,581
nor do I show
any interest in dating.

356
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,459
And now? What changed?

357
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,384
You happened.

358
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,311
You’re the only one
I want to marry.

359
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,436
Okay.

360
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,772
We better stop...

361
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,148
- for now - But, wait.

362
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,691
But you were hard.

363
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,319
So, you were looking at it?

364
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:43,986
Anyways,

365
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,322
I have to study.

366
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:46,823
You have to sleep,

367
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,326
and I’ll prepare breakfast first
thing in the morning, okay?

368
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,910
Goodnight.

369
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,828
But...

370
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,082
Goodnight.

371
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,209
If you end up with blue balls,
that’s on you!

372
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,839
I know I need to be patient,
but this is killing me!

373
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,139
Sorry, I woke up late.

374
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,892
I even said
I’d cook you breakfast.

375
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,476
I’ll make it up to you.

376
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,728
Hey, it’s okay.

377
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,772
You’re always
the one cooking anyway.

378
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,524
But

379
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,234
if you really want,

380
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,487
I know a way for you
to make it up to me.

381
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,242
Right now?

382
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,535
Yes.

383
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,706
All I need is your hand.

384
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,379
Just my hand?

385
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,759
I’m talking about this!

386
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,264
You’re not following me
back on my socials.

387
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,349
I even followed you.

388
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,311
Wait...

389
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,897
What were you thinking?

390
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,274
Nothing.

391
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,777
What are you assuming?

392
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,950
Happy?

393
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,785
Good.

394
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,204
I sent my follow request
a long time ago,

395
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,645
and you just
wouldn’t follow me back.

396
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,624
Actually, I followed you
a while ago,

397
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,294
but then I unfollowed you
right after.

398
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,838
Huh? Why?

399
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,717
I got annoyed with
your story, you were with...

400
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,051
that Sevi guy.

401
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,888
You’re so petty!

402
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,851
Wife?

403
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,604
We’re not married yet.

404
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,272
We will be.

405
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,484
So we’re not breaking
the engagement?

406
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,201
We’re not breaking
the engagement.

407
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,119
Whatever happens,

408
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,623
I promise you that.

409
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,961
Okay.

410
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,047
Stop.

411
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,882
Let’s eat breakfast now.

412
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,342
Okay. I’ll bring these
to the table.

413
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,343
Okay.

414
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,518
Hey, Sam! What’s your plan
for your birthday?

415
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,477
Same club as last time?

416
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,896
Yeah, I plan to host it
in a club in BGC.

417
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,564
You guys save the date, okay?

418
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,109
When did we ever miss out
on your parties, Sam?

419
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,445
Yanna can’t go, though.

420
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,364
I’ll cover for Yanna.

421
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,616
I’ll try, Sam, okay?

422
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,076
We’re in season right now.

423
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,161
We still have training.

424
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,704
It’s okay, Sevi.

425
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,082
Don’t invite him, please.

426
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,792
Don’t please.

427
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,211
Luna, if Kalix finds out
you’re invited,

428
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,421
for sure, he won’t go.

429
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,215
That’s good then.

430
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,716
You’re so bitter.

431
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:52,967
Wow.

432
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,719
Just because you…

433
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,555
You’re so annoying.

434
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,847
How about Arkin?

435
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,224
Via, where’s Arkin?

436
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,225
Huh?

437
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,644
I don’t know.

438
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,980
He probably has a shoot?

439
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,690
Ask Sevi.

440
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,315
How would I know?

441
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,360
Last time I saw him,
he was at the gym.

442
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,306
That’s why you shouldn’t steal
other people’s best friends.

443
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,406
You can’t steal something if

444
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,908
someone’s paying
attention to it.

445
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,577
Right, Luna?

446
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,121
Wow, Sevi.

447
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,831
You’re such an asshole.

448
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,833
That’s why no one’s
flirting with you.

449
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,627
Because you’ve got
such a bad attitude, Sevi!

450
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,379
Are you sure
no one’s flirting with me?

451
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,381
Yuck. Gross.

452
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,551
Can we kick him out
or something?

453
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,095
How about you, Sam?

454
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:40,139
Introducing us to someone
special on your birthday?

455
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,434
Huh? I'm not aware.

456
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,102
Is there someone?

457
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,520
She’s not answering!

458
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,898
Oh, my god! Spill the tea, sis.

459
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,192
Spill the tea.

460
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,485
Oh my gosh, she’s blushing!

461
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,488
I’m home!

462
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,115
Cy?

463
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,043
Are you on your way home?

464
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,463
I bought dinner for us!

465
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,010
Maui, sorry.
Go ahead and eat first.

466
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,929
We’re still studying at a cafe.

467
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,017
Okay. Don’t forget to eat, okay?

468
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,645
Good luck with your studies.

469
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,792
I wonder if he’s on his
way home. Has he eaten?

470
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,885
Hey, sorry I think we
might be here until morning.

471
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,056
Don’t wait for me, okay?
Good night. I love you.

472
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,270
You take care, okay?

473
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,106
Make sure to eat a proper meal,

474
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,943
not just coffee. I love you.

475
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:26,955
Good morning.

476
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,333
Morning. Sit down, let’s eat.

477
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,544
This looks so good.

478
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,713
Thank you.

479
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,881
What time did you get home?

480
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,093
Around seven?

481
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,012
And you even cooked
breakfast for me?

482
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,181
Yes, because

483
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,684
it’s been so long since
I’ve made food for you.

484
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,144
Even your lunch.

485
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,854
I’m sorry.

486
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,440
Hey, I told you it’s okay, Cy.

487
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,317
I know it’s not easy
on your part since

488
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,528
you're already
preparing for clerkship.

489
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,405
That’s why I’m here
to support you.

490
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,905
You know what,

491
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,323
I’ll take care of the cooking.

492
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,160
I can cook as good
as you, you know?

493
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,121
Maybe pasta, sure.

494
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,940
But when it comes
to other meals...

495
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,751
my cooking is still better.

496
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,171
Really? You just won’t
back down, huh?

497
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,883
Hey…

498
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,139
I missed you.

499
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,475
Are you free today?

500
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,477
Do you want to go
grocery shopping?

501
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,855
And then let’s eat out after.

502
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,399
I would love to,

503
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,276
but you haven’t slept yet.

504
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,861
No, it’s okay. Just give me

505
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,739
1 to 2 hours to sleep,

506
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,699
and then we can go.

507
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,452
Okay then, it’s a date.

508
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,786
Okay.

509
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,419
You bought so many ingredients.

510
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,254
What are you and Naomi baking?

511
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,089
We’re making brownies.

512
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,673
Are you baking too?

513
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,801
Why’d you buy so
many baking ingredients?

514
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,386
No, I’m making a different dish.

515
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,598
But I’ll cook it
for you next time.

516
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,855
That’s a lot of messages.

517
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,232
Is it for your org?

518
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,274
No,

519
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,402
I was sending invites
for my party,

520
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:25,198
so the guests were RSVPing.

521
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,741
Wait. Do you want to come?

522
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,077
It’s next week, Saturday.

523
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,538
Saturday?

524
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,707
I wonder if he knows
that it’s my birthday.

525
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,960
Should I mention it?

526
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,588
I can’t.

527
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,883
I’m going to
the hospital with Ridge,

528
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,719
and then we’ll study afterward.

529
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,556
We have two major
exams on Monday.

530
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,307
I’m sorry.

531
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:56,145
Never mind. He might
feel guilty about it.

532
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,025
It’s okay! Your exams
are more important.

533
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,449
Sam, I like this apron.

534
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,702
We should take a picture!

535
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,412
I’m glad you liked it.

536
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,329
- Wait…
- I ordered these online.

537
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,206
They almost didn’t
make it in time, though.

538
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,125
- Okay.
- Okay.

539
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,125
Let’s go.

540
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,881
Okay, that’s so cute.

541
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,759
How’s school lately, Naomi?

542
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,345
Same, same.

543
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,933
My classes are relatively easy
since I’m still a freshman.

544
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,061
I see. That’s good.

545
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,440
Did you really
wanna take Pol Sci?

546
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,777
I thought I wanted it, but...

547
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,988
I guess I just wanted
to impress Dad and

548
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,782
get validation from him.

549
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,078
I’m sorry.

550
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,708
I hope you learn to enjoy
your classes eventually.

551
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,044
I hope so, too.

552
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,297
Remember, I’m proud
of you as it is,

553
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:09,052
and you don’t have to
do anything more, okay?

554
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,346
Thank you, Sam.

555
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,222
As long as we’re okay,

556
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,099
all is fine.

557
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,314
I’m done with
the wet ingredients.

558
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,274
Want to mix it?

559
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,442
- Here.
- Okay.

560
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,110
Thanks.

561
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,074
This is pretty hard, Sam.

562
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,618
Let me help you.

563
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,087
Just don’t overmix it,

564
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,006
or else we’ll end up
with stone-hard brownies.

565
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,174
Yeah, just mix it.

566
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,175
Okay.

567
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,181
Sam, it’s your birthday
tomorrow, right?

568
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,393
Yes, you remembered.

569
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,395
Of course!

570
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,774
You know what,
I have a party at BGC.

571
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,943
Do you want to come?

572
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,445
I want to introduce you
to my friends.

573
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,949
I-

574
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,493
I don’t think I’m ready
to go out and party

575
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,663
after what happened
to my own birthday.

576
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,915
But I appreciate you for wanting

577
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,085
to introduce me to your friends.

578
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,087
Hey, it’s okay.

579
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,133
We’ll just have a separate
birthday celebration.

580
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,009
You, me, and Cy,

581
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,928
since he won’t be
able to attend either.

582
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,181
He won’t? Why?

583
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,269
Med school stuff. But it’s okay.

584
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,689
He doesn’t know
that it’s my birthday.

585
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,318
Of course, he knows!
He’s your fiance!

586
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,655
Maybe he’s just saying
that to surprise you.

587
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,698
Who knows, maybe he’s planning

588
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,617
a birthday surprise
for you tonight.

589
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,911
She’s right.

590
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,705
Cy might actually
surprise me later!

591
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,207
- Let me handle that.
- Okay.

592
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,292
Sam?

593
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,757
Happy Birthday!

594
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,678
For me?

595
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,137
Yeah,

596
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,848
of course!

597
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:20,932
I...

598
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,770
I compiled all our photos.

599
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,228
Really?

600
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,153
Oh my god, Naomi!

601
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,198
This is beautiful. I love it.

602
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,324
I’ll treasure this.

603
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,035
Thank you so much!

604
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,793
You know what, I’m so happy
that we’re okay now.

605
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,087
Whatever happens,

606
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,381
your big sister’s here
for you, okay?

607
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,927
I know, Sam. I know.

608
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,594
Thank you.

609
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,890
- Okay.
- Okay.

610
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,016
I’ll mix this now.

611
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,771
Okay. Continue that.
I’ll just put this...

612
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,610
Who knows, maybe he’s planning

613
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,530
a birthday surprise
for you tonight.

614
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:21,911
Oh my god. Wait.
What if this is the surprise?

615
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,759
Hey, are you still out?

616
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,137
What time are you coming home?

617
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,310
Yup. Coffee shop.

618
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,148
Might be home past midnight.
I’m still studying.

619
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:55,027
Past midnight. So he won’t be
here to welcome my birthday?

620
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,949
But what if he’s planning to
surprise me exactly at midnight?

621
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,860
I fell asleep! What time is it?

622
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,168
Hey, Maui. I might
stay over at Ridge’s place.

623
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:39,674
We’re not done yet. I’m sorry.
Good night. I love you.

624
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,471
No birthday surprise.
No birthday greeting.

625
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,266
Does he really not know
it’s my birthday?

626
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,275
Hello.

627
00:37:57,276 --> 00:38:01,778
Happy birthday!

628
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,281
Happy Birthday to you,
happy birthday to you...

629
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,075
happy birthday,
happy birthday...

630
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:11,163
happy birthday, you crazy bitch!

631
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,665
Thanks.

632
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,834
How cold.

633
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,919
Why do you look unhappy?

634
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,462
It’s because of Clyden.

635
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,756
I think he doesn’t know
it’s my birthday today.

636
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,759
What’s the problem with that?
Then just tell him.

637
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,218
But shouldn’t he already know?

638
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,345
I mean, we’re a couple.

639
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,431
Even I know
when his birthday is.

640
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,808
You’re just annoyed

641
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,312
‘cause he hasn’t
gotten down on you yet.

642
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,771
Well, you have a point.

643
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,693
All right, just enjoy
your day, okay?

644
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,739
Maybe Clyden actually has
something planned for you.

645
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,657
If not, then go ahead
and get mad at him.

646
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,243
It’s totally valid
to feel a little upset.

647
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,662
Just tell him

648
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,039
he can make it up
to you with his body.

649
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,333
- Just like that.
- Yanna!

650
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,460
Okay, happy birthday. Bye!

651
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,795
- Love you.
- Bye!

652
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,596
Hi babies! Want to eat?

653
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,597
Okay.

654
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,519
Here you go.

655
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,232
Wow.

656
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,360
Go Summer, eat.

657
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,945
I’ll take a photo.

658
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,657
Smile! Cute!

659
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,041
Look. I already fed our babies!

660
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,461
Cute.

661
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,671
Thanks, Maui.

662
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,716
That’s it?

663
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,594
Just a thank you?

664
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,554
No happy birthday?

665
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,438
Summer, why are you not eating?

666
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,941
Eat already. Here.

667
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,361
Do I look okay?

668
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,989
Okay? Sam, you look gorgeous!

669
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,157
Really?

670
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,994
How’s my makeup?

671
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,081
I did the eyeshadow
technique you taught me.

672
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,751
It’s beautiful.
Enjoy the night, Sam.

673
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,920
Happy birthday!

674
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,214
Thank you, Naomi.

675
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,215
Bye!

676
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,641
The day’s almost over,

677
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,977
and he still hasn’t greeted me.

678
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,646
At this point, I’m not
expecting anything anymore.

679
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:52,199
Hey, do you even know
it’s my birthday today?

680
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,169
It’s useless.

681
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,843
Thank you guys for coming,
enjoy the party!

682
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,137
- Thank you.
- Yeah!

683
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,054
Welcome!

684
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,055
Hi!

685
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,683
Are you guys okay there?

686
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,642
- Sam!
- Shan! You’re here!

687
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,270
Of course! Happy birthday.

688
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,563
Thank you.

689
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,316
You didn’t have to,
but thank you.

690
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,942
You can put it there.

691
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,027
Sure.

692
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:29,110
And they’ve already
started serving drinks,

693
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,236
I know you want that.

694
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:30,905
Nice.

695
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,780
That’s really what
I came for, drinks!

696
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,991
I know, right?

697
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,368
- I’ll see you later.
- Enjoy.

698
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,206
Happy Birthday!

699
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,207
Luna!

700
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,000
Sevirous can’t make it,

701
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,919
so it's just going
to be Ke and Via.

702
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,587
It’s okay.

703
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,379
Happy birthday!

704
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,380
Thank you.

705
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,217
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you, girls.

706
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,636
Thank you for coming.

707
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,348
Kalix is not here. Don’t worry.

708
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,976
It’s not like
I’m looking for him.

709
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,811
Not looking ‘cause
you don’t want to see him,

710
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,606
or because you do want to?

711
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,775
I said I’m not looking for him!

712
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,778
So? Are you introducing
someone to us?

713
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,363
I wouldn’t want
to waste my outfit.

714
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,822
I love this song!
Girls, let's dance!

715
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,367
Come on! Hurry, let’s dance!

716
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,617
Okay, fine!

717
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,285
Come on, come on.

718
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,285
We’ll get to that later.

719
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,207
Happy Birthday!

720
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:24,917
Thank you.

721
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,502
Enjoy the night!

722
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,008
Girls, I’ll just get us
some shots, okay?

723
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:34,760
- Okay.
- Okay.

724
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,512
Stay here. I’ll be back.

725
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,098
Sorry, excuse me.

726
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,603
There. Some shots. Thank you.

727
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,188
Sam.

728
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,815
- Hey.
- Happy Birthday!

729
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,401
Lewis! Thank you. Glad you
could make it tonight.

730
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,488
Yeah. I need a break
from training.

731
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,447
Good thing,
Adi’s been, you know,

732
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,825
raving about your parties.

733
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,705
I wonder what other
stuff Adi said to you.

734
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,290
He said you throw
the best parties out here.

735
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,126
So you know, I had to check.

736
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,627
Although he did warn me that

737
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,880
I might get a little
too drunk tonight.

738
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,299
Yeah.

739
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,926
Wait. There’s a...

740
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,553
There’s something in your...

741
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,096
- What?
- An eyelash.

742
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,394
Let me just…

743
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,188
Thank you.

744
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,025
I’ll just go back to my friends.

745
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,319
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

746
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,236
- I’ll just get back to Adi.
- Yeah.

747
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,405
I’ll see you later, okay?

748
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:38,714
Bye. Enjoy.

749
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,602
Hey!

750
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,412
Hello?

751
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,756
I’m not leaving.

752
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,113
What are you doing here?

753
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,615
Go back in there.
It’s your birthday, right?

754
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,742
So, you know it’s my birthday?

755
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:04,992
How could I not?

756
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,870
I spent the whole day looking
for a nice gift for you

757
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,957
only to see you having fun
with some other guy.

758
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,459
Wait. Is that him?

759
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,213
The football player slash...
what? Environmentalist?

760
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,841
Is that him?

761
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,093
I’m not having fun
with another guy.

762
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,219
We were just talking.

763
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,096
And he saw something
stuck on my face,

764
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,307
he took it out,
that’s it. It’s nothing.

765
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,437
I’m the one who
should be mad right now

766
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,022
because you
didn’t even greet me!

767
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,817
I was waiting the
whole day, but nothing.

768
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,402
I felt really bad.

769
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,080
I’m sorry.

770
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,626
I really wanted
to greet you in person.

771
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,628
I spent the whole night studying

772
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:00,007
so that I could show up
to your birthday party.

773
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,343
But it looks like
my plan kind of backfired.

774
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,555
I’m really sorry, Maui.

775
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,601
It’s okay, you’re here now.

776
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,601
Is it okay to do it here?

777
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,145
It’s tinted.

778
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,704
Is something going
to happen tonight?

779
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:58,333
Wait, is she trying
to seduce me?

780
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,043
Shit.

781
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,047
I think she is.
Should I give in?

782
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,928
All right Cy, let’s do it.

783
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,517
We're finally almost done,
this is crazy.

784
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,520
We can finally sleep, bro.

785
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,355
Nope.

786
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,500
- Are you heading home?
- I still have somewhere to go.

787
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:26,320
Right! That's why you're
in such a hurry.

788
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:27,863
Sam’s birthday?

789
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:29,489
Yeah.

790
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,033
I hope you already
have a gift for her.

791
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:35,370
You've been playing hard to get
all day with your future wife.

792
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,289
I do have one.

793
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,874
Oh heck yeah!

794
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,375
Hey!

795
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,964
Hope Sam likes it.

796
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,885
Come on, open it already.

797
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,723
Fuck! Sorry, Lord.

798
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,600
Damn, bro. That’s beautiful.

799
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,769
- Is that for real?
- Of course.

800
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:00,853
But why a ring?

801
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,676
Don’t you guys already have one?

802
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,567
Bro, that was a gift
from our parents.

803
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,696
I want something with
sentimental value for us.

804
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,159
I want to propose
to her properly, Ridge.

805
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,829
You son of a—
Wow, love is so sweet.

806
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,082
You’re an expert now, Clyden?

807
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,709
- Duh.
- Let’s go.

808
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,982
You two are so cute, I hope
you guys never break up.

809
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,717
You’re the only
good thing in this world.

810
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,719
What really
makes Christmas special

811
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,473
is the people you spend it with.

812
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,474
You probably know me already,

813
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,915
so I won’t bother
introducing myself.

814
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,815
Do you think there’s
pain there, Sam?

815
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,280
It’s a ruthless world
out there, Maui.

816
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,199
Then what do you want me to do?

817
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,742
Should I just follow
everything you say then?

818
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,828
You’re the one who
fucked up your own life.

819
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,038
Manners, please.

820
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,582
Just in case anything
happens to us...

821
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,293
you need Clyden.

822
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,128
You really miss him, huh?

823
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,672
Of course.

824
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:13,260
We’ve just been busy with
school, but we still make time.

825
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,263
They loved your portfolio!

826
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,389
They’re gonna sign you.

827
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,390
Wait! What?

828
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,229
I’m tired.
