1
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,013
I just don’t want him getting
dragged into your family’s mess.

2
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:15,806
So please, as a mother,

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,642
I’m begging you,

4
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,186
stop the engagement.

5
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,232
As long as we’re together,

6
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,067
we can get through
anything, okay?

7
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,610
It’s only now that
I’ve felt what it’s like

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,320
to be treated like family.

9
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,659
Sam!

10
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:36,619
Goodbye.

11
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,332
I’ll see you later.

12
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,751
Hello? Naomi?

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,920
Ma’am, she’s gone.

14
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:50,504
Naomi, how can I live now?

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,677
Let’s just take a selfie.

16
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,431
Cy, please.

17
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,100
Let’s end this.

18
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,810
Maui, you’re just tired.

19
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,187
I was using you.

20
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,206
Haze?

21
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,619
Sam’s almost finished with
her hair and makeup.

22
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,620
Really?

23
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:20,872
She liked the look
you proposed

24
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,207
and decided to do it.

25
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,292
Great. Okay. Let's start!

26
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,293
She’s ready!

27
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:33,843
This supermodel
from the Philippines

28
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,909
is making waves worldwide.

29
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:38,531
She's been in the industry for four years.

30
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,329
And what four years can do.

31
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:42,970
Samantha Vera has fronted
magazine covers,

32
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:44,564
ruled international runways,

33
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:47,456
and is the face of
many global campaigns.

34
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:51,402
A true force
in the fashion scene.

35
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:52,862
With every step,

36
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:56,658
Samantha Vera rewrites the
narrative of the Filipina beauty

37
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:00,651
and proves that a Filipina
can own the world stage.

38
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,459
This is the new Sam.

39
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:07,434
The Sam who’s going to
live life on her own terms.

40
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:10,049
No fear. No holding back.

41
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,882
Nothing and no one will stop me.

42
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:15,390
Not even my past.

43
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,390
Okay.

44
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,893
Her throat isn't
swollen anymore,

45
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,401
but is Avi still coughing?

46
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,232
Not really, Doc.

47
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:31,426
Doc, they’re looking
for you in the ward.

48
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,951
Sorry, I didn’t know
you had a patient.

49
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,872
No, wait,
I’ll introduce you to her.

50
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,709
This is Samantha Vera, the model.

51
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,495
Do you recognize her?

52
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:08,667
Shit. The past is right in front of me.

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,657
And this is
Doctor Clyden Ramirez.

54
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:19,199
He’s a pediatric resident.

55
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:25,542
And this cute little girl
over here is Avrielle.

56
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,229
Av… Avrielle?

57
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,880
We know each other already, Doc.

58
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,552
Hi, Maui.

59
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,800
Hi, Cy.

60
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:52,549
So, how do you guys
know each other?

61
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,448
Common friends?

62
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,904
She was my fiancée.

63
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,451
Wait, wait. I have to take this.

64
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,409
Yes?

65
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,330
Okay. I’ll be right there.

66
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,876
Cly, can you cover for me
and take care of Avi?

67
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:14,582
Maui, I’m so sorry but
I’m needed in the ward.

68
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:16,050
Okay.

69
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:17,884
Excuse me.

70
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,468
Okay, Doc. I’ve got this.

71
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,565
Thank you.

72
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:28,003
How the hell did I end up in
the same room as him?

73
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,934
Excuse me.

74
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:04,778
Okay, what do we have here?

75
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,410
Avi has a sore throat
and was under

76
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,995
medication for five days.

77
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,872
It’s just a follow-up
check-up today.

78
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,292
Hi, Avi. I’m Doc Clyden.

79
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,960
I’ll check your throat first, okay?

80
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,820
Okay.

81
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,967
Okay, say aah.

82
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,156
Okay.

83
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:33,490
Does it hurt?

84
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,229
How about when you cough,
does it still hurt?

85
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,855
Not anymore.

86
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:39,732
Okay.

87
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,307
Doc, am I okay now?

88
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,116
Yes, your throat’s not
swollen anymore.

89
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,035
That’s because
I’ve been a good girl.

90
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,413
I drank the syrup
Dr. Lana gave me,

91
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,206
even though it tastes eewy.

92
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,748
Eewy…

93
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,209
You don’t like the taste?

94
00:06:58,234 --> 00:06:59,335
No.

95
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,712
If they want kids
like me to get well,

96
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,923
they better make it
taste like candy.

97
00:07:04,312 --> 00:07:05,357
I see.

98
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,261
I'd better talk to those
people who make medicines.

99
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,757
Or you should eat mommy’s
soup and vegetables.

100
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:13,450
They’re delicious.

101
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:18,091
I see.

102
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,856
Your mom’s a great cook.

103
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,611
But I miss ice cream.
Can I eat ice cream now?

104
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,946
Yes. Yes, you can.

105
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,198
But just in moderation, okay?

106
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:31,200
He’s still good
at talking to children.

107
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,369
Being a pediatrician really suits him.

108
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:35,225
What does moderation mean?

109
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,669
Moderation means
just a little at a time.

110
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,501
Then can I eat it with
marshmallow toppings?

111
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,019
How about nuts?

112
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,255
He looks mature now,

113
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,591
and very confident and reliable.

114
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,551
I’m happy to see him like this.

115
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:49,939
Okay.

116
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:53,197
So, her throat’s okay now.

117
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,807
No need for more medication.

118
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,101
Just make sure she goes easy
on sweets and cold stuff.

119
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,145
Stick to warm water for now,

120
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,299
just in case the
inflammation comes back.

121
00:08:01,324 --> 00:08:03,785
Or worse,
she might get tonsillitis.

122
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,985
Got it. Thanks, Cy.

123
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,614
I mean, Dr. Ramirez.

124
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,577
She takes after you.

125
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,646
Let’s go, Avi.

126
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,216
We’ll go ahead, Doc.

127
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:24,473
Thank you.

128
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:25,838
Say thank you to Doc.

129
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,673
- Thank you.
- Bye, Avi!

130
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,342
- Say bye.
- Bye!

131
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,763
Let’s go.

132
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:44,599
The rumors are
getting out of hand.

133
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,567
This should be easy to debunk

134
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,718
since it’s not even true.

135
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:51,005
We can always get a statement
from Avi’s parents, right?

136
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,927
No. I can’t drag Yanna
and Avi into this,

137
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,288
especially since Hiro
still doesn’t know about Avi.

138
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,541
It will die down.

139
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,461
Why don’t we create a new rumor?

140
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,046
Let’s say

141
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,006
a non-showbiz boyfriend?

142
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,176
But I don’t have
a non-showbiz boyfriend,

143
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,053
and I don’t even
have time for one.

144
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,806
Well, if you don’t have time
for a romantic relationship,

145
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,100
then maybe an old fling?

146
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,394
Maybe your ex-boyfriend?

147
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,146
Ma’am, remember the
last time you got drunk?

148
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,649
You said your last ex

149
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,026
was the best boyfriend
you’ve ever had?

150
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,778
Perfect. I like that idea.

151
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,071
Who is this boyfriend, anyway?

152
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,324
Try reconnecting with that ex,
whoever he is.

153
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,827
The way I broke up with him?

154
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,653
There’s no way we’ll reconnect.

155
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:43,574
He might still be mad at me.

156
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,961
Maui, wait.

157
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,005
Let’s talk, please.

158
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,299
Let me go.

159
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:53,151
Let me go.

160
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,765
Stop with the
boyfriend rumors, please.

161
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,892
Just let the issue with Avi be.

162
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,520
Again, it will die down eventually.

163
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:07,660
Okay. If you say so.

164
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,610
Let’s talk about your projects.

165
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,175
Francine.

166
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:14,969
So, upcoming bookings so far—

167
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,157
Photoshoots,

168
00:10:16,605 --> 00:10:19,201
The Lab Cosmetics, Muse Magazine,

169
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,511
and Denim Haus.
Now for fashion shows,

170
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:24,331
we have Noa Atelier
and Maison Lorent.

171
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,334
Okay. Got it.

172
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:31,297
By the way, your parents’
lawyers sent a message.

173
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,761
They want you
to visit Camp Crame.

174
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:36,664
Your mom wants to see you.

175
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,765
Ever since they got jailed,

176
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:43,029
I haven’t visited my parents.

177
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,215
Not even once.
And I don’t think I will.

178
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:51,480
I can’t. I’m busy.

179
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,876
I don’t have time to visit.

180
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,032
But that’s true— because
you have a tight schedule.

181
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,097
Here’s your schedule.

182
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,715
Are you good?

183
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:04,921
Yeah. Okay, bring it on.

184
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,274
You have your
gym training every day.

185
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:15,235
Ten more minutes, Sam!
You can do it!

186
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,389
On Wednesday,
you have a photoshoot.

187
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,599
Friday, contract signing.

188
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,149
Thank you.

189
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:34,344
Thank you.

190
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,611
We are thrilled

191
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,782
to have you as our
new brand ambassador, Sam.

192
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,033
Thank you for having me.

193
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,868
I’m so excited to work
with you guys,

194
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,871
and you know what,
I can eat Botejyu every day.

195
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,872
Wow.

196
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,798
Also on Friday night,

197
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,176
you have a runway
rehearsal and Saturday—

198
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,695
you have a fashion show.

199
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,750
Samantha Vera
wows in fashion show,

200
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,627
as Modern Maria Clara.

201
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,279
Thank you.

202
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:01,639
Sam, the psychology students
from San Gabriel College

203
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,843
are double-checking
if you’re still coming

204
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,135
as their guest speaker.

205
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,178
It’s tomorrow,

206
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:08,444
unless you want to take a break.

207
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:12,037
No, I’m going there.

208
00:14:12,256 --> 00:14:14,175
It’s important, I should be there.

209
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,639
Mental health isn’t a weakness.

210
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:26,046
It takes real courage
to talk about it.

211
00:14:27,478 --> 00:14:30,943
Sometimes we think
we can handle everything—

212
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,039
but we’re only human.

213
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,553
You need to check in on
the people you care about,

214
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,498
even if it’s just
a simple message like,

215
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,839
“How are you?”

216
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:44,390
Sometimes we assume

217
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:49,504
they don’t want to be bothered
or that they’re okay.

218
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,473
But the truth is,

219
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,978
you never really know what
someone’s quietly carrying.

220
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,816
There are smiles
hiding sadness underneath.

221
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,279
Your small act of care,
just a simple,

222
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,574
“I’m here if you need me”.

223
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,536
That might just save a life.

224
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,747
So,

225
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:22,058
let’s all normalize
asking for help.

226
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,299
Let’s all normalize checking in.

227
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,053
You’re not weak
just because you’re tired.

228
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,972
We all need to pause,

229
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,465
reflect,

230
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:35,716
and heal together.

231
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,841
I hope you’re proud of me, Naomi.

232
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,929
I miss you.

233
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,044
Sam, are you busy tomorrow?

234
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:32,973
Can I leave Avi with you?
I have a sudden flight.

235
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:35,153
But I’ll pick her up
in the evening.

236
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,040
Of course! No problem.

237
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,709
But I’m going
to the gym tomorrow.

238
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,711
Is it okay if Avi comes along?

239
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:49,675
Sure! But oh man,
Avi will change her mind again.

240
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,219
The other day, she said she
wants to be a weightlifter.

241
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:52,928
Then, just recently,

242
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,222
she said she wants
to be a pretty office woman

243
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,307
because you took her
to your meeting.

244
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:12,325
Nine, eight, seven. Then other side.

245
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,158
Baby, be careful.

246
00:17:17,546 --> 00:17:18,559
Jump.

247
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,731
- Slowly.
- Go, Auntie!

248
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,941
Chest out.

249
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,958
Yes.

250
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:02,806
Come on, Sam. You can do it!

251
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,375
Go, Auntie! Go!

252
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,627
Avi, be careful.

253
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,686
Okay.

254
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,254
One more set, Sam.

255
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,548
I’m dying, Rich.

256
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,700
Come on, Sam.

257
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,930
I’m so tired!

258
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,890
Don’t you have
a bikini photoshoot, Sam?

259
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,433
So, suck it up.

260
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,606
Come on.

261
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,677
Go, Auntie! Go!

262
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,809
Careful, Avi!

263
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,655
- Auntie… Auntie!
- Oh my god.

264
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,558
Baby! Avi!

265
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,293
Rich, I need to take her
to the hospital.

266
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:41,071
There's one nearby,
Ramirez Medical.

267
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:45,681
It’s okay, baby.
Let’s go to the hospital.

268
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,757
Is Dr. Lana on duty today?

269
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,758
She’s Avi’s doctor.

270
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,719
Dr. Lana’s off duty right now,

271
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:59,080
but one of our pediatricians
is already on the way.

272
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:04,254
Baby, stop crying.
It’s okay, it’s okay.

273
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,286
He’s here.

274
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:07,521
- Don’t worry.
- What happened?

275
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:12,747
I think she hit her face
flat on the floor at the gym.

276
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,155
Why would you bring
your kid to the gym?

277
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:23,559
Blood. There’s blood.

278
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:24,614
Let me see.

279
00:19:25,503 --> 00:19:26,652
Can I see?

280
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:27,708
Okay. No more.

281
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:29,206
It’s not bleeding anymore.

282
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:32,254
Am I going to be okay?

283
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:34,692
Of course,
you’re going to be okay.

284
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,419
You’re a strong girl, right?

285
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,764
Okay. Let me take this.

286
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,231
Hold it.

287
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,690
The ice pack, please.

288
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,324
Okay, lean forward to me.

289
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,367
Okay.

290
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,578
It’s okay. It’s okay, Avi.

291
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,880
All right. Lean back,
lie down. Slowly.

292
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,568
Okay, good girl. It’s okay.

293
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,295
It’s okay.

294
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,174
Let’s get her an X-ray

295
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,176
just to make sure there
are no fractures or anything.

296
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,094
I’ll have the nurse assist you.

297
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,099
Okay.

298
00:20:23,124 --> 00:20:25,877
Don’t worry baby.
You’re gonna be okay.

299
00:20:25,902 --> 00:20:28,237
- Stop crying now, okay?
- It’s okay.

300
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,599
There’s no more bleeding. It’s okay.

301
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:43,110
It’s okay, it’s okay.

302
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,911
It’s okay.

303
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,912
Just a quick search.

304
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,748
It’s harmless.
I’m just curious.

305
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,550
Charles Ramirez to
Lead Ramirez Medical,

306
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:45,306
Unveils Expansion Plans
for Modern Healthcare.

307
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,099
Charles? Really?

308
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,310
I wonder what happened.

309
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,612
Ramirez Son, leads vaccine
efforts in rural areas.

310
00:21:55,637 --> 00:22:00,767
Vaccines help protect children
from serious diseases.

311
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:04,990
We can get them for free
at barangay health centers,

312
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,533
government hospitals,

313
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,953
and some private clinics
accredited by the DOH.

314
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,420
Doc, thank you so much
for this program.

315
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,815
You’re welcome, Cap.

316
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,065
But this wasn’t all just my effort.

317
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,676
A lot of volunteers from
Ramirez Medical helped out,

318
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,230
and we also received
a lot of donations.

319
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,724
But you’re really the one
who started this program,

320
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,684
so thank you so much.

321
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:35,401
Ramirez Medical brings
free medical service

322
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:37,189
to hundreds of children.

323
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,575
Hello.

324
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:54,373
That doctor is so hot,

325
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,007
I’d definitely get a shot from him.

326
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:01,629
Okay, good.

327
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,194
Is it hard to be a doctor?

328
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,638
I want to cure my mom.

329
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:09,561
She’s always sick.

330
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,224
You can definitely be a doctor,

331
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:14,163
but you have to stay healthy.

332
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:15,689
So you have to take
all the medicine

333
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:18,730
and vitamins I give you, okay?

334
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,179
- Yes, sir!
- Okay.

335
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:22,706
Me too, Doc. Can I have some?

336
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,545
I want to be a model
when I grow up.

337
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,905
How lame.

338
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,741
You just have a crush on me.

339
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,952
A model and a doctor?

340
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:34,132
That’s a great dream to have.

341
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:37,709
See? I told you being a model is cool.

342
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,202
Clyden Ramirez is more
than just Medical Royalty.

343
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,890
He’s still the same old
Clyden I knew years ago.

344
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,741
The same principled guy
with a heart

345
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:53,593
to help those in need.

346
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:10,009
Why am I getting annoyed?

347
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,211
I’m just tired.

348
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:16,698
That’s right. I need rest.

349
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,102
Avi, be a good girl. Okay?

350
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,988
Don’t stress your Auntie.

351
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,126
When I get back,

352
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:44,321
we’re going to pack our
things for Japan, okay?

353
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:45,442
Are you excited?

354
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:47,594
I’m super excited, Mommy!

355
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,572
How about you? Are you excited?

356
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,784
Of course!

357
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,494
But honestly,
I’m a bit nervous too.

358
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:57,467
Don’t worry too much.

359
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,251
Just enjoy your first
international trip with Avi.

360
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:01,985
Besides, I’ll be there too.

361
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,221
I’ll make sure the three
of us have a great time.

362
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:07,093
Okay. Thanks, Sam.

363
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:09,370
All right, our flight
is coming up soon.

364
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:10,509
Okay, bye.

365
00:25:10,534 --> 00:25:12,160
Avi, say bye-bye to your mommy.

366
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:13,360
Bye, mommy!

367
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:15,666
Are you buying me a souvenir?

368
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:17,665
I’m going to Thailand, baby.

369
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,867
We're just going to buy a lot

370
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,810
of souvenirs in Japan, okay?

371
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,729
Yeah, I’ll see you.

372
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,813
- Okay?
- Miss Samantha Vera?

373
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:25,715
OMG! Can we take
a photo with you?

374
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,559
Yeah. Sure.

375
00:25:31,451 --> 00:25:32,326
Thank you.

376
00:25:32,351 --> 00:25:34,103
Your daughter is so cute.

377
00:25:39,444 --> 00:25:40,736
Thank you.

378
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:48,227
Dog!

379
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,391
Baby! Avi!

380
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,979
You look familiar.

381
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:06,161
- Hail.
- Hail?

382
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:08,572
Oh my god, is that you?

383
00:26:15,588 --> 00:26:18,674
Great. We bumped into each other again.

384
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:30,586
Sorry, she just got excited
about the dogs.

385
00:26:31,332 --> 00:26:33,625
I didn’t even realize this was Hail.

386
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:34,829
It’s okay.

387
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:36,915
But it looks like he recognized you.

388
00:26:37,414 --> 00:26:39,142
He got excited when he saw you.

389
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:43,014
New dog?

390
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:45,243
Yeah. Solar.

391
00:26:46,824 --> 00:26:48,034
Summer’s daughter.

392
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:49,852
Puppy!

393
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:52,105
Summer has a baby.

394
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:53,682
How is she?

395
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:55,449
She...

396
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,321
passed away.

397
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,473
I’m sorry to hear that.

398
00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:07,482
Sam—

399
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,017
Yes?

400
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:10,282
Wait.

401
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:13,876
- Wanna pet the dogs?
- Yes!

402
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:16,400
- Hello? What happened?
- This is Hail.

403
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:18,965
Okay, I’ll be right there.

404
00:27:21,363 --> 00:27:22,364
I need to go.

405
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,599
Okay. See you around?

406
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:28,609
I hope we won’t see each other often.

407
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,400
Excuse me, what?

408
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:33,548
Does he hate me that much?

409
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,228
Because that means Avi’s unhealthy.

410
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,449
So, please take good care of her.

411
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,771
Come, let’s go.

412
00:27:44,018 --> 00:27:45,895
- Hail, Solar.
- Okay. Say bye-bye to the dogs!

413
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,298
Bye!

414
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,343
Sir, how’s she doing?

415
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,131
She’s doing okay.

416
00:27:56,823 --> 00:27:58,540
She’s been feeling weak lately.

417
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:00,827
Okay. I’ll just go check on her.

418
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,121
Hi, Anya!

419
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:06,774
Doc, look!

420
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,676
I want to dance like this.

421
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:12,240
When will I be able to go out?

422
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:14,901
I want to see my friends already.

423
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:16,371
I miss them.

424
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:18,530
You know, Nurse May told me

425
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,156
that you’re not
taking your medicine.

426
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:22,268
I’m waiting for you.

427
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:26,303
I don’t want to take it
unless you give it to me.

428
00:28:27,093 --> 00:28:28,261
You’re being picky.

429
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,268
You have to take your medicine,

430
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:31,954
you can’t be stubborn about it.

431
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:33,564
Am I going to get better?

432
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,947
Because on the internet,

433
00:28:35,972 --> 00:28:39,309
it says you don’t get
better at stage four.

434
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,673
Hey…

435
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,845
Not everything you see on
the internet is true.

436
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:50,251
Okay?

437
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:52,404
Okay, Doc Clyden.

438
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:55,968
I’ll trust you more than the internet.

439
00:28:56,265 --> 00:28:59,644
Because you’re the best
doctor in the world!

440
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:03,635
All right, now take your meds.

441
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:10,532
Anya, here you go.

442
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:23,540
Oh, that’s my mommy’s magazine.

443
00:29:24,942 --> 00:29:26,694
Do you think she’s pretty?

444
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,699
She looks like my doll.

445
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,413
Yeah.

446
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:41,468
She does look like a doll.

447
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,666
Thanks for coming along
at the last minute, Sam.

448
00:29:50,691 --> 00:29:51,663
Of course.

449
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:54,649
I know it’s hard to travel
with a 4-year-old.

450
00:29:54,694 --> 00:29:56,795
- Avi!
- Avi, your mommy.

451
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,853
You stay with Auntie Sam
for now, okay?

452
00:29:57,878 --> 00:29:59,087
We’ll see each other later.

453
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:00,718
Okay, Mommy.

454
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,653
All right, let’s talk later.
My phone’s drained.

455
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:04,694
See you soon!

456
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,429
Bye, Mommy!
I love you, Mommy!

457
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,015
Bye, Avi! I love you, too!
See you!

458
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,717
Look, Avi. That’s mommy.

459
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:17,202
She’s super busy, see?

460
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:19,379
Hi, Mommy! You’re so pretty.

461
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:21,374
You’re so cute, my baby.

462
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,616
Okay Avi, go to the lavatory.

463
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:29,343
Okay…

464
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,808
Girl, are you okay?

465
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:36,798
Sam, I have a problem.
I don’t know what to do.

466
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,981
What is it?

467
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:40,864
Hiro’s the pilot.

468
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:43,234
There was a last-minute change.

469
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,344
We’re also staying in the same
hotel with the flight crew.

470
00:30:46,508 --> 00:30:48,833
What if we bump into Hiro?

471
00:30:48,858 --> 00:30:51,140
Maybe I should just change
hotels, just to be safe?

472
00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:53,536
We can do that. But really, Yanna.

473
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,929
What if you just
tell Hiro about Avi?

474
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:58,502
I think that’s the easier option.

475
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:02,120
Maybe this is the right timing
you’ve been waiting for.

476
00:31:11,335 --> 00:31:13,045
- Avi would love that.
- Hey!

477
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,817
- Jeez.
- I'll buy these for her,

478
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:17,917
what else?

479
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,168
That’s too much candy.

480
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,169
No, It's okay.

481
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,132
I want chocolate.

482
00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:23,366
That might be too much.

483
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:24,559
No, it’s fine.

484
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:48,019
I like your hair clip.

485
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:51,552
Thank you!
My daddy gave it to me.

486
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:55,841
Are you a pilot?

487
00:32:00,749 --> 00:32:01,711
Yes…

488
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,741
My daddy is a pilot, too.

489
00:32:45,248 --> 00:32:47,834
Avi, let’s go to our hotel.

490
00:32:58,914 --> 00:33:00,123
Let’s put the other clip.

491
00:33:00,148 --> 00:33:02,400
Wow! You look so pretty.

492
00:33:02,425 --> 00:33:03,959
Thank you!

493
00:33:19,426 --> 00:33:21,220
I’ll go out for a while.

494
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:29,418
Are we going to ride
the carousel now?

495
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,851
Let’s see.

496
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:43,128
Hi, my love.

497
00:33:43,493 --> 00:33:45,745
Daddy, look at my outfit.

498
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:50,196
You look so pretty, my love.

499
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:52,113
Are you excited?

500
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:54,932
I’m excited to explore
Japan with you.

501
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:56,871
Wow! Let’s go?

502
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,876
- Bye, Auntie!
- Bye, have fun.

503
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,541
Bye. Thank you.

504
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:32,552
Hey, Raylee. I’m already
at Boteyju Shibuya.

505
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,105
Are you on your way?

506
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:48,293
We’re heading back to the hotel

507
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:51,144
from the amusement park!
Want to join us for dinner?

508
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:52,795
Let’s meet in Shinjuku!

509
00:34:57,999 --> 00:34:59,292
I’ll pass for now.

510
00:34:59,317 --> 00:35:02,946
I’m meeting Raylee here in
Shibuya. But enjoy, you guys!

511
00:35:03,338 --> 00:35:05,298
It’s so nice to
see you all together!

512
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:08,189
We’ll catch up when
we get back to the hotel.

513
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:13,566
But seriously, Sam, this might
be the happiest day of my life.

514
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:15,759
Also, I’m sorry!

515
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,988
It should be you, me,
and Avi’s bonding time,

516
00:35:19,054 --> 00:35:20,847
but Hiro butted in.

517
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,614
Don’t worry about me.

518
00:35:24,877 --> 00:35:28,631
Just enjoy this trip. Enjoy your dinner!

519
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,746
Well, this is bittersweet.

520
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,802
I’m happy they’re finally a family.

521
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:40,213
But I kinda feel sad because

522
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,158
I know I don’t need to
take care of Avi anymore.

523
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:44,965
I’m solo again.

524
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:51,828
Hey, Sam, sorry!

525
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:53,511
I can’t make it to our dinner.

526
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:55,538
I had to head back
to the Philippines.

527
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,072
My niece got into an accident.

528
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:03,619
Oh no. I hope she’s okay!

529
00:36:03,986 --> 00:36:06,113
Let’s just meet up in Manila instead.

530
00:36:06,637 --> 00:36:08,097
Take care, Raylee!

531
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,800
Thank you.

532
00:36:21,394 --> 00:36:23,480
Please enjoy your food.

533
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:25,652
Yes, thank you.

534
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:37,902
Can I join you?

535
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:39,589
Haze!

536
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:41,668
Sure, go ahead.

537
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:44,011
I never thought I’d see you here.

538
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,995
Same with you, Sam.

539
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:47,527
Small world.

540
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:50,199
Your date didn’t show up?

541
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:52,827
I was supposed to meet a friend.

542
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,795
What about you?

543
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:56,545
You got stood up too?

544
00:36:58,223 --> 00:36:59,933
Unfortunately, yes—

545
00:37:02,392 --> 00:37:04,394
by the businessman
I was about to meet.

546
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:05,905
But well,

547
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:07,902
I’m glad you’re alone too.

548
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:10,855
Mind if we have dinner together?

549
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:12,589
Well, you’re already
sitting there,

550
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:14,277
what else can I do?

551
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:18,675
You know what?

552
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:21,123
Hiro’s here, by the way.

553
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:22,322
Yeah, I know.

554
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,235
I’m sure he’s having
a lot of fun right now.

555
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:48,503
You’re still a heavy drinker,
Samantha Vera.

556
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:52,069
But, I don’t get drunk easily.

557
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,198
You seem a little tipsy to me.

558
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,276
I’m not.

559
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:01,050
All right,

560
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,183
if you say so.

561
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:04,543
Haze,

562
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:06,769
have you ever fallen in love?

563
00:38:10,642 --> 00:38:12,185
That’s so out of nowhere

564
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:14,768
but sure, I’ll answer it.

565
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,531
Of course, I have.

566
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:19,019
You?

567
00:38:20,337 --> 00:38:21,338
Of course.

568
00:38:21,504 --> 00:38:24,841
I fell madly and deeply
in love with this person.

569
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:27,355
He’s an amazing guy, you know?

570
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:29,824
We even lived together

571
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,185
and promised to
marry each other, but—

572
00:38:34,528 --> 00:38:35,821
I just left him.

573
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,524
When we saw each other again,

574
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,218
everything just changed.

575
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:42,945
What changed?

576
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:47,132
The way he looks at me
and talks to me.

577
00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:50,645
He’s kind of cold
and grumpy now.

578
00:38:51,302 --> 00:38:52,678
It hurts, you know?

579
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,132
Maybe,

580
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:58,101
I’m just expecting
something more.

581
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:00,096
Well,

582
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,167
you left him.

583
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:04,592
You can’t just expect him to
treat you the same way.

584
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:07,645
Love fades, Sam.

585
00:39:11,155 --> 00:39:12,406
Why are you smiling?

586
00:39:13,288 --> 00:39:15,790
You’re happy while
I’m miserable? Huh?

587
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:18,183
Huh?

588
00:39:18,448 --> 00:39:20,066
Told you, you’re drunk.

589
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:22,987
I’m not drunk.

590
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,293
Where’s your hotel, Sam?

591
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:31,003
My… My wha—

592
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:32,747
Are you okay?

593
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:36,456
I thought you didn’t
get drunk easily?

594
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:38,487
What the fuck is this?

595
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:43,698
Haze, don’t you have a girlfriend?

596
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,853
No, I don’t.

597
00:39:47,645 --> 00:39:49,026
Why? Are you applying?

598
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:58,471
Are you sure you’re okay?

599
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:01,284
Yeah. I’m okay.

600
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:03,605
Cheers?

601
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:35,940
Samantha Vera spotted having
a date with a guy in Japan?

602
00:40:39,457 --> 00:40:42,168
OMG! Is that Sam’s baby daddy?

603
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:45,482
Even from the back,
he looks yummy!

604
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:48,124
Sam’s love life is so messy!

605
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:50,580
Why doesn’t she just
announce it already?

606
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,792
Thank god, Haze’s
face isn’t showing!

607
00:41:05,736 --> 00:41:07,529
Are you back in Manila?

608
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:09,412
Are you free to meet today?

609
00:41:14,228 --> 00:41:15,855
Thanks for meeting me here.

610
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,548
This is just the nearest place
to Ramirez Medical.

611
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:22,089
My niece is confined there,

612
00:41:22,114 --> 00:41:24,366
and I’m the only one
watching over her.

613
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,448
Are you okay? Are you hiding
from something?

614
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:39,978
I fucking knew it.
Of course, I’ll see him here.

615
00:41:40,713 --> 00:41:43,309
One large strawberry
milkshake, please.

616
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,396
Anything else, ma’am?

617
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:45,422
Make it two.

618
00:41:46,013 --> 00:41:48,140
- Okay, two please.
- Okay.

619
00:41:49,378 --> 00:41:51,088
- Let’s wait for our drinks.
- Yeah.

620
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:58,941
Do you have a headache?

621
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:04,005
How’s residency going?

622
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,449
I’m doing okay.
I’m actually learning a lot.

623
00:42:06,786 --> 00:42:10,194
Well, kids are not
the easiest patients, but

624
00:42:10,669 --> 00:42:12,247
I love taking care of them.

625
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:13,333
Looks like it.

626
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:16,479
Actually, I heard you’re the
favorite of the patients

627
00:42:16,504 --> 00:42:17,505
in the pedia ward.

628
00:42:18,859 --> 00:42:20,193
Yeah. It’s true!

629
00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:23,454
Wait, so remind me,

630
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:26,505
why did you decide to go into pedia?

631
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:28,869
I really thought you
were going for surgery.

632
00:42:29,434 --> 00:42:30,852
Yeah, I did. But

633
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:33,560
I realized it would take too long.

634
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:35,712
And I want to get married
before fellowship starts.

635
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:39,098
Marry? Who?

636
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,432
With Eva?

637
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,435
Looks like
they got closer, huh?

638
00:42:43,482 --> 00:42:45,312
They even drink
shakes together now.

639
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:46,797
What’s with the long face?

640
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:48,174
You okay?

641
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:53,880
Not really. I just received
a message from my assistant and,

642
00:42:54,217 --> 00:42:56,135
I need to head to
our agency right now.

643
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:59,285
No problem, I need to get back
to my niece anyway.

644
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:03,997
Oh, wait, do you want me
to drop you off at the hospital?

645
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:05,146
I brought a car.

646
00:43:05,171 --> 00:43:07,298
No need, no need.
You’ll have to go around.

647
00:43:07,323 --> 00:43:09,911
I mean, the hospital’s just
walking distance from here.

648
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:11,911
and I need to
get my steps in. So—

649
00:43:12,294 --> 00:43:14,232
- Sure?
- Yeah, I’m totally sure.

650
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:15,443
Okay, I need to go.

651
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,099
- Take care.
- Yeah. You too.

652
00:43:17,124 --> 00:43:18,125
I’ll see you soon.

653
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,692
Guys, look here.
Look at the camera.

654
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,740
- Let’s do an unboxing.
- What’s that?

655
00:43:34,765 --> 00:43:36,975
Hey! It’s Samantha Vera.

656
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,881
- You’re right!
- Yeah!

657
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,158
Isn’t she trending right now?

658
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:39,867
- Right
- Right!

659
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:40,904
Hey, Sam!

660
00:43:41,097 --> 00:43:42,932
Are you with your
boyfriend in Japan?

661
00:43:43,201 --> 00:43:44,580
I have nothing to say.

662
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,831
- Can I have a picture?
- Please!

663
00:43:45,972 --> 00:43:46,932
I’m sorry.

664
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,834
- Your baby is so cute.
- Come on.

665
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,302
I saw your picture
with her at the park.

666
00:43:51,327 --> 00:43:52,828
Is he the father of your child?

667
00:43:52,853 --> 00:43:54,919
- It’s just for our content.
- For engagement, come on.

668
00:43:54,944 --> 00:43:55,649
Please?

669
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,717
What’s your
boyfriend’s name, Sam?

670
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,843
Just a picture, Sam.

671
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:58,886
- Come on.
- Sam.

672
00:43:58,886 --> 00:43:59,970
- I have to go, I’m sorry.
- Just one.

673
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,971
Just one, just one.

674
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,431
- Let’s just take a photo.
- Come on.

675
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,432
- Just a video, okay?
- Just a photo.

676
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,982
- Just for our content.
- Just a video.

677
00:44:05,007 --> 00:44:06,842
Just for engagement
with the fans, okay?

678
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:08,687
- Take a video.
- Hurry up. Here.

679
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,313
- All right.
- Come on.

680
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,314
Let her go.

681
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:11,737
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

682
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:13,208
We just want to take a photo with her.

683
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,344
We just wanted to take a picture.

684
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:15,537
Just one picture.

685
00:44:15,712 --> 00:44:17,881
Come on, just one photo.

686
00:44:17,913 --> 00:44:19,506
Sir, this is Samantha Vera—

687
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,658
We just want to take a picture.

688
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,950
That’s not allowed here.

689
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,263
Just one photo.

690
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:25,154
I said that’s enough.

691
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:26,497
So stingy!

692
00:45:18,598 --> 00:45:20,641
Thank you for saving me earlier.

693
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,762
I think I can take it from here.

694
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,209
I’ll go ahead.

695
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:31,837
Sam, you need to rest.

696
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:35,081
I’m feeling even worse
because of the heat.

697
00:45:35,106 --> 00:45:37,167
The topic about the guy
you were with in Japan

698
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,527
is seriously heating up.

699
00:45:38,728 --> 00:45:41,647
He’s Fly Asia’s CEO.

700
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:46,663
Did you bring a companion?
To watch you?

701
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:49,697
It’s just me.

702
00:45:50,077 --> 00:45:51,532
My card holder is missing.

703
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,618
Sorry to bother you but—

704
00:45:53,643 --> 00:45:55,770
Have you seen a card holder?

705
00:46:05,844 --> 00:46:07,014
Sam?
