1
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:12,386
This is Samantha Vera,

2
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:13,179
the model.

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,639
We know each other already, Doc.

4
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:16,300
She was my fiancée.

5
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,201
There’s really no one
like The Samantha Vera.

6
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,895
The school year just started and

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,922
she plans the best parties.

8
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:23,115
Do you remember when I told you

9
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,525
that you’ll be marrying
the son of my best friend?

10
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,693
His name is Clyden.

11
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,445
BS Biology. Cum Laude.

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,456
Don’t get all giddy.

13
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,417
We can’t marry each other.

14
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,710
I agree.

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,920
Come on, get dressed.
We're going to a party.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,422
She's not coming.
It’s just us.

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,422
What?

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,634
You want to show off your
dad’s bastard child to everyone?

19
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,053
- Mom!
- Let’s go!

20
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,224
We bought you a house.

21
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,224
Yes!

22
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,353
No fucking way.

23
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,897
What the hell?

24
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,114
Why? Is there a problem?

25
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,785
I don’t think there’s a problem.

26
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,785
Is there, sweetheart?

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,542
Right! No problem.

28
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,295
We’re just shocked
with the big news.

29
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,841
But we’re both happy and
excited at the same time.

30
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,551
We’ll be together every day.

31
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,721
But, hon… Don’t you
think it’s going too fast?

32
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,972
I mean, they’re still students.

33
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,101
Maybe they can just live
together after the wedding?

34
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,519
Well, I get your point,

35
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,687
but that’s where it’s
all headed anyway, right?

36
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,942
That will be good for them to
get to know each other better.

37
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,495
Yes.

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,488
So you guys can practice
being a husband and a wife.

39
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,656
Well, that's right.

40
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:56,449
So, when are they moving in?

41
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,951
In about a month's time.

42
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,870
I can’t wait
for you to graduate

43
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,124
so that we can finally
get our first grandson!

44
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,500
- Really?
- That’s true!

45
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,961
A grandchild?
What the fuck is happening?

46
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:09,921
- This can’t be my life now.
- Probably our grandson

47
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,673
will look so handsome, and
I hope he gets your nose.

48
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,341
I hope he gets your eyes!

49
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,680
Don’t worry, I’ll make sure
that won’t happen.

50
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:22,227
That’s never gonna happen,
not even in your dreams.

51
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:25,046
Just thinking about it
makes me want to puke.

52
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,189
If you're disgusted, trust me,
I’m even more disgusted.

53
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,732
You two better get ready.

54
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,776
I’ll handle everything from here.

55
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,927
Yes, Dad.

56
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,322
Excuse us, we’ll just talk.

57
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,883
A talk between fiancés.

58
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,325
- Okay.
- Okay. Go ahead.

59
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,380
Live together?

60
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,590
Fuck this.

61
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:56,566
You think I want to live with you?

62
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,013
I don’t need your presence
while I'm studying.

63
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,181
Then say no.

64
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,808
We can still be engaged
without living together.

65
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,809
Why me?

66
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,519
Why not you?

67
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,272
Just tell your dad you don’t want to.

68
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,817
I can’t say no to my dad.

69
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,359
No one can.

70
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:15,928
See?

71
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,197
You can’t.

72
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,825
My dad isn’t any regular dad.

73
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,161
What he wants, he gets.

74
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,511
And you?

75
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:26,455
Why can't you just tell
your dad you don’t want it?

76
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:28,891
I just can’t.

77
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,602
Jeez.

78
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,503
So you’re not any different then.

79
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:35,279
If you can’t say no,
then we have to deal with this.

80
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,258
You’ll have to adjust to me.

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,385
Me? Adjust to you?

82
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,970
- Why not?
- Why, yes?

83
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,640
Are you out of your mind?
I need more time to study.

84
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,641
Wow!

85
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:46,684
You think you're high and mighty

86
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,686
just because you're
studying med, huh?

87
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,105
And you think your time
is more important than mine?

88
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,358
And you think
you’re such a princess, huh?

89
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,817
You will adjust to me.

90
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,279
If they spoil you at home,

91
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,448
well guess what, I'm not them.

92
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,659
That won’t work on me.

93
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,460
What the fuck are you doing?

94
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:17,394
They’re looking at us.

95
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,054
Just play along.

96
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,728
Fuck you.

97
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,898
Did she just say, “I love you”?

98
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,066
I think so.

99
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,764
- They’re really meant for each other.
- Yes.

100
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,125
What did you say earlier?

101
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,167
That I’m spoiled?

102
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:57,492
Can you even hear yourself?
Do you know how rude you are?

103
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:58,559
Rude?

104
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,841
Yes, I know.

105
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:00,800
Why?

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,260
Why can’t you just be kind?

107
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,971
You know, try it. It’s not that hard.

108
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,264
I am kind…

109
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,266
to kind people.

110
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,118
So you’re saying that I’m not kind?

111
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,147
Are you?

112
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,273
I don’t know what
to do with you anymore.

113
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,859
It’s not like we can do
anything about it,

114
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,860
so let’s just plan.

115
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,128
Shit.

116
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,988
It’s my last year
in college this August,

117
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,448
and you’re ruining it.

118
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,700
Why are you mad at me?

119
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,368
Am I the one buying the house?

120
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,436
You think I want to live with you?

121
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,996
Not at all.

122
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,740
So maybe try being
mad at someone else.

123
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,168
I suggest your dad.

124
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,295
Can you be serious for a second?

125
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,255
I am serious.

126
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,121
Do you think I’m joking?

127
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,110
Okay.

128
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:48,427
Here's the plan—

129
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,351
No helpers, no drivers, nothing.

130
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,393
To avoid gossip.

131
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,063
So, if you don't have
any better suggestions,

132
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,148
let's just stick to the plan.

133
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,384
And I’m staying in that house
for one month only,

134
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,693
just to please my parents.

135
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,944
I’m going back
to my condo eventually.

136
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,322
Do whatever you want.

137
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,658
For now, we have
to follow what they say.

138
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,627
This whole pretending thing
will be over soon anyway.

139
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:11,995
I agree.

140
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,540
I really hope this ends soon!

141
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,834
I can’t wait for
that time to happen!

142
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,293
Deal?

143
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,258
Deal.

144
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,853
One month, Sam!
It’s just one month!

145
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,357
Just literally co-exist with
that rude guy in the same house!

146
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,359
No need for small talk
or anything.

147
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,737
Okay. For now,

148
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,572
just keep calm.

149
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,121
Something’s missing…

150
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,968
- Naomi.
- What are you doing here?

151
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,181
I’m just curious if you borrowed
some of my makeup?

152
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,226
But I don’t mind. In fact, here.

153
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,144
I even brought more for you.

154
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,939
Are you accusing me
of stealing your makeup?

155
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:27,022
Huh? No!

156
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,235
I was just asking.

157
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,904
I mean, it’s totally fine,
I was just wondering.

158
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,948
I did not steal
your makeup, okay?

159
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,948
Now, go away.

160
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:37,128
Wait.

161
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:39,826
Naomi, if you want more makeup,

162
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,455
you can ask me for some.

163
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,541
I can lend you
the brands I like and—

164
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,793
I don’t need you
to buy me makeup, okay?

165
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:48,259
I can ask Dad to buy me makeup.

166
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:50,279
Now, leave.

167
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:51,305
Sorry.

168
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,387
That was a lie.

169
00:09:56,926 --> 00:10:00,137
She couldn’t ask anything
from Mom or Dad.

170
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:02,987
Neither her needs nor
the things she wanted to buy.

171
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,440
Of course, I understand why
she had to borrow my things.

172
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,328
Rubylyn, did you preheat
the oven like I told you?

173
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,039
Yes, ma’am. I set it to 340.

174
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,042
Didn't I say 375?

175
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,960
Sorry, ma'am. I'll fix it.

176
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,462
I keep on repeating
myself, Rubylyn.

177
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,463
I'll fix it, ma'am.

178
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,298
So annoying.

179
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,011
- Mom.
- Hi, Maui!

180
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:38,898
Look what I made.

181
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:42,357
I’m making cookies.

182
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,035
You should try it when it’s done.

183
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,979
And also, bring some for Clyden.

184
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,318
Mom, I’m here to talk
about Naom—

185
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,736
I knew it!

186
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,279
I already know
what this is about,

187
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,824
you want to talk about
moving in with Clyden?

188
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:01,396
That was quick, I knew it!

189
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,372
You know, sweetheart,

190
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,249
love is

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,502
like baking!

192
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,670
Huh?

193
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,174
You need to have
all the ingredients

194
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,760
of patience,

195
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,969
warmth,

196
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,888
and understanding

197
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,808
to truly savor the sweetness.

198
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,935
Sometimes, it might burn

199
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,896
or get undercooked.

200
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,065
But in time,

201
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,775
you'll perfect it.

202
00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:37,558
Mom, can I talk
about something else?

203
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,367
Okay. Sure. What is it?

204
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,327
Naomi is a college freshie now.

205
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,537
Rubylyn!

206
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:46,597
This is done.

207
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,748
Start baking it.

208
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,290
Go ahead. What?

209
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:53,170
So, she might need
new clothes, school supplies,

210
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,505
and other things.

211
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,047
Oh!

212
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,385
Sweetheart, I’m not her mom.

213
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,429
And she has
her allowance anyway.

214
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,389
She’s old enough,
she can take care of herself.

215
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,808
Okay.

216
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,186
I left some of my clothes,
makeup, and camera—

217
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,186
Wait!

218
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,356
Let’s take a picture.

219
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,652
Nice! Baking with my daughter,
mommy duties!

220
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,449
- So, Mom… I left—
- Look at this.

221
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,950
The picture would’ve been great,

222
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,910
but you weren’t
smiling properly.

223
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,910
What a shame.

224
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,539
I left it in my room
for her to use,

225
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,707
so please give it to her.

226
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,334
I'll tell Rubylyn,
she can take care of it.

227
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,589
Well… All right—

228
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,886
Are you ready?

229
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,346
To move in with Clyden?

230
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,664
Joy?

231
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,500
More like anger.

232
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,600
Do you want to go inside?

233
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:04,497
Nice, right?

234
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,595
I picked out this house.

235
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,765
They let you choose?

236
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,977
They didn’t even ask me about it.

237
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,186
I suggested it.

238
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,773
If I'm forced to live
in a house with you,

239
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,900
a woman I don't even know—

240
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:23,128
Might as well make sure
the house is nice.

241
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,321
And,

242
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,698
just a consolation.

243
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:27,681
I might even like living here.

244
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,865
To be fair, you have good taste.

245
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,877
Hey, guys!

246
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,295
Did you miss your dad?

247
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,379
Come here!

248
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:43,789
Sam, this is Maple.

249
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,926
She's calm right now,

250
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,678
but don’t get her angry.

251
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,472
You’ve met Summer, right?

252
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,266
She’s the sweetest.

253
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:53,910
But she’s a bit stubborn.

254
00:14:54,948 --> 00:14:55,949
Just like you.

255
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,938
Me? Stubborn?

256
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,568
And this one, my big boy, Hail.

257
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,112
He’s just like me.

258
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,116
Has a bad attitude?
Rude and annoying?

259
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,116
No.

260
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,534
He’s nice

261
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,120
and loyal.

262
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,539
But don’t get too close to them,

263
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:17,598
they’re a bit picky with people.

264
00:15:20,024 --> 00:15:22,082
Hi, Hail!

265
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,053
Huh?

266
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,591
Oh no!

267
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:29,091
Hail!

268
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,013
Don’t do that again.

269
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,323
Well, I think he likes you.

270
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,560
He got excited.

271
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,941
So that’s the pool
slash living room area.

272
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,276
And, stairs

273
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,986
all the way to the bedrooms.

274
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,947
And there’s a lounge,
mini lounge over there,

275
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,073
underneath the stairs.

276
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,033
Then, kitchen.

277
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:53,879
Then bathroom, fridge,

278
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,209
dining area.

279
00:15:58,887 --> 00:15:59,891
So,

280
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,126
let’s check out the rooms?

281
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,420
- This house has three bedrooms.
- Good!

282
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,213
So we’re not forced
to sleep in one room.

283
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,006
Definitely.

284
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,966
You know, we really should
have separate rooms

285
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,843
and keep our interactions
to a minimum.

286
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,220
Let’s just literally
co-exist together

287
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,615
and get through this one month.

288
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,307
Whatever, you can have
the master’s bedroom.

289
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,935
No, you can have it.

290
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,145
You’re the one who
chose this house, anyway.

291
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,162
It’s yours.

292
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,772
I’ll sleep in the guest room.

293
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,234
- Well, actually, I don’t sleep.
- Really?

294
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,403
Because I can never

295
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,863
survive a day without sleep.

296
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,823
And then, welcome to med school!

297
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,158
So don’t worry,

298
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,160
our interactions are
gonna be very,

299
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,369
very minimal.

300
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,621
So when I’m studying, please,

301
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,081
don’t be noisy.

302
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,707
Me?

303
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:24,126
I’m not noisy.

304
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,464
Anyway, I need to unpack,
and I’ll have that room.

305
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:29,636
Bye.

306
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,151
Okay, seriously?

307
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,278
How am I supposed
to live like this?

308
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,416
I’m stuck in this
house with him.

309
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,460
Him! Of all people…

310
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,337
And then what?

311
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,681
So, this is the
master’s bedroom.

312
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,608
Pretend we’re a couple?

313
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,235
I barely know that guy!

314
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,321
it’s like we’re just
roommates but…

315
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,537
with a ring.

316
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,349
This is not how
I imagined my life at all!

317
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,438
Okay, one last chapter.

318
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,440
Then you can sleep.

319
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,650
One last, one last.

320
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:09,685
It’s too early!

321
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,603
Seriously?

322
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,325
You guys didn’t
let me sleep last night.

323
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,168
Good morning, baby!

324
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,006
Baby dogs.

325
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,317
Beer?

326
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,236
All these…

327
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,820
Junk food.

328
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,829
Chips for breakfast?

329
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,914
Really?

330
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:13,914
Why not?

331
00:22:14,754 --> 00:22:15,963
You want some?

332
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,031
No!

333
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,574
Oh my god.

334
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,750
Summer…

335
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,918
Bad dog!

336
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,724
Hey, Sam,
where are you staying now?

337
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:55,700
Hasn’t it been almost two weeks

338
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,602
since we last
went to your condo?

339
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,271
She’s right. Have you gone
back home already?

340
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:01,059
Should I tell them?

341
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,524
They’re my friends.

342
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,317
I’m sure they’ll understand.

343
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,282
Oh, no. Are you okay?

344
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,618
Is it me?

345
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,245
I’ve been thinking

346
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,248
that maybe I should've
loved Kalix more.

347
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,834
Maybe I should’ve
given him everything so—

348
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,752
so he wouldn’t
have cheated, right?

349
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,796
Right?

350
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,631
So it was my fault? It was all me.

351
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,508
Luna, don’t say that.

352
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:31,063
Fuck that Kalix, seriously.

353
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,974
Luna, I know it’s hard right now

354
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,143
but you have to be thankful that

355
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,020
you’re out of that relationship.

356
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,272
You deserve someone,

357
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,607
who loves you fully.

358
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,816
You deserve to be happy,

359
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,444
not trapped in something
that’s making you miserable.

360
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,865
Sounds like
that’s based on experience.

361
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,622
Fuck Kalix.

362
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,376
If you want to
share anything with us,

363
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,420
just let us know.

364
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,838
We’ll listen.

365
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,634
Maybe we can help out.

366
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,013
Should I tell them?
Should I just say it?

367
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,725
No, they’re already dealing
with their own problems.

368
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,602
I don't want to burden them.

369
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,270
I’m okay, Sev.

370
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,522
Don’t worry about me.

371
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,192
Just know that we’re
always here for you, okay?

372
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:33,465
- I’m still okay. I can still manage.
- [background chattering]

373
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,840
They don’t need to know.

374
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,036
Come on, she was already okay.

375
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,248
Now you’re making a mess.

376
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,708
- Should I go after Kalix?
- Don’t!

377
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,751
I mean, yes!

378
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,765
Look, it’s your dad.

379
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,603
I won’t be surprised
if they discover he’s actually

380
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,230
protecting rich drug lords.

381
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,064
I’m tired.

382
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,151
I don’t wanna engage in
this conversation about my dad.

383
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,945
Of course.

384
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,783
I don’t understand you, really.

385
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,827
Sometimes, you’re nice.

386
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,912
But most of the time you’re rude.

387
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,414
What did I ever do to you, huh?

388
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,124
I’m the only one
you’re treating like this.

389
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,251
I hate your dad.

390
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,587
Actually, I hate your whole family.

391
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,631
It’s fucking pathetic to be honest.

392
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,675
What about you?

393
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,802
You’re more pathetic
than my family.

394
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,802
How so?

395
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,680
I do not steal taxpayers' money.

396
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,308
Can’t you see
how pathetic you are?

397
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,101
You’re trying so hard
to impress your dad

398
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,437
just because you badly want
recognition from him.

399
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,063
And because of that,

400
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,024
you’re not enjoying
your life anymore.

401
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,110
All you do is study and
stay all night in your room.

402
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,945
You probably
don’t have any friends.

403
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,281
‘Cause your whole life revolves
around med school!

404
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,907
Get a life!

405
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,410
- Go on.
- Go on?

406
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,537
You can’t even
say no to your dad

407
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,582
just because you want
to play, “The Best Son.”

408
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,209
No wonder why your
brothers are so mad at you.

409
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,338
Because you don’t care
about how others feel.

410
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,381
Even your own brothers!

411
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,179
Shit,

412
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,389
was I too hard on him?

413
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,101
Hey, I’m—

414
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,101
For the record—

415
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,773
I fucking hate
being the best son.

416
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,858
And you know
where that shit got me?

417
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,275
Here.

418
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,612
In this house! With you!

419
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,030
And it makes me sick!

420
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:40,867
Cy, wait.

421
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,831
I need to apologize.

422
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,084
I don’t like hurting
people’s feelings.

423
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,185
I should really say sorry.

424
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,863
Can we talk now?

425
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,353
Can I talk to him now?
But he looks busy.

426
00:28:56,413 --> 00:28:57,413
Clyden?

427
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,612
Can we talk?

428
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,264
I really want to apologize.

429
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:47,285
Hi! I really want to apologize
for what I said the other day.

430
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,245
I was trying to say sorry
in person—

431
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,706
Sam? Is it a good idea?

432
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,165
What?

433
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:57,045
Just remember that the
party's set this weekend, okay?

434
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,297
All the proceeds
will go to the orphanage.

435
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,467
Guys, I’m so excited to see
how much we can raise.

436
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,844
Can I just say,
this is such a good idea.

437
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,680
I mean, a fundraising
event for charity?

438
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,975
You always manage to come up
with these great ideas, Sam!

439
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:11,976
That’s true.

440
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,021
Sam's org events are
always for a good cause.

441
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,023
You're always thinking
of ways to give back.

442
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,401
It’s giving, charity queen!

443
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,822
Well, it’s the least I can do.

444
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,450
You know what, I'm really
looking forward to this party.

445
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,077
I need to de-stress, you know.

446
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,829
I’m so stressed at home

447
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,831
and I haven’t been
sleeping well lately.

448
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,041
Wait... What home?

449
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,168
I thought you live in a condo?

450
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,671
Right. What’s going on?

451
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,005
Why are you stressed?

452
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,468
There’s just a situation

453
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,636
I need to deal with.

454
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,263
Nothing major.

455
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:49,722
Anyway, back to the party!

456
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,850
Okay. Should we get a DJ?

457
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,581
Of course!

458
00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:56,229
Guys, we will party all night!

459
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,902
I feel good.

460
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,903
Hey!

461
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,571
So good!

462
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,783
Hi!

463
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,742
Enjoy!

464
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,204
Adi! I didn’t expect
you guys to be here.

465
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,914
Well, I just got
dragged by a friend

466
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,541
so I dragged other friends, too!

467
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,333
Yo, Sam!

468
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,168
- Solid party, by the way.
- Thank you.

469
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,881
Girls! You’ve met them, right?

470
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,798
- Yes.
- ‘Sup?

471
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,550
Guys, remember them
At the party?

472
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
That’s good.

473
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,386
Let’s start?

474
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,554
Let’s drink!

475
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:30,579
Give me a drink?

476
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,268
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

477
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,899
You know…

478
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,445
I was surprised at the entrance.

479
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,655
There's a fee for outsiders.

480
00:31:47,851 --> 00:31:49,477
It’s for a good cause
though, Adi.

481
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,075
Just enjoy the night.

482
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,410
Whatever you say.

483
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,703
What time are you
leaving later?

484
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,746
Order one more!

485
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,788
Do you want more?

486
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:56,581
One more, guys!

487
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,832
Okay.
One more, one more!

488
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,083
- One more!
- One more!

489
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,084
One more, one more.

490
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,961
- Let’s go!
- Okay, game. Game!

491
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,503
Cheers!

492
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,255
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

493
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:08,328
In the club,
I can just be myself.

494
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,261
Let's go, Kalix!

495
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:10,803
Kalix—

496
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,139
No expectations from anyone.

497
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,891
Not even my parents.

498
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,393
I’m not some
Senator’s daughter here.

499
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,603
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

500
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,563
I’m just me.

501
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,439
Sam, are you okay?

502
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,572
- Who?
- Are you okay?

503
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,077
Hi, crush!

504
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,204
Girls, my former crush.

505
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,246
- She’s drunk.
- Really?

506
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,246
Yes!

507
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,920
- Do you need water?
- She needs it.

508
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,380
I’m good.

509
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,387
- Sam?
- Sam!

510
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,222
Bro!

511
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,688
Sam, watch your step.

512
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,940
Okay.

513
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,613
We’re here!

514
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,701
Sam, are you sure
about this address?

515
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,537
Fuck, is this a set up?

516
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:20,123
Bro, you’ve been watching
too many murder documentaries.

517
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,248
Hey, drunkard!

518
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,376
Is this the right address?

519
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,962
Yes. It’s right.

520
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,505
We’re here!

521
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,091
Guys! You guys, you can go na!

522
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:30,925
Go ahead.

523
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,135
I can manage myself.

524
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,052
- Are you sure?
- Go!

525
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,052
Yeah.

526
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,265
Hi!

527
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,516
Cy.

528
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,934
KJ.

529
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,286
You know this guy?

530
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,896
I’m in trouble.

531
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,896
Yes.

532
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,649
He’s a family friend.

533
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,901
Why is Sam going home here?

534
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:50,944
Who are you?

535
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,322
They’re my friends.

536
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,865
Say hi!

537
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,833
- Hi!
- Okay, so—

538
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,287
Here is my friend also.

539
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,497
He’s my ex-crush actually.

540
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,540
Hey, what the hell!

541
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:03,958
Friends.

542
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:04,667
We’re just friends.

543
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,502
Really? Are you guys
just friends?

544
00:34:08,802 --> 00:34:09,714
Just kidding.

545
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,174
- Sorry.
- You can go now.

546
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,675
Thanks.

547
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,969
Let’s go.

548
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,012
- Goodnight!
- Bye!

549
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,306
Bye, guys! Thank you so much!

550
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,933
I’ll see you soon! Bye!

551
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,814
I can go—

552
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,275
It’s okay. I can manage.

553
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,320
I take care of everyone,

554
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,447
but no one takes care of me.

555
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,074
Go back to studying!

556
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,409
I can handle myself. Okay?

557
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,078
You can’t.

558
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,966
You should’ve texted me
so I could’ve picked you up.

559
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,592
What?

560
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,222
We’re in a fight. Remember?

561
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,473
You’re mad at me.

562
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,808
I was.

563
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,644
But I’m not anymore.

564
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,982
I don’t have the time to be mad,

565
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,192
sulk,

566
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,152
or even feel anything at all.

567
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:18,065
I’m sorry about what I said.

568
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,451
Well,

569
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,287
you’re right

570
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,164
about my brothers hating me.

571
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,043
Sorry, too, for the way

572
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,337
I spoke to you,
I was pretty harsh.

573
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,048
It’s fine.

574
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,591
Maybe it’s true.

575
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,593
Maybe my dad really is corrupt,

576
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,804
and I’m just in denial.

577
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,309
Do you know why I keep
holding those charity events?

578
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,728
No, why?

579
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,648
It’s because I feel guilty

580
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,860
that my dad is likely
misusing public funds.

581
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,779
It’s the least I can do
to make up for it.

582
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,701
It’s good that you want to help.

583
00:36:02,271 --> 00:36:03,271
But

584
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,205
it would be even better
if you were doing it

585
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,624
because they
truly matter to you.

586
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,753
Not just because
you’re feeling guilty.

587
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,089
But, good job

588
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,424
on those baby steps.

589
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:20,845
I like this,

590
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,668
when we’re nice to each other.

591
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,226
Can’t we stay like this?

592
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,061
Ceasefire, please.

593
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,061
Really?

594
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,648
You’re the one who
usually starts it, though.

595
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,360
I just hope you still
remember this tomorrow.

596
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,002
Sam, wake up.

597
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,755
Sam, you have to sleep
in your room.

598
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,060
Sam!

599
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,519
Sam! Wake up, Sam!

600
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,187
Your parents
are in the driveway.

601
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,647
We need to go
to the master’s bedroom.

602
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,856
We’re supposed to sleep
next to each other there.

603
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,899
- Come on!
- Huh? Wait—

604
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,991
So they left the main door open.

605
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,409
At least the gate was locked.

606
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:28,412
- Shit!
- There’s nothing here.

607
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,685
Nothing at all!
Come on, let’s go back!

608
00:37:30,353 --> 00:37:32,500
Yes. They don’t even
have security, hon.

609
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,464
No flowers either.

610
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,466
Come on, Maui.

611
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,717
- Wait.
- What?

612
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,427
- Where’s my ring?
- Where did you put it?

613
00:37:43,452 --> 00:37:45,412
I don’t know, look for it.

614
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,889
It looks kinda bare.

615
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,313
At least it’s clean.

616
00:37:55,118 --> 00:37:55,856
Yes.

617
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,149
Which bag did you use yesterday?

618
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,689
I found it.

619
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:02,697
- Hon, let’s go up. Let’s check.
- Let’s go.

620
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:08,473
They’re still not here?

621
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:12,177
We forgot the blankets again!

622
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:13,220
Go back!

623
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:22,883
Just get everything. Let’s go.

624
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,394
Maui?

625
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,652
- Hey! Lie down already!
- Yes!

626
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,570
Wait! Ouch!

627
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,572
She turned it
into a walk-in closet.

628
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,699
They don’t have
a walk-in closet.

629
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,908
That’s too bad.

630
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,870
The door! Close it.

631
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,747
Let’s check the other room.

632
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,211
This door is so heavy.

633
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:03,140
Oh my god!

634
00:39:03,165 --> 00:39:04,508
Hon, what are they doing?

635
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,302
Mom! Dad! You’re here!

636
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,137
- Hi!
- We weren’t expecting you.

637
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:09,663
Sorry… Sorry!

638
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,600
Oh my god. Just like us
back then, hon. It’s so—

639
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,351
Let’s go, let's go.

640
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,061
- We didn’t have to see that!
- We’ll just see you down.

641
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,187
Lock the door!

642
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,108
That wasn’t part of the plan.

643
00:39:22,046 --> 00:39:24,841
We needed to look convincing.
What are you talking about?

644
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,990
So, what now?
What are we going to do?

645
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,325
Well, I don’t know either!

646
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,537
It’s fine. I’ll go down instead.

647
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,914
I’ll just tell them

648
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,916
you were busy studying all night

649
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,958
and you’re really sleepy.

650
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:38,958
Fine.

651
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,046
Don’t you wear a bra?

652
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,881
Huh?

653
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
I mean,

654
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,887
don’t get me wrong.
I don’t really care.

655
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:52,556
I just thought maybe
you forgot to wear one.

656
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,166
Fuck my life!

657
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,190
You don’t wear briefs, either.

658
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,608
So, you were checking this out?

659
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,858
Huh?

660
00:40:16,773 --> 00:40:18,582
- Hey!
- Hey.

661
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:23,254
So, here’s where we spend
most of our time together.

662
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,966
We always eat meals together.

663
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,884
- It’s our bonding moment.
- Yes.

664
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:31,382
Why are your placemats
so far apart?

665
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,893
‘Cause Cy sometimes
studies while eating,

666
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,354
and I sit over here
so I won’t distract him.

667
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,354
Yeah!

668
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,374
But you know, sweetheart,

669
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:48,606
it's really best that you
sit together when you eat,

670
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,531
so your bond
will be even stronger.

671
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,074
Don't just focus on studying!

672
00:40:52,726 --> 00:40:54,243
Don't worry about that, Auntie.

673
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:56,510
We spend a lot
of quality time together.

674
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,249
Especially last night, right?

675
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,630
You know,

676
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:11,510
I’ve noticed it feels kind of
empty around your living area.

677
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,888
You don't have any personal
touches around the house,

678
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,348
like some paintings or pictures
of the two of you together!

679
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,725
And flowers, hon!

680
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,477
It just doesn’t feel
like a home yet.

681
00:41:19,952 --> 00:41:22,246
Yes. We plan to decorate
the house, Dad.

682
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,148
We’re just busy lately.

683
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,357
Also Senator,

684
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:27,610
we’re budgeting our money

685
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,110
correctly.

686
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,242
How much do you need?

687
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,869
If you need anything, just ask.

688
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,288
About that Senator, don’t worry.

689
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,123
I’ll handle it.

690
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,667
I really like you.

691
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,420
You're a man of the house.

692
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,091
They’re still snooping around.

693
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,218
What should we do?

694
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,137
You are so beautiful!

695
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,764
Beautiful!

696
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,601
I really can't wait to marry you.

697
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:03,312
Hon.

698
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,523
I know!
I can’t wait to marry you.

699
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,402
Hon, I think we better go
and leave the kids alone.

700
00:42:11,788 --> 00:42:13,072
We better get going.

701
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,659
You know kids, we'll just
show ourselves out, okay?

702
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,119
- All right!
- Okay.

703
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,246
- Thank you.
- Let’s go! Let’s go.

704
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,372
Thank you for visiting us.

705
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,374
Take care Mom and Dad.
I’ll see you soon.

706
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,626
We’ll visit again like always.

707
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,419
Makes me jealous,

708
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,213
they’re just like how
we used to be before.

709
00:42:31,194 --> 00:42:32,236
Fuck.

710
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:34,971
It worked.
It worked, it worked.

711
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,804
What the hell is your problem?

712
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:38,889
What problem?

713
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,058
All the things you did earlier.

714
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,810
It was over the top.

715
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,018
Which one?

716
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,395
Everything!

717
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,607
“I really can't wait to marry you.”

718
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,693
Don’t tell me you
felt giddy over that.

719
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,320
Looks like you're

720
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,614
even blushing right now.

721
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,908
As if!

722
00:42:58,531 --> 00:43:01,075
What makes you think that
would work on me, huh?

723
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:02,912
For the record,

724
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,791
you’re not my type,
and I don’t like you.

725
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,713
You’re my type,

726
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,882
but I don’t like you.

727
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:16,968
What?

728
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,679
Did I hear that right?

729
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,514
I’m your type?

730
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,890
You heard me, didn’t you?

731
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,641
No need to repeat myself.

732
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:30,176
So what exactly is your type?

733
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:31,876
And how am I your type?

734
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,682
You’re so full of yourself!

735
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,864
I knew it.

736
00:43:38,245 --> 00:43:39,496
You’re such an asshole!

737
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,037
Your dad’s an asshole.

738
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,206
What?

739
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,001
I’m leaving tomorrow,

740
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,210
just to get away from you.

741
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:51,962
Then go!

742
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,548
I wasn’t asking.

743
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,682
Good morning, Ma’am.
What brings you here?

744
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,976
Hi! Is Naomi here?

745
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,770
She’s in her room, ma’am.

746
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,812
Okay, thank you.

747
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:09,812
Welcome, ma’am.

748
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,705
Hi!

749
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,333
How are you?

750
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:30,958
Why are you here?

751
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,339
I just wanna say hi.

752
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:38,951
I’m okay. You can go now.

753
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,514
By the way, that shirt
really looks cute on you.

754
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,515
You can have it.

755
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,142
And the camera?

756
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,977
I don’t use it anymore.

757
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,317
It would be better if you have it.

758
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,232
Please stop giving me
your hand-me-downs

759
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,608
like I’m a charity case.

760
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,944
Don’t you know
how offensive that is?

761
00:44:58,366 --> 00:44:59,449
I’m sorry.

762
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,323
No. Just leave!

763
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,878
Please bring all of that up
to the dressing room, okay?

764
00:45:14,903 --> 00:45:15,946
- Yes, ma’am.
- Okay.

765
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,758
Maui! Hi!

766
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,677
What are you doing here?

767
00:45:22,062 --> 00:45:23,647
- Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

768
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,265
You missed me already?

769
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,308
I just came to check on Naomi.

770
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,560
Naomi?

771
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:32,246
She’s perfectly fine.

772
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,649
She got into your school
because that’s what she wanted.

773
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,318
You know that, right?
She's just jealous.

774
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,028
Mom, don’t say that.

775
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,905
I’m just telling you the truth.

776
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,783
And mom, why did you
shop so much?

777
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,034
That’s so excessive!

778
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,662
Maui…

779
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:52,374
You know, when
you're a senator’s wife

780
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,960
you have to look glamorous.

781
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:59,631
What will people say
about me if I look pathetic?

782
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,594
But aren’t senators supposed
to work for the people?

783
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,055
You don’t need to impress them
with luxurious clothes.

784
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,477
Well, someday you’ll
understand me too.

785
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,187
And you know, Maui,

786
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:17,566
even if I shop every day,
we’ll never run out of money.

787
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,279
I can’t deal with this now, Mom.

788
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,908
Stay for lunch.

789
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,409
I can't.

790
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,385
I have somewhere I still need to go.

791
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,835
Are you home?

792
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,726
Yanna,

793
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,603
you should’ve just
waited inside;

794
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,063
that's bad for the baby.

795
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,026
Oh my gosh, the baby bump.

796
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,071
It still feels so weird.

797
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,408
What's the problem?

798
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,995
Why did you have to drive
all the way out here?

799
00:47:13,903 --> 00:47:16,364
I just need
my best friend right now.

800
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,920
So?

801
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,717
I don’t know, Yanna.

802
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,053
I really want to
get closer to Naomi,

803
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,764
but it’s like I always mess up.

804
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,226
It feels like I'm always
doing something wrong.

805
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,312
Every time I try to reach out,

806
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,106
she ends up mad at me.

807
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:40,898
I don’t get it.

808
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,985
What am I doing wrong?

809
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,238
Just try to be
understanding for now.

810
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:48,169
The day will come
when things will be okay

811
00:47:48,194 --> 00:47:49,533
between the two of you.

812
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,660
Just be patient with her.

813
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,664
You know she’s going
through a tough time, right?

814
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,250
You’re right.

815
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,212
I just need that one
breakthrough moment, you know?

816
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,506
I just need to break the ice,

817
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,384
and we’ll find something
in common to connect on.

818
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,934
What else are you
thinking about?

819
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,396
Tell me, I’ve got time.

820
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,525
Well…

821
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,419
I’ve been bothered by my dad.

822
00:48:29,054 --> 00:48:32,057
I’ve had suspicions
that he’s not all clean,

823
00:48:32,755 --> 00:48:35,245
but the news about him
lately is just getting worse.

824
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,664
Worse than I imagined.

825
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,126
And my mom isn’t helping either.

826
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,129
It seems like
she’s enjoying everything!

827
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,925
You know, my conscience
just can’t handle it anymore.

828
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,761
How can I live this kind of life

829
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,930
when everything
we have comes from—

830
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,224
Crime? From corruption?

831
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,771
What if you stop asking for
an allowance from your parents

832
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,733
first to ease your guilt?

833
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,902
Get a part-time job!

834
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,614
That’s a good idea.
I just hope they let me.

835
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,366
But I doubt it.

836
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:16,036
Also, what would
I even do, Yanna?

837
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,872
I don’t have any skills
for a part-time job, you know.

838
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:19,890
Come on!

839
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,210
There are plenty! You could
be an event planner

840
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,380
or even a bartender.

841
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,172
Stylist!

842
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:32,104
I know, right.
Speaking of fashion…

843
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,263
What if I become a model?

844
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,101
Where did that come from?

845
00:49:39,588 --> 00:49:41,548
What are you talking about?
When I was a kid,

846
00:49:41,573 --> 00:49:43,992
I had this doll who
was a fashion model,

847
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,649
and she was my favorite.

848
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,318
That's when I thought,

849
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,362
I want to be a model too,
just like her.

850
00:49:50,804 --> 00:49:51,905
Know what I mean?

851
00:49:53,173 --> 00:49:55,384
- See?
- Wait, you know what?

852
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,035
You’d actually be
perfect as a model!

853
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,829
You have so much potential,
I swear,

854
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,038
I can totally see it.

855
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,832
- Really?
- Yes!

856
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,834
You know what,
that doll story is true

857
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,502
but me becoming a model?

858
00:50:05,835 --> 00:50:07,462
Come on, Yanna!
I was just joking.

859
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,716
Come on! I was just joking
about being pregnant,

860
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,259
but look at me now.

861
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,142
Seriously though,

862
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,227
you'd be perfect as a model.

863
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,731
If they won’t let you
get a part-time job,

864
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,399
just bear with it for now.

865
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,735
You’re only one year away
from graduating.

866
00:50:31,003 --> 00:50:32,713
After that,
look for a job right away

867
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,450
so you can be financially
independent from your parents.

868
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,869
That way,
your conscience is clear.

869
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:41,996
Right.

870
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,958
Model!

871
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,251
Show your godchild!

872
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,046
- Like this?
- Stomachache.

873
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,255
- See?
- Headache.

874
00:50:50,724 --> 00:50:52,684
What else do you want?
A stiff neck?

875
00:50:54,234 --> 00:50:56,611
Thanks for listening
to all my problems,

876
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,138
even though it was sudden.

877
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,320
I feel so much better
after talking to you.

878
00:51:02,499 --> 00:51:04,542
You know, since you left,

879
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,897
I haven’t had anyone to talk to.

880
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:10,859
Our friends’ dealing with
their own problems, too.

881
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,154
And I don’t want to add to it.

882
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,163
You know what I mean?

883
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,449
And it’s fine if it’s me?

884
00:51:18,781 --> 00:51:20,971
I’m kidding! Just kidding.

885
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,040
What about Clyden?
Why don’t you open up to him?

886
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,585
He’s so annoying, Yanna!

887
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,421
Why did you have to
make me remember his face?

888
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,798
Now I’m pissed.

889
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:35,217
You know what ever since
we started living together,

890
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,207
he just—

891
00:51:36,232 --> 00:51:37,719
Living together?

892
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,971
Whoa, Samantha!

893
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,225
Are you ranting right now?

894
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,645
Hey! I’ve never seen you
like this before.

895
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,940
It’s because
I’ve never met anyone

896
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,691
who's as annoying as him.

897
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,111
If you were
in my position right now,

898
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,154
you'd probably
feel the same way.

899
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,656
Actually, you might have even
punched him already,

900
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:58,865
but I’m still calm.

901
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,700
I’m calm.

902
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,121
You know,
I haven’t even met him yet,

903
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,289
but I feel like you two
would be a good match.

904
00:52:07,746 --> 00:52:09,017
Don’t say that again.

905
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,544
You know what,
I’m just gonna go home!

906
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,712
Home?

907
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,839
To the house!

908
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,132
To him?

909
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,634
Your future husband?

910
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,052
Whatever!

911
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,472
I wonder what we’re going
to argue about tonight.

912
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,308
Just take care, okay?

913
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,977
If you need anything,
contact me.

914
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,603
I’m one call away.

915
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,273
And I can drive all the way
here again, you know.

916
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,276
Thank you.

917
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,819
I love you—

918
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,819
both.

919
00:52:37,211 --> 00:52:39,464
Your godchild
and I love you too.

920
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,367
Take care.

921
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,910
Okay. Bye!

922
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,538
- And be calm.
- I’m calm.

923
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:58,799
Hi!

924
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:01,303
Hi. Did you go drinking again?

925
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,723
No. I just visited Yanna.

926
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,933
Oh, okay. Let’s go inside.

927
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,812
Were you worried about me?

928
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,318
Why aren't you asleep yet,
and why is Summer still awake?

929
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,989
She’s waiting for her mom.

930
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,248
Sam, you need to
sleep in your room.

931
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,714
Yes, Summer.
Don't worry,

932
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,841
she’s just asleep.

933
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,844
I’ll take good care of your mom,

934
00:54:25,223 --> 00:54:26,785
and make sure she's comfortable.

935
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:30,635
To our social butterfly,

936
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,746
you have the kindest
and purest soul ever.

937
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:34,422
We love you so much.

938
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,292
You are so kind and generous.

939
00:55:42,828 --> 00:55:44,330
So, this is who you are.

940
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,023
Good morning, Clyden.

941
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,900
Good morning, Sam.

942
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,443
Sorry, I just went
inside your room

943
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,778
‘cause you weren’t answering.

944
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,365
Are you okay?

945
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,768
You look good.

946
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,495
That’s one thing
I can promise you, Sam.

947
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,374
I’ll always be honest with you.

948
00:56:19,729 --> 00:56:22,003
You’re wearing our
engagement ring today?

949
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,880
I always do.

950
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,299
Can I call you, Maui?

951
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,718
Only my family
gets to call me that.

952
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,678
Why? Am I not family?

953
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,932
I’m your future husband,
to be exact.

954
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,226
Let’s talk more.

955
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,395
Get your hands off her.

956
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:39,646
Okay.

957
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:42,107
You don’t know
anything about me.

958
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,291
It’s annoying.

959
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,323
Naomi!

960
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,991
Can you give me a hug?
