1
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:11,594
It’s okay to be afraid.

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,888
Everyone’s afraid of pain.

3
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,183
Well, does it hurt?

4
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,136
Before I forget…

5
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,313
You can keep it.

6
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,416
Then why did you
agree to meet me?

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,817
Isn’t it obvious?

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,306
I wanted to see you.

9
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:31,212
Oh my god.

10
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:32,737
You and Haze are trending.

11
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:35,260
Your photos during the fashion
show are circulating.

12
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,162
Special delivery!

13
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:39,919
It’s never gonna be enough.

14
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:41,904
It doesn’t matter what we do,

15
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:43,931
it’s never just gonna be
fucking enough.

16
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:45,311
Fuck the system, man.

17
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,546
Yeah, fuck! Fuck the system.

18
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,672
- Fuck the system.
- Fuck the system.

19
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:48,339
Fuck the system.

20
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,675
Can you spend your
next free day with me?

21
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,961
I want to see the dogs.

22
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:55,401
Sure.

23
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:57,722
They miss their mom too.

24
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,725
Hey!

25
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,587
How’s Paris?

26
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,565
Probably the best month
of my life.

27
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,568
I bought you a gift,
but I’ll give it to you later.

28
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,694
Where are we going now?

29
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,813
Did you miss me?

30
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,823
Don’t ask two questions
at the same time.

31
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,074
Give me your suitcase.

32
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,742
Did you miss me?

33
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,702
Let’s go to the
parking lot first.

34
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,871
- Come on.
- Hey! Did you miss me?

35
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,958
I have a surprise for you.

36
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,632
Hey, where are we?

37
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,136
Just wait. You’ll see.

38
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,887
- Okay.
- Okay, let’s go.

39
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,694
Slowly.

40
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,258
Step.

41
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:25,994
- Wait…
- Okay, step.

42
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,148
We’re in the stairs. Step.

43
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,608
A bit to your left.

44
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:32,467
- To my left. Okay.
- Left and left. Yeah.

45
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:36,406
Wait.

46
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,740
I’m scared. Wait.

47
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,659
Wait, hold my hand.

48
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,140
Okay.

49
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,246
Left, left.

50
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,833
I’m here. I’m here.

51
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:55,249
Where are we going?

52
00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:57,552
Is this safe?

53
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,262
Just trust me.

54
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,140
Be careful.

55
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:07,020
- Just follow my lead.
- Okay.

56
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:09,123
We’re going up, okay?

57
00:03:09,394 --> 00:03:10,248
Huh?

58
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,357
- Again.
- Again?

59
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,835
Wait.

60
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,409
Wait… Okay.

61
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,315
- Just follow my lead.
- Wait, stairs again?

62
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,474
Step.

63
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,546
One more.

64
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,394
One more.

65
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,468
Okay.

66
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,215
Almost there.

67
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:44,654
One more step.

68
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:46,601
I got you.

69
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,751
Our house.

70
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,951
So, did that answer your
question a while ago?

71
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,746
I missed you so much.

72
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,374
But what does this kiss mean?

73
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,371
It’s good you were able
to take care of this house.

74
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,831
The house still looks nice.

75
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,502
Even if so much has changed.

76
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,963
Yeah, I actually thought
about selling it

77
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,674
since it was given to us
by our parents.

78
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,135
But at the same time,

79
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,430
I didn’t want to let go
of our memories here.

80
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:32,305
I agree.

81
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:35,162
We really do have a lot
of memories here.

82
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,563
Yeah.

83
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,404
I’m leaving for New York.

84
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,574
Let’s just make the most of
the time that you’re still here.

85
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,656
Hey.

86
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,581
Are you okay?
Is something bothering you?

87
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,128
Do you remember

88
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,589
what happened that night?
When you got drunk at my condo?

89
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,551
What happened that night?

90
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,470
About our conversation
back then.

91
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,222
What did we talk about?

92
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,516
Seriously?

93
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,436
No, I’m just joking.

94
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,063
I remember everything.

95
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,400
- Everything?
- Everything.

96
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,570
I remember everything
we talked about.

97
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,491
And… I also remember you said

98
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,953
you’re moving to New York soon.

99
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,875
So, you know that I’m leaving…

100
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,919
Why did you still kiss me, then?

101
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,212
What did that mean?

102
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,549
Because I still have
feelings for you, Sam.

103
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,968
Even if we can’t be together.

104
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,345
That’s why

105
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,265
I just want to enjoy
every moment

106
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,625
with you while you’re still here.

107
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,211
I practiced a lot.

108
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,670
I’m excited to eat.

109
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,256
It feels so good
to be back here, Sam.

110
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,516
Wow! You really look
like a model, Sam!

111
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,060
Try a different pose.

112
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,190
I miss you.

113
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,783
We have a gift for
my favorite sister.

114
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,160
Thank you, Sam.
Thank you, Clyden.

115
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,345
Merry Christmas.

116
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,247
More years to spend together.

117
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,581
I’m claiming it.

118
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,334
I’ll always be your
number one fan, Sam.

119
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:06,837
Hey.

120
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,383
Why are you still up?

121
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,176
You’re not sleepy yet?

122
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,721
I don’t feel like sleeping yet.

123
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,393
Staying up late
isn’t good, you know.

124
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,856
I just want to make
the most of my stay here,

125
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,651
to remember all the
good memories in this house—

126
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:29,986
With you…

127
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,072
and with Naomi.

128
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,534
Hey…

129
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,830
I miss her, too.

130
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,748
And I’m sure

131
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,959
she’s in a better place now.

132
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,059
Can you sleep with me?

133
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,313
Huh? Why?

134
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,899
I just want someone
beside me tonight.

135
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,137
Can you cuddle with me?

136
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,683
Yeah, sure.

137
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,487
Is this okay?

138
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,539
I guess.

139
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,208
Sam, can you stop
moving, please?

140
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,109
I’m sorry.

141
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:12,968
‘Cause your behind
is brushing on my—

142
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,945
front.

143
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:34,445
Samantha, do not think of
erotic things right now!

144
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,596
You need to sleep!

145
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,990
Good morning.

146
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,991
Morning.

147
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,746
You’re up early.

148
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,248
I couldn’t sleep.

149
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:31,142
I probably only got around
four hours of sleep.

150
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,086
Why? Are you okay?
Are you sick?

151
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,923
It’s all your fault.

152
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,551
What did I do to him?

153
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,511
I just slept.

154
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,889
I can’t remember
doing anything.

155
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,511
Was I moving around a lot?

156
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,143
Did I sleep talk?

157
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,149
Did I say something offensive
before we went to sleep?

158
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,194
Then how is it my fault?

159
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:06,437
Spoon?

160
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,956
Maybe I’m just not used
to sleeping next to someone.

161
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,699
Maybe.

162
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,881
Eat up. We’re gonna
walk the dogs.

163
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:28,253
Is it good?

164
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,859
She’s really enjoying herself.

165
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,320
Yeah, Solar loves walking.

166
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,117
Cy, can I ask you something?

167
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,156
Yeah, sure.

168
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,417
How did Summer pass away?

169
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,879
Well, she was already old.

170
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,840
And after giving birth to Solar,

171
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,299
that’s when she really
started getting weaker.

172
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,052
Actually, Solar was supposed
to have a sibling, too.

173
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,388
But that one passed away.

174
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,563
Did you know that
during Summer’s last breath,

175
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,648
she was waiting for you.

176
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,984
What?

177
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,282
Are you tired?

178
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,209
Do you want to rest now?

179
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,296
You're still waiting for her?

180
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,582
I'm sorry, Summer.
Mom can't go home.

181
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:56,169
It’s okay, Solar.
Your mom’s gonna be fine.

182
00:14:56,817 --> 00:14:58,110
It’s okay.

183
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,531
I should have been there.

184
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,575
I’m sorry I wasn’t.

185
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,883
It’s okay.

186
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,787
She died happily.

187
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,748
Our good girl.

188
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,876
And I’m sure
she’s at peace now, too.

189
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,630
And she left another angel here.

190
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,509
You know what, she reminds me
so much of Summer.

191
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,639
Yeah. Solar, my baby.

192
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,934
She’s a sweet reminder
that I once had Summer.

193
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,404
Yup? Hello?

194
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,327
Yeah, okay.
Let’s finalize that.

195
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,120
I’m sure Yanna will like it.

196
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,291
Okay. Yeah, bye.

197
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,921
That was Luna. She just needed
to confirm something.

198
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,091
Yanna’s gonna have
a bachelorette party.

199
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,843
Can I come?

200
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,304
What? Of course not!

201
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,390
That’s for girls only.

202
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,101
Hiro’s having
a bachelor party too

203
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,478
and I’m sure
there’ll be girls there.

204
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,773
It’s the same with Yanna,
so all’s fair.

205
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,361
If you’re inviting other men,
then invite me too.

206
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,114
No way.
You don’t get it.

207
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,198
We will have fun with—

208
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,992
Why? Can’t you have fun with me?

209
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,579
It’s not like that.

210
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,165
Okay.

211
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,460
Well, have fun and
enjoy the party.

212
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,840
Just behave and promise me
you’ll be a good girl.

213
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,384
Or else?

214
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,762
Or else,

215
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,348
you’re gonna
have fun with me too.

216
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,625
They’re here.

217
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,648
- Be careful.
- You walk too fast.

218
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:13,924
Okay, I’m sorry.

219
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,160
Wait, I’ll just close the door.

220
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,411
Okay…

221
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,412
Okay.

222
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,707
You’re making me nervous.
What is this, Samantha?

223
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:25,643
Don’t be nervous.
You’re safe with me, come on.

224
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,379
Okay, stand here.

225
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,273
Are you ready?

226
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,717
What is this? What is this?

227
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:33,625
Okay.

228
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,888
Can I open my eyes now?

229
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,474
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

230
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,144
Welcome to your
bachelorette party!

231
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,271
Bitch, I thought I got kidnapped!

232
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,899
You guys really went all out.

233
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,860
As if you’re not
used to being blindfolded.

234
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,820
Why? You’re not Hiro,
you know?

235
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,859
Excuse me!

236
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,118
Seriously, guys!
You really went all out!

237
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,497
I don’t even know how
I deserve friends like you.

238
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,248
I love you guys!

239
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,917
- I love you too!
- I love you too!

240
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,461
You know, if younger
Yanna heard this,

241
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,880
she’d be grossed out. She was
so grumpy back then.

242
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,132
Okay guys, enough with
the drama. Let’s party!

243
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,343
- Yes.
- But, before we start…

244
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,679
You’re gonna love this. Look!

245
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,889
- Okay, okay.
- What’s this?

246
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,516
You need to put this on.

247
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,059
- Wow!
- Oh!

248
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,435
Are you serious?

249
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,520
Wait, not just that.
This too.

250
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,813
Oh my gosh.

251
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,315
This is the best part!

252
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,069
Is this it, guys?
Come on, this is too easy.

253
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,535
What’s going on?

254
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,282
Are you ready?

255
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,535
Now blow.

256
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,495
Oh my god!

257
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,287
- Blow it!
- Blow it!

258
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:42,788
Blow it!

259
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,958
- Just the tip! Just the tip!
- Just the tip! Just the tip!

260
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,634
Is it good?

261
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,511
You guys are too much!
This is way too sweet!

262
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,390
Oh my god. Here it comes!

263
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,850
Here it comes!

264
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,105
Oh my god!

265
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,815
- What is this? Where’s Hiro?
- Yes!

266
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,402
Oh my god, this is too much!

267
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,865
Girl, just enjoy it!

268
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,076
Hiro’s having
fun too! It’s okay.

269
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,995
Lower.

270
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,204
- Oh, that’s good!
- Lower.

271
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,833
Girl, you still have
icing on your lips!

272
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,376
Wipe it off!

273
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,590
- Oh my god!
- What are you guys doing?

274
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,508
Take it off, good sir!

275
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,431
- Via, look!
- He’s too much.

276
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,142
- He’s showing off his abs!
- Hiro… Hiro…

277
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,602
Oh my god!

278
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,562
They’re so wild.

279
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,648
Okay, shake it. Shake it!

280
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,945
Haze: The party’s
starting here.

281
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,740
I invited your ex.
It’s a little unfair for him

282
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,534
to just let you have fun
on your own, don’t you think?

283
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,037
Sam: What?
You better make sure

284
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:09,291
he will go home safely! Do not
let him drink too much!

285
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,340
Haze: He could say
the same to you.

286
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,425
We’re just on the
other side of the hallway,

287
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,844
but follow the rules.
You can’t go here,

288
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,346
and they can’t go there.

289
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,350
Everybody, be quiet!

290
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,270
I’m drunk.

291
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:36,840
It’s fine! Go girl! Enjoy it!

292
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,084
Yes!

293
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,051
- Wait! What’s happening?
- Oh my god!

294
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,177
I’m bleeding, Sam!

295
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,137
- Huh?
- Oh my god, oh my god.

296
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,390
Boys, stop! Stop!
You can leave now.

297
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,391
Go, go, go, go!

298
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,809
Hold on.
Wait, hold on.

299
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,354
What’s happening?
I’m so dizzy.

300
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,355
Wait.

301
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,815
- Girls.
- What’s going on?

302
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,816
She needs help.

303
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,359
Don’t touch it.

304
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,527
Oh my god. Wait.

305
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,074
Sam: Sorry to disturb you.

306
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:31,839
Do you have a first aid kit
or something?

307
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:35,577
Cy: Yeah, I have one in my bag. Why?

308
00:21:35,605 --> 00:21:37,921
Sam: There’s a minor accident
here in the girls’ suite.

309
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,089
We need help.

310
00:21:40,752 --> 00:21:41,878
Cy: On my way.

311
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,902
Okay, okay.

312
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,637
Don’t worry.
Help is on the way.

313
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,139
That’s fine. Just don’t touch it.

314
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,682
Don’t touch it.

315
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,144
Guys. How are you?

316
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,300
What happened?

317
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,188
She’s wounded.

318
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,857
- Yanna! How are you?
- Hi!

319
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,607
What’s he doing here?

320
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,692
He’ll treat—

321
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,737
Okay, let’s go now.

322
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,780
- Let’s go, you’re drunk.
- Hey!

323
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,116
You’re taking her home already?

324
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,659
Yeah, she’s drunk.

325
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,703
Guys, you can continue
the party, okay?

326
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,705
Enjoy!

327
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,956
No—

328
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,625
Be careful.

329
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,502
We’ll be in the bedroom, guys.
You can take care of yourselves.

330
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,378
Okay.

331
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,172
You too?

332
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,215
Yeah. I’m sorry, I’m heading
to another party.

333
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,925
- But—
- Can I see?

334
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,722
Just what in the world were
you doing to end up like that?

335
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,931
Why do you care?

336
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,476
Just go to the nearest hospital.

337
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,435
Just to be sure.

338
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,436
Okay.

339
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,604
All right. I’ll take her there.

340
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,651
Wait! Hey, let me go.

341
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,652
Wait.

342
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,338
Her sh—

343
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,614
Her shoes.

344
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,079
They’re all gone.

345
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,251
So,

346
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,464
are you going to sleep here?

347
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,593
Well, I have my own hotel room,

348
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,346
but I think I’ll take
care of the girls.

349
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,223
Who knows what might happen.

350
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,892
You know, just

351
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,853
call somebody else
to take care of them.

352
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,106
And then let’s go to your room.

353
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,983
I don’t think I can drive
home anymore.

354
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,788
Oh shit.

355
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,668
Just call somebody else.

356
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,173
Okay.

357
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:53,807
Hey, Samantha.
What time do you think it is?

358
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,184
Sev! Sev! This is urgent.

359
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,811
Can you please
come to the hotel?

360
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,310
Yeah, and please take care of—

361
00:23:59,335 --> 00:24:02,124
Luna! Via, ‘cause—

362
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,733
What am I, a babysitter?

363
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,734
Why? What happened
over there?

364
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,892
Well, they’re super drunk and
I can’t look after them, so—

365
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:11,074
Damn it! I’m sure
Luna’s too far gone.

366
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,411
Go ahead, keep drinking
until you pass out!

367
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,038
Next time, I’ll let St. Peter
watch over her!

368
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,165
Okay, I’ll just get ready.

369
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,500
Yes! Thanks, Sev.
Please, please come here.

370
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,460
Take care.

371
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,509
No, no…

372
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,754
- Okay! I’ll wait for you, okay?
- Oh my god.

373
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:25,792
Take care!

374
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,413
Did you have fun?

375
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,583
Yeah. It was chaotic.

376
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,086
But you know what?
I feel bad for Yanna.

377
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,173
I don’t even know
if she liked it or not.

378
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,260
Did you have fun
with the macho dancers?

379
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,098
I don’t mind.

380
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,554
As long as you
had fun with them.

381
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,648
Did you?

382
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,822
Yes.

383
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,204
Well, do you mind
extending the fun with me?

384
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,612
Do you wanna shower with me?

385
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,190
Maureen.

386
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,695
I love you.

387
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,656
I still do.

388
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,832
Eyes on the camera, Sam!

389
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,626
Good. Nice!

390
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,758
You’re doing great.

391
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,178
Energy, Sam. Energy.
More energy!

392
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,440
Okay, continue.

393
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,568
Eyes on the camera.

394
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,281
We’re good. Thank you.

395
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,284
Sam, we’ve got the shot!

396
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,161
See the photos?

397
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,512
Nice!

398
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,581
I don’t think I’ve seen
you like this before.

399
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,793
You’re really shining today.

400
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,836
You seem inspired.

401
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,296
In love or dating?

402
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,507
I’m just happy.

403
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,133
Thanks for today.

404
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,301
Thanks as well.

405
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,929
Hold on a sec, okay?
I’ll just fix my stuff there.

406
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,138
- Yeah. I’ll see you.
- Okay, bye.

407
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,139
I’ll see you later.

408
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,148
Sam: I’m flying to
Coron this weekend

409
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,483
for Yanna and Hiro’s wedding.

410
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,612
I’m staying there for three days.
You really can’t come?

411
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,115
Cy: I’m sorry. I really
want to, but I can’t go.

412
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,035
Sam: It’s okay.
I knew that already,

413
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,120
but I still wanted
to ask you.

414
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:36,847
Cy: Enjoy the wedding.
Cy: Take care, love.

415
00:30:38,198 --> 00:30:41,993
Sam! Your New York
rental apartment application

416
00:30:42,018 --> 00:30:43,019
got approved!

417
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:45,088
So, what now? Should we
pay the down payment?

418
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,264
Part of me wants to stay in Manila.

419
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,598
To be with Cy.

420
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,375
To hold on to what we have.

421
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,893
But then,

422
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,144
there’s New York.

423
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:58,147
With all its possibilities
and opportunities.

424
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,776
Send the landlord
the holding deposit for now

425
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,695
to reserve the apartment.

426
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,696
Okay.

427
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,468
This is it! It’s your
wedding day. Are you nervous?

428
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,846
Who wouldn’t be nervous?

429
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,685
You know, I really thought
you’d be the first one

430
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,186
among us to get married.

431
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,397
I probably wouldn’t be
this nervous

432
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,733
if you had already
gone through it.

433
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,569
Well, shit happens.

434
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,780
Just enjoy your wedding day
with the love of your life.

435
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,463
You waited a long
time for this, right?

436
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,869
And lucky you,
you found someone to love,

437
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,121
and who’ll love you
for the rest of your life.

438
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:57,441
And then Avi came as a bonus.

439
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,878
In a life filled with
unexpected twists and turns,

440
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,339
it’s a miracle when two people

441
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,800
who truly love each other
make it to their wedding day.

442
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:10,593
Where did you
even get that line?

443
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,890
But you’re right.

444
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,310
It feels so good knowing
we’re finally getting married.

445
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,749
Right?

446
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,897
So instead of worrying,

447
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,732
just put your trust
in your relationship.

448
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,734
Everything will work out.

449
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,615
I’m so glad you’re my maid
of honor and my best friend.

450
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,244
Out of all the maids of honor,
you’re the first honor.

451
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,913
- I know, right?
- I know.

452
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,252
You look so gorgeous!

453
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,588
Everything is on point!

454
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,507
Yeah, such a goddess.

455
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,466
Thanks, guys.

456
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,927
You know what, I still can’t
believe Yanna’s old motto,

457
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,596
“flirt responsibly,”
actually brought her here.

458
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,641
You’ll be officially
a wife in an hour!

459
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,187
Yanna, I know there’s going to
be “kiss the bride” part later.

460
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,314
There are kids,
so keep it PG, okay?

461
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,733
Hey, I can’t promise that.

462
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,485
After all, I’ll be married already.

463
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,366
Thank you, guys.

464
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,077
I may be the first one
to get married—

465
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,912
but I’m claiming it now.

466
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,957
All of us will get married

467
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,002
and have our own
happily ever afters

468
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,463
with people who truly love us.

469
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,344
Group hug?

470
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,096
Come here.

471
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,473
Come here, you talk too much.

472
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,230
- Guys, let’s take a photo!
- So pretty!

473
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,442
One, two, three, smile!

474
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,582
Hello, Princess.

475
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,753
So, are you back together?

476
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,451
Are you two the
next ones to get married?

477
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,050
Not exactly. Why?

478
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:14,638
Are you waiting for us
to get back together?

479
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:16,391
Are you playing cupid now?

480
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,432
That’s not my thing at all.

481
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,184
I just think that

482
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,520
when two people
clearly love each other,

483
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:28,399
they should stop with all the
bullshit and just be together.

484
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,604
Right?

485
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,780
Ma’am, Sir.
We’re about to start,

486
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,448
so please fall in line.

487
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,095
Look at Sam,

488
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,223
she’s already in tears
just seeing Yanna walk.

489
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,683
You’d think she’s
the one getting married.

490
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,779
This is it Yannah.
I’m so happy for you.

491
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,346
When I look back at my life,

492
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,724
I realize

493
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,520
all the moments I cherish
the most are with you.

494
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,651
And I want to spend
the rest of my days

495
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,989
creating more important
memories with you and Avi.

496
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,494
I know life is far from perfect,

497
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,581
but I promise you this, Yanna.

498
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:59,462
I will love you more
than any amount of distance

499
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,963
that will keep us apart.

500
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,350
I remember when I was a kid—

501
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,687
I didn’t believe in true love.

502
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,984
And I believed

503
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,612
no one would ever love me.

504
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,158
But deep inside my heart,

505
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:36,374
I always wanted
to be loved and seen.

506
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,504
Then all of a sudden,

507
00:39:42,455 --> 00:39:43,623
you came into my life.

508
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,552
Who are you checking out?

509
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,603
Right there.

510
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,899
OMG, girl. That’s Hiro!

511
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,684
You changed everything

512
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,022
I believed about love.

513
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,066
Because of you,

514
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,821
I started to believe in love.

515
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,077
You made love look so easy.

516
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,601
And from this day on,

517
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,563
I’ll keep reminding you

518
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,774
how much I love you—

519
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,279
how much Avi and I love you.

520
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,619
I promise,

521
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,748
it’s only going to be you
for the rest of my life.

522
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,340
We will love you

523
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,760
above and beyond

524
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,597
what airplanes could ever fly.

525
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,478
Ashianna Fernandez
and Avrielle Haven,

526
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,367
I love you above and beyond

527
00:41:24,392 --> 00:41:26,311
airplanes could ever fly.

528
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,989
I pronounce you

529
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,659
husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride.

530
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,515
More!

531
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,395
- More!
- More!

532
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,651
More!

533
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,194
- More!
- More!

534
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,202
One more!

535
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,744
- More!
- More!

536
00:42:20,343 --> 00:42:21,330
More!

537
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:10,187
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

538
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,797
Please help me welcome

539
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,799
Samantha Maureen Vera

540
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,553
to say some heartfelt words
for the newlyweds.

541
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,083
Well, hey to the both of you.

542
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,278
So, I don’t know how to start.

543
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,781
I just want to tell you, Hiro, that

544
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,908
I’m Avrielle’s first dad.

545
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,397
You know what,

546
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,831
I actually hated you back then

547
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,041
because I saw how
Yanna cried her eyes out

548
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:52,527
every night because of you.

549
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,215
Ever since you started that

550
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,259
little deal between
the two of you,

551
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,928
I already knew that she
would fall for you because

552
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:00,929
who wouldn’t?

553
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,516
But she wanted to prove
that she was strong.

554
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,143
Well, she’s an idiot.

555
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,980
But even if she is,

556
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,691
she loves you so much.

557
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,364
Hiro, please take care
of my best friend.

558
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,784
Not that you need me
to remind you, but

559
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,287
she’s very special to me.

560
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,832
She may look so
strong on the outside,

561
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,418
but she’s really fragile.

562
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:33,184
So,

563
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,215
please stop making her
cry because of pain.

564
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,260
Well, you can make her
cry for other reasons.

565
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,356
Kidding aside,

566
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,976
I wish genuine happiness
for both of you.

567
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,520
Raise Avrielle well.

568
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,649
And know that I’ll always
be here for you

569
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,984
if you need any help, okay?

570
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,611
Cheers!

571
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:58,987
Cheers!

572
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,739
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

573
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:01,746
Cheers!

574
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,703
Go, Auntie!

575
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,013
Wow.

576
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,082
Thank you, Sam.

577
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,817
Thank you.

578
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,919
I love you, my best friend.

579
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,383
I love you.

580
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,681
Thank you so much for being
with me on this journey.

581
00:45:28,363 --> 00:45:29,697
I’m always here for you.

582
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:33,517
I’m always here for
both of you and for Avi,

583
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:35,085
if you need any help. Okay?

584
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,426
Come here, you.

585
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,568
You had a rough time
or something?

586
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,988
Well, it was kind of rough.

587
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,576
He was rough.

588
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,419
Thank you for trusting me.

589
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,257
Only a few friends and
family know I’m bisexual.

590
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,843
You should feel honored.

591
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,682
Cy doesn’t know?

592
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,606
No.

593
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,145
It’s not like
I’m hiding it from them.

594
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,481
But if they asked,

595
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,775
I would’ve answered honestly.

596
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,361
I do get seen with
other men a lot.

597
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,488
Yeah, you’re right.

598
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,282
Why? Why’d you ask?

599
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,076
Are you jealous of me?

600
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,872
I know I’m hot and a flirt, but

601
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,208
I don’t like your guy.

602
00:47:17,104 --> 00:47:18,480
Dude, I have a type, okay?

603
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,965
Really? So what’s your type?

604
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,343
In girls or guys?

605
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:32,307
Well, in girls,
it’s pretty simple.

606
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:36,942
You.

607
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,941
I liked you at first glance.

608
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,956
Did you really like me, or

609
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:47,484
did you just want
a one-night stand back then?

610
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,284
I genuinely liked you.

611
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,203
Honestly,

612
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,206
if I hadn’t met Clyden first,

613
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,166
I would’ve fallen for you.

614
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,252
But it’s a good thing

615
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,004
I met him before you.

616
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,565
You probably
would’ve just hurt me

617
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,216
or left me in tears.

618
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,594
You’re right.

619
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,263
I’m not the type for
a long-term relationship.

620
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,559
What about you? Are you okay?

621
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,106
Is something bothering you?

622
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,668
Well,

623
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,613
I’m leaving for
New York in a few weeks.

624
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,865
I want to settle down there.

625
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,076
There are more
opportunities there, and

626
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,038
I won’t have to keep flying back
and forth anymore.

627
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,751
I’m just really
worried about Clyden.

628
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,753
I’m sure he can manage.

629
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,673
I heard he’s busy
with residency.

630
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,426
So even if you stay,

631
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,387
your relationship
would still be stuck.

632
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,766
That guy’s passionate
about his dreams.

633
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,101
And so are you.

634
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,938
Time isn’t on your side yet.

635
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:04,983
It just

636
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,611
pains me to leave him again.

637
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,530
I wish I hadn’t
come back at all if

638
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,157
I was only going
to leave him again, right?

639
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,410
But he said

640
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,746
I should still hold on to him,

641
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,039
even if

642
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,749
I will leave him in the end.

643
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,377
Well, if he knows about it,

644
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,003
then he should be ready.

645
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,674
You are your own woman.

646
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,051
If you want to settle
somewhere else,

647
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:32,361
then go.

648
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,393
Do it.

649
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,138
It’s your life.

650
00:49:37,465 --> 00:49:38,478
You’re right.

651
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,729
It’s selfish to actually
make him wait for me, right?

652
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,066
Maybe I should just let him go

653
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,860
if I don’t even
plan on coming back.

654
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,696
Well,

655
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,865
I don’t know. I’m not him.

656
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,910
But if I were really
in love with you,

657
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,621
you wouldn’t even
have to ask me to wait.

658
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,581
I’d wait for you.

659
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,420
Maybe I’m just
fucking dumb like that.

660
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,850
Thank you for coming.

661
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,851
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

662
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,852
Thank you.

663
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,342
Take care.

664
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,188
Well?

665
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,898
The conversation seems
a bit too serious.

666
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,191
Let’s wait for them.

667
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,192
Yeah.

668
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,236
- Finally.
- Long live the newlyweds!

669
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,489
Congratulations, you guys!

670
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,699
Thank you.

671
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,950
All right, let’s play!

672
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,248
Let's go!

673
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,494
Truth or dare.

674
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,006
Okay.

675
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,122
- Let’s go.
- Game.

676
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,248
Awesome!

677
00:50:51,773 --> 00:50:53,025
- Truth!
- Go!

678
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,359
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

679
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,490
Are you and Haze dating?

680
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:57,633
No!

681
00:50:57,658 --> 00:50:59,409
How lame, that was easy.

682
00:50:59,701 --> 00:51:00,994
Okay. My turn.

683
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,143
Who’s next?

684
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:07,856
Yanna.

685
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,232
- Yanna.
- Yanna.

686
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,525
Okay, truth!

687
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,110
- So, truth?
- Oo. Truth, truth.

688
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:12,903
Okay.

689
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,404
Who was your first kiss?

690
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,436
Ouch!

691
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,545
Who?

692
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:22,943
I’ll just drink.

693
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,168
I poured a lot
just for you guys.

694
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,961
Okay, drink.

695
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,755
- Bottoms up.
- Drink, drink, drink!

696
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:35,759
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

697
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,842
That was quick.

698
00:51:39,123 --> 00:51:40,131
Bitch!

699
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,015
Okay, next!

700
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,774
Me again? What the heck?

701
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,234
Okay, fine.

702
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:53,490
Truth!

703
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,779
Okay, you already did truth earlier.

704
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,317
Go for a dare this time.

705
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,426
Hey!

706
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,411
- No coaching.
- Okay, okay.

707
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,514
How about this?

708
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:08,959
Send an extreme confession to
the last person you messaged.

709
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,710
Something you haven’t
told anyone, okay?

710
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,740
Even to Yanna.

711
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,090
Go on.

712
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,817
- The last person.
- Go on.

713
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,843
Fine, whatever.

714
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,808
Sam: I still want to marry you
and have kids with you.

715
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,064
What the heck,
that’s so wholesome!

716
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,401
Come on, it’s an
extreme confession.

717
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,412
Okay.

718
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,574
- Oh, he replied immediately.
- What did he say?

719
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,118
I’d rather read it by myself.

720
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,953
- Excuse me.
- What?

721
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,037
That’s unfair.

722
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,956
- Let us in on it.
- Such a buzzkill.

723
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,029
Why did you even play?

724
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,005
Cy: Are you drunk?

725
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,924
Sam: It’s a confession.

726
00:53:00,275 --> 00:53:01,639
Cy: Do you still love me?

727
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:08,560
Cy: Never mind. Don’t say it.
It’s better this way.

728
00:53:10,803 --> 00:53:13,765
Now that I’ve confessed,
what’s next?

729
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,817
The decision is still on me.

730
00:53:18,043 --> 00:53:19,053
Who’s next?

731
00:53:20,193 --> 00:53:21,201
Your turn again!

732
00:53:22,048 --> 00:53:23,383
Someone else should be next.

733
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,160
- Okay, someone else.
- Okay, let’s go.

734
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,536
- This is the last.
- Go.

735
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,042
Okay, for real this time.

736
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,710
- Truth or Dare?
- Dare?

737
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,463
Send—

738
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,607
Wow!

739
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,721
Avi, be good to Auntie, okay?

740
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,732
Yes!

741
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,683
We have lots of goodies for
you when we get back.

742
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,311
I love you, mommy and daddy!

743
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,896
We love you, Avi!

744
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:57,234
All right you guys,
you might miss your flight.

745
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,670
Thanks a lot, Sam.

746
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,803
Anytime. Enjoy your honeymoon.

747
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,074
- Bye now.
- Bye!

748
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,993
Take care, guys.

749
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:07,928
Bye.

750
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:10,956
Eat your ice cream.

751
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,332
Is it yummy?

752
00:54:12,464 --> 00:54:13,465
Yes.

753
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,711
Auntie, can we go somewhere too?

754
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,295
Okay, baby.

755
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,341
But let’s just do
it tomorrow, okay?

756
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,717
It’s a bit late now.

757
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,639
Okay, eat your ice cream.

758
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,144
Cy: Hi. You’re back
in Manila?

759
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,732
Sam: Yes, I arrived a while ago.

760
00:54:40,295 --> 00:54:42,732
Cy: Can we meet
tomorrow morning?

761
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:44,384
I’ll be at the hospital.

762
00:54:45,965 --> 00:54:49,022
Sam: Okay. I’m going to bring Avi.

763
00:54:49,054 --> 00:54:51,537
She’s staying with me for a few days.

764
00:54:54,642 --> 00:54:57,318
Cy: All right. See you.

765
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:03,654
It’s going to be the last few
times we’ll see each other.

766
00:55:17,534 --> 00:55:19,245
That’s good. Thank you.

767
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,787
Hey.

768
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,867
Avi, do you remember
Doctor Clyden Ramirez?

769
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,577
Hello, Doc!

770
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,430
Hi, Avi.

771
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:33,581
Oh, hi.

772
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,001
Daddy said you only
kiss people you like.

773
00:55:38,086 --> 00:55:39,654
Do you like Auntie?

774
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,342
Yeah.

775
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,672
I like your Auntie.

776
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:44,178
Is that okay?

777
00:55:44,548 --> 00:55:45,591
It’s okay.

778
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,652
Do you want to know a secret?

779
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,554
I will become just like you!

780
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,639
Really? You want to become
a doctor too?

781
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,640
Yes!

782
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:57,103
I thought you wanted to be
a pilot like your daddy?

783
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,439
I will be a pilot-doctor!

784
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,772
Okay.

785
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,652
But if you want
to be a pilot-doctor,

786
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,364
you need to eat
a lot of veggies

787
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,824
and get plenty of sleep
so you can stay healthy.

788
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,284
- Okay?
- Okay, Uncle.

789
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:14,788
I’ll get lots of sleep
and eat many veggies.

790
00:56:15,668 --> 00:56:17,128
Uncle?

791
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:22,962
How was the wedding?

792
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:24,923
It was so beautiful.

793
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,384
I cried many tears of joy.

794
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,470
We played truth or dare, too.

795
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:31,943
Yeah.

796
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,266
Is that why you sent that message?

797
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:40,105
Yes. But honestly, I felt
that way nonetheless.

798
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,983
Auntie, you said we’re
going somewhere fun.

799
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,529
Yes, baby. We’re going
there later, okay?

800
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,282
I’m free for
the rest of the day.

801
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,701
Can Uncle join you guys?

802
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,537
- You want to?
- Both!

803
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,746
Yeah. Both?

804
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:57,414
- Both?
- Yeah!

805
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,415
- Both of us?
- Yeah.

806
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:09,217
Auntie, thank you for bringing
me here. I’m so excited!

807
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,427
Really?

808
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,719
Hold on, guys, go there.

809
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,279
Okay.

810
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:16,015
Excuse me. Reservation
for Samantha Vera.

811
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,142
- Yeah.
- Okay.

812
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,394
She’s so excited.

813
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,826
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go, baby.

814
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,148
Be careful.

815
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,533
I got the cheese!

816
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,746
Good job, baby!

817
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,040
Auntie’s not getting anything!

818
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,772
- Teach Auntie how to do it.
- Go, I want more!

819
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,843
I got that fair and square.

820
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:54,846
She got one.

821
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,056
We got four both. It’s a tie.

822
00:57:57,056 --> 00:58:00,852
- Go, Auntie! Go!
- Go, go!

823
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,103
Go! Auntie, go!

824
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,231
There you go.

825
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,459
We’re awesome!

826
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,679
Auntie, I wanna do the bazooka.

827
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,890
Maybe next time baby, okay?

828
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,309
Hey, how about the goo catcher?

829
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,144
Okay!

830
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,905
Samantha Vera?

831
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,025
OMG. It really is Samantha Vera!

832
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,569
- Can we get a photo with you?
- It really is her!

833
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,196
- Can we get a photo?
- Yeah, sure.

834
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,532
- Just don’t include them.
- Avi, come on. Stay here.

835
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,553
Thank you.

836
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:58,998
Let’s go.

837
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:00,370
- Wait a minute.
- Oh no.

838
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,371
It went blank.

839
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:07,585
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

840
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,213
But who’s that with her?

841
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,091
Yeah, that’s not Haze.

842
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,678
How did you two meet?
Are you together?

843
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,723
Avi, come here.

844
00:59:17,748 --> 00:59:20,056
Are you the son
of Christopher Ramirez?

845
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,308
The owner of Ramirez Medical?

846
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,644
The one who topped
the board exams, right?

847
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:29,315
Samantha Vera, are you
cheating on Haze Juarez?

848
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,870
Doc, you’re trending
online right now.

849
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,413
I don’t know what
you’re referring to,

850
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,081
but sir, can we please
focus on your health?

851
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:30,585
We both know you’re
really the useless one

852
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,061
between the two of us.

853
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,241
Fuck you. Asshole!

854
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,946
We’re not even close
with the Vera family anymore

855
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:42,890
and we even cancelled
the engagement of our son.

856
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,100
Why aren't you answering me?

857
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,477
I’m sorry.

858
01:00:49,048 --> 01:00:50,633
He’s already
struggling with his life

859
01:00:50,658 --> 01:00:53,536
without our support,
and a scandal like this

860
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:56,361
will burden him even more.
So please don’t add to it.

861
01:00:58,229 --> 01:00:59,498
If you find someone else,

862
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,826
I hope she can truly make you happy.

863
01:01:07,472 --> 01:01:10,141
Don’t cry now, baby.

864
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,417
You’re making me cry, too.

865
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,670
Let me hold you, bestie.

866
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,214
You’re making us all cry.
