1
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,433
Hey—

2
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:22,039
I’m sorry I didn't answer
your calls earlier.

3
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,483
Is that Naomi with Jaron?

4
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:29,446
Do you guys know
how wild the party was?

5
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,198
Sam here was so hyper!

6
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,450
She was sexy dancing with Sevi,

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,826
and Sevi was just
standing like a statue.

8
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,995
It’s been a while since
we all went out together.

9
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,955
Yanna hasn’t been around.

10
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:40,890
Do you know
what happened to her?

11
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,793
- Hi, girls!
- Hi, Eva!

12
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:51,947
I hate him!

13
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,722
What’s your problem?

14
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,039
Nothing!

15
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,975
Go, drive Eva home.

16
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,270
What’s your problem?

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,646
Are you jealous?

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,041
Here.

19
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,001
I guess

20
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,003
you were looking
at the wrong hand.

21
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:30,736
And about Eva—

22
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,426
She's just a friend.

23
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,554
Oh my god.

24
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:38,253
You—

25
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,934
You’re really unbelievable.

26
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,367
Wait a minute, girls.

27
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:02,336
Hi.

28
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,028
What’s wrong?

29
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,586
I think I’m drunk.

30
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,646
I want to go home.

31
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,131
Okay, I’ll drive you home.

32
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,133
I haven’t had that much
to drink anyway.

33
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,133
Okay?

34
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,970
What the fuck
is wrong with me?

35
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,888
Cy had no business kissing me

36
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,557
because we’re not even dating.

37
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:23,666
I can’t take it off my mind!

38
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,229
Let’s go?

39
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:28,764
Um...

40
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,048
Raylee…

41
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,985
Have you ever
been kissed by a guy

42
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,236
you're not even dating?

43
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,863
Oh my god!

44
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,406
Who the hell kissed you?

45
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:39,656
Was it Mr. Medical Student?

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,204
I knew it!

47
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,380
Girl, what a catch!

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,208
He’s so handsome!

49
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,127
I’m not happy.

50
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,462
It will make things
so awkward between us.

51
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,006
I don’t even know why he did

52
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:54,669
that!

53
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,135
He obviously likes you.

54
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,014
I mean, why would
he kiss you if he doesn't?

55
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,015
No way.

56
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,850
Why would he even like me?

57
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,851
We never get along,

58
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,769
and we’re the total
opposites of each other.

59
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,092
Opposites attract.

60
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,399
Or do you want us
to just ask him?

61
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:13,846
Raylee, we’re not even friends.

62
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,776
We're just strangers who

63
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,655
know each other.

64
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,216
That’s a dumb take.

65
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,202
I know we’re not just strangers.

66
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,578
But still!

67
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,579
Wait,

68
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:27,033
let’s get this straight—

69
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,375
Do you hate that he kissed you?

70
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,710
You know what,

71
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,503
hate is such a strong word.

72
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,764
I’m just

73
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,216
taken aback, I guess.

74
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:37,842
Okay,

75
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,346
I think you should just let
the shock die down first.

76
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:42,756
Then, after that,

77
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,850
you’ll know whether
you liked the kiss or not.

78
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:47,622
And Sam,

79
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:49,716
please be honest with yourself.

80
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,357
I mean, you're so

81
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,734
honest with other people, but

82
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,225
you seem to keep
lying to yourself.

83
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,010
This is making me crazy!

84
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,045
I can’t face Cy. Not right now!

85
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:41,069
I need to move out
of this house tonight…

86
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,345
…away from Clyden.
I need to think.

87
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,849
Everything is so
fucking confusing.

88
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,191
If only Yanna was here…

89
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,539
Hey!

90
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:17,356
Are you insane?

91
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:19,212
Suddenly barging in here.

92
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,381
Good thing I was already awake.

93
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:23,064
I’m sorry.

94
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:24,764
I just missed you!

95
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,762
Come here, you.

96
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,732
The baby.

97
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,497
Let’s go.

98
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:37,732
You can take your
things to my room.

99
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,033
Perfect timing, Grandma’s cooking.

100
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,709
Yes.

101
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,819
Be careful.

102
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,155
What’s up?

103
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,783
Spill the tea,

104
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,411
what’s going on
with your fiancé?

105
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,092
You know what?

106
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,420
He kissed me.

107
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,297
What?

108
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,717
Just a kiss? Was it good?

109
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,886
- Yanna!
- I’m sorry.

110
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,221
This is not the right time
to ask that, okay?

111
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,943
I’m confused.

112
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:14,762
Why did he kiss me?

113
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,229
Stop acting all innocent.

114
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,397
This isn’t your first time.

115
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,566
Obviously, he kissed you

116
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,859
because he likes you.

117
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,235
You're not some
free sample, you know?

118
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,232
But he never told me that.

119
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:28,170
And I also don’t want to assume.

120
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,199
It’s just that

121
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,242
with Clyden,

122
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:32,865
everything is uncertain.

123
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:34,264
And you?

124
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:36,219
How do you really feel
about Clyden?

125
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,126
I’m really not sure.

126
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,087
Before, I could easily—

127
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,466
I could easily tell if I like the guy.

128
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,759
But now, with Clyden,

129
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,670
everything’s just different.

130
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,381
Here’s what I think, okay?

131
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,607
I feel like

132
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,481
it’s easier for you
to admit you like others

133
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,107
because you know

134
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,037
you’re not going
to give it your all.

135
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:07,162
But with Clyden,

136
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:09,277
you’re scared to get hurt.

137
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,701
You’re scared of the pain
if things don’t work out.

138
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:18,140
I got it, didn’t I?

139
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,674
I told you.

140
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,743
I know you better
than you know yourself.

141
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,923
Sam, Yanna, come on!
Let’s eat now.

142
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,549
The food’s ready.

143
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,551
- All right.
- Okay, Grandma.

144
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,720
Let’s go, let’s eat.

145
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,805
If you’re going
to overthink about Clyden,

146
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,516
at least do it
with a full stomach.

147
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:39,092
Come on.

148
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,979
Cy usually eats breakfast
around this time.

149
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,940
I wonder what time
he got home last night.

150
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,275
Did he look for me?

151
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,131
I guess not.

152
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,540
This champorado tastes
like heaven, Grandma!

153
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,542
How I wish I could eat
this every day.

154
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,628
Not every day, okay?
You might get diabetes.

155
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,258
Grandma, can you share your
champorado recipe with me?

156
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,801
I want to try cooking it.

157
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,261
Sure, sure, sweetie.

158
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,637
It’s really easy to cook.

159
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:18,392
I’ll write it down later
and give it to you, okay?

160
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,187
Why?

161
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,812
Are you planning to cook it
for your future husband?

162
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,147
Why?

163
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,691
Do you have a boyfriend already?

164
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,734
No, Grandma!

165
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,986
I’m super single.

166
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,906
Don’t believe anything Yanna says.

167
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,659
Why not?
You’re such a pretty girl.

168
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,619
No one’s courting you?

169
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,416
Come with me to the town
dance sometime, okay?

170
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,794
I’ll introduce you to the
grandson of my old classmate.

171
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,505
Seriously, Grandma?
Stop setting Sam up!

172
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,007
What do you mean?

173
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,009
Jaime is a decent guy!

174
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:55,705
He even studied nursing in Manila.

175
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:05,771
Looks like you attract
future hospital workers, huh?

176
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,525
I guess you’ll never have to worry
about getting sick anymore.

177
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:13,947
Grandma, you know what?

178
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,115
I’ll go with you.

179
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,541
Good.

180
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,213
Don’t worry, this is safe
for the baby.

181
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,599
No harmful effects.

182
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,808
No chemicals.

183
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,477
Wow, thank you.

184
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,477
Yes.

185
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:47,271
That’s so pretty.

186
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,981
You could totally be a manicurist.

187
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,759
Of course, you still
have to look pretty!

188
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,047
But wait,

189
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:54,494
have you thought of
a name for the baby yet?

190
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,323
Not yet,

191
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:58,677
but

192
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,160
the due date’s still
far off anyway.

193
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,447
There’s still a lot of time.

194
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:07,166
Want me to ask Hiro
for name suggestions?

195
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:13,923
So how’s that kiss
from Clyden, huh?

196
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,719
Come on, rate the kiss.

197
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,014
I won’t answer that.

198
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,266
Come on!

199
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,602
Maybe

200
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,646
you don’t want to
remember it ‘cause

201
00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:31,109
you might realize
you actually liked it, huh?

202
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,859
I didn’t.

203
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,319
Just—

204
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:39,384
I’d probably rate it
like a five out of ten.

205
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,259
A five out of ten,
but you can’t forget it?

206
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,205
Fine! Ten out of ten.

207
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:48,273
I knew it!

208
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:50,425
Just because
it feels different, okay?

209
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,869
But you know what?

210
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:54,392
It’s weird that he said
he doesn’t date

211
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:55,798
but he knows how to kiss.

212
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,467
Right? What’s that about?

213
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,846
You can kiss someone even
if you’re not dating them.

214
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,515
- You did that!
- You too.

215
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,541
I did that, too!

216
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,229
But if he really doesn’t
have any experience,

217
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,064
maybe he just watches porn.

218
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,947
Porn, really?

219
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,946
Maybe he likes watching
romantic comedies.

220
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,030
That’s it.

221
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,365
So vanilla.

222
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:23,995
Was he really good?

223
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,494
Test it again.

224
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,377
Maybe you’ll get
an 11 out of 10 next time.

225
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,374
You’re something else.

226
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,877
Hey, Clyden texted!

227
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,086
Huh? Wait—

228
00:12:37,362 --> 00:12:38,556
I knew it.

229
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,468
You’ve been staring at your
phone for a while now.

230
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,302
Why don’t you go home

231
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,780
so you don’t have
to keep staring at it?

232
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,682
I’ll go home in a while,

233
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,670
but I’ll go straight to the condo.

234
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,226
I’m still not ready
to face him. Besides—

235
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,771
I already moved out of our house.

236
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:53,264
Really?

237
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,818
What if Clyden
comes to pick you up?

238
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,487
Are you going to say no?

239
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:03,158
He won’t.

240
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,126
He’s not even messaging me.

241
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,278
He doesn’t even know
where I am right now.

242
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,541
Hey, look.

243
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,582
You checked it!

244
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,517
You’re totally busted!

245
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:35,397
He’s really not thinking of me?

246
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,024
I know I left suddenly,

247
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,944
but isn’t he
worried about me?

248
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,811
Isn’t he affected by the kiss?

249
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,794
You just can’t beat this.

250
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,068
I’m having coffee right now.

251
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,013
Look, we have books here.

252
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,468
They’re smart. I’m smart too,

253
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,011
but I’m closer to God.

254
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,137
You can’t beat that.

255
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,256
There’s Eva and Cy.

256
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,980
Well, I guess he’s way
too busy with Eva

257
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,148
to even think about me.

258
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,951
It’s clear she totally likes him!

259
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,787
Why do I feel so mad?

260
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:24,646
Why am I getting jealous?

261
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,131
If he’s not thinking of me,
then so will I!

262
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:32,810
I can’t just sit around
and wait for him to text!

263
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,382
Hey, yo! What’s up, Sam?

264
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:44,653
Hey, Adi!

265
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,721
Remember the time when you
said you had a friend who was

266
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,139
interested in meeting me?

267
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,390
Lewis?

268
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,644
Is he still interested?

269
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,105
Can you set us up for a date?

270
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,150
Aren’t you with Clyden?

271
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,548
We’re not together, okay?

272
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:05,283
And I’m super single.

273
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,364
Really now?

274
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,950
Yes! So, please do me a favor.

275
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,493
I want to meet new people.

276
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,506
All right, here’s the deal.

277
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,914
I’ll give you Lewis’ number,

278
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,290
and you two
can just talk it out.

279
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,291
I don’t want to get involved.

280
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,500
You’re both adults. Okay?

281
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,836
Okay. Thanks, Adi!
You’re the best!

282
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,890
You know, I’m so glad that Adi

283
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,183
finally set us up.

284
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,392
Right? Yeah.

285
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,646
Anyway, I’ve heard you
like documentaries?

286
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,521
Yes.

287
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,486
So, I watched this
documentary last night.

288
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,281
It’s about how climate change
is affecting the oceans.

289
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,952
Did you know that
coral reefs are dying

290
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,161
at an alarming rate

291
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,163
due to ocean acidification?

292
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:58,936
It’s so heartbreaking to think about.

293
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:00,685
It really is.

294
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,419
I wonder if Cy’s
had dinner already.

295
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,545
That’s why it made me
realize something—

296
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,714
He tends to forget
to eat sometimes.

297
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,351
Reducing plastic use,

298
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,812
supporting sustainable brands,

299
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,398
and— Sa—

300
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,607
Sam?

301
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,066
You okay?

302
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,361
Am I boring you?

303
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,781
No, no. I’m listening.
I’m just a little tired.

304
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,912
Anyway, have you
thought about dessert?

305
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,789
They serve the best
tiramisu here.

306
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,165
- Really?
- Yeah.

307
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,002
That’s a bit too sweet for me.

308
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,745
I think ice cream is better.

309
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,051
- Ice cream.
- What do you think?

310
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:47,847
You know what?
Now that I think about it,

311
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,271
maybe ice cream is a bit better.

312
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,343
What flavor
do you want? Vanilla?

313
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,595
Vanilla! Yes. Vanilla. Exactly.

314
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,097
That’s exactly what
I was going to say.

315
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,619
I swear, you just beat me to it.

316
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,768
'Cause you know,
I always go for vanilla,

317
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,062
whether on dates
or even with my family.

318
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,014
It's just this—

319
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,207
It’s just the memories,

320
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,316
At this point,

321
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,756
he’s just agreeing
with everything I say.

322
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,113
I miss Cy and our little debates.

323
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,490
We're just not going to get along.

324
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,034
I don’t like you either.

325
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,328
He’s not afraid to challenge
me with his opinions—

326
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,330
even though we end up
fighting sometimes.

327
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,999
Sam?

328
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,835
Are you okay?

329
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,295
You’re spacing out again.

330
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,088
Sorry, are you saying something?

331
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,381
Yes, but

332
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,341
I was also going
to ask if, you know,

333
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,761
maybe you want to
grab some drinks later or—

334
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,891
Sorry, Lewis.
I need to go home after this.

335
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,436
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

336
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,897
You should eat.

337
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,535
Why are you here?

338
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,379
I missed you.

339
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,093
What?

340
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,100
Did you regret kissing me?

341
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,727
No.

342
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,732
That’s the best thing I did.

343
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,112
Then why did you kiss me?

344
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,077
Say it.

345
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,086
I like you.

346
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,470
I like you, Maui.

347
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,794
What now?

348
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,716
Let’s date.

349
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,552
For real this time.

350
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,061
That makeout sesh was intense.

351
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,879
- Definitely an 11 out of 10.
- So,

352
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,673
you’re still not
coming back home?

353
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,759
Do you want me to?

354
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,887
I came here to convince you.

355
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,475
I want you back, Maui.

356
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,689
I was already planning to pack
my things when I saw you.

357
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,941
I also want to go back.

358
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,735
Everything is not
the same without you.

359
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,112
Shit.

360
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,781
That was so cheesy and corny.

361
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,953
Why did I even say that?

362
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,953
So, where were you earlier?

363
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,164
Huh?

364
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,500
I had dinner.

365
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,835
What about you, have you eaten?

366
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,219
Do you want to eat something?

367
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,132
Who did you have dinner with?

368
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:46,280
Have you been waiting outside
my condo for a while?

369
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:48,974
Not really.

370
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,268
Although I did have
a hard time coming up here,

371
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,687
good thing Kalix
was there to help me.

372
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,731
Yes, Kalix!

373
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,858
He lives here too.

374
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,736
So, who did you have
dinner with, again?

375
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,656
He just can’t let it pass, huh?

376
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,409
I was with a friend.

377
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,495
Who’s this friend?

378
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,336
Lewis.

379
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,594
Adi’s friend.

380
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,520
He’s a football player

381
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:22,174
and an environmentalist.

382
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,969
Wait, I’ll pack my things now.
It's getting late.

383
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,262
So, was it a date?

384
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,848
- Huh?
- Was it a date?

385
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,561
He still can’t let it go!

386
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,397
It was a date.

387
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,067
But I don’t like the guy, okay?

388
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,905
So, you just came back
from a date,

389
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,115
and then you
kissed me afterwards?

390
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,160
When you put it that way,

391
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,703
you’re making me
sound like a player.

392
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,014
I just

393
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,922
went out with a random guy ‘cause

394
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,752
I thought my feelings for you
were not that serious at all.

395
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,128
Feelings? What feelings?

396
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,624
Feelings? You already know.

397
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:04,650
No, I don’t.

398
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,219
Fine!

399
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:10,548
I like you.

400
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:11,578
Okay?

401
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,229
You know what,

402
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:19,247
it’s getting late.

403
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,857
The rain is pouring outside,

404
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,151
and I’m pretty sure
we’ll get in traffic.

405
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,738
Okay…

406
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,211
So,

407
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:33,078
I think it’s best if we just
spend the night here.

408
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,917
Okay, if you say so.

409
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,213
Oh my god.

410
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,016
What’s going
to happen tonight?

411
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,105
So I got excited for nothing!

412
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,732
I mean, technically,
we’re engaged.

413
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:08,392
Sam?

414
00:24:12,393 --> 00:24:13,561
Are you asleep?

415
00:24:15,057 --> 00:24:16,850
Yes. I’m sleeping.

416
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:23,912
Did you kiss that Ruiz guy too?

417
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,380
It’s Lewis.

418
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,756
And no,

419
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,216
I didn’t kiss him.

420
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,886
I only kiss the guys
I like, okay?

421
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:32,351
Guys?

422
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,930
So, how many of us are there?

423
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,058
One, okay? And it’s you!

424
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,977
God, we’re engaged!

425
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,814
You're not even wearing your ring.

426
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,400
What? I always wear it.

427
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,944
It’s always around your neck.

428
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,238
You don’t wear it like this.

429
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:53,575
I didn’t know he could be
this petty when he’s jealous!

430
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Fine.

431
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,304
Fine.

432
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,461
I’m going to wear it.

433
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,373
See?

434
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,396
That’s the last kiss
you’re going to get from me.

435
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,731
Huh?

436
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,191
Why?

437
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,653
Because our next kiss

438
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,021
should be when
we’re officially together.

439
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,498
Good night.

440
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,214
So, no kiss policy while dating?

441
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,759
The next kiss will be when we're
officially in a relationship?

442
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:23,794
Hey,

443
00:26:24,762 --> 00:26:26,138
are you free this morning?

444
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,170
Yes, why?

445
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:32,838
Let’s go on a breakfast date.

446
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,208
Sure.

447
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,600
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

448
00:26:42,138 --> 00:26:43,138
Okay.

449
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,404
Should I wear a dress?

450
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,281
This one. Pink.

451
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,499
Or t-shirt and jeans?

452
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,962
It’s just a breakfast date
after all.

453
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,839
- You called?
- How’s my outfit?

454
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,842
- I’m just heading out somewhere.
- But.

455
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,678
He might bring me
to a fancy restaurant!

456
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,889
I’m torn!

457
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,724
Turn around.

458
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,227
Nice one, bro. Great outfit.

459
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,812
- Is it okay?
- Where are you going?

460
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,857
For a job interview?

461
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,815
Okay, bye now.

462
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,317
Hey! Wait up, hold on—

463
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:46,232
You know what? It’s my
first time on a breakfast date.

464
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:48,625
It’s also my first time—

465
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:51,247
going on a date in general.

466
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:53,400
I already told you,

467
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,256
I don’t have time to date.

468
00:27:56,638 --> 00:27:58,885
So, the kiss?

469
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,472
Our kiss, was that
your first time too?

470
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,139
No.

471
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,067
Are you mad?

472
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,111
No.

473
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,989
I’m just wondering
if you’re an expert player

474
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,700
and if you’re playing
with me right now.

475
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:23,665
No dating experience,

476
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,859
but you know how to kiss?

477
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,665
You make me sound so bad.

478
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,584
I’ve only kissed three women
during college.

479
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,546
And during med school?

480
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,631
Just you.

481
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,271
Good.

482
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,476
How about we get
to know each other?

483
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,270
What’s your favorite color?

484
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:51,804
Blue.

485
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,896
I knew it.

486
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,485
Yours is pink. Sometimes purple.

487
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,696
How the hell did you know that?

488
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,864
Because

489
00:29:01,482 --> 00:29:02,866
I pay attention.

490
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,829
Anyway, let’s not talk about,

491
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,331
like, favorite colors or
favorite anything, whatever.

492
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:12,679
Let’s talk about
something interesting.

493
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,168
Like,

494
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,212
what do you even prefer?

495
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,131
Soft type or—

496
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,050
hardcore?

497
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,218
What?

498
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,096
Are you talking about sex?

499
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,060
I’m talking about
personality types.

500
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,192
Stop talking about sex.

501
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,904
It’s so early in the morning.

502
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,366
Anyway, I’m curious.

503
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,951
So what’s your answer?

504
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,792
You.

505
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060
Huh?

506
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:57,720
You’re exactly my type.

507
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,972
By the way,
my mom called earlier.

508
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,391
There’s going to be
a family dinner tomorrow night.

509
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,186
She said that
I should bring you with me.

510
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,730
But if you don’t want to,
I can make an excuse.

511
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,358
I know how much
you dislike my family.

512
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:23,807
I’ll go with you.

513
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:26,831
I don’t want you to go to those

514
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,285
dreadful family dinners
alone anymore.

515
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,373
Cy, I appreciate you a lot.

516
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,926
And I like you a lot.

517
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,767
Sam!

518
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,105
- Hey!
- Hi!

519
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,365
Sorry if
I’m interrupting something.

520
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,319
Your boyfriend?

521
00:31:07,182 --> 00:31:08,851
Just someone you're dating?

522
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,930
No.

523
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,919
He’s also not my boyfriend.

524
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:21,348
He is…

525
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:25,709
He is my fiancé.

526
00:31:28,326 --> 00:31:29,577
Fiancé?

527
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:31,687
Yes.

528
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,021
Girl, it’s a long story.

529
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,566
Congratulations.
Oh my god, congratulations!

530
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,693
Congratulations.

531
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,694
Thank you.

532
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,780
This is Nicole, by the way.

533
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,948
- My college friend.
- Hi.

534
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:49,866
Nicole.

535
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,242
- Clyden.
- Hi.

536
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,452
Congratulations, both of you!

537
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,185
You two look good together.

538
00:31:55,138 --> 00:31:58,016
I’ll just go. Sorry if
I’m interrupting you guys.

539
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:58,666
- I’ll see you.
- Enjoy.

540
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,626
I’ll see you. Bye!

541
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,626
Bye!

542
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:05,316
What did you say?

543
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,591
Fiancé?

544
00:32:11,645 --> 00:32:13,396
Why are you smiling? Just eat.

545
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,313
Let’s go to the grocery?

546
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,857
We need to replenish
our stocks.

547
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,316
Sure thing.

548
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,777
Okay. Let’s go.

549
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,865
There.

550
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,951
Fix your collar.

551
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,374
I knew it.

552
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,286
He’s dating Raylee’s sister.

553
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,671
This dude better not be
playing with Naomi.

554
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,881
Hey!

555
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,760
Are you okay?

556
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,722
Yes, I’m fine.

557
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,748
OMG, OMG.

558
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,560
Why do I feel panicky?

559
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,138
It’s not my first time
to hold hands with a guy!

560
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,958
Remember when you asked me if

561
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,234
I was nervous ‘cause
my hand was wet

562
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,902
and you couldn't stand
holding me?

563
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:10,514
Are you nervous?

564
00:33:10,861 --> 00:33:13,155
Why is your hand wet? Yuck.

565
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,078
Okay.

566
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,161
That was me. I was nervous.

567
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,002
But I won’t let go of you now.

568
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:30,153
I got you all giddy, huh.

569
00:33:31,006 --> 00:33:33,383
You ruined it. How annoying!

570
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:34,411
I’m sorry.

571
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,266
Let’s go grocery shopping now.

572
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,642
Okay.

573
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,892
Let’s go!

574
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,316
- Make sure that’s done properly, okay?
- Yes, ma’am.

575
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,735
Sam and Clyden are on their way.

576
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,865
This one. There you go.

577
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,119
Hi, Sam! Hi, Clyden!

578
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,529
I’m so glad that
you can join us tonight.

579
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,958
- Good evening, Auntie.
- Hi.

580
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,588
What a shame, your Uncle
Stephen’s not here right now because

581
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:11,525
he has an important
business meeting.

582
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:12,781
Business?

583
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,803
I didn’t know Senator Vera
had any business.

584
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,140
It's just his side venture.

585
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,560
You know, outside
of his political service.

586
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:26,395
You guys go upstairs first.
I’ll just fix the food,

587
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,638
then I’ll call you for dinner.

588
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,151
- Okay.
- Okay.

589
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,280
Is the food ready?

590
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:36,212
All right.

591
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,619
Let’s hurry up, okay?
The kids might be hungry.

592
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,636
So, this is my room.

593
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,933
I haven’t let any other guy here.

594
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,115
So, you’re the first one.

595
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,734
And I’ll be the last.

596
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,526
You’re deciding for me now?

597
00:35:16,689 --> 00:35:17,941
Is this your best friend?

598
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,658
Yanna?

599
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,121
Yes. She’s in Nueva Ecija now.

600
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,789
You remember her?

601
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,934
I think I was drunk
when I told you about her.

602
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,253
I used to have my best friend,
Yanna, you know?

603
00:35:30,465 --> 00:35:32,676
And she was always there for me.

604
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,009
Of course, she’s your best friend.

605
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,154
And your sister?
Aren’t you guys close?

606
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:46,839
Hi, Naomi!
How are your studies?

607
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,187
Why do you even care?

608
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,356
I don’t need you
to buy me makeup, okay?

609
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,066
I can ask Dad to buy me makeup.

610
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,526
Stop acting like
you care about me.

611
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,861
You don’t know
anything about me.

612
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,611
It’s annoying.

613
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,280
Please stop giving me
your hand-me-downs

614
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,489
like I’m a charity case.

615
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,032
Don’t you know
how offensive that is?

616
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,082
Just leave!

617
00:36:01,107 --> 00:36:03,327
Please stop acting
like you care about me.

618
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,204
I really care about you, Naomi.

619
00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:14,628
I’m sorry.

620
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,051
If it’s too personal,
you don’t have to answer that.

621
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,854
She’s actually my half-sister.

622
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,191
She started living
with us a few years ago

623
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,400
when her mom died.

624
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,528
I was really happy
to have her ‘cause

625
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,031
I grew up as an only child. And...

626
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,867
I’ve always wanted
to have a younger sibling.

627
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:46,388
But you know,

628
00:36:46,975 --> 00:36:49,435
I’m not sure if I’m being
a good older sister to her.

629
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,460
She doesn’t want to talk to me

630
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,621
or have anything to do with me.

631
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:01,385
But I’ll never stop reaching out
and making her feel loved.

632
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,935
You’re already
a great sister, Maui.

633
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,146
I’m sure she’ll
open up to you more,

634
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,147
eventually.

635
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,026
Thanks, Cy. That means a lot.

636
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,243
Who gave that to you?

637
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,454
- That one?
- Yes.

638
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,168
I can’t remember.
Maybe my ex from high school.

639
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,340
You like teddy bears?

640
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,178
I’m more of a flowers
and chocolate type of girl.

641
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:48,760
It’s so pretty!

642
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,893
The one who gave it
must be really sweet.

643
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,768
They brought a bouquet to a club.

644
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:54,336
I mean, who does that?

645
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,713
Does what?

646
00:37:55,738 --> 00:37:59,543
Those cute and sweet things.

647
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,446
If that were given to me,
I wouldn’t let go of it.

648
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,490
I remember.

649
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,159
Have I mentioned that before?

650
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,036
Yes, when we were at the bar.

651
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,373
When you saw my flowers--

652
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,501
I mean, the…

653
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,246
The bouquet of flowers
that was left at the bar.

654
00:38:45,861 --> 00:38:48,155
Ma’am Samantha,
dinner is ready downstairs.

655
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,161
All right, we’ll be right there.

656
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,121
Let’s go!

657
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,513
Hi, Naomi.

658
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,306
What?

659
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,560
I like your makeup.

660
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,106
Dinner’s ready.

661
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,554
I just want to ask you
about your birthday

662
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:29,497
since it’s coming up.
Do you have any plans?

663
00:39:29,522 --> 00:39:30,565
I can help you.

664
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,705
I don’t want to celebrate it.

665
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,375
Hey, why not?

666
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,770
We can plan a beach
party with your friends.

667
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,090
We have a membership at
this exclusive island resort,

668
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,884
and it would be fun
to fly everyone there.

669
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,387
Are you for real?

670
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,556
Are you really suggesting
I throw a beach party?

671
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,934
Are you that insensitive?

672
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,564
Naomi, I’m sorry—

673
00:40:12,946 --> 00:40:14,365
She’s a mad kid.

674
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:17,069
No.

675
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:19,129
Her anger is valid.

676
00:40:19,674 --> 00:40:21,134
I was insensitive.

677
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,462
I suggested that she have
a beach party for her birthday

678
00:40:25,487 --> 00:40:29,032
when I know that her mom
died at the beach?

679
00:40:31,272 --> 00:40:32,649
What was I thinking?

680
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,224
It’s okay.

681
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,480
Sam, Clyden. Dinner’s ready!

682
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,690
Let’s eat.

683
00:40:53,046 --> 00:40:55,661
Clyden, don’t be shy, okay?
Just eat.

684
00:40:55,731 --> 00:40:56,732
Yes, Auntie.

685
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,457
Should we call Naomi?

686
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,542
We should eat together.

687
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,796
She always eats
around 9:00 or 10:00 at night.

688
00:41:06,448 --> 00:41:07,773
I don’t know. Just let her be.

689
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,259
You don’t call her to eat?

690
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,181
I tried.

691
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,138
Once.

692
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,017
She didn’t respond, so

693
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,102
I guess she’d rather eat alone.

694
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,439
I’ll call her.

695
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,232
Excuse me.

696
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Mom—

697
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,328
you should check up on Naomi.

698
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,079
Maybe there’s something wrong

699
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,414
with how you’re treating her

700
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,333
that she would rather
stay inside her room

701
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,834
than eat dinner with you.

702
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,212
I really don’t care about the kid.

703
00:41:55,066 --> 00:41:57,861
It’s my fault. I ruined her night.

704
00:42:12,305 --> 00:42:13,305
Hey.

705
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:15,312
Are you okay?

706
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:22,549
You don’t usually go to
the veranda to hang out.

707
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,583
Is something wrong?

708
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:27,005
I just need some fresh air.

709
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,132
Why is it always
so emotionally taxing

710
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,009
whenever I visit
our family’s house?

711
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,931
I wish I could take
Naomi out of that house.

712
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,854
Thank you for coming
with me today, Cy.

713
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,859
Having you there
made the night tolerable.

714
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,154
I understand how you feel.

715
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,495
I used to dread going home
to my parents’ house.

716
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,371
That's why sometimes
I stay long at coffee shops

717
00:43:03,035 --> 00:43:04,044
or the library,

718
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,125
just so I don't have to go home.

719
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,462
But now, I'm starting to think that

720
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,924
moving in was
actually a good idea.

721
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:17,382
I look forward to going home now.

722
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,222
Going home to you.

723
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,936
You were so mean to me back then.

724
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:30,157
Did you ever feel guilty after
being mean to me back then?

725
00:43:32,664 --> 00:43:33,664
Yes.

726
00:43:35,307 --> 00:43:36,517
I always do.

727
00:43:40,104 --> 00:43:41,522
I don’t believe you.

728
00:43:41,547 --> 00:43:44,845
You know what, you’re the
most sarcastic asshole

729
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,998
- I’ve ever met.
- Until now?

730
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,752
I’m treating you nicely. Come on.

731
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,171
I’m kidding.

732
00:43:52,911 --> 00:43:55,490
You’re a warm and kind person, Cy.

733
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,802
And you’re the only person
in the world who

734
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,305
understands exactly how I feel.

735
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,727
Maui?

736
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,247
I thought you were
going to wait for—

737
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,309
How do you know if you’re
already falling in love?

738
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,717
Because I think I am.

739
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:30,977
Naomi?

740
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:34,270
Please don’t tell Sam.

741
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,236
Your setup’s wrong.

742
00:45:41,253 --> 00:45:42,337
Let me help you.

743
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,997
You have to make sure
this is level.

744
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,806
Your camera might fall
if it’s not stable.

745
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,711
And make sure this part
is always secured.

746
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,799
Thanks. Do you take
photography too?

747
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,093
Sometimes.

748
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,564
Well, I did back in high school,

749
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,930
but I haven’t really
practiced since.

750
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,076
I see.

751
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,401
Your shots look good.

752
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,780
You just need to
tweak your aperture a bit

753
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,281
when taking portrait shots.

754
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,159
Are you mostly shooting portraits?

755
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,537
I like taking photos
of people smiling

756
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,414
because it makes me smile too.

757
00:46:34,142 --> 00:46:35,894
Well, you surely have the eye for it.

758
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,962
You should continue taking pictures.

759
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,426
Well, anyway,
we’re eating downstairs.

760
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:45,676
Come join us.

761
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,888
I’m still full.

762
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,307
Okay.

763
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,559
Well, if you get hungry,

764
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,394
just come down. We’re just there.

765
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,814
And

766
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,690
you know what?

767
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,486
Your sister cares deeply about you.

768
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,072
You should give her a chance.

769
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,866
It will surely make her smile, too.

770
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,331
All right, then.

771
00:47:27,759 --> 00:47:29,054
What do you want?

772
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,931
I want to showcase clothes.

773
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:34,393
Redefine beauty and tell stories

774
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,370
through fashion on a global stage.

775
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,480
I want to be an international model.

776
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,941
Do what you actually want to do.

777
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:48,411
You cooked for me?

778
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,091
Sam seems to be
in a good mood today.

779
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,954
What is this?

780
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,622
It’s just food.

781
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,082
Wow, Samantha!

782
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:00,002
You packed your lunch
for the first time?

783
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,336
That’s awesome!

784
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,509
Hey, you’re smiling from ear to ear.

785
00:48:04,534 --> 00:48:06,939
How do you know if
you’re already falling in love?

786
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,888
Because I think I am.

787
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,599
Cy said, he thinks that

788
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:16,144
he's already
falling in love with me.

789
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,145
That’s perfect!

790
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,022
You’re falling in love
with each other.

791
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,190
I don’t know how to answer that.

792
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,568
Because

793
00:48:24,593 --> 00:48:26,554
I haven't fallen in love yet.
