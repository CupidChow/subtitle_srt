1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,343
Here's the plan...

2
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,139
No helpers, no drivers, nothing.
To avoid gossip.

3
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,558
So, if you don't have
any better suggestions,

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,518
let's just stick to the plan.

5
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,021
Do whatever you want.

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,023
For now, we have to
follow what they say.

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,482
- Okay, game. Game!
- Cheers!

8
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,485
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,528
I’m good.

10
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:31,531
Sam…

11
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,899
- Hey, Sam.
- Sam!

12
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,662
Hi!

13
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,205
Who are you?

14
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,625
Here is my friend—also

15
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,502
he’s my ex-crush.

16
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,186
You are so kind and generous.

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,983
Why are you and
Summer still awake?

18
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,235
She’s waiting for her mom.

19
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,905
Mom?

20
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,242
I’m now your dog’s mom?

21
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,868
Yes.

22
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,579
It’s because

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,831
my dogs have grown fond of you.

24
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,167
I see.

25
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,544
Of course he didn’t mean
anything by that.

26
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,758
You waited for me, baby?

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,759
Yes.

28
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,430
I mean, we waited for you.

29
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,101
Your mom said
you didn't stay for dinner.

30
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,854
Is he worried about me?

31
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,022
Next time, if you're
going to be home late,

32
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,191
let me know.

33
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,442
So I’ll know what
to tell your mom and dad

34
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,945
if they ask me where you are.

35
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,905
I understand.

36
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,533
I’m sorry for not messaging you.

37
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,372
Have you eaten yet?

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,957
What now?

39
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,583
Is he genuinely being nice

40
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,919
or he’s just making sure
my parents can’t say

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,922
that he’s not taking care of me?

42
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,214
No,

43
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,799
I’m not hungry yet.

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,135
I think I’ll just sleep.

45
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,678
Well,

46
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,847
at least eat something
before you sleep.

47
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,307
It’s not good to sleep
on an empty stomach.

48
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,350
And

49
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,478
if you need
ointment for your back,

50
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,980
I have one upstairs.

51
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,277
Thank you, Clyden.

52
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,777
No worries.

53
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,906
If you suddenly feel hungry
and want a proper meal,

54
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,324
just tell me.

55
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,951
I can order.

56
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,164
Are you doing
an all-nighter again?

57
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,709
Okay.

58
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,546
How about you?

59
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,924
Did you eat dinner already?

60
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,218
If you want,

61
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,511
I can prepare for you.

62
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,888
What would you like?

63
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,723
It’s okay. I already ate,

64
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,307
but

65
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,518
thanks for asking.

66
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,355
Maybe it’s possible
that we can be

67
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,317
genuinely nice to each other.

68
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,652
Why are we always fighting?

69
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,737
Come on.

70
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,698
Let’s go inside.

71
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,698
It’s raining.

72
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,992
Let's go, baby!

73
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,746
Come here.

74
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,913
Good morning, Clyden.

75
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,665
Morning, Sam.

76
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,459
Your eyes look so puffy.

77
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,378
You haven’t slept yet, have you?

78
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,370
I’m just eating breakfast,
and then I’ll sleep afterward.

79
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,093
Sit down, let’s eat.

80
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,512
He’s still being nice to me.

81
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,015
I wonder what changed.

82
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,855
You cooked breakfast for me?

83
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,481
Yes.

84
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,115
The pancakes
were about to expire,

85
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,158
so I cooked them already.

86
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,479
Wouldn’t want them
to go to waste.

87
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,912
There he goes again,
keeping my hopes up!

88
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,540
What did I even expect?

89
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,666
Why?

90
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,294
You don’t like
almost-expired pancakes?

91
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,254
I could just give
them to the dogs.

92
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,839
No, I’ll eat them.

93
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,341
And too many pancakes
aren’t good for the dogs either.

94
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,384
It’s bad for them.

95
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,218
You can give them as a treat,

96
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,514
but you can’t put toppings
like butter, honey,

97
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,850
sugar, especially chocolates!

98
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,810
Did you have a dog before?

99
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,312
You seem to know a lot.

100
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,730
I did my research.

101
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,692
After all, I'm now
the mom of these dogs.

102
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,657
No,

103
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,286
Let’s swap that.
That one’s burnt.

104
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,745
Here.

105
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,414
This one’s better.

106
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,586
No. He’s actually being nice.

107
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,046
By the way,

108
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,798
Dad’s asking me to
come over for dinner.

109
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,509
It’s at your place.
Let’s go together?

110
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,470
Okay. I’ll go with you.

111
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,640
But you should sleep first.

112
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,725
I’ll just wake you up later.

113
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,395
So,

114
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,063
goodnight.

115
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,023
I’ll handle that, don’t worry.

116
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,985
And don’t worry about
the dogs, I’ll feed them.

117
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,445
You sure?

118
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,155
- Sure.
- Okay.

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Thanks.

120
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,045
All right, your turn, babies!
Time for breakfast!

121
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,885
Let's go eat now,
my beautiful kids!

122
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,303
Hail!

123
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:14,016
No! You’re next. Share, please?

124
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,728
Summer, come here!
Eat your food now.

125
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,814
Eat your food.

126
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,358
You know what?
You guys are so lucky

127
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,570
that you have such
a beautiful and kind mom!

128
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,407
Right? Unlike your dad,
who’s always grumpy.

129
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,076
- Come eat, Summer. Here!
- Grumpy?

130
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,619
But you know what?

131
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,914
He is not that grumpy lately.

132
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,500
I actually

133
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,751
like this side of him.

134
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,878
I hope we can get along.

135
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,464
We could actually be friends,

136
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,924
if we just keep being nice
and kind to each other.

137
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,925
Right, babies?

138
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,679
You guys have good appetites.

139
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,848
But you know what?
I promise. I promise!

140
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,350
I’ll try my best

141
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,353
to not be grumpy
to your dad, too.

142
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,781
Yummy.

143
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,796
My look is serving today.
Yanna will love this ‘fit.

144
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,270
Maureen, you have to
win the approval

145
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,106
of your future in-laws, okay?

146
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,318
Dress to impress and
be on your best behavior.

147
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,529
Don’t disappoint me.

148
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,421
Clyden? Are you awake?

149
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,882
Is he still asleep?

150
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,762
Clyden, I’m letting
myself in, okay?

151
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,320
Wow, he's so
dedicated to his studies.

152
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:36,158
I wonder how it feels to be
this passionate about something.

153
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,918
Clyden?

154
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,801
How can someone as grumpy as him

155
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,679
look so innocent while asleep?

156
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,348
He looks tired, though.

157
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,394
Clyden?

158
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,772
Clyden?

159
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,399
Clyden?

160
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,695
I’m sorry I had to wake you up.

161
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,072
It’s just that it’s almost six,

162
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,491
and they’re
expecting us at 7:30.

163
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,909
Sorry, I just went
inside your room

164
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,621
‘cause you weren’t answering.

165
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,668
Are you okay?

166
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,797
You look good.

167
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,930
Thanks.

168
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,311
All right, I’ll get ready.

169
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,895
Okay.

170
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,773
I’ll wait for you outside.

171
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,462
They said there’s traffic
on the main highway.

172
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,143
I’ll just check
where the fastest route is.

173
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,345
We’re both wearing green.

174
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,432
Did he do it on purpose?
Or is it just a coincidence?

175
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,517
Well, if it was intentional,

176
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,604
I’m sure it’s just to make us
look like a real couple.

177
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,692
That color suits you.

178
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:33,983
Thanks.

179
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,614
Why is he so quiet?
This is so awkward.

180
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,074
I can’t stand it!

181
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,577
Do you mind if
I play some music?

182
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,089
It’s looking for...

183
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,281
I’m asking for your phone.

184
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,658
Oh my god.

185
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
I’m so sorry.

186
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,167
What the fuck was I thinking?

187
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,502
That was so embarrassing.

188
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,339
He’ll keep teasing me
about this, I’m sure!

189
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,968
You didn’t tell me that you
just wanted us to hold hands.

190
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,360
Cris, I heard you’re
expanding the hospital.

191
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,653
You’re adding a new wing?

192
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:01,864
You know that's impressive.

193
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,242
Yes! We recently acquired
the latest MRI machines,

194
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,369
the first in the country.

195
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,706
That’s why we’re getting
swarmed by VIP patients.

196
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,541
But you know how it is,

197
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,585
there’s a lot that needs fixing,

198
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,588
like permits and
government approvals.

199
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,340
Nothing moves without
the right connection.

200
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,509
I know what you mean, bro.

201
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,385
It’s just like politics.

202
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,720
You need the proper connections.

203
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,241
That way, you know
what you’re getting.

204
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,474
But,

205
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,474
you know?

206
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,852
I’m really glad we’ll
soon be a family.

207
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,437
Absolutely.

208
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,522
We can do great things
for this country.

209
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,398
- Yes.
- Yes.

210
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,066
Cheers to that.

211
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,358
- Cheers.
- Yeah, right.

212
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,694
At the expense of Clyden and me.

213
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,489
Wow. So fun.

214
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,130
Sam, your legs.

215
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,140
So, how’s living together?

216
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,102
It’s been great, Auntie.

217
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,522
I actually love
living with Clyden.

218
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,064
Yes, Mom.

219
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,193
It’s like the best thing that’s
ever happened in my life.

220
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,694
Well, that’s great.

221
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,363
I was really worried you
might be fighting every day

222
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,657
because you know Clyden,

223
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,535
he can be tactless sometimes.

224
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,330
If I'm forced to live
in a house with you...

225
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,541
might as well make sure
the house is nice.

226
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,876
Just a consolation.

227
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,795
I hate your dad. Actually,
I hate your whole family.

228
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,589
It’s fucking pathetic
to be honest.

229
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,132
And how am I your type?

230
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,925
You’re so full of yourself!

231
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,177
I’m leaving tomorrow,
just to get away from you.

232
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,638
I didn’t ask.

233
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,142
Clyden is actually really…

234
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,894
soft-spoken.

235
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,936
- Soft-spoken?
- Soft-spoken?

236
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,937
Really?

237
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,315
Yes, he’s not judgmental.

238
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,067
Not judgmental at all.

239
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:03,903
- Wow.
- Wow.

240
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,904
My son must
really like you, huh?

241
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,345
Who else would
he get it from, right?

242
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,200
Come on, Jaida.

243
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,829
I’m actually the
one who’s worried.

244
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,040
Because my daughter,

245
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,252
everyone knows
she’s a social butterfly,

246
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,630
and I’m afraid she might be
distracting Clyden.

247
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,592
She just loves to party.
She’s always in demand.

248
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,848
You’re so loud.

249
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,683
I can manage.

250
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,976
I take care of everyone

251
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,687
but no one takes care of me.

252
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,648
I can handle myself. Okay?

253
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,066
You can’t.

254
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,486
You know what,
you’re right, Auntie.

255
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,571
Sam can be really loud.

256
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,950
Sometimes she even
gets home late

257
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,743
because of all her activities.

258
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,538
The fuck?
This guy can’t even lie!

259
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,041
Did he really just rat me out?

260
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,878
But I found out that
the orgs Sam joins

261
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,964
are actually for charity.

262
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,342
She’s always busy
helping other people,

263
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,887
so I can’t help but
root for her, you know.

264
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,139
And she’s

265
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,934
the most caring person
I’ve ever met.

266
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,853
She even takes care of my dogs.

267
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,938
So,

268
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,275
it's really not hard
to love someone

269
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,735
like Sam.

270
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,656
That’s good.

271
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,957
If I didn’t know
we were just pretending,

272
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,085
I think I would’ve fallen
for those words.

273
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,761
Oh my gosh!

274
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,644
I’m sorry.

275
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,271
I didn’t see you there.

276
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:03,981
No worries.

277
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,858
Sorry for startling you.

278
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,859
No, it's okay.

279
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,570
So,

280
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,989
you’re graduating soon?

281
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,743
What’s with
the sudden small talk?

282
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,579
Yes. It’s my last year.

283
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,124
Nice. So,

284
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,418
after that,

285
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,170
you’ll get married
to my brother.

286
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,673
That’s the plan.

287
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,508
You know what?

288
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,971
If only I had done
great in college,

289
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,099
I’d be the one marrying you.

290
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,791
Such a shame!

291
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,232
You’re exactly my type, too.

292
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,527
So,

293
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,574
if ever you get
bored with Clyden...

294
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,870
feel free to approach me.

295
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,914
Does he think
I’m some kind of property

296
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,042
they can just pass around?

297
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,049
Excuse me, I think Clyden
is already looking for me.

298
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,259
Hold on.

299
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,635
Let’s talk some more.

300
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,971
Get your hands off her.

301
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,430
Okay!

302
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,723
Chill!

303
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,810
Clyden, it’s getting late.

304
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,062
I want to go home now.

305
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,689
Okay.

306
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,900
Let’s go home.

307
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,872
Why didn’t you
tell Charles off earlier?

308
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,292
He was clearly insulting you.

309
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,711
Are you afraid of him?

310
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,004
No.

311
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,301
I was afraid
I might cause a scene,

312
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,470
so I just let it go.

313
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,388
Are you…

314
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,974
always like that?

315
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,767
Like what?

316
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,272
Scared of conflict.
That’s why you stay quiet

317
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,781
even when you're the one
who's actually right.

318
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,278
No one has ever
pointed that out before.

319
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,907
It’s a disservice
to yourself if you don’t,

320
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,449
you know, speak up.

321
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,120
I hope one day you can
somehow find the courage

322
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,414
to defend yourself...

323
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,293
‘cause no one’s allowed
to talk to you like that.

324
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,052
Thank you, Clyden.
I appreciate that.

325
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,180
You can do it.

326
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,723
You’re able to show
your annoyance with me

327
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,184
when I tease you,

328
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,294
so how much more
with other people?

329
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,563
You’re different.

330
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,566
It’s just so easy
to be mad at you.

331
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,279
Okay, I’ll take that
as a compliment.

332
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,699
But he’s right.

333
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,909
Why is it that
I can be transparent

334
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,578
with my emotions with him?

335
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,663
How about you?

336
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,334
Did you always have a difficult
relationship with your brothers?

337
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,297
We used to be close.

338
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,133
But when we got older,

339
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,887
Dad would always compare us.

340
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,141
I feel like that's when their
resentment towards me started.

341
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,771
Do you hate your brothers?

342
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,858
Sometimes I do.

343
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,363
But what I feel more
is pity for them.

344
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,491
They’re always being
shamed by Dad.

345
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,704
How about my parents?

346
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,706
You hate them?

347
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,833
Sorry,

348
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,212
but I really don’t feel any
compassion towards your dad

349
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,965
because I witnessed firsthand

350
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:02,678
how his corruption has
affected hospital patients.

351
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,808
I was a premed
student back then.

352
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,517
There was a mother and her son

353
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,998
who had just come out
of the hospital.

354
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,855
Because they didn’t have money,
they weren’t admitted.

355
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,779
And that’s when
I saw how fucked up

356
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,865
our healthcare system really is.

357
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,534
It was during the term
of Senator Vera

358
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,161
at the Health Department.

359
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,252
Apparently, the mother didn’t
have enough for medication.

360
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,218
They were asking for help
from the government,

361
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,264
but the aid they
received was insufficient.

362
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,534
I used to think that money
always comes back.

363
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,998
But the lives
of our loved ones...

364
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,542
don’t.

365
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,794
That’s why I used
to get angry at people

366
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,631
who go to the hospital
only when it’s too late.

367
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:22,966
Life is priceless.

368
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,383
Even if you have
to borrow money,

369
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,261
as long as
you can get treatment.

370
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,971
That’s what matters.

371
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,266
That’s when I realized that

372
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,811
you can only have that
mindset if you’re privileged.

373
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,273
Unlike that mother and her son,
who had nothing at all.

374
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:43,487
So when they needed
help the most,

375
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,947
where was the government?

376
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,327
After that incident,
I immersed myself

377
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,205
in the public hospital system

378
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:58,877
and saw firsthand how corrupt
the management is.

379
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,631
No wonder the mother and
her son didn’t get any help.

380
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,010
Medical supplies and
equipment were overpriced.

381
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,931
So the hospital subsidy
funds were drained.

382
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,975
You know,
when I did my research,

383
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,397
it turned out your dad was
the one in charge

384
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,651
of the procurement
for all of these.

385
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,363
I didn’t know it was this bad.

386
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,449
No wonder he hates my dad.

387
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,579
I know my apology won’t undo
anything my dad did.

388
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,040
But,

389
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,793
I’m sorry for the victims

390
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,921
and...

391
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,758
thank you for
telling me this, Clyden.

392
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,927
I appreciate your honesty.

393
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,432
That’s one thing
I can promise to you, Sam.

394
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,185
I’ll always be honest with you.

395
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,690
Obviously.

396
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,901
You never filter
your words with me.

397
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,988
Sometimes it borders on rude,

398
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,449
and I just want to
smack you in the face.

399
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,659
But...

400
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,121
really, I appreciate
your honesty.

401
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,289
See?

402
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,626
You’re able to voice out
your frustration with me.

403
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,125
Just needs a little more
practice with other people.

404
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,704
Good morning!

405
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,086
He woke up in a good mood.

406
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,088
I’ll sit with you.

407
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,050
It’s not filling at all
when you eat alone.

408
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,098
He looks so neat.

409
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,602
Being a future doctor
really suits him.

410
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,146
What time is your class?

411
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,024
Won’t you hit traffic
on the way there?

412
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,193
My first class is at 10AM,

413
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,319
but I should get there by 9AM,

414
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,907
so I can review
and avoid traffic.

415
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,743
You still study
even before class?

416
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,114
So my readings don’t pile up.

417
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,123
I even review during break time.

418
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,043
Wow, your schedule seems hectic.

419
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,045
Wait, do you still
have time for lunch?

420
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,672
Sometimes,

421
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,048
when I remember.

422
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,467
You’re a future doctor.

423
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,928
I don’t need to tell you the
negative effects on your health

424
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,138
if you skip meals.

425
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,851
I’ll remember
to eat lunch today.

426
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,353
Thanks.

427
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,854
How about you?

428
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,607
Don’t you have class at ten?

429
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,193
How did you know?

430
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,445
I’ve noticed that...

431
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,532
you leave around 8:30 to 9AM.

432
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,911
I didn't know
he’s this observant.

433
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,789
My class schedule isn’t hectic.

434
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,790
I just get busy after classes

435
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,960
because I have
org meetings every day.

436
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,130
At least you don’t
forget to eat lunch.

437
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,425
He’s a bit chatty today, huh?

438
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,510
And this small talk
feels pleasant.

439
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,055
So, we can actually talk
without arguing.

440
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,433
Oh?

441
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,728
You’re wearing our
engagement ring today?

442
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,438
I always do.

443
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,357
Does he want people
to know he’s taken?

444
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,277
Taken by me?

445
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,822
I'm scared to take it off.
It might get lost.

446
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,992
And Dad might make me pay
for it if it does.

447
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,079
Of course! Why did I even
think it was because of me?

448
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,707
What the fuck is wrong with me?

449
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,626
People might think you're taken.

450
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,585
So?

451
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:14,215
I’m sure pretty girls from your
school will be disappointed.

452
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,716
Why?

453
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,053
Do you think others
find me likeable?

454
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,974
Wow, this guy is unaware
of how attractive he is.

455
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:28,730
If you smile at them often
and talk to them softly, then...

456
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,522
probably yes.

457
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,984
Like how I said good morning
to you earlier?

458
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:34,943
Huh?

459
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,070
Nothing.

460
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,406
Hurry up. You might
get stuck in traffic.

461
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,215
I convinced my uncle to book the
whole bar for the org meeting,

462
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,802
free of charge, when I told him
it’s for the fundraising event.

463
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,523
We only need to pay
for the food and drinks.

464
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,098
And they serve
good cocktails too, right?

465
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,851
I’m pretty sure a lot
will show up at the party.

466
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,478
I think we should do
something new too,

467
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,272
to attract more people.

468
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,857
What do you think, Sam?

469
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,193
Sam, are you okay?

470
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:16,861
Yes.

471
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,780
I'm sorry, just thinking
about something.

472
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,449
What is it? Is it a boy problem?

473
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:22,908
No!

474
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,328
Girls, I have a question.

475
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,415
What does it mean when someone
who's usually grumpy to you

476
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,834
suddenly becomes nice?

477
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:35,338
Are you talking about
a specific person here?

478
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,424
No, okay?

479
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,219
I’m just referring to a scene
from a Korean drama I watched.

480
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,470
It’s not that deep.

481
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,473
Well, it could mean nothing,

482
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,599
or it could mean everything.

483
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,476
Nothing, because

484
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:53,439
maybe he’s just being nice
now and wants to make up for

485
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,024
being grumpy to you.

486
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:59,237
And everything, because it
could be the start of something

487
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,405
romantic!

488
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,406
You’re right.

489
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,952
Why is it so hard to read him?

490
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,331
Girls, wait a minute, okay?

491
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,332
Okay.

492
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,502
Hey, guys!

493
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,088
What’s up?

494
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,965
Thanks for bringing me
home the other night.

495
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,759
Of course!

496
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,093
You guys are the best!

497
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,053
Are you guys together?

498
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,263
Huh?

499
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,513
Clyden.

500
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,391
I...

501
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,726
It’s...

502
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,271
You don’t have to worry.
You’re in good hands.

503
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,440
He’s a nice guy,

504
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,817
and I think he’s really wise.

505
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,276
You’ll learn a lot.

506
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Wise?

507
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,620
He’s not a professor.
What’s so wise about him?

508
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,617
What’s there to learn from him?

509
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,327
Such a dumbass.

510
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,329
But, thank you! Thank you
for coming to the party.

511
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,080
I’ll invite you guys
again next time.

512
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,248
- Of course.
- I’ll message you...

513
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,417
and don’t ditch, okay?

514
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,431
In the next event,
can I have a free drink?

515
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,755
It’s for charity, you know.
For a good cause.

516
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,674
Maybe at the next event,
you’ll be...

517
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,967
I’m not like that.
Was I like that?

518
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,804
No hangover next time. Yeah?

519
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,554
I promise.

520
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,309
Thank you.

521
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,105
Hey, Giselle!

522
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,232
- Samantha!
- Hi!

523
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,233
Oh my god.

524
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,985
- It’s so good to see you.
- Nice to see you here.

525
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,780
What’s up? I heard you're
getting busy these days.

526
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,533
Not really.
My schedule is manageable.

527
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,661
More relaxed since
we're seniors now, right?

528
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,537
Yes.

529
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,372
You know what? I saw your
billboard, you looked so good.

530
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,498
Really, you saw it?

531
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,666
- Yes.
- Thank you.

532
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,168
Isn’t it hard being a model?

533
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,254
It can be hard.
I mean, it's a real job.

534
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,506
Long days on set.

535
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,424
Sometimes the photographer
can be intimidating.

536
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,926
But you know what,

537
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,261
I just love that
there’s a control

538
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,763
over the freedom of my time.

539
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,514
Definitely makes it exciting.

540
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,600
Plus, I get the
opportunity to travel.

541
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,310
The pay is pretty good, too.

542
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,564
It sounds like
a dream job to me,

543
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,776
especially about having freedom
and control over your time.

544
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,945
Yes. You know what?

545
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,989
Should I start modelling?

546
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,115
You know what?

547
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,993
You definitely have
the look and the vibe.

548
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,744
Let me look at you. Spin around.

549
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,080
How tall are you? 5’8”?

550
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,415
- Yes.
- With heels,

551
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,208
you could totally
rock that runway.

552
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,667
I mean, you have such an aura,

553
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,669
you have a beautiful neckline.

554
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,046
It would be so fun,
we could even model together.

555
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,924
Imagine we’re jetsetting,
the people that you meet…

556
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,386
You get to go to places you
wouldn’t even plan on going to.

557
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,035
You should
definitely think about it.

558
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,306
I can help you.
I have such a good agent,

559
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,225
and they’re always
looking for people.

560
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,602
I’m just kidding, Giselle,

561
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,646
but thank you for the offer.

562
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,647
Hey, think about it.

563
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,566
If you change your mind,
just give me a call.

564
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,567
Okay.

565
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,527
- Thank you!
- See you soon!

566
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,613
I’ll see you!

567
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,910
Me? A model?

568
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:56,789
I want to try but I feel like
I’m not fit for it.

569
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,845
Hey.

570
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,348
I was buying dinner earlier,

571
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,683
so I bought some for you too.

572
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,685
I hope you like ramen and gyoza.

573
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,397
You didn’t have to,
but thank you.

574
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,151
Okay.

575
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,863
I’ll just get water.

576
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,824
You can like, you know,
get the food already.

577
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,127
Nice.

578
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,631
We ran out of these earlier?

579
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,591
Did you buy these?

580
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:49,968
Yup.

581
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,636
I stopped by the grocery,

582
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,555
so I grabbed some.

583
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,183
You didn’t have to,

584
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,686
but thank you.

585
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:10,278
At what age did you decide
you wanted to be a doctor?

586
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,447
Because...

587
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,450
I saw in your room that

588
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,704
there's a photo of you
wearing a doctor's costume.

589
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,038
Just curious.

590
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,833
When was it…

591
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,753
That was at
my 6th birthday party.

592
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,047
Actually, I don’t remember

593
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,299
the exact age, but

594
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,970
since I was young, I’ve always
been at our hospital.

595
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,391
I also saw how my parents
took care of the patients.

596
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:39,892
That’s why.

597
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,769
I wanted to be like them.

598
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,063
It's good that at a young age,

599
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,567
you already knew what
you wanted to do in life.

600
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,443
How about you?

601
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,657
I don't know what I really want,

602
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,118
even though I'll be
graduating next year.

603
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,247
I took Communications,
not because it’s my passion.

604
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,209
I just did it because
I wanted to go against my dad.

605
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,837
Because I know that after this,

606
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,798
he’ll just dictate everything

607
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,134
he wants me to do with my life.

608
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,096
Your life is yours, Sam.

609
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,434
But if there
were no limitations,

610
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,436
what would you want to do?

611
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,570
Don’t laugh, okay?

612
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,489
You’re already laughing.

613
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,655
No. No, I’m not.

614
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,949
- Okay.
- Well?

615
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,246
I was thinking…

616
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,707
if I could…

617
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,586
model?

618
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,632
Don’t laugh.

619
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,758
I’m not laughing, I swear.

620
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,759
Okay.

621
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,930
What?

622
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,810
That’s a good idea.

623
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,854
It suits you.

624
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,565
I mean,

625
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,069
objectively speaking,
you have the physique,

626
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,570
you have the height.

627
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,406
Looks? Do you have it?

628
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,241
Yes, you have the looks,

629
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,494
and the personality of a model.

630
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,996
Really now…

631
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,750
Just say that I’m beautiful.

632
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,335
That’s it!
That confidence of yours,

633
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,338
you’ll need that if you
want to be a model.

634
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Thanks.

635
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,426
For?

636
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,681
For saying that
I could be a model.

637
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,600
Your words boost my confidence.

638
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,477
But, yeah...

639
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,980
I still need to think about it.

640
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,773
You don’t have to hurry.

641
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,070
Samantha Maureen Vera.

642
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,197
- Yes?
- Maureen.

643
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,283
Maui.

644
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,619
Can I call you, Maui?

645
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,624
Only my family
gets to call me that.

646
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,835
Why? Am I not family?

647
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,255
I’m your future husband,
to be exact.

648
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,217
Is he serious, or
is he just teasing me again?

649
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,636
Nice try.

650
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,931
But I think you’re
forgetting our agreement.

651
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,309
We won’t last a day
until our wedding.

652
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,019
Are you sure?

653
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,023
Why? Do you...

654
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,774
like me now?

655
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:38,988
Do you?

656
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,618
No! I don’t like you.

657
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,285
Good.

658
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,038
Then the feeling is mutual.

659
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,874
I don’t like you
that way as well.

660
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Okay.

661
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,003
It’s settled then.

662
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,838
We both don’t like each other.

663
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,091
But at least,
we don't hate each other.

664
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,637
We can manage to live
in this house peacefully.

665
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,639
Right.

666
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,517
Anyway, I need to
go back to studying.

667
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,728
Thanks for the food, Mau...

668
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,649
I mean, Sam.

669
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,985
Yes, no problem.

670
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,951
It’s still too early for him
to call me, Maui.

671
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,663
It's too risky.
Maybe in the future.

672
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,915
Are you eating well, Yanna?

673
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,709
Don’t forget to eat
fruits and veggies, okay?

674
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,545
And avoid coffee and soda.

675
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,382
As much as possible,
try to eat more fiber.

676
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,968
Grandma already mentioned that.

677
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,679
Also, avoid doing
heavy chores, okay?

678
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,515
Just rest,
you might hurt yourself.

679
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,808
Yes, Sam!

680
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,018
I'm already being nagged
by Mom and Grandma,

681
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,354
and now you're adding to it?

682
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,065
I can't see this pregnancy
getting into any trouble

683
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,150
with all these
naggers around me.

684
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,151
Jeez!

685
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,406
What about you?

686
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,616
How’s everything
with your fiancé?

687
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,243
Is he still grumpy?

688
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,745
Lately, we’re okay.

689
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,581
We’ve been nice to each other,
and we’re having

690
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,334
a lot of good conversations.

691
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,712
Surprisingly,
he’s fun to talk to.

692
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,173
So he's being nice to you now?

693
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,882
Are you ready for a taste?

694
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,343
Bitch! No!

695
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,511
There is no tasting
happening because

696
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,431
we're not in that
kind of relationship.

697
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,225
Besides, we’re breaking the
engagement in the near future,

698
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,185
remember?

699
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:36,646
You could still go for it.
You're both single,

700
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,607
and you guys
do look good together.

701
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,401
Give it a chance! Who knows?

702
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,945
No. We talked about it
a while ago.

703
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,780
We made it clear that

704
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,532
we don’t like each other.

705
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,368
Then why do
you look disappointed?

706
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,329
No, I’m not.

707
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,333
I'm just happy that we're
already in friendly territory.

708
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,918
And that’s as far as it can go.

709
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,421
Okay, if you say so.

710
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,893
You need to fix it. Like this...

711
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,894
Okay...

712
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:18,856
Hey!

713
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,523
Did you just take a photo of us?

714
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,068
I was fixing my bra.

715
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,861
No, I’m not.

716
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:28,074
Did she just roll her eyes?
So rude.

717
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,910
Hey, let it go.

718
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,329
No, Sam. She took our picture
without our consent.

719
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,789
That is not right,

720
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,750
especially because
she's invading our privacy.

721
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,669
You better not upload that.

722
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,340
Right! What if she’s going to
use it for other purposes?

723
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,715
Like what?

724
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,259
You think I’m gonna take your
photo, make a fake account,

725
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,346
and start chatting with old men
using your face?

726
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,056
Thanks for the idea, by the way!

727
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,643
Oh my god. Why is she so rude?

728
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,062
Girls, just let it go.

729
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,814
I’ll handle it. It’s fine.

730
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,441
Naomi, can we talk? Please?

731
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,402
You know her, Sam?

732
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,907
Kind of, she's...

733
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,743
She’s my friend.

734
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,038
All right. We’re just
going to buy food.

735
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,539
Do you want anything?

736
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,376
It’s okay, girls. You can go.

737
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:29,969
Naomi,

738
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,263
I’m sorry about what happened.

739
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,724
Can you just delete the photo?

740
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,893
I did not take a photo!

741
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,520
See it for yourself.

742
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,778
You really have to check, huh?

743
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,614
Of course,
you believe your friends.

744
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,409
You can’t even tell them
I’m your sister.

745
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,454
I’m sorry. I thought

746
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,790
you wanted us to treat each
other like strangers in school.

747
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,417
I didn’t know...

748
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,585
Yeah, you’re right.

749
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:05,504
Maybe we should treat each other
like strangers here in school.

750
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,049
You couldn’t even
defend me from them.

751
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,614
Hey.

752
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,327
Are you okay?

753
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,953
Yes. I’m okay.

754
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,247
Are you sure you're okay?

755
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,123
Yes.

756
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,960
What do you want for dinner?
I'm buying.

757
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,631
I’m not hungry.
But thank you for offering.

758
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:54,261
By the way, I have an
org party this Friday.

759
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,305
It’s a fundraising event.

760
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,140
Do you want to attend?

761
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,768
I can’t.

762
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,063
I still need to finish
my readings.

763
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,899
But I’ll just buy a ticket
to help out.

764
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,483
Okay.

765
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,736
Thank you, Clyden.

766
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,946
I’ll go to sleep now.

767
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,490
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

768
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,421
Let’s have a family
dinner tomorrow.

769
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,715
Don’t be late.

770
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,970
I have no energy for
a family dinner tomorrow.

771
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,933
I don’t even know how Naomi
will react when she sees me.

772
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,110
Summer! Hi!

773
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:05,416
Are you here to comfort me? Huh?

774
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,835
Babies!

775
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,589
So cute! Thank you.

776
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,938
Where’s Clyden?

777
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,732
You didn’t tell me
I should bring him,

778
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,026
so I didn’t invite him.

779
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,819
And I think he’s also
busy with his studies.

780
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,947
Well, you should
always bring him.

781
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,617
Besides, he's your
future husband.

782
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,870
And you should
get to know him more.

783
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,081
You should force yourself
to get to know him.

784
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,499
Maui,

785
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,378
make sure he doesn’t back out
of this engagement.

786
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,255
You need him.

787
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,966
No, I don’t.

788
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,386
Yes, Mom.
I’ll bring him next time.

789
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,305
Good.

790
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,354
Naomi, do you have plans
for your birthday?

791
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,898
It’s your 18th birthday.

792
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:12,899
Well…

793
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,277
Nothing grand.

794
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,530
She’s gonna have a little
get-together with her friends.

795
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,617
Mom, it’s her 18th birthday.

796
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,994
It should be grand
if she wants it to be.

797
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,746
Honey, just because your
18th birthday was grand

798
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,999
doesn’t mean hers has to be too.

799
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,377
Besides, we talked
about it already.

800
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:35,339
A little get-together with
her friends will do.

801
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,841
Can you stop talking
about my birthday?

802
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,259
Stop acting like
you care about me.

803
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,179
You don’t know anything
about me. It’s annoying.

804
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,514
Naomi!

805
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,143
You’re such an ungrateful kid,
you know that?

806
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,895
You should be thankful

807
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,981
your sister even remembered your
birthday when no one else did.

808
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,232
Mom!

809
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,944
Don’t raise your
voice at me, Maureen.

810
00:44:58,946 --> 00:44:59,946
You.

811
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,115
I’m so disappointed in you.

812
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,034
You’re grounded.
Go to your room!

813
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,285
Yeah.

814
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,746
Like it would even
make a difference.

815
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,541
I’m used to it anyway.

816
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,168
God!

817
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,213
Mom, don’t do that to her.

818
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,216
Don’t jail her in her room.

819
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,927
Maui, she needs
to be disciplined.

820
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,264
And you,
don’t disappoint me too.

821
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,362
Hey.

822
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,323
How’s dinner?

823
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:45,909
It was okay.

824
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,538
Did something happen?

825
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,791
I’ve noticed since yesterday
that you’re not okay.

826
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,838
I’m having problems
with my sister.

827
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,259
Do you need a hug?

828
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,434
Can you give me a hug?

829
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:16,857
Come here.

830
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,546
You smell nice.

831
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,491
You just took a shower,
didn’t you?

832
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,633
Sorry.

833
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,219
I just came from a jog.

834
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,722
From jogging? But you still
smell like baby powder?

835
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,348
Wow.

836
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,351
I can feel your heartbeat.

837
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,772
But I’ll just pretend
that I can’t.

838
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,779
I hope things will
get better soon, Sam.

839
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,989
Thanks, Cy.

840
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,408
I really needed that.

841
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,370
And you know what?

842
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,706
You can call me Maui,
if you like.

843
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,294
Sure, Maui.

844
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:30,389
Thanks for buying tickets
for the fundraising party.

845
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,182
I hope you can still make it.

846
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,059
I can’t promise,

847
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,311
but I’ll try.

848
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,898
Okay, thanks.

849
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,634
Hey!

850
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,429
Luna’s getting nervous.

851
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,848
Don’t worry. Kalix is not going.

852
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,600
- Just enjoy the night.
- Okay.

853
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,809
Let’s go! Let’s go!

854
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,437
All right.

855
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,398
Come on, guys. Energy!

856
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,485
Wow! She’s got energy.

857
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,653
You’re full of energy, girl!

858
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,030
What’s up? Got some good news?

859
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,159
Not really. I’m just
in the mood to party.

860
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,243
Really?

861
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,079
Our friend here is really happy.

862
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,831
Let’s dance!

863
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,416
Like this.

864
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,001
Go, Sevi.

865
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,086
Hey, Sam? What the...

866
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,006
- Come on!
- Are you drunk?

867
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,342
I’m not drunk, Sevi.
Come on, dance with me.

868
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,802
Let’s go, Luna.

869
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,792
This is fun.

870
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,419
Oh, god.

871
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,716
That color suits you.

872
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,050
Thanks.

873
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,595
You know what,
let’s take a break.

874
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,716
Let’s have dinner for a bit?

875
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,474
Yes, I’m starving.

876
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,184
Cy, ikaw?

877
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,771
Pass. I need to finish
everything by 7PM.

878
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,065
Why? What’s up?

879
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,026
There’s an important event
I need to go to.

880
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,611
What event?

881
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,654
You know, Eva,
you’re such a gossip, huh?

882
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,573
Don’t worry about it!
You know what?

883
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,867
Let’s just eat. Okay?

884
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,203
My brain can’t handle any
more medical terms right now.

885
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,830
- Come on.
- You’re treating, right?

886
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,041
No promises.

887
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,714
This is the first time
I’ll meet your fiancée.

888
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,467
I still can’t believe

889
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,844
you’re actually engaged.

890
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:39,554
Wow!

891
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,056
Sir, flowers for sale. Only 150.

892
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,183
Should I buy?

893
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,558
This is really cheap, sir.

894
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,186
A small one should be fine.

895
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,771
- How much?
- 150.

896
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,526
Thank you, boss. Thank you!

897
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,236
That’s good enough.

898
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:56,737
No.

899
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,698
- How much is this?
- 350, boss.

900
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,075
You can just add 200.

901
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,077
200...

902
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,830
- All right, then.
- Thank you, boss.

903
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,541
- Thanks.
- Let’s go.

904
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,670
Shit! No— Not enough.

905
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,921
How much is this?

906
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,589
600, boss.
Are you sure about this?

907
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,508
Yes.

908
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,385
Here you go, just add 400.

909
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:19,886
Keep the change.

910
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,054
Hey! Thanks, boss.

911
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,139
You might as well
buy everything.

912
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,349
Let’s go.

913
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,482
Hey!

914
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,652
Hey, what’s up, mamacita?

915
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,279
Are you new here?

916
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,740
Damn, this is some
real party, bro.

917
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:44,286
Your bouquet looks
out of place, though.

918
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,912
I thought it was a formal event.

919
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,791
How can it be a formal event
when it’s literally at a bar?

920
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,003
Sure, Cy. Sure.

921
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,006
Where’s Maui?

922
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,477
If you stopped ignoring
my messages and calls,

923
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,980
then maybe you would know.

924
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:17,861
I’m sorry, I didn’t answer
your calls earlier.

925
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,366
Here’s the playboy!

926
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,536
I think it’s really time
to go now.

927
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,622
No. So cute! One more!

928
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,624
Let’s go now.

929
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,418
Do you guys know
how wild the party was?

930
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,087
Sam here was so hyper!

931
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:40,633
She was even giving
Sevi a sexy dance!

932
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,343
While Sevi was just standing
there like a statue.

933
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,720
It’s been a while since
we all went out together.

934
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,390
What do you expect?
Yanna hasn’t been around.

935
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,516
Do you know
what happened to her?

936
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,726
Yes, where is she anyway?

937
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,686
Hi, girls!

938
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:52,978
- Hi!
- Hi, Eva!

939
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,397
They’re my friends.

940
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,774
So nice to meet you.

941
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,443
What’s your problem?

942
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,944
Nothing!

943
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,155
Go, drive Eva home.

944
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,949
What’s your problem?

945
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,076
Are you jealous?
