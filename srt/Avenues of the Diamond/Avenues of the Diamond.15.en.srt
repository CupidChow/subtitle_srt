1
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:13,661
- Can you cuddle with me?
- Yeah, sure.

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,350
Sam, can you stop
moving, please?

3
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,936
I’m sorry.

4
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,231
‘Cause your behind is
brushing on my—

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,168
front.

6
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,199
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,867
- Welcome to your bachelorette party!
- Yes, sir!

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,577
- I love you too!
- I love you too!

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,789
Do you mind extending
the fun with me?

10
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,382
I may be the first
one to get married—

11
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,092
but I’m claiming it now.

12
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,054
All of us will get married

13
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,223
and have our
own happily ever afters

14
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,518
with people who truly love us.

15
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,125
OMG. It really is Samantha Vera!

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,401
Who’s that with her?

17
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,694
That’s not Haze.

18
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:14,824
Samantha Vera, are you cheating
on Haze Juarez?

19
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,826
It’s okay.

20
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,746
No.

21
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,123
Haze and I are just friends.

22
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,210
What’s your relationship
with Clyden Ramirez?

23
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:26,211
Are you two together?

24
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,754
- Yeah, are you two a couple?
- It’s okay, Avi.

25
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:28,546
Are you a couple now?

26
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,089
- Are you a couple now?
- Sam.

27
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,089
Sam, let’s go.

28
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,757
Yes.

29
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,425
We’re together.

30
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,677
So, stop asking now.

31
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,098
You can stop asking now, okay?

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,866
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.

33
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,891
Let’s go.

34
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,187
So is it true?

35
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,146
No doubt about it.

36
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,229
Yes,

37
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,982
we’re together.

38
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,609
So stop asking.

39
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,448
So is it true? Clyden Ramirez
is Sam’s boyfriend?

40
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,117
Baby daddy confirmed?

41
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,577
I thought Haze
was the baby daddy?

42
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,955
Sounds like Sam was seeing both
guys at the same time.

43
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,707
Sam never even admitted that
she and Haze were a thing!

44
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,209
I think she’s the one
in that blind item

45
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,627
about a girl with two guys.

46
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,672
And she’s not even sure who the
real father of her baby is!

47
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,050
Honestly, I’m so disappointed
in Samantha Vera.

48
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,886
I’m a huge fan.
I love her advocacies.

49
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,430
I thought she was
a decent woman.

50
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,393
What were you
thinking, Samantha?

51
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,811
I’m your manager!

52
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,896
I should’ve known about this.

53
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,107
Now I had to find out online
that you have a boyfriend?

54
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,943
I’m sorry. I should’ve told you,

55
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,612
but we weren’t sure of
our relationship yet, so—

56
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,490
I don’t care if
you’re official or not.

57
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,034
The fact that you’re
seeing a high-profile man

58
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,453
is a really big scoop
for the media, Sam.

59
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,581
The brands tied to your
name could pull out.

60
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,416
And don’t forget about
your morality clause.

61
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,792
And now look,

62
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,087
there are even more stories
coming out about you two.

63
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,215
I don’t even know
what’s real or not.

64
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,845
The truth is—

65
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,222
Clyden is my ex.

66
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,516
What?

67
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,019
Actually, he’s not just my ex.

68
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,979
He was my fiancé.

69
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,273
Our parents arranged
for us to be married.

70
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,608
But

71
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,818
when the scandal
about my family came out,

72
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,529
Clyden and I had to break up.

73
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,241
We haven't talked to each other
for years, until recently.

74
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,993
Shit, Sam.

75
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,829
I’m pretty sure that
they will dig into your past.

76
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,915
News spreads fast,
you know that.

77
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,585
Content creators are
now making money

78
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,879
off the drama of celebrities.

79
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,631
Just like you.

80
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,468
Hi, guys. We’re here today
at Ramirez Hospital.

81
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,680
Someone challenged me to
interview Dr. Clyden Ramirez.

82
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,809
Challenge accepted.

83
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,562
I’m gonna be a fake
patient for today’s video.

84
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:52,750
Nurse!
Nurse! It really hurts.

85
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,734
Help me.

86
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,780
I saw our target,
he’s on the other side.

87
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,449
Doc!

88
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,409
My stomach really hurts.

89
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,494
Where exactly does it hurt?

90
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,516
Here, doc.

91
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,832
Doc, how’s Sam doing?

92
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,460
Arah, what should we do?

93
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,545
I don’t want Clyden
to get dragged into this.

94
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,632
The moment you two
admitted you were dating,

95
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,760
he automatically
became part of the issue.

96
00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:24,280
What kind of pain
are you feeling?

97
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,765
Is it like cramping?

98
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,768
Doc, you’re trending
online right now.

99
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:31,496
I don’t know what
you’re referring to, but sir,

100
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,921
can we please
focus on your health?

101
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:35,073
What happened was wild.

102
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,985
They said you guys
cheated on Haze?

103
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,444
Is that true, Doc?

104
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,946
What?

105
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:43,047
Come here.

106
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:44,117
- Get him.
- Where?

107
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,286
Get them out. They’re
pretending to be a patient.

108
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:48,263
- Get them out of here.
- Sir.

109
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,977
- Hurry.
- You need to leave now.

110
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,474
- Sir, please don’t.
- Wait.

111
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,834
- Sir, I’m not.
- Doc!

112
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,544
- Sir!
- Stop resisting.

113
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,545
Sir! Sir!

114
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,921
- Sir!
- Enough.

115
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,630
You’re still pretending.

116
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,257
- Sir!
- Busted! We got caught.

117
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,009
- Doc couldn’t even answer.
- Please don’t, sir. Sir!

118
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,516
So it looks like it’s true.

119
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,163
Doc, you’re being called
to the director’s office.

120
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,843
I will see what I can do,

121
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,102
but it’s not looking good.

122
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,190
I hope Clyden is not
having a hard time right now.

123
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,640
I’ve been getting
so many reports

124
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,934
about fake patients in the ER.

125
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,728
They’re wasting our resources.

126
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,772
There’s also
a lot of media outside.

127
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,274
What are you trying to do? Huh?

128
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,820
The hospital’s reputation is
ruined because of you.

129
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,906
Every time you get involved
with that woman,

130
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,199
there’s always trouble.

131
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,659
Damn it!

132
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,786
Just because of a woman?

133
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,622
What happened to
being the “perfect son”?

134
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,583
What good are you now?

135
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,460
Huh, Cy?

136
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,129
So if you still have
any shame left,

137
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,673
just resign instead of
causing more trouble.

138
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,258
Or you know what?

139
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,470
You’re better off just
going with that woman.

140
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,181
What’s her name again?

141
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,560
Samantha Vera?

142
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,814
That slut from a corrupt family.

143
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,942
Don’t you fucking dare
talk about Sam like that.

144
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,278
Let me remind you,

145
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,114
you’re only in that position
because I turned it down.

146
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,516
If I really wanted to, I could
easily take it back from you.

147
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,828
That’s why I’m not
gonna resign, Charles.

148
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,271
Because we both know,

149
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:38,572
between the two of us,
you’re the useless one.

150
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:40,389
In fact, I pity you.

151
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,336
A lot.

152
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:46,382
‘Cause this hospital is all you
ever have going for you.

153
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,719
So, go fuck yourself!

154
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,889
Fuck you, asshole!

155
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,328
So yeah,

156
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,749
it’s confirmed, Samantha Vera and Clyden
Ramirez were in an arranged marriage.

157
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,584
They say it was
for political reasons.

158
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,462
But when the scandal with
Senator Vera broke out,

159
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,589
the Ramirez family
suddenly backed out

160
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,674
so they wouldn’t
get dragged into it.

161
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,512
Maybe that’s why
the wedding was canceled,

162
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,223
to hide that the
Ramirezes were involved.

163
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,767
That Ramirez family
seems shady, too.

164
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,394
Looks like they already
made money off the Veras.

165
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,438
The hospital suddenly
expanded like crazy.

166
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,857
So, how true is it that
Clyden topped the boards

167
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,442
if people say it
was all paid for?

168
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,818
Honestly, I wouldn’t
be surprised.

169
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,861
He’s a nepo baby.

170
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,155
Everything’s just
about money now.

171
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,658
This is all my fault!

172
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,786
I did this to Cy! Fuck!

173
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,542
Sam: Hey, are you okay?

174
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,044
I’m so sorry for
dragging you into my mess.

175
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,128
Hello, Maui? Are you okay?

176
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,728
Hey, Clyden.

177
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,773
I’m really sorry, Cy.

178
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,608
This is all my fault.

179
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,236
I shouldn’t have said
we were together.

180
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:32,555
I should’ve protected you
from the public.

181
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,950
Hey, you don’t need
to apologize. I’m okay.

182
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,786
You didn’t do anything wrong.

183
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,289
I’m the one who should’ve
protected you from them.

184
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,833
So, how are you? No one’s
bothering you over there?

185
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,544
Stay off social media
for now, and don’t go out.

186
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,173
I know it’s not easy,
but it’ll help.

187
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,883
Thank you, Cy.

188
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,427
Even with everything going on,

189
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,761
you’re still thinking about me.

190
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,223
If anyone bothers you,
let me know, okay?

191
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,684
It's okay. I’m okay.

192
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,520
No one’s bothering me
here either.

193
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,105
Take care, okay?

194
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,194
Let’s go.

195
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,250
Hey, Samantha Vera!
My kid used to idolize you,

196
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,003
but wow, you’re such
a disappointment!

197
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,005
So many kids
look up to you,

198
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,928
and it turns out you’re
a terrible role model.

199
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:35,234
I’m burning all
of my kid’s magazines!

200
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,260
You’re disgusting!

201
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,967
You’re no different
from your father! Rotten!

202
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:42,091
How did this person
get my personal number?

203
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:46,495
You’re a bad role model!
You’re disgusting!

204
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,564
You’re no different
from your father!

205
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:51,050
I’ve tried my best to be
a decent person,

206
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,280
to be different
from my parents.

207
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,489
And yet just
one wrong move,

208
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,866
and people have been
so quick to judge me.

209
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:01,752
I know I’m not perfect.

210
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:04,209
But do I really deserve
this kind of hate?

211
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,834
Yanna: We’re booking
a flight home.

212
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,253
There’s no way you’re
facing this alone.

213
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,839
Luna: Sam, we’re right here.
Let’s just go for a drink!

214
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,926
Sevi: Stay strong, Sam.
Ignore the bashers!

215
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,719
They don’t know how
kind you really are!

216
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,304
Kierra: If you need
someone to talk to,

217
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,931
we’ll come see you anytime.

218
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,017
Via: Sam, just always remember
we love you, okay?

219
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,602
We’re here for you.

220
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,355
Auntie, are you okay?

221
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:32,779
Auntie, are you crying?

222
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,112
Auntie, don’t cry.

223
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,199
If you’re sad, then I’m sad too.

224
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,206
Auntie’s just going
through something, baby.

225
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,457
But I’ll be okay soon.

226
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,431
Everything will be
all right, Auntie.

227
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,297
I always pray to Papa Jesus
that he will protect you.

228
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,135
Eat this, so you’ll
be happy again.

229
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:04,215
Thank you, baby.

230
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:05,987
Thank you.

231
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,069
Sam?

232
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,600
Yeah.

233
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:22,684
Haze, can you take care
of Avi for now?

234
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,886
All eyes are
on me right now,

235
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,663
and it could stress the kid.

236
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,667
Hey, I’m involved in
the issue too, you know.

237
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,128
I’m sorry.

238
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,006
It’s all right. I can handle it.

239
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,299
How are you?

240
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,885
Not good.

241
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,846
That’s why I need your
help to take care of Avi.

242
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:44,921
Sure.

243
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:47,741
Avi will be much safer
here at our parents’ house.

244
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,727
I’ll just pick her up
at your condo.

245
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:54,559
No, actually, we’re already
on our way there.

246
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:57,683
There are a lot of reporters
and content creators

247
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:58,903
waiting outside the condo,

248
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,031
and things will get worse
if they see you here too.

249
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,992
All right. I’ll wait
for you here.

250
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,494
Thank you, Haze.

251
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,455
And I’m really sorry
for dragging you into this.

252
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,832
Don’t worry about me, Sam.

253
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,543
Focus on yourself
and take care, okay?

254
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,069
See you.

255
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,930
Let’s go, baby.

256
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,919
Look who’s here!

257
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,794
- Hello, love.
- Uncle!

258
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,025
Are you going to buy me lots
of toys and food again?

259
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,903
You’re spoiling her too much.

260
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,697
Wow! You’re one
to talk, huh?

261
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,710
Hey!

262
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,204
Go up to your
room first, okay?

263
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,997
I’ll prepare you
something to eat.

264
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,667
Bye, Auntie!

265
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,085
Bye, baby.

266
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,337
Don’t be sad, okay?

267
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,923
Okay, I promise.

268
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,306
Thank you for agreeing
to look after Avi.

269
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,642
But please don’t bring
her to your dates.

270
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,978
She’s just a kid; you gotta
protect her innocence.

271
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,440
So, what’s your plan now?

272
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,653
I’m sure there are tons of media
waiting outside your condo.

273
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,488
Yeah.

274
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:28,709
I already asked Kalix if
I could borrow his parking space

275
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,537
so they won’t see me arriving.

276
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,092
I see.

277
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,583
I saw your video.

278
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,918
“Haze and I are just friends.”

279
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,591
That kinda hurt, you know?

280
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,261
I thought we had
something special.

281
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,247
You just can’t be serious, no?

282
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,725
Anyway, I’m leaving now.

283
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,560
Okay then, take care.

284
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,980
Hey, one more thing.

285
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,566
If you’re going to
run from the media—

286
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,651
wear heels.

287
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:22,381
Arah: Sam, have you seen this?!

288
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,772
Your ex’s mom
just did an interview!

289
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:26,147
This is bad!

290
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,140
These allegations made me sick.

291
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,477
You know, my family and I
have cut ties with the Veras

292
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,604
ever since before
this incident happened.

293
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:41,863
And besides,
we’re in the medical field.

294
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:44,265
We value honesty
and integrity,

295
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,111
especially when it
comes to our patients.

296
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,907
And being involved with Senator
Vera is against our values.

297
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:52,315
That’s exactly why we
canceled our son’s engagement

298
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,925
with Samantha Vera.

299
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,874
So please, stop linking
their family to ours.

300
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,794
But ma’am, are you
aware that your son

301
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,587
is dating
Samantha Vera again?

302
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,590
Well, you haven’t heard anything
from my son, right?

303
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,009
So, those two are not dating.

304
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,682
OMG. So what now?

305
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,684
Did Sam force herself
on Clyden again?

306
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,477
What kind of
bribe did she use this time?

307
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,063
Is Clyden’s family throwing
her under the bus?

308
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,440
I feel like the mom’s
version is more believable,

309
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,942
because if they
were really dating,

310
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,653
- why won’t Clyden confirm it?
- Samantha Vera

311
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,321
delulu era it is!

312
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,369
I’m tired. So fucking
tired of all this.

313
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,204
When will it ever end?

314
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:42,126
Jaida Ramirez: Hello, Sam.
This is Clyden’s mom.

315
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,087
I’m on my way to
your condo. Can we talk?

316
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,108
Good afternoon.
Please come inside.

317
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,323
Would you like
a drink or anything?

318
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,118
Well, no need. This will be fast anyways.

319
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,329
And I need to clear
everything out for you.

320
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,418
I will, ma’am. I’m just waiting
for my manager’s call.

321
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,380
Well, I don’t know if you
and my son are really dating.

322
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,467
But please, stop tarnishing
the relationship

323
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,852
between my son and his dad.

324
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,887
They’re not even
talking anymore.

325
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,181
He refused another marriage.

326
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,224
He lost his inheritance.

327
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,602
And I’m sure you know
the reason why.

328
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,229
What? I don’t understand.

329
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,940
Well, my son hasn’t
accepted any of our help

330
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,525
since you two broke up.

331
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,111
I don’t want you anymore.

332
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,907
You’re nothing without
your family’s money.

333
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:56,619
I’m nothing?

334
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,621
My son doesn’t want to
accept any kind of help anymore.

335
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,791
I literally had to beg him
to take the hospital room

336
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,250
we were offering him.

337
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,544
At first, he refused.

338
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:10,380
But eventually, he accepted it
out of necessity.

339
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:16,220
But I believe he only took it so
the other residents could use it

340
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,681
Sam, don’t take this
the wrong way.

341
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,435
But this is the worst time to be
dragging my son into this mess.

342
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,229
He’s already struggling
with his life

343
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,480
without our support.

344
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,109
And a scandal like this
will burden him even more.

345
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,693
So please don’t add to it.

346
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,248
It feels like history
is repeating itself.

347
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,751
Maybe I really am
no good for Cy.

348
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,411
Yanna?

349
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:25,614
I’m here.

350
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,166
I’m here.

351
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,042
- Yanna…
- I’m here. I’m here.

352
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,645
Take a sit first.

353
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:50,754
You haven’t been answering
my messages or calls.

354
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,610
You haven’t even
checked in with the group.

355
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,280
We’re all really
worried about you.

356
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,576
I really thought something
bad happened to you,

357
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,037
that’s why I told Hiro
we had to come back.

358
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,499
Yanna—

359
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,170
I’m sorry I ruined
your honeymoon.

360
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,714
Go back. Don’t worry about me.

361
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,924
I’m okay.

362
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,927
How can I enjoy myself
knowing you’re not okay?

363
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,431
If you can drop everything

364
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,642
when I’m feeling down,

365
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,269
then I can drop
everything too—

366
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,732
even Hiro, just to be with you.

367
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,028
No. Hiro’s probably
mad at me right now.

368
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,280
He’s the one who
booked my flight, actually.

369
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,282
He understands.

370
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,617
Don’t feel guilty.

371
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,375
Give me your phone.

372
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,464
You’re not allowed
to read any comments

373
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,882
or posts tonight.

374
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,636
That won’t do any good
for your mental health.

375
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,431
You’re right.

376
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:12,479
Good thing you’re
here to stop me.

377
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,569
Yanna, can you stay
with me tonight, please?

378
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,491
I honestly feel lost
and scared right now.

379
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,787
Do you even have to ask?

380
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,748
I was already planning
on sleeping here tonight.

381
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,170
At least, I have Yanna.
I will always have Yanna.

382
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,568
- Morning.
- Morning.

383
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,861
Sam, I’m heading out
for a bit, okay?

384
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,821
I just need to fix something
at work real quick.

385
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,866
It’s okay, Yanna. Just do
what you have to do.

386
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,410
Thanks for staying here, okay?

387
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,203
And for cooking breakfast.

388
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,414
Of course.

389
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,796
But Sam...

390
00:22:20,752 --> 00:22:22,671
Before you say thank you, can
you please take a shower first?

391
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,527
You smell like alcohol.

392
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,095
Even your breath!

393
00:22:27,316 --> 00:22:28,818
You seriously smell
like alcohol!

394
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:31,095
Fine! I’ll shower, okay?

395
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,019
All right, I’m heading out now.

396
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:38,806
Eat your breakfast and
reply to my message, okay?

397
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:39,858
Yes.

398
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,443
- Okay.
- Yes, I will.

399
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:42,828
- Bye!
- Bye.

400
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:43,983
Thank you.

401
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:02,297
No, I should stop
reading comments online.

402
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,673
It’s not good for me.

403
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,759
But,

404
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,637
I’m just curious about what
people are saying about me.

405
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,138
I feel like I need to.

406
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,723
I want to know.

407
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:22,105
I really didn’t expect
that from Samantha.

408
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,444
I thought her image
was so clean.

409
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,822
She has so many
charity projects.

410
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,408
Now I don’t even know if
all of that was just for show.

411
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,076
Such a waste, she’s so pretty.

412
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,663
What’s the point of being pretty
if your attitude is trash?

413
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,249
How can they say
my attitude is trash?

414
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:40,458
That everything I did
to help others was fake?

415
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,337
They don’t even know me!

416
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,639
The same people who once
praised me for clicks and clout

417
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,599
are now the ones
attacking me.

418
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,102
Not even one person
is standing up for me?

419
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,271
They all left me?

420
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,148
Wasn’t there another
issue with her dad?

421
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,567
They said he killed his
mistress and made up

422
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,027
-some other reason to cover it up.
- Didn’t they have a child?

423
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,529
- Naomi, right?
- There haven’t been any updates

424
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,905
about Naomi.

425
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,490
People are saying
she was killed, too.

426
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,825
Maybe he got rid of her, too.

427
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,661
Even Samantha hasn’t
said anything about it.

428
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,121
Why?

429
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,915
Why are you dragging
Naomi into this, too?

430
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,043
I’ve had enough.

431
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,629
This needs to stop.

432
00:24:25,694 --> 00:24:27,237
I need to be
stronger than this.

433
00:24:27,262 --> 00:24:30,598
For Naomi, for Cy,
and for myself.

434
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:34,169
Arah, please organize
a tell-all interview.

435
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,642
I want to clear up all
the issues once and for all.

436
00:24:38,283 --> 00:24:40,363
Let them judge me after this.

437
00:24:40,862 --> 00:24:42,864
Sam, are you sure?

438
00:24:43,265 --> 00:24:44,902
This won’t be easy.

439
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,528
Yes. I’m 100% sure.

440
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,157
I have to speak up.
I have to defend myself.

441
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,868
Okay. I understand.

442
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,536
I know a trusted journalist.

443
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,288
I’ll schedule an
appointment with her.

444
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,459
Thank you. Also, please,

445
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,462
book my flight to New York
as soon as possible.

446
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,005
I want to leave soon.

447
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,009
Okay. Give me at least
three days to prepare.

448
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,971
Sam? You got this, okay?
We’re here for you.

449
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,767
Thank you, Arah, for everything.

450
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,699
Cy.

451
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,875
Why aren’t you answering me?

452
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,683
I—

453
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,882
I’m sorry.

454
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,063
Sam, I’m sorry.

455
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,824
Why are you apologizing?

456
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:11,439
If I hadn’t approached
you again,

457
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:13,341
none of this
would’ve happened.

458
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,947
I shouldn’t have
told you I still love you.

459
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,912
Sorry, Sam. It’s my fault.

460
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,291
Don’t apologize, Cy.

461
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:26,083
I’m the one who should be
saying sorry to you.

462
00:26:26,108 --> 00:26:27,776
This is all my fault.

463
00:26:29,895 --> 00:26:32,397
Maybe it was wrong
to make you hold on to me.

464
00:26:33,907 --> 00:26:36,034
I never wanted
to hurt you, Maui.

465
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,723
We’re both hurting.

466
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,768
Cy, please think
about yourself too.

467
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,523
It’s my fault your family got
dragged into this mess.

468
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,485
People are starting
to doubt your profession.

469
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:56,024
And I know you’re being
disturbed by the media.

470
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:57,885
Maui, I don’t even
care about that.

471
00:26:58,687 --> 00:26:59,688
Why?

472
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:02,104
Why aren’t you
answering my calls?

473
00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:05,172
Are you pushing me away again?

474
00:27:05,383 --> 00:27:07,010
- Cy…
- I’m sorry.

475
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:10,435
I just love you so much,

476
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,629
and I was hoping and praying

477
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:15,143
that we’ll be together again.

478
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:18,955
That night, when you left me,

479
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:21,489
all I wished for was
for you to come back.

480
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:24,746
I was angry when
you walked away,

481
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:27,608
because how could you end
everything in one night?

482
00:27:29,421 --> 00:27:31,256
Maui, was it my fault?

483
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:34,876
No.

484
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,577
Everything was just too
much for me that night.

485
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:46,166
Naomi, my parents, modeling.

486
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,407
And I didn’t want your
family to get caught up

487
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:50,725
in my family’s mess.

488
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,049
Part of the reason was that

489
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:57,954
I just wanted to save you
and your family’s reputation.

490
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,805
That time, I didn’t need
a savior, Maureen.

491
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,724
I just needed you
to stay with me.

492
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,895
Was it really that easy
for you to leave me?

493
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:10,943
No, Cy.

494
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,407
I just wanted to protect you,

495
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:17,273
and I failed.

496
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,742
Just like how I failed
to protect Naomi.

497
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:28,875
Your mom came to see me.

498
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:32,327
I found out about
your inheritance

499
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:35,147
and your relationship
with your dad.

500
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:37,827
Cy, I’m so sorry.
This is all my fault.

501
00:28:37,852 --> 00:28:39,187
Maui, stop.

502
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:42,376
It’s not your fault.
I made that choice.

503
00:28:43,328 --> 00:28:46,164
The hell with the inheritance
and another marriage.

504
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:50,314
If it’s not with you, I have no
intention of getting married.

505
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:56,322
Cy, I’m sorry.

506
00:28:58,588 --> 00:29:01,299
I’m truly sorry
for everything I did.

507
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,447
For not fighting for us,
then and now.

508
00:29:07,888 --> 00:29:09,807
For making you feel useless.

509
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:13,167
For making you blame yourself.

510
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:17,820
For making you feel
that I hate you.

511
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,475
None of those are true, Cy.

512
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:25,906
I love you.

513
00:29:28,521 --> 00:29:32,233
I can’t love anyone else
the way I love you.

514
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:38,719
Maui, it’s really
not your fault.

515
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,080
You didn’t fail to
protect me or Naomi.

516
00:29:44,662 --> 00:29:47,248
Do you know what
she told me before she left?

517
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,751
She talked to you?

518
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,711
She told me to
stay by your side

519
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,880
through all the highs and lows.

520
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:05,220
And to make sure I wipe
the tears off your face.

521
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,390
And that you should
never lose your smile.

522
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,268
And she also said,

523
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,314
“Sam is the happiest
when she’s free.”

524
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,990
You’re free when you're
at your happiest, Sam.

525
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,036
So let everything go,

526
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:32,827
even me.

527
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,628
Do something for
yourself this time, please.

528
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,103
Cy, can you please
confiscate my phone?

529
00:30:57,951 --> 00:31:00,746
I can’t stop reading
all the negative comments.

530
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,444
I think I’m starting
to get addicted to it.

531
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:05,526
I don’t even
know why. Maybe,

532
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,784
I’m just looking
for a few positive ones?

533
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,397
But it’s so hard.

534
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,415
Why don’t you check
your friends' posts?

535
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,335
I’m pretty sure they
sent you messages, too.

536
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,346
Luna: These comments are
really getting on my nerves!

537
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,998
The way these people judge,
it’s like they actually know Sam

538
00:31:34,023 --> 00:31:35,817
I swear I’m about
to respond to them!

539
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,064
Sevi: Too late. I’m already
replying to some of the comments

540
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,274
It’s so annoying.

541
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,651
Via: Hey, calm down, you two.

542
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,696
Don’t engage, it might
just make things worse.

543
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,325
Kierra: Yeah. We might end up
saying something

544
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,660
that’ll get Sam
into more trouble.

545
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,616
Sevi: What if I make
some dummy accounts?

546
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:00,960
Luna: Hey, Sevirous. We are not
turning into a troll farm!

547
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,582
Sevi: But I’m really
worried about Sam.

548
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:05,131
She’s not replying at all.

549
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,467
Kierra: Maybe she’s
not going online.

550
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,551
That might actually be better

551
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,595
than seeing all those
nasty comments.

552
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,848
Luna: @Sam, miss you.
We love you.

553
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,683
Luna: Should we just
go see her?

554
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,522
Sevi: I’m in!

555
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,194
Yanna: I’ll go.
I’m already on my way.

556
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,029
I’m really worried too.

557
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,616
Kierra: It might be better
if Yanna goes first.

558
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,994
Sam might get overwhelmed if
we all show up at once.

559
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:41,668
Via: Omg Yanna, yes please.
Be there for Sam,

560
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,386
and message us if she says
it’s okay for us to come too.

561
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:46,955
Luna: Tell her we love her!

562
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,761
Sevi: Let’s just post
encouraging messages for Sam.

563
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:51,663
- Who’s in?
- Luna: I’m in!

564
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,393
Sevi: Sam is one of the closest
and most generous friends I have.

565
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,437
Whether it’s a night out or
a breakdown, she’s always there.

566
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,190
She even supports me
at my basketball games,

567
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,109
even when I’m playing
against her school.

568
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,860
We love you, Sam!

569
00:33:11,768 --> 00:33:13,937
Luna: Not a lot of
people know this,

570
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,505
but ever since high school,

571
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,996
Sam has always held charity
events every Christmas

572
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,175
or on her birthday.

573
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,333
That’s just the kind of person
she is, genuinely kind-hearted.

574
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,254
She doesn’t post
about it on social media,

575
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,531
but she’s helped
so many people.

576
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:29,655
Love you, Sam!

577
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:35,497
Yanna: This is Avi,
my daughter.

578
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:38,925
I got pregnant with her
while I was in college.

579
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:43,980
At the time, I didn’t think I
could handle being a mom.

580
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:48,735
But I felt like I could
get through anything

581
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,611
because Sam was with me.

582
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,450
I used to ask her why she
wouldn’t just deny

583
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,203
being Avi’s mom whenever
people assumed she was.

584
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:02,281
And she always say,

585
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,502
“Avi is like a daughter to me.”

586
00:34:07,827 --> 00:34:09,829
That’s how much
she loves my child.

587
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:13,141
That’s how deeply
Samantha Vera loves.

588
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,199
Cy.

589
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,559
I feel guilty.

590
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:27,815
I feel guilty for thinking
that everyone left me.

591
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:34,113
I forgot that there are still
so many people who love me.

592
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,702
And I have such great friends.

593
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,413
You know why?

594
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,708
Because you're
a good person, Sam.

595
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,878
That’s why you
attract good people.

596
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,637
I’m tired of crying.

597
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,890
I wanna do something to
take my mind off everything.

598
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:05,895
But I can’t really
go out right now.

599
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,441
I know a therapeutic activity.

600
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,891
Really?

601
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,480
Really? The therapeutic activity
you’re talking about

602
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,606
is general cleaning?

603
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:55,145
Believe me.
It’s the best therapy.

604
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,673
Do you sleep with this?

605
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,736
No.

606
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,825
Of course not!

607
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,390
You know, Arah?

608
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,641
My manager.

609
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,519
She bought this as a joke.

610
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:33,441
One time, I ran out of PJs,
so I wore this.

611
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,942
But that was just one time.

612
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,194
That’s it, okay?

613
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,906
I can imagine.

614
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,372
I love this.

615
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,959
Just you and me
at home together.

616
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,421
Today has been a nice
escape from everything.

617
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,138
Arah: Hey Sam!
I e-mailed your flight details

618
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,348
to New York City.

619
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,058
You’re booked and
ready to go.

620
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,684
This is it Sam!

621
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:14,106
If only we could
stay like this forever.

622
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,765
Hey.

623
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,960
Should we save
some food for Yanna?

624
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,670
Isn’t she coming back?

625
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,272
No.

626
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,383
When she found
out you were here,

627
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,551
she said you should
take care of me for now.

628
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,514
Too bad, she won’t get
to taste my cooking.

629
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,564
Cy—

630
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,280
I’m leaving for New York
in three days.

631
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,457
Okay.

632
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,317
Give me strength, Naomi.

633
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,776
Hey.

634
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,489
You got this, okay?

635
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,201
Thanks, Cy.

636
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,290
I’m ready.

637
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:05,947
Samantha Vera, first of all,

638
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,887
how are you?

639
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:13,196
Honestly, I haven’t been well.

640
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,852
I’m hurt.

641
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,814
It hurts to see my personal life

642
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,483
being treated like
public entertainment.

643
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:22,575
And that’s why I'm here -

644
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,820
to tell my truth.

645
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:30,842
First of all, the issues with
my parents will remain theirs.

646
00:39:32,028 --> 00:39:34,113
Like my dad’s lawyer said,

647
00:39:34,434 --> 00:39:36,144
I already cut ties with them,

648
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:38,941
and I’m still not
ready to face them.

649
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:41,485
I’m on my healing journey,

650
00:39:42,176 --> 00:39:43,636
and I’m not there yet.

651
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:46,637
But no matter what happens,

652
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,346
I will never justify or
condone what they did.

653
00:39:50,995 --> 00:39:53,873
Is it true that you went
to New York for a while

654
00:39:53,998 --> 00:39:56,208
to escape your parents’ issues?

655
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,775
No. I went to New York to
continue pursuing my dream—

656
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,792
modeling.

657
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,461
But what about your engagement
with Doctor Clyden Ramirez?

658
00:40:07,826 --> 00:40:11,872
Is it true that supposedly,
it's an arranged marriage?

659
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:15,527
I’m confirming that I was once

660
00:40:15,552 --> 00:40:17,804
engaged to
Doctor Clyden Ramirez—

661
00:40:18,256 --> 00:40:20,425
the person I admitted
to dating days ago.

662
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,450
At first, the engagement
was forced.

663
00:40:24,995 --> 00:40:28,040
And we didn’t like
each other, but—

664
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:30,884
we fell in love.

665
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:33,253
Clyden and I are very different.

666
00:40:33,782 --> 00:40:35,033
Honestly,

667
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:37,317
his first impression
of me wasn’t even good,

668
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:39,170
but somehow, we clicked.

669
00:40:41,629 --> 00:40:43,756
Only the two of us
truly understand

670
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:45,741
what the other
has been through.

671
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:51,086
We grew together and helped
each other during hard times.

672
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,867
We’re always there
for each other.

673
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:58,909
But we had to
cancel the engagement

674
00:40:58,934 --> 00:41:01,061
because things were
too messy at the time.

675
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:03,873
Still, even after all
these years,

676
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:07,383
Clyden and I remained
each other’s comfort.

677
00:41:08,314 --> 00:41:09,649
The love never left.

678
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,846
That’s why when
we saw each other again—

679
00:41:14,993 --> 00:41:17,996
we just kept finding our way
back into each other’s arms.

680
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,516
That’s nice.

681
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:22,245
So it’s not true that you were

682
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,355
seeing Haze Juarez and
Clyden at the same time?

683
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:25,886
No. Never.

684
00:41:26,808 --> 00:41:28,352
Haze is just my friend.

685
00:41:28,377 --> 00:41:30,667
I never confirmed that
we were together.

686
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:32,277
People just assumed that.

687
00:41:32,846 --> 00:41:35,474
All right. Now that everything’s
been cleared up,

688
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:38,627
can we say that
your relationship

689
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:41,614
with Doctor Clyden
has been rekindled?

690
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:48,012
We tried, but the timing
isn’t right at the moment.

691
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,925
We still have big
dreams to chase.

692
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,595
Nevertheless, we’ll always
have love for each other.

693
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:57,822
That’s very mature
of both of you, Sam

694
00:41:57,847 --> 00:42:00,892
and Dr. Clyden. I admire
you guys for that.

695
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:04,036
As much as I don’t
want to overstep,

696
00:42:04,098 --> 00:42:06,893
do you have anything
to say to your family?

697
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:13,587
I have something
to say to my sister.

698
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:18,786
I know she’s listening
right now… in the sky.

699
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,330
I want to go there.

700
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,832
Where?

701
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,876
To the moon,

702
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,003
or just beside it.

703
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:30,571
I wanna be one of the stars.

704
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:35,691
I love you the most, Naomi.

705
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,723
You’re such a good sister,

706
00:42:39,783 --> 00:42:41,118
a good daughter,

707
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,102
and a good person.

708
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,437
No one could tell you otherwise.

709
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:51,029
I will continue to
reach for the stars

710
00:42:51,054 --> 00:42:55,684
in hopes that someday,
I can hold you again.

711
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:07,577
Thank you so much
for your trust, Samantha Vera.

712
00:43:08,158 --> 00:43:09,493
Okay, let’s cut it!

713
00:43:09,735 --> 00:43:11,487
- Thank you, Sam.
- Thank you.

714
00:43:11,512 --> 00:43:12,513
Thank you.

715
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,931
- How are you?
- Good.

716
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,143
Thank you, girls.
I owe you one.

717
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,520
Don’t worry, when
we get to New York,

718
00:43:26,545 --> 00:43:27,880
I’ll take you shopping.

719
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,107
No, no, don’t worry about it.

720
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:34,612
It’s my job, and my job is to
always take care of you, okay?

721
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,072
That’s right. That's why
we’ll never leave you,

722
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,657
because we love you.

723
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,576
Group hug!

724
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,663
Okay, we’ll leave you be.

725
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,791
And I think your knight in
shining armor is waiting for you

726
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,354
Thank you.

727
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,675
Hey.

728
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,930
You did good and
I’m so proud of you.

729
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,849
Everything’s going to be okay.

730
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,103
Thank you.

731
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,706
Sam doesn’t deserve
the hate she received.

732
00:44:15,731 --> 00:44:17,316
#ApologizeToSamNow

733
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:19,134
There’s always two
sides of every story.

734
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,828
She was mature and
brave in her interview.

735
00:44:20,853 --> 00:44:22,146
She didn’t have to explain.

736
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:24,036
You know, I’ve been
seeing a lot

737
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,537
of positive comments online.

738
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,581
I guess it really was a good
thing you did that interview.

739
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,724
Right?

740
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,377
People you’ve helped are
starting to speak up, too.

741
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,630
Good! Sevi almost turned
this into a troll farm.

742
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,257
Of course! I’m totally
ready to trash-talk

743
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:40,167
those bashers, for Sam’s sake!

744
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,932
You guys, seriously, thank you.

745
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,558
I appreciate you all so much.

746
00:44:53,033 --> 00:44:54,033
Hey!

747
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,193
Why are you so quiet, Luna?

748
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,489
I’m just feeling a little sad.

749
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,367
Sam’s leaving for New York,

750
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,954
and then Via’s
leaving soon too.

751
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,408
And I’ll be stuck with
your face every day.

752
00:45:10,433 --> 00:45:12,602
It’s kind of depressing, right?

753
00:45:13,272 --> 00:45:15,274
Oh, come on!
I’ll still visit you guys.

754
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:16,926
Or come visit me.

755
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,802
Auntie, why are you leaving?

756
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,722
Will I see you soon?

757
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,391
Baby, of course!

758
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,976
Don’t be a bad girl, okay?

759
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,437
Be a good girl to your mom
and your dad, okay?

760
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,897
Okay.

761
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:40,362
Hey, Yanna. Are you crying, too?

762
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:45,284
I’m not used to you
not being here.

763
00:45:48,268 --> 00:45:52,397
You’re making me cry, too.
Let me hold you, bestie.

764
00:45:52,422 --> 00:45:54,341
You’re making us all cry.

765
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,651
We’re going to miss you, Sam.

766
00:46:07,016 --> 00:46:09,268
Don’t go.

767
00:46:09,293 --> 00:46:10,961
I have to.

768
00:46:11,317 --> 00:46:12,902
Visit me sometime, okay?

769
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,250
Sorry, I can’t come with
you to the airport.

770
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,045
I can’t watch you leave.

771
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,297
It’s okay.

772
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,854
I don’t want to leave
while crying either.

773
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,932
Take care of yourself,
all right?

774
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,073
Don’t just keep accepting
work non-stop.

775
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,773
And know your limits, too, okay?

776
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:01,902
You too.

777
00:47:02,939 --> 00:47:04,733
Take care of yourself, okay?

778
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:09,899
Don’t push yourself too hard;
remember to rest.

779
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,747
You’ll achieve greater things,

780
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,083
but to do that, you
need to stay healthy.

781
00:47:20,344 --> 00:47:21,345
I will.

782
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,390
If you find someone else,

783
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,810
I hope she can
truly make you happy.

784
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,596
And she won’t make
you suffer like this.

785
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,110
I hope she never leaves you,

786
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,151
no matter what happens.

787
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,784
If you find someone else,

788
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,164
I hope he never
makes you cry like this.

789
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,376
I mean it.

790
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,595
I’m serious.

791
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,216
Choose a good woman, all right?

792
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,468
Promise me.

793
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,763
Okay. I promise.

794
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,686
I promise. So, will you
please stop crying?

795
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,996
I will miss you.

796
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,169
See me when you do.

797
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Hey.

798
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,574
Hey. How did you—

799
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,242
I’m heading to Australia.

800
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,370
I have a conference
there in two days.

801
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,667
And I booked an earlier flight
just so I could see you.

802
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,088
You said you didn’t
wanna watch me leave.

803
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:27,124
I don’t.

804
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,549
But I want to spend
more time with you.

805
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,843
Even just for an hour.

806
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,013
Or even just a minute.

807
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,915
I guess it’s time
to say goodbye.

808
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,752
Make sure you eat, okay?

809
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,439
If something’s bothering you,
talk to someone

810
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,091
or message someone.

811
00:50:11,715 --> 00:50:14,051
Don’t ever keep it
all to yourself.

812
00:50:15,105 --> 00:50:16,106
Okay?

813
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,233
Maui, wait.

814
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,533
I just wanna say that I’m really,

815
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,744
really gonna miss you.

816
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,481
It’s time to go now.

817
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,650
You’re finally…

818
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,320
free.

819
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,551
- Sev!
- Welcome back!

820
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,303
You're really so famous now.

821
00:52:23,953 --> 00:52:26,143
Luna!

822
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,936
I miss you!

823
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,479
So, how's your love life?

824
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,314
- Haven't heard anything for a while.
- You know what, guys—

825
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:33,934
- I’m still single.
- Seriously?

826
00:52:37,464 --> 00:52:38,590
How is she, Doc?

827
00:52:42,503 --> 00:52:44,880
Is it okay for you to be seen with me?

828
00:52:46,379 --> 00:52:48,464
Shouldn’t I be the one asking you that?

829
00:52:50,421 --> 00:52:54,281
Let’s raise our glasses and
toast to this brand-new start.

830
00:52:54,306 --> 00:52:57,340
Welcome to Epitome! Cheers!

831
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:04,222
Where's your boyfriend?
He's not here yet?

832
00:53:13,051 --> 00:53:14,428
Sam, sweetheart…
