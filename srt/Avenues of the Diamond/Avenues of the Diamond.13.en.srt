1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,941
Thank you for
saving me earlier.

2
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,221
I think

3
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,890
I can take it from here.

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,509
I’ll go ahead.

5
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:24,444
Happy birthday,
happy birthday…

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,769
Happy birthday to you!

7
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:30,602
Wow!

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,975
We’re getting married
in a few months.

9
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:35,943
Congratulations!

10
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:39,721
The guy you were with
in Japan is a hot topic.

11
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:42,499
He’s Fly Asia’s CEO.

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,143
Did you bring a companion?

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,378
To watch you?

14
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,839
Do you have a boyfriend?

15
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,789
It’s just me.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,595
My card holder is missing.

17
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:55,588
All my credit cards
are in there.

18
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:58,166
Have you seen a card holder?

19
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,562
Oh my god.

20
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:06,485
Let me know.

21
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:17,703
Yoga.

22
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,270
I miss yoga.

23
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:26,202
What the hell.

24
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,546
This is so embarrassing.

25
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:38,626
Me too. I miss y—

26
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,143
Yoga. I miss yoga too.

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,951
He’s clearly teasing me.

28
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:52,812
Really? Then we should
do yoga next time.

29
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:55,072
Wait.

30
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:56,097
This feels off.

31
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:58,474
Why the hell am I even
inviting him to do yoga?

32
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:07,792
Cy: Sure. Let me know
when you’re free.

33
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:11,399
Huh? He agreed? Weird.

34
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:13,361
Anyway…

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,900
Sam: Wait, going back
to the sweater.

36
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:18,551
Where can I meet you tomorrow?

37
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:21,713
Cy: I’ll be in
an outreach program.

38
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,700
We can meet there
if that’s okay with you.

39
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:25,224
Outreach program?

40
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,372
Am I really gonna go
all the way there

41
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,852
just to return his sweater?

42
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:30,852
But I guess it’s fine.

43
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:36,609
Sam: Sure, I can go.
Is 11 AM good?

44
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,828
Cy: Yes. I’ll send you
the address. See you.

45
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:43,927
Sam: See you!

46
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,774
Hey, that girl’s so pretty!

47
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,634
Wait, she looks familiar!

48
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,275
She’s the one from that Juicy
Cologne commercial, right?

49
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,405
Am I in the right place?

50
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,433
Hey. I’m already here
at the location.

51
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,893
I think I arrived too early.

52
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,647
What if he thinks
I’m too eager to see him?

53
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:17,375
But no rush!

54
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,820
I just had to make a stop nearby,
that’s why I came early.

55
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,045
Maybe he’s busy.

56
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:31,442
- Miss! Help me!
- John Eldin!

57
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:34,957
- John Eldin!
- She’s gonna give me to the doctors.

58
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:37,562
Mom, you said we were
just buying fish sauce

59
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,213
at the corner store.

60
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:43,568
My teacher said liars
go to hell. You’ll burn!

61
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:48,097
John Eldin, I swear!
You’re just like your father.

62
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,450
- Hurry up and get circumcised already.
- I don’t want to.

63
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,970
- I said get circumcised!
- No!

64
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:54,316
Let’s go! Oh!
Sorry, miss! I’m sorry.

65
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:55,980
- Come on now.
- No! I don’t want to!

66
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:58,424
John Eldin!
This is embarrassing.

67
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,817
Let’s go!

68
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:01,878
Please move here.

69
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,780
John Eldin, right?

70
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,368
It’s John Eldin De Guzman,
not Wright.

71
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:07,511
Ah...

72
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,354
Okay then, just John Eldin.

73
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:17,156
John Eldin, I don’t think
your mom meant to lie to you.

74
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:19,939
You should listen to her.

75
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,673
This is for your health.

76
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,178
So when you grow up, you’ll be
stronger and healthier.

77
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,264
But my classmate said it hurts.

78
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,974
I’m scared.

79
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,855
It’s okay to be afraid.
Everyone’s afraid of pain.

80
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,317
But you know,

81
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:45,247
I actually know the doctor who’s
going to do your circumcision.

82
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,240
He’s really skilled!

83
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,541
Yeah, right. You’re joking.

84
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,421
Hey!

85
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,373
It’s true! He won’t let anything
happen to you. I promise!

86
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,000
So, are you going
through with it?

87
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,004
Okay, since you said
he’s really good at it.

88
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:03,102
Mhm!

89
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,175
John Eldin De Guzman?

90
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,763
That’s you? Okay. Hi!

91
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:14,033
I’m Doc Clyden,
the super skilled doctor

92
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,560
who’s gonna do
your circumcision.

93
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,370
Shit, he heard that!

94
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,395
Let’s go?

95
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,773
Okay. Go, son!

96
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,316
- Let’s go.
- Go!

97
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:23,984
Thank you, Doc.

98
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,159
Be careful.

99
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:37,348
Is the doctor your boyfriend?
Your boyfriend?

100
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,702
- Huh?
- Your boyfriend?

101
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:40,168
All done, ma’am.

102
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,061
He’s back. Yay.

103
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,168
Well, does it hurt?

104
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,593
Nope. It just felt like
a dinosaur bit me.

105
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:48,793
You and your nonsense.

106
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:51,316
- Thank you, Doc.
- You're welcome.

107
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,006
Miss, thank you.
Thank you so much.

108
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,231
You're welcome.

109
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,226
Your doctor is really good.

110
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:03,190
Gosh, his eyes are so puffy.
Did he cry a lot inside?

111
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,495
Yeah, he did.

112
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,502
I was just prepping
the injection,

113
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,948
and he was already freaking out.

114
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:13,373
Hey, are you free?

115
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:14,607
Do you wanna have some lunch?

116
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:17,441
Uh...

117
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,209
I guess I’ve got time
for a quick lunch.

118
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:23,590
Okay, let’s go.

119
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,293
Sorry I brought you here.

120
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:35,960
It’s just that I have
to head back right after.

121
00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:37,598
It’s okay. No worries.

122
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,019
The adobo here’s really good.

123
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,105
Too bad though.

124
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,067
You’re all dressed up.

125
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,609
What?

126
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:52,715
No, I dressed like this
because I have a meeting later.

127
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,200
Not because
I’m meeting up with you—

128
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:55,225
Just kidding.

129
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:59,163
- And now, he’s teasing me!
- By the way,

130
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:01,690
I watched your fashion show.

131
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:03,163
Congratulations.

132
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:05,662
- Really?
- Yeah.

133
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,966
You were amazing.
You really stood out.

134
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:11,763
Thanks, Cy.

135
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:14,718
I didn’t know
you actually watched it.

136
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,658
You know, I watched
your stories and—

137
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,778
Shit!

138
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,982
And...

139
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:29,777
I saw that you were
at the hospital.

140
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,865
Yeah. You know, I usually
watch everyone's stories.

141
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:38,226
Yeah, I was on duty that time.

142
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,647
But I just recorded the stream,
so I could still watch it later.

143
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,503
No rice?

144
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,467
Your fashion show’s done.
Are you still on a diet?

145
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Wait.

146
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:00,301
There’s something on your—

147
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,443
You look like a hamster.

148
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:18,584
I always have to be
mindful of my figure.

149
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,053
You know, my manager’s
pretty strict about me

150
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,431
keeping my body fit.

151
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,998
To be honest,

152
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,796
eating this Adobo right now
feels like a cheat day.

153
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,840
It’s just that I get
full a lot quicker now.

154
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:34,635
You get full quickly?

155
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:37,802
But didn’t you use to always
finish everything I cooked?

156
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,375
Why the hell is he
bringing up the past?

157
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,746
My appetite’s just smaller
than it used to be.

158
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:58,826
That’s okay, as long as you’re
getting rest and eating well.

159
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:01,979
Samantha Vera?

160
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,961
Oh my god, can I get a picture?

161
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:06,438
Sure.

162
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,626
You’re one of my idols.

163
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,273
- Miss—
- Thank you so much!

164
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,667
- can we take a photo too?
- Yeah, sure.

165
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:16,692
Okay.

166
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,095
You’re so pretty in person.
I always watch your shows.

167
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,890
- You’re our idol.
- Thank you!

168
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,097
Can we take one more?

169
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:25,160
Oh.

170
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,514
Sam, don’t you have
a meeting? Let’s go.

171
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:29,817
- I’ll carry this.
- Thank you.

172
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:31,266
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

173
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:45,552
Sorry about that.
I kind of ruined our meal.

174
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:46,665
No, it’s okay.

175
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,356
I actually need
to head back too.

176
00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:50,781
But I’m free next weekend.

177
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,214
Didn’t you say we’d do yoga?

178
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,343
Because we both miss it.

179
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,682
What the—

180
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,308
He actually
took that seriously?

181
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:10,739
Okay. I’m also free
next weekend.

182
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:14,417
Should we just
meet at my condo?

183
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,277
So it’s more private?

184
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,486
If that’s okay with you.

185
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:19,096
Yeah, sure. That works.

186
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,156
Okay.

187
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,992
Before I forget…

188
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,370
You can keep it.

189
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,620
What?

190
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,541
Then why did you
agree to meet me?

191
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,126
Isn’t it obvious?

192
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,625
I wanted to see you.

193
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,760
See you next week, Maui.

194
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:42,574
Take care.

195
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:06,702
Great job guys, at the meeting
earlier with Veluxe Apparel.

196
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:09,221
I mean, I’m surprised
they’re willing to adjust

197
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,601
and meet all our requests
for the shoot.

198
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:13,434
And it’s obvious.

199
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,045
They’re really eager
to work with you, Sam.

200
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,480
They wanna do the shoot
as soon as possible,

201
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:21,513
so we might need to adjust
our schedule next month.

202
00:13:21,537 --> 00:13:25,082
He agreed to meet me just
because he wanted to see me?

203
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:26,942
What does that even mean?

204
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,126
And I actually invited him
to my condo?

205
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:30,719
And he said yes?

206
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,950
Oh my god.
What the hell are we doing...

207
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:35,728
Sam?

208
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:39,901
Uh... Yeah.

209
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:42,625
I feel like they really
are eager to work with us.

210
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,120
What are you saying?

211
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:48,202
I’m asking if you have
any leave requests next month.

212
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,040
Oh my god.

213
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,891
What? What happened?

214
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,334
You and Haze are trending.

215
00:13:55,424 --> 00:13:56,424
Let me see.

216
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:59,398
Your photos during the
fashion show are circulating.

217
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,246
They think Haze is
your non-showbiz boyfriend.

218
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:06,863
I need to talk
to Haze about this.

219
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,557
I think Haze isn’t the only one
you need to talk to.

220
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,395
Sam, who did you have a lunch
date with a while ago?

221
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:16,355
You even ate at a local eatery.

222
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,816
- What?
- Whoever it is,

223
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,667
he’s also trending.

224
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,799
Oh my god. He’s—

225
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,824
He’s just a friend.

226
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,785
What should I do, Arah?

227
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:33,131
What if they invade his privacy too?

228
00:14:33,514 --> 00:14:36,267
It might be better
if we just don’t respond

229
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,273
to anything about Haze.

230
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:41,807
It still seems like people think
Haze is your boyfriend anyway.

231
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:43,769
Okay.

232
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:45,302
Okay. I think that’s better.

233
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:48,628
After all, Haze is more used
to being in the public eye.

234
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:49,925
I’ll just talk to him.

235
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,150
As long as Cy doesn’t
get dragged into this.

236
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:53,741
So...

237
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:55,634
Who is this Cy?

238
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:59,797
And why are you
so protective of him?

239
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:05,983
Arah, I told you,
he’s just a friend.

240
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,805
Hey Sam.

241
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,625
You and I are
trending right now.

242
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,048
I know. Don’t talk about it.
Just avoid them.

243
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:26,983
Are you using me
as a cover-up?

244
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,763
Because I feel like I saw
another photo of some guy.

245
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:32,868
Uh...

246
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,392
I’ll also use you, then.

247
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,772
Huh? What do you need me for?

248
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:43,330
My desires.

249
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:45,695
What the hell?

250
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,401
Just kidding.

251
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:50,049
Being linked with you
will make my mom shut up

252
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,253
about wanting me
to get married already.

253
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:53,317
So,

254
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,788
let’s use each other
wisely, Samantha Vera.

255
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,581
Fine.

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,001
It’s a deal.

257
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,839
- Hey.
- Hi! Come in.

258
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:37,429
You can put your things there.

259
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,454
Okay.

260
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,880
This is the portrait Naomi
took years ago, right?

261
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,375
It is.

262
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:52,793
I’m kinda hungry.

263
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:54,698
Should we eat first?

264
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,223
Yeah, sure.
I brought some food too.

265
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:57,296
Okay.

266
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,267
Okay.

267
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,651
Here you go.

268
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,320
Wow!

269
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:13,402
Sushi.

270
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,928
[sighs] There goes my
no-rice diet again.

271
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,569
Come on, it’s just
once in a while.

272
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:25,044
And I remembered
it’s your favorite too.

273
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,040
Of course. He used to make
those for me before.

274
00:17:29,937 --> 00:17:31,119
Sushi?

275
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,972
Your special request.

276
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,007
This is my favorite.

277
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,896
Why is it so awkward?

278
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,288
Maui?

279
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:54,193
Hmm?

280
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:57,863
How do you date
when you’re a model?

281
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,744
There you go.
Finally, you looked at me.

282
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:04,070
I’d prefer it if you would
look at me instead.

283
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:06,998
So?

284
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,296
How?

285
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,982
My friends do it normally since

286
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,592
there’s nothing
to be ashamed of.

287
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,236
It’s just kind of hard

288
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,679
when the guy isn’t from showbiz

289
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:19,498
because the media
really messes with them.

290
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,475
I’m not asking
about your friends.

291
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,311
I’m asking about you.

292
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,439
I don’t date.

293
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:30,042
I’m way too busy for that.

294
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:33,011
Maybe when I retire, and...

295
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,835
I can finally give
quality time to my partner…

296
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:38,062
Hmm...

297
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,617
Okay.

298
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:42,212
I want to date normally,
you know.

299
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:47,096
Go shopping, go on a picnic
date, travel together.

300
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:49,698
All the normal
things couples do.

301
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:54,689
Well, that requires
a lot of time.

302
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:56,714
Yeah.

303
00:18:57,254 --> 00:18:59,250
My love language
is quality time.

304
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,477
So, do you have plans
to retire from modeling?

305
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,063
Eventually.

306
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:09,833
That’s still a long way off,

307
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,457
but I’m already thinking
of starting my own business.

308
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,436
I want to open a club,

309
00:19:16,631 --> 00:19:19,634
since I’m so good at drinking.

310
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:21,884
Well, you should.

311
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,595
That would be great.

312
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,914
You think so?

313
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,168
Of course.

314
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,879
Anything you do is beautiful.

315
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,841
And I’m proud of you
since you're...

316
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:38,381
starting to plan
your own future, and...

317
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,785
you decide what you want to do.

318
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,098
Thank you.

319
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,642
You?

320
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,348
Your turn to share.
What are your plans?

321
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,315
Well…

322
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,651
Finish residency,

323
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,720
take the exam,

324
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,941
then move on to fellowship.

325
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,617
And then I’m thinking
of pediatric cardiology?

326
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,867
I don’t know.

327
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,498
I’m sure whatever you choose,

328
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,542
you’ll do great
like you always do.

329
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:17,174
- Eat.
- Okay.

330
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,259
Now,

331
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:22,453
let’s do the downward
dog position.

332
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:26,027
We’re going down—

333
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,003
Exhale as you go up.

334
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:35,274
I can’t believe we’re
doing yoga right now.

335
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,824
I mean, this is the
reason why he came.

336
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,199
But I didn’t expect him
to be serious about it.

337
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,144
He even brought
a yoga outfit.

338
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,214
What?

339
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,259
Nothing. I was just copying you.

340
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,585
It would be more accurate
if you copied Max instead.

341
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:07,999
[sighs]

342
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:10,006
Now I’m even more conscious.

343
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:13,157
I want you to relax…

344
00:21:13,468 --> 00:21:14,928
Inhale going down.

345
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:21,328
Exhale.

346
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,274
Relax.

347
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:32,808
What now?

348
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,833
Nothing!

349
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,504
Max, can you check
if my form is right?

350
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,179
Exhale going up…

351
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:50,472
Up.

352
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,898
And walk forward until
you reach a triangle.

353
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,505
What?

354
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,341
What?

355
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,761
It’s kinda hot, right?

356
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:30,307
I think my AC needs
some cleaning.

357
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,316
Reach for the heavens.

358
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,527
Exhale.

359
00:22:55,111 --> 00:22:56,904
Reach for the skies.

360
00:22:56,929 --> 00:22:57,929
Exhale.

361
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,754
Maybe you feel hot
because you’re hot.

362
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,780
I’m what?

363
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,297
Hot.

364
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,009
Other side.

365
00:23:12,127 --> 00:23:13,253
Down

366
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:31,739
Exhale.

367
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,579
All right!

368
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,181
That’s it
for our first session.

369
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:38,458
I think I’m gonna go.

370
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,666
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you, Max.

371
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,433
I’ll just get the door.

372
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,580
I’ll just get my bag.

373
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,222
Special delivery!

374
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:57,285
Shit, I forgot.

375
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,904
Avi’s staying
with me tonight!

376
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,815
And of all people,
it had to be Haze

377
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,466
who dropped her off!

378
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,984
You okay?

379
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,820
Do you have a visitor?

380
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:11,444
Maui, is that the delivery,
the deli—

381
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:19,104
What are you guys doing?

382
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:21,558
Yoga.

383
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:24,235
I see.

384
00:24:26,189 --> 00:24:27,941
- Cy, he’s—
- Lim.

385
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,842
Wow.

386
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:32,568
You’re the guy I’ve heard about.

387
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,848
Long time no see, Cy.

388
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,853
They know each other?

389
00:24:40,137 --> 00:24:41,271
Interesting.

390
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,233
Can I join your yoga session?

391
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:46,985
It sounds fun.

392
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,964
- Auntie?
- Hmm?

393
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:08,358
Are you going to sleep now?

394
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,343
I think you should
join your friends outside.

395
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,763
I’m okay here alone
and I’m sleepy.

396
00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:19,897
I’m kinda sleepy too, baby.

397
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,603
I’ll lie down for a while.

398
00:25:22,243 --> 00:25:24,162
- Okay.
- Good night.

399
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,054
Haze and Cy,
together in my house?

400
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:33,481
How did we end up here?

401
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:37,947
What if Haze tells Cy
that we’re in a relationship?

402
00:25:38,146 --> 00:25:40,690
After all, we agreed
to “use” each other.

403
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,990
Shit, no. I don’t want that!

404
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,725
Hey—

405
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,521
Have you known
Max for a long time?

406
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,898
You two seemed
really close earlier.

407
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,651
I knew it.

408
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,112
You’re jealous.

409
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,069
But don’t worry,
because he’s gay.

410
00:26:17,882 --> 00:26:19,467
Exhale going up…

411
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,998
Up.

412
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:28,533
Sam,

413
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,667
I grabbed some beers
from your fridge.

414
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,417
I’ll just replace them later.

415
00:26:32,997 --> 00:26:34,373
I tried to stop him.

416
00:26:35,747 --> 00:26:38,000
Well, since the instructor
already left,

417
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,922
I was asking Cy to
show some yoga poses,

418
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:42,729
but he didn’t want to so—

419
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:44,329
How do you guys know each other?

420
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,147
We went to the same high school.

421
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:48,838
He was my junior.

422
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:50,709
I think

423
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,361
I made fun of him a lot
because he was a quiet kid.

424
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:54,387
Really, Lim?

425
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,033
Or were you just
so noisy back then?

426
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,659
Here, Cy.

427
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:02,271
Here.

428
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,042
Don’t tell me you can’t
handle your liquor?

429
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,200
I’ll go to the bathroom.

430
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:13,267
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

431
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,557
Hey, stop teasing him.

432
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,770
You’re acting like a kid.

433
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:23,840
You didn’t even mention

434
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:26,311
that he’s the ex boyfriend
that you’re busy falling for.

435
00:27:26,357 --> 00:27:27,566
You didn’t ask.

436
00:27:27,803 --> 00:27:30,865
And I didn’t know
you two knew each other.

437
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:32,867
Geez...

438
00:27:32,925 --> 00:27:34,176
Stop it, okay?

439
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:44,926
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Shh...

440
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,729
I’m actually helping you here.

441
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:48,185
What?

442
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:55,220
I can drink.

443
00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:05,095
Can he really drink or
is he just forcing himself?

444
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,305
Who is it?

445
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,872
I invited someone.

446
00:28:15,813 --> 00:28:16,813
What?

447
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,035
Hey.

448
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,456
So,

449
00:28:31,434 --> 00:28:32,727
Cy invited you?

450
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,088
Unfortunately.

451
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:44,531
Can I read while drinking?

452
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,787
Is that allowed here?

453
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:47,522
Hey, loosen up, KJ.

454
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,602
Gotta keep the mind sharp.

455
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:51,754
Mamma mia.

456
00:28:55,641 --> 00:28:58,477
This night is getting
weirder and weirder.

457
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,612
So...

458
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,115
Cy, do you have a girlfriend?

459
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,327
Not looking for one.

460
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:09,729
Sucks to be single, huh?

461
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,128
Watch your words, man.

462
00:29:12,202 --> 00:29:13,261
[laughing]

463
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,919
Someone’s hurt.

464
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,629
I thought you’re with Giselle?

465
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,923
I thought so too.

466
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,717
I guess we’re done.

467
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:25,263
I mean, It wasn’t anything
serious anyway. So—

468
00:29:26,469 --> 00:29:28,109
Is it really a thing now?

469
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:31,770
You know, getting together
with your friend’s exes?

470
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,815
I guess it is.

471
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,775
Right?

472
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:39,985
Huh?

473
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,488
Huh?

474
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:42,693
Why?

475
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,021
Bro, the justice system
is already messed up, right?

476
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,806
It’s like playing
survival mode out there.

477
00:30:00,995 --> 00:30:03,367
- Right?
- It’s so unfair, man.

478
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:06,951
It doesn’t matter
how hard we try.

479
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:08,167
Yeah, screw that.

480
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,228
It’s just a hard field.

481
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:14,258
Sometimes I just wish
we had a nine to five.

482
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:17,207
Like do you realize
how hard it is for us

483
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,692
that every time we walk
into that office,

484
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,530
we’re holding someone's
future in our hands.

485
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:23,780
You’re right about that, bro.

486
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,119
Screw this shit! Like,

487
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:26,591
what kind of
responsibility is that?

488
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,234
I’m not even paid
enough for this.

489
00:30:28,432 --> 00:30:30,184
Bro, and do you know
what hurts the most?

490
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:32,561
The poor don’t even
have a choice.

491
00:30:33,262 --> 00:30:35,348
Shit. Only the rich
get to have a choice.

492
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,371
Whether it’s in healthcare
or in justice.

493
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:39,170
Right? It’s so frustrating, bro.

494
00:30:39,195 --> 00:30:41,489
No matter how much I sponsor
or how much money I give,

495
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,882
it’s just never enough.

496
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,943
That’s the point.
It’s never gonna be enough.

497
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,816
It doesn’t matter what we do,

498
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,972
It’s never just gonna be enough.

499
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,407
- Screw the system, man.
- Yeah, screw the system.

500
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,517
- Screw the system.
- Screw the system.

501
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,839
- Screw the system.
- Okay, workaholics.

502
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,648
That’s why you two are single.

503
00:30:58,969 --> 00:31:00,955
- What the hell?
- And you’re not?

504
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,084
Why do you have to put that in?

505
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:04,732
We’re not even
talking about that.

506
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,656
Insensitive bitch.

507
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,783
Why? Are you throwing
shade at someone?

508
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:10,848
- This guy’s drunk.
- Right?

509
00:31:10,907 --> 00:31:13,242
Why are you saying—
Yes, I know we broke up.

510
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,874
- No.
- Yeah. I—

511
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,125
I don’t know, bro.

512
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,388
I don’t know what the hell
I did wrong.

513
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,550
What the hell!

514
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,763
This guy is drunk.
I should bring him home.

515
00:31:22,794 --> 00:31:25,690
- No.
- Bro! Seriously! I gave everything.

516
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,320
- Right?
- Let’s go, let’s go.

517
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,238
Shit! This is the whole
country’s problem now!

518
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:32,429
- Screw the system, bro.
- Screw the system!

519
00:31:32,454 --> 00:31:35,310
- Screw the rich and all that love shit.
- Screw the sys—

520
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,478
What, screw love?
No, love is good.

521
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,771
- It’s not!
- It’s—

522
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,219
I was right there.

523
00:31:40,471 --> 00:31:42,014
- I was right there.
- That’s enough.

524
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,711
- Believing it that it was good-
- All right, all right.

525
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,819
that it was gonna
give you the damn—

526
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,070
- That’s enough! That’s enough.
- Okay!

527
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,322
That it’s gonna
give you the...

528
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,966
- All right, bro. Let’s go.
- passion for it, but it’s not!

529
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,492
- Enough.
- It’s gonna kill you inside,

530
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,911
- I’m telling you.
- No, I’m not!

531
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:54,787
Stop! Okay.

532
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,414
You’re leaving? You’re leaving.

533
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,498
No, I’m leaving too.

534
00:31:57,523 --> 00:31:58,875
- No, stay there.
- Yeah. No.

535
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,193
No, you stay there.

536
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,228
- Come, I’m gonna save you.
- Kalix.

537
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,254
- Later, bro.
- Come on.

538
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,440
Stay there. Okay.
Get up, get up.

539
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,425
They’re all kind
at the beginning!

540
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,525
Okay, Haze— Kalix’s unit
is on the 23rd floor.

541
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,555
No, stop.

542
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,205
- Screw that, man!
- Okay.

543
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,726
- Be careful.
- Don’t touch me.

544
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:17,877
I’m not touching you.

545
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,374
- Wait.
- Enjoy the rest of the night, Sam!

546
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,026
Yeah. Your book.

547
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,709
Haze, 23rd floor.

548
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,109
- All right.
- Kalix, sleep okay?

549
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,839
Attorney.

550
00:32:30,727 --> 00:32:32,952
Haze, don’t forget
to close the door.

551
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:35,462
Have fun, lovebirds!

552
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,496
Close it!

553
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,343
Cy?

554
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,887
Cy, wake up.

555
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,237
Summer?

556
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,514
What?

557
00:32:56,728 --> 00:32:58,810
Shit. You’re so heavy.

558
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,228
One, two!

559
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,814
Fudge.

560
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,402
Wait.

561
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,741
Okay.

562
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,164
So heavy.

563
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,624
Okay.

564
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,006
I’m sorry.

565
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,175
Get in that justice system.

566
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,720
- The what?
- Justice system.

567
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,263
What the hell?

568
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,390
- It’s messed up.
- What?

569
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,100
It’s messed up.

570
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,602
You’re drunk.

571
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,641
Hey, are you okay?

572
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,310
Do you want water?

573
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,191
Sam?

574
00:34:29,353 --> 00:34:30,353
Hmm?

575
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,820
Am I stupid to you?

576
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,911
You probably think
that I’m a fool.

577
00:34:41,124 --> 00:34:42,292
Is it fun?

578
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,499
Are you having fun?

579
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:47,823
Hey, I don’t understand.

580
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,047
What are you talking about?
Are you still drunk?

581
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,673
You know,

582
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,765
I am willing to accept
everything that comes with you,

583
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,297
but you’re becoming
harder to reach.

584
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,438
Everything’s gotten
so complicated.

585
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,651
No matter what I do,

586
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,261
I couldn’t be enough for you.

587
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,631
You still prefer someone else

588
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,699
because they have
more time for you.

589
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,203
Cy, it’s not like that.

590
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,752
I was probably
exhausting to be with.

591
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,918
That’s why you broke up with me.

592
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,217
I’m sorry for everything,
Maureen.

593
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:39,278
I got so busy chasing my dream

594
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,556
that I forgot
to show up for you.

595
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,752
I couldn’t even
celebrate your achievements.

596
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,942
I’m sorry if you felt that
you couldn’t rely on me.

597
00:35:55,294 --> 00:35:56,629
Cy, that’s not true.

598
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,523
We broke up

599
00:36:01,275 --> 00:36:03,861
because I needed
to focus on myself.

600
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,254
I relied on you a lot, Cy.

601
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,172
And you gave me
a lot of motivation.

602
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,856
It’s just that,

603
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,426
during that time,

604
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,825
we were both busy.

605
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,560
And I understood.

606
00:36:23,657 --> 00:36:26,077
But during the worst time
of your life, Maui,

607
00:36:26,612 --> 00:36:28,322
you didn’t rely on me.

608
00:36:29,098 --> 00:36:32,059
When Naomi died, you didn’t
even reach out to me.

609
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:36,862
I thought—

610
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,779
I thought you were on duty.

611
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,156
Maui,

612
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,411
I was willing to drop everything
that day just to be with you.

613
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:47,973
Damn it, I was willing
to drop everything

614
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,124
just to be with you back then.

615
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:54,724
I even begged my parents
to not cancel the engagement.

616
00:36:59,224 --> 00:37:01,476
We have to cancel
the engagement with Samantha.

617
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:05,832
We shouldn’t be
associating with the Veras.

618
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,101
No, I won’t cancel
the engagement.

619
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,810
We’re getting married!

620
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,104
Son, we’re in the medical field.

621
00:37:12,371 --> 00:37:15,791
How can people trust us if
we’re involved with a politician

622
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,823
- like Stephen Vera?
- Mom!

623
00:37:17,848 --> 00:37:20,408
Then you shouldn’t have arranged
our marriage in the first place!

624
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,031
Jesus!

625
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,740
Clyden!

626
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,495
You have to break up
with Samantha.

627
00:37:26,648 --> 00:37:28,886
Or you don’t deserve
to inherit the hospital.

628
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:31,349
You don’t even care about
the future of our business!

629
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,876
- You are disappointing!
- Disappointing?

630
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,754
Because for once I didn’t follow
what you wanted to happen?

631
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:38,314
So, now what?

632
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,800
I’m no longer the ideal son?

633
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:42,884
Right.

634
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,667
You never really treated me
like your son anyway, did you?

635
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:47,740
I’m just one of your movable objects

636
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,326
that you can show off to anyone.

637
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,436
What did that girl do to you?

638
00:37:52,826 --> 00:37:54,802
I can’t even
recognize you anymore!

639
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,607
I’m warning you, Clyden.

640
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,652
If you don’t break up
with Samantha,

641
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,029
you will lose everything.

642
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,990
Don’t disappoint me!

643
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,246
- My dear…
- Mom…

644
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:13,391
I know you love Sam
but choosing her as a wife

645
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,834
won’t be an easy task.

646
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,879
Especially now that their family
is involved in so many issues.

647
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,015
Are you really willing to
give up everything for Sam?

648
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,301
Even your dreams?

649
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,471
Thank you.

650
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:05,818
Out of all my students,

651
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,554
you’re the one with
the most potential, Dr. Ramirez.

652
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,098
Thank you, Dr. Tolentino.

653
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:14,583
Tonight, I have
a complicated surgery.

654
00:39:14,662 --> 00:39:16,269
If you want, you can observe,

655
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,980
but you’ll have to do overtime.

656
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:20,152
It’s a big opportunity for you.

657
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,576
Doc! Wait a moment, please.

658
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,948
Here, doc. You left it
earlier at the lounge.

659
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,213
- Thank you.
- Take care, Doc. Thank you.

660
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,734
Are you willing to
give up everything for Sam?

661
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,011
Even your dreams?

662
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,642
Doc, thank you
for this opportunity but—

663
00:39:56,452 --> 00:39:57,453
I can’t tonight.

664
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,271
Believe me, Doc,
I’m really grateful,

665
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,296
but...

666
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:02,657
I just have something
I need to take care of.

667
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,445
If it’s more important,
then I understand.

668
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,016
Auntie?

669
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:21,805
Clyden?
Hi, is Sam with you?

670
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,546
She’s not answering her phone.

671
00:40:23,957 --> 00:40:25,417
We’re not together.

672
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,841
Why? Did something happen?

673
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:28,902
I have no idea
what’s going on with her.

674
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,637
She won’t even talk to us and
she won’t let us go to the wake.

675
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,558
Wake? What do you mean wake?

676
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:35,851
Oh my god. You didn’t know?

677
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,743
Naomi committed
suicide last night.

678
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,022
It was such a big mess.

679
00:40:55,457 --> 00:40:56,750
Naomi…

680
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:36,478
I felt so useless.

681
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:41,517
I felt so hurt because
you didn’t reach out to me.

682
00:41:42,998 --> 00:41:44,592
Maui, if you only knew.

683
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:48,452
I was willing to throw
everything away.

684
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,177
And that’s why
I couldn’t call you—

685
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:57,371
because I knew you were capable
of leaving it all behind.

686
00:41:59,011 --> 00:42:00,952
And I didn’t want that for you.

687
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,100
I didn’t want you
to ruin your future.

688
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,860
The relationship
felt one-sided, Sam.

689
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,423
You’re always the one
making adjustments for us,

690
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,658
so why won’t you let me
do the same for you?

691
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,078
You always say you understand.

692
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,828
But right now,

693
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,791
please tell me
what’s on your mind!

694
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,170
Fine.

695
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,591
Screw you.

696
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,581
Screw all of you.

697
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,268
I felt so alone and left out.

698
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:46,809
I’m always there for everyone,

699
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:51,569
but I’m always alone
when I’m at my lowest.

700
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,032
And yes, the thing is,

701
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,952
I also like pushing
people away—

702
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:03,666
Because if they leave me,

703
00:43:04,531 --> 00:43:07,909
then it’s my fault and
I have no one else to blame.

704
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,463
I always say I understand

705
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,757
because the blame is on me.

706
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,047
I don’t like asking
people for help

707
00:43:19,072 --> 00:43:20,432
because I don’t want
to be disappointed

708
00:43:20,456 --> 00:43:22,583
if they don’t show up.

709
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:27,259
So I just learned how
to take care of myself, Cy.

710
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:32,026
And I’m sorry if
I made you feel useless.

711
00:43:34,472 --> 00:43:37,809
I’m sorry for not giving you
the chance to take care of me.

712
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:39,950
I’m sorry

713
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,122
for making you think that
the relationship was one-sided.

714
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,250
It’s my fault.

715
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,169
It’s all my fault.

716
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,047
I’m the one who’s useless.

717
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,927
God, I couldn’t even save Naomi.

718
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,847
Maui, I’m sorry.

719
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,184
I’m sorry I wasn’t
there for you.

720
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,374
I’m sorry I let you go.

721
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,568
I should’ve never
left you back then.

722
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,489
I’m sorry if
I couldn’t give you time.

723
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:35,740
I’m leaving for New York.

724
00:44:46,568 --> 00:44:47,568
Okay.

725
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:54,139
Let’s just make the most of the
time while you’re still here.

726
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,614
You’re not going to stop me?

727
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,491
How could I?

728
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,789
You promised yourself, remember?

729
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,249
That you’re gonna
live for yourself.

730
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,502
And I want to
support you on that.

731
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,139
Come here.

732
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,139
I’m sorry.

733
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,444
I’m sorry.

734
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:13,732
Wow.

735
00:46:14,132 --> 00:46:15,752
He looks more mature now,

736
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,537
but he looks even
more handsome.

737
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:21,659
It makes me happy
seeing him asleep

738
00:46:21,684 --> 00:46:23,360
so peacefully like this.

739
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:09,676
Shit.

740
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:14,098
- Yanna!
- Why did you take so long to answer?

741
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,892
You’re probably hiding
a guy in here, aren’t you?

742
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,764
Is Avi awake already?

743
00:47:17,895 --> 00:47:18,977
Yanna, wait!

744
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,796
Damn. There really is a guy!

745
00:47:22,397 --> 00:47:23,690
You might wake him up!

746
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,175
Shit, what’s he doing here?

747
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,261
Is he still breathing?

748
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,556
What the hell, Yanna!

749
00:47:32,046 --> 00:47:33,058
Mommy!

750
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,419
Baby, hi!

751
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,704
We’re going home.

752
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,648
Your daddy is waiting
at the parking lot. Okay?

753
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,592
- Okay.
- Go get your bag.

754
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,568
Go…

755
00:47:45,117 --> 00:47:46,117
He’s handsome.

756
00:47:47,172 --> 00:47:49,591
Hiro’s waiting. You should go.
Time to leave.

757
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,512
- All right. Baby—
- Wow, you’re really in a rush.

758
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,025
Why, are you
planning something?

759
00:47:54,282 --> 00:47:56,737
Oh wait, something
already happened, huh?

760
00:47:57,933 --> 00:48:00,258
- I thought so.
- No!

761
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:02,004
- And nothing happened, okay?
- What?

762
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,547
You really—

763
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:06,967
Baby?

764
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,095
Your daughter’s taking too long.

765
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:11,572
Baby!

766
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,045
Let’s go, baby.

767
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,976
Mommy.

768
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,964
- Say bye now.
- Bye, Auntie!

769
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,771
Give me a hug!

770
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,585
I’ll see you soon!

771
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,903
Enjoy.

772
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,536
Bye!

773
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:36,732
Oh! You’re awake!

774
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,749
Was that Avi?

775
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:40,801
Yeah.

776
00:48:40,826 --> 00:48:42,746
Her mom picked her up.

777
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,928
You know,

778
00:48:53,675 --> 00:48:55,571
at first I thought
she was your daughter.

779
00:48:56,422 --> 00:48:57,422
What?

780
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,854
How could you say that?
She’s already five.

781
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,565
You saw it
in the records, right?

782
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,109
And we were still together
when she was born.

783
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,058
I thought you cheated on me.

784
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:11,715
Why didn’t you just ask me

785
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,617
instead of jumping
to conclusions?

786
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,162
Because I was scared
that it might be true.

787
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,291
Well, I’m glad everything
is clear to you now.

788
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,003
Avi’s mom is Yanna,
my best friend.

789
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,423
And her dad is Hiro,
Haze’s brother.

790
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,218
Don’t you like him?

791
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,638
Haze, I mean.

792
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,120
We’re just friends, Cy.

793
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,412
I admit, I’m comfortable
with him, but...

794
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,706
I see him as nothing
more than just a friend.

795
00:49:44,956 --> 00:49:46,791
And you’re not
giving him a chance?

796
00:49:48,204 --> 00:49:49,204
No.

797
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,031
He’s been with other women too.

798
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,493
Why are you even asking?
Are you giving me away?

799
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,619
Never.

800
00:49:58,996 --> 00:49:59,997
Good,

801
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,624
because I’d be mad if you did.

802
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,042
Sam?

803
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,842
Have you ever actually
been mad at me?

804
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,555
No.

805
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,143
But I admit you hurt me a lot.

806
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,512
Even then, I couldn’t bring
myself to be mad at you.

807
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,807
I used to think

808
00:50:29,834 --> 00:50:31,544
you just had a lot on your mind

809
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,597
and were too busy to notice
you were slipping away—

810
00:50:35,048 --> 00:50:37,092
that our relationship
had been on the rocks

811
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,367
for quite some time.

812
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,705
As for me,

813
00:50:42,556 --> 00:50:44,057
I was too understanding

814
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,200
to bring up any
of the issues I had.

815
00:50:46,853 --> 00:50:49,755
And that’s exactly
what the problem was, Sam.

816
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,945
You couldn’t tell me
what was really on your mind.

817
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,053
I wish you could
open up to me more.

818
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,015
I want to open up to you more.

819
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,892
To be honest,

820
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,686
I’ve been so lonely.

821
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,230
My career’s doing fine,

822
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,775
but I’ve been
living in the dark.

823
00:51:10,423 --> 00:51:11,485
Up to now,

824
00:51:12,054 --> 00:51:14,008
I’m still angry at my parents,

825
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,569
and I miss Naomi so much.

826
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,119
I know.

827
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,172
Losing her was the hardest
thing that happened to me.

828
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,340
Even now, I still remember her.

829
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,925
Sometimes,

830
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,553
I see her in the audience
while I walk on shows.

831
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,364
But I have no one
to talk to, you know?

832
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,143
So sometimes,

833
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,605
I just wish I could
lean on someone.

834
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,275
Hey,

835
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,028
you can hold on to me.

836
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,323
Even if you let go
of me again in the end.

837
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,618
Just hold on to me right now,

838
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,879
I don’t care what happens after.

839
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,377
That’s a selfless
thing to do, Cy.

840
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,380
You should know that, right?

841
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:18,797
Can you spend your
next free day with me?

842
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,138
I want to see the dogs.

843
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,681
Sure.

844
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,184
They miss their mom too.

845
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,568
Why did you still kiss me?

846
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,195
What does it mean?

847
00:53:18,722 --> 00:53:21,015
Because I still have
feelings for you, Sam.

848
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,283
Can you cuddle with me?

849
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:30,829
Because your behind
is brushing on my—

850
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:33,842
front.

851
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,340
In love or dating?

852
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,091
I’m just happy.

853
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,717
Hi, Avi.

854
00:53:41,742 --> 00:53:42,742
Oh, hi.

855
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:47,217
Daddy said you only
kiss people you like.

856
00:53:47,322 --> 00:53:48,948
Do you like Auntie?

857
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,519
You said we're going
somewhere fun.

858
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,396
I’m free for
the rest of the day.

859
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,941
Can Uncle join you guys?

860
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:59,336
You don’t get it.
We will have fun with—

861
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,404
Why? Can’t you have fun with me?

862
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,035
Samantha Vera?

863
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,119
Oh my god. It really
is Samantha Vera!

864
00:54:08,803 --> 00:54:10,681
- Can we get a photo with you?
- It really is her!

865
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:12,855
- Can we get a photo?
- Are you together?
