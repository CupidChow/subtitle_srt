[HIStory 2 - Right or Wrong]

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,800
Yesterday, there was a doll on the slide.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,100
It was sitting on top and then...

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,100
Yo Yo.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,200
Mommy, you're back!

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,700
You have grown so much! Wow.

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm 5 cm taller now.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,500
Really? I missed you so much.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,800
A kiss for you.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,000
And you are...

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,200
He's Brother Xiao Fei, whom daddy and I both love.

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,600
No, no. Don't misunderstand.

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,200
I'm just a student hired by Teacher to look after Yo Yo.

22
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,900
Oh. Thank you for looking after them for me.

23
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,500
You're welcome.

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,300
Let's go home.

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,200
Okay.

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,100
I came back especially to see you. Are you happy?

27
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,300
Let me tell you. We bought a lot of groceries.

28
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,100
We're going to cook dinner.

29
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,100
Then, how about I cook for you?

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,600
Okay.

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,500
So heavy.

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,100
Be careful.

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What exactly are you doing here?

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,300
I have something I want to discuss with you.

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,500
Let's talk after we eat.

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,800
Yo Yo, come here quickly.

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,400
You haven't had my cooking in a long time, right?

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,700
Yes.

41
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,400
Student.

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,000
There's no need to be shy. Let's all eat together.

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,300
I'm going home first.

44
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,800
Shi Yi--

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,500
Teacher, goodbye.

46
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,600
Yo Yo, bye-bye.

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,400
Bye-bye.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,300
The one who should be leaving isn't you.

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,600
Yo Yo, do you really want to eat together with Mommy?

50
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,100
Yes. You haven't been home in a long time.

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,300
You all can eat together, it's fine.

52
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,400
You eat with Yo Yo.

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,700
Yo Yo, I'm going out with Xiao Fei for a bit. I'll be home soon.

54
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,400
Okay.

55
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,700
Teacher.

56
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,800
Don't challenge my anger.

57
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,600
Shi Yi Jie.

58
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,600
Yo Yo, let's eat first.

59
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,300
Okay.

60
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,600
- Eat...
- The egg.

61
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,700
Okay, the egg. Do you want carrots?

62
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,100
No.

63
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,300
Okay, I'll eat them.

64
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,800
I want some veggies.

65
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Earlier, you--

66
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
You don't eat bean sprouts, right?

67
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,100
Shi Yi Jie, did I--

68
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't want to talk right now. Eat.

69
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I ordered this for you.

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,300
What should I do with you?

71
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,700
What's wrong?

72
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,400
You say it first. Why did you call me Teacher earlier?

73
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,600
You are my teacher to begin with.

74
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,000
I want to hear the truth.

75
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,400
Even if you don't say it, I can still guess what this is about.

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,000
But I want to hear you say it yourself.

77
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,100
I think it's better if people don't know.

78
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,500
What is it that's better if people don't know?

79
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
That we're together?

80
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,200
I don't care.

81
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,700
That's because you don't know

82
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,700
what happens to your life after people find out.

83
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,800
I know. I have been through it.

84
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,200
But you still have Yo Yo. You still have a job.

85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,500
Our relationship, it's fine if I know and you know.

86
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,400
Why must we tell others?

87
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
What if they don't accept it?

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,400
How awkward would it be at school?

89
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,500
The awkwardness is fine.

90
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,400
But if this gets out, it would be bad for you, too.

91
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,900
You don't know how bad those people can make things sound.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Even the strongest person would get hurt.

93
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't want to cause you hurt.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,400
Hurt me?

95
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,300
So you see yourself like this?

96
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,600
Our relationship?

97
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,800
So in the end, you just don't believe me.

98
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,200
You don't believe that I truly want to be with you.

99
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,900
I only want to protect you--

100
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,100
Don't use my protection as an excuse!

101
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,700
Even if that's true, did you even think

102
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,100
that before that, your mistrust in me has already hurt me?

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,400
Just because I was married once I can't receive your trust?

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,800
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,700
Your cowardice

106
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,800
makes me feel that my determination is very stupid.

107
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,500
The person you want to protect, is it me or yourself?

108
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,200
I'm not that scumbag senior from three years ago.

109
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't ever put me and him together!

110
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,700
The train station is over there. Find your own way home.

111
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,800
You're back.

112
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,100
Yo Yo fell asleep waiting for you.

113
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,900
But don't worry. I made sure she finished her homework and showered.

114
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,600
Her backpack is organized, too.

115
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,500
These are all habits that Yo Yo also has.

116
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,400
She doesn't need supervision.

117
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,000
Say it. What do you want?

118
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,000
I came to see Yo Yo and you.

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,500
I wanted to know if you both were doing well or not.

120
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,000
Leave, if you still won't say it.

121
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,400
I want to get back together.

122
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,200
Yo Yo needs a mother. This home needs a woman's touch.

123
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,000
You just realized that after four years of divorce?

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,100
You were the one who said that you couldn't handle staying home and taking care of Yo Yo every day.

125
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,700
You thought that I didn't love you.

126
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,500
That I only married you out of responsibility.

127
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,200
You thought Yo Yo and I had ruined your life

128
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,100
and you wanted me to let you go.

129
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,400
To get a divorce, you said all that. Don't you still remember?

130
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Don't you realize how very tiring it was to take care of Yo Yo back then?

131
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,800
She wasn't in good health. I was running to the hospital every day.

132
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,900
She used to cry and wail. It drove me crazy.

133
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,000
I endured it for four years. Wasn't that enough?

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,800
It wasn't any different for me. Day and night, I had two jobs.

135
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,300
Every day, there was school, tutoring classes, and the hospital, always running around between these three places.

136
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,700
You and I, neither of us had it easy.

137
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,600
I was too young then; too impulsive.

138
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,100
A lot of things, I didn't think through enough.

139
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,000
Then, take responsibility for the impulsiveness you had when you were young.

140
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,400
Everyone should be responsible for their actions until the very end.

141
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,800
I just want another chance.

142
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,400
I want to prove that I'm able to manage this household well.

143
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,700
I can do better than before.

144
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,600
I won't think about going out and working.

145
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,200
I'll be a full-time housewife.

146
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,100
Trust me. Trust me, okay?

147
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,300
I don't have the will to pay for your regrets.

148
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Shi Yi Jie!

149
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Be careful on your way. I won't be seeing you out.

150
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
He should be home by now.

151
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,300
So not all brain-dead cases are suitable as organ donors.

152
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,500
What are the conditions?

153
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,700
After a doctor pronounces the patient is brain dead.

154
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,200
Aged between two months and sixty years old.

155
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Free of systemic sepsis and any infections.

156
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,400
No malignant tumors, no infectious diseases.

157
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:36,900
Matches the blood type and size of organ required by the recipient.

158
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,400
Very good.

159
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,200
So some think that vegetative state patients are suitable organ donors,

160
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,700
but that's not true.

161
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,400
In order to donate organs, you must be brain dead.

162
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,200
Brain death refers to the death of the brainstem.

163
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,000
Although people in a vegetative state can't think, aren't conscious, and have no language ability,

164
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,500
they are still able to breathe on their own.

165
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,900
So they are not suitable as organ donors.

166
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,200
Understood?

167
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Yes.

168
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I just found out today that you can't be a donor when you're in a vegetative state.

169
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,900
I'm kidding. I knew that a long time ago.

170
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,200
Teacher, I still have some data to sort out.

171
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll be able to give you the completed work in a few days.

172
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What are you doing?

173
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,600
What exactly is going on between you and Shi Yi Jie lately?

174
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,300
Nothing.

175
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,000
If you two broke up then, of course, it's nothing.

176
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,500
But if it's a cold war, then that's something.

177
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,900
Which one is it?

178
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,200
I...

179
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,800
Okay. Then just don't say it.

180
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,400
Then I'll go tell Auntie that Shi Yi Jie's bullying you.

181
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,900
That's not true!

182
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,700
What is it then?

183
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,800
It's me that hurt him.

184
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,400
What? How is that possible?

185
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,000
This time, I can't help but defend him.

186
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,500
If I were him, I would definitely break up with you.

187
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,000
Hey, Ye Zi.

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,900
It's the truth.

189
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,300
Did you forget, in Year Two of high school,

190
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,800
how scared you were when you realized that you liked boys?

191
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,300
But what about him?

192
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,500
He's been married and even has a child.

193
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,300
The things he has to consider are so much more than people our age,

194
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,800
but yet he still decided to be with you.

195
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,300
Why do you think that is?

196
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Have you thought about

197
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,400
what kind of feelings and realizations he had to have to go tell Auntie all this?

198
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,900
He's using his actions

199
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,300
to tell you that he is very serious.

200
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
But what about you?

201
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,300
He wants to drag you into the sunlight to walk together.

202
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,600
So you shouldn't drag him back into a dark corner to hide.

203
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,400
Xiao Fei, you're really wrong this time.

204
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,400
Your cowardice makes me feel that my determination is very stupid.

205
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,200
The person you want to protect, is it me or yourself?

206
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm not that scumbag senior from three years ago.

207
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:23,000
Fei Sheng Zhe, can we talk?

208
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,300
There's no one here. You can talk now.

209
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,400
I don't understand why Yi Jie chose you.

210
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,800
Don't say things wrongly.

211
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,600
I already asked Shao An about you.

212
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,200
He's my younger brother.

213
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,800
I want to ask you for your help.

214
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,700
Help you with what?

215
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,600
Give Yi Jie and Yo Yo back to me.

216
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
Let me take care of them.

217
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,800
Let me fulfill my duties as a mother and wife.

218
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,200
Yo Yo is still so young. She needs a complete family.

219
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,200
A complete family, do you understand?

220
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,000
Please, I'm begging you. Okay?

221
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:35,100
I'm sorry. Yo Yo really misses you.

222
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,800
You're her mother. You can come visit her anytime.

223
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,300
But Shi Yi Jie... he is mine.

224
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,400
I won't let anyone else have him.

225
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,500
Don't try using the despicable moral persuasion of adults on him.

226
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,800
He will take it seriously.

227
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,400
Yi Jie?

228
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,700
I just...

229
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,000
Zhou Xin Ru, have you had enough?

230
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,900
I just want to get back the home that belongs to me.

231
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,700
That home ceased to exist when you asked for a divorce.

232
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,400
Please leave quickly. Otherwise, I'm going to call school security.

233
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,600
What you said earlier was very good.

234
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,400
I am yours. Please continue that.

235
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,600
Don't let anyone else have me.

236
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,200
Are you not angry?

237
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,300
Where would I get that much anger to be angry?

238
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,400
You little brat.

239
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,700
I'm sorry. You were right.

240
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,100
I wasn't trying to protect you.

241
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,600
I just wanted to protect myself.

242
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,700
I'm sorry for not trusting you.

243
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,000
You should apologize to me then.

244
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,600
For grouping me together with that scumbag.

245
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,800
I'm sorry.

246
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,200
I knew I shouldn't have promised Sister Juan to wait until you were 20.

247
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,600
What should I do with you, you little brat?

248
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,700
Have you turned in your will?

249
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,900
Why are you laughing? I'm being serious.

250
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,600
If you don't turn it in, I'll still fail you.

251
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,200
Fail me then.

252
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
You're very bold, aren't you?

253
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,700
Yo Yo!

254
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,400
Yo Yo!

255
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,400
Are you happy that mom's here to pick you up?

256
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,500
Let's go home, okay?

257
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,000
But Brother Xiao Fei said he's going to come pick me up.

258
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,100
Brother Xiao Fei is busy. He asked me to come pick you up.

259
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,800
Let's go home.

260
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,100
Okay.

261
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,000
Good girl. Let's go.

262
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Give me your hand.

263
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
What do you want to eat later?

264
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,200
Steak.

265
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,000
You want to eat steak? Then, we'll eat steak.

266
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,800
Okay.

267
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,900
Come to the supermarket with Mommy and later I'll cook steak for you.

268
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,200
Okay.

269
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
Bye, children.

270
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,400
Bye, Teacher.

271
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,500
Goodbye.

272
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,200
Teacher, excuse me.

273
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,900
Hi.

274
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,800
Are the children from Year One done with school?

275
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,700
Yes, they have all finished their classes.

276
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,900
Then, where's Yo Yo?

277
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,800
Yo Yo? She left already.

278
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,400
So? Did Zhou Xin Ru pick up?

279
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,600
Shao An, did you get in touch with her?

280
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,200
Her phone is switched off. Nobody is picking up at home.

281
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,600
Did your sister run away with Yo Yo?

282
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,600
How is that possible? She just got back from overseas, where can she go?

283
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,900
Why are you being so mean? I'm not the one who took Yo Yo away.

284
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,600
All right. Calm down, you two.

285
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,000
How about this? You and Ye Zi search on the route home.

286
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Sheng Zhe and I will head over there now.

287
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,600
Let's get in touch with each other if we find them.

288
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,400
Okay.

289
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,800
Don't worry.

290
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,900
My child was not taken by a stranger so at least I'm only half as worried.

291
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,700
She's Yo Yo's mother. She won't do anything to harm her.

292
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,500
If only I had gotten to the school earlier...

293
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,100
If it weren't for you,

294
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,200
we wouldn't even know Yo Yo was taken by her.

295
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,600
Once you realized that Yo Yo was gone,

296
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,000
you immediately asked school security to check the security footage.

297
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,300
That was already a big help.

298
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,800
What if Xin Ru insists on fighting you for Yo Yo?

299
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,000
My family belongs to me.

300
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,900
Yo Yo is. You are, too.

301
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,000
I won't ever back down.

302
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,400
Zhou Xin Ru!

303
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,900
- Ai!
- Hey, hey!

304
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,100
Ai!

305
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,900
Ai!

306
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,600
Shi Yi Jie!

307
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,700
Your arm.

308
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,300
Yi Jie! There's so much blood.

309
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,400
Do something. Stop the bleeding.

310
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,000
- Yi Jie.
- Shi Yi Jie.

311
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,100
I'm okay.

312
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,000
You're still saying you're okay?

313
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
How did it end up like this?

314
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,600
Yi Jie.

315
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Why isn't anyone here yet?

316
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,900
Teacher, are you all right?

317
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,800
I'm fine. Where's Yo Yo?

318
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,200
Don't worry. I asked Ye Zi to stay home and take care of her.

319
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,400
Mr. Shi Yi Jie.

320
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,700
Here.

321
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,600
Can we go in now?

322
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Yes. Does the wife want to go in with him?

323
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,700
Yes, I'll accompany him.

324
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,800
She's not my wife.

325
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,600
What are you saying? What's wrong with you?

326
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,700
He's a man.

327
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,300
How will you two be happy together?

328
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,800
That's enough, Sister.

329
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,000
Don't be like this.

330
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,800
And Yo Yo. Have you ever thought about her?

331
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
What if she's teased or bullied by others?

332
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,100
That will be the fault of you both, don't you know that?

333
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,300
That's enough, Sister.

334
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,400
That is our problem.

335
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
We don't need your concern.

336
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,400
Let's go.

337
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,300
This way.

338
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,000
Miss, please take care of him.

339
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,100
Shi Yi Jie!

340
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,700
That nail could be rusty. Does he need an injection for tetanus?

341
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,500
Sister!

342
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,400
Be careful!

343
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,900
Sister! Sister, wait for me.

344
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,000
Sister.

345
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,600
Sis.

346
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,100
I'm not wrong. It's Yi Jie who is too selfish.

347
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,900
He only cares about himself.

348
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,300
Sister, you're the one that only cares about yourself.

349
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,200
Back then, you couldn't handle taking care of Yo Yo

350
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,600
and was persistent in getting a divorce to go find work overseas.

351
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,500
You said you wanted to create your own life.

352
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,600
But now? You met some problems with work

353
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,700
so you came back to find Teacher and be a housewife again?

354
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,900
What do you understand?

355
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,300
I never forgot about them.

356
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,800
Especially Yi Jie.

357
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,600
Because we were separated, I became more certain that I love him.

358
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,800
I can't believe he's with a man now.

359
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,700
Was it because I hurt him too deeply?

360
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,300
So that now he has a grudge against women

361
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,100
and chose to be

362
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,100
- with a man?
- Sister.

363
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,500
Sister, stop thinking so highly of yourself. All right?

364
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,200
Teacher has the right to choose who he loves.

365
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
But they're both men.

366
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,100
So what if they're men?

367
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,700
True feelings and true love are not bound by gender.

368
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,300
Besides, you and Teacher divorced long ago.

369
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,900
He wasn't obliged to wait for you to confirm your own feelings.

370
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,300
But I'm not willing to be resigned to this.

371
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,700
What can you do if you're unwilling?

372
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,300
You're the one who gave up Teacher and Yo Yo.

373
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,200
You let yourself become their past.

374
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,000
Sister, considering that Teacher just saved you,

375
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,200
stop being so stubborn. Okay?

376
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,900
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.

377
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,400
Sister!

378
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,200
Sister!

379
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,300
The doctor said you can't drink alcohol.

380
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,600
Only water.

381
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,200
Yes, wife.

382
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,600
Hey, that counts as an indirect kiss.

383
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,000
I drank from it.

384
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,200
I'm sorry for making you worry.

385
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,600
Are you really not going to regret it?

386
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,500
Regret what?

387
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,800
Promise me first that you won't get angry.

388
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,200
Let me hear it first.

389
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,100
About what Zhou Xin Ru said this afternoon.

390
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,900
Perhaps, in the future, other people will also--

391
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,900
Ow!

392
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,000
Why did you suddenly bite me?

393
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,100
I'm angry.

394
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,200
Didn't you say you weren't going to get angry?

395
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,500
I didn't promise you that.

396
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,300
You just--

397
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,100
Yeah, you didn't say it.

398
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,000
We live our own lives.

399
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,200
What does that have to do with other people?

400
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,400
What I'm about to say next,

401
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,100
I will only say it one time.

402
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
So you better listen very carefully.

403
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,100
Nobody knows what the future holds.

404
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,900
I just know that I can't imagine a future without you.

405
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,700
What you just said...

406
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,000
I told you, I will only say it on--

407
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,000
I like you.

408
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,200
I'm only saying it once, too.

409
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,000
I initiated that just now.

410
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,200
So it's not breaking the promise you made to my mom.

411
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,900
Little brat.

412
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,900
What?

413
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,100
I also want a sip.

414
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
I can't reach it.

415
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,400
Hey, no. Just one sip.

416
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,400
As you wish, boss wife.

417
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,700
Hey.

418
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Who wrote you a love letter? And even left it in a book?

419
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,700
"Tibet Death Scrolls?" Is it a student of mine?

420
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,800
Yes.

421
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,500
You guys really know things well.

422
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,400
I taught you how to write wills and now you are all starting to write love letters.

423
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,900
You said so yourself.

424
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,400
Writing a good will means writing a good love letter.

425
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,500
I was just making things up.

426
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,200
Making things up?

427
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,500
If I didn't move you guys a little, you would never work on it yourselves.

428
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,000
Who'd write one for you?

429
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,800
You... You care?

430
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,900
I'm very jealous.

431
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,000
You're mine alone.

432
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,800
Hey, this is the library.

433
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,200
Be a little more subtle, okay? Don't be so cheesy.

434
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,600
You're going to reject it, right?

435
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,700
Of course.

436
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,900
I'm thinking of how I should turn them down more gently.

437
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,000
You need to be firm with rejections.

438
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,600
All right.

439
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,500
It's impossible to be gentle while rejecting someone.

440
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Especially when it comes to feelings.

441
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,700
Oh.

442
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,700
You mustn't give them hope.

443
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,600
Okay.

444
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,000
Xiao Fei!

445
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,900
Brother Xiao Fei, happy birthday!

446
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,900
Shh!

447
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,500
Yo Yo, didn't we agree to keep this a secret

448
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
and tell your daddy later?

449
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,400
But Daddy is not here.

450
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,300
Fei Sheng Zhe, today's your birthday?

451
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,700
Yes.

452
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,300
Happy birthday!

453
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,000
Xiao Fei? Yo Yo?

454
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,700
Uncle is here.

455
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,400
Yay!

456
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,900
Is today my birthday?

457
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,100
In your dreams.

458
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
Fine.

459
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,000
Where's Teacher and Xiao Fei?

460
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,400
Teacher thought us third wheelers were bad for his eyes, so he kidnapped the birthday boy.

461
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,900
I wanted to tell you,

462
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,800
but Ye Zi said to give you a surprise.

463
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,400
Are you angry?

464
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
What are you doing?

465
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,100
I couldn't prepare your 20th birthday present in time,

466
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,500
so I'm going to be the present and give myself to you.

467
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,200
You're not going to unwrap the present?

468
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,200
Here, it's my turn.

469
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,200
Okay.

470
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,000
I hope I'll be able to quickly get--

471
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Get who?

472
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,200
Why aren't you saying?

473
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,700
It isn't my birthday today anyway.

474
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,900
I want to play the "blowing the candles" game again.

475
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,000
Okay. I'll light them for you.

476
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,700
I wish to buy the Elsa watch and a little bear hat...

477
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,400
...and the ninja turtle toy.

478
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,300
Little children are really so innocent.

479
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,100
They are happy with such simple things.

480
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,800
Yes.

481
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,300
Xiao Fei, that idiot.

482
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,900
He's only 20 and he's already been stolen by someone.

483
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,800
He's so stupid.

484
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
What about you?

485
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,500
When are you planning to be stolen by someone?

486
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,800
Thirty.

487
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,300
Thirty?

488
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,200
That means...

489
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,900
I'll have to wait nine more years!

490
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,700
So? Don't wait if you can't wait.

491
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,500
No. Of course, I can wait.

492
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,100
Don't forget. I'm an archaeology major.

493
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,700
When it comes to antiques, the older it is, the more I love it

494
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,800
and the more passionate I become.

495
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,900
Then just wait a hundred years.

496
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,900
Then I'll wait a hundred years.

497
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,300
I haven't forgiven you yet

498
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,600
for snitching to your sister about my best friend's secret.

499
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,000
Oh,

500
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,500
- no--
- Sister Ye Zi.

501
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,400
I want to cut the cake.

502
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,300
Okay, I'll cut it for you.

503
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,800
Here. I'll help you cut it too, okay?

504
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,700
Okay. Here.

505
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,300
Do you want a big piece or a small piece?

506
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,000
A big piece.

507
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
This big, okay?

508
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,900
Okay.

509
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,200
All right. Here.

510
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,800
Hey.

511
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
Tee hee hee!

512
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,900
Attack! Attack!

513
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,700
Do you guys want to eat cake or not?

514
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,900
Really?

515
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,500
Then did anything happen to Uncle and Ye Zi after that?

516
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,600
Okay. Be a good girl, don't be so naughty.

517
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,700
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

518
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,100
Yes.

519
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,900
Okay. Bye-bye.

520
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,200
Was that Yo Yo?

521
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,100
She said she's staying over at Ye Zi's house tonight.

522
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,400
Are you all right? After all, it was your first time.

523
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
I tried my best to be gentle.

524
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,200
Hey.

525
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,000
How could you talk about these things so calmly?

526
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,800
Do you have lots of experience?

527
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,200
You care?

528
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,000
I don't.

529
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,400
- Who would care?
- You do.

530
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,500
Are you jealous?

531
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,300
Your jealousy is so cute. Have more vinegar, it's good for your health. (Jealous in Chinese sounds like "eating vinegar.")

532
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,500
Shi Yi Jie!

533
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Let's see if you dare to do that again.

534
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,900
Your spirit seems pretty good.

535
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,200
That's nonsense. I'm still young.

536
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,500
Since you're young, how about unwrapping this present again?

537
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,000
What kind of present throws itself about so readily?

538
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,400
Well, you can throw yourself at me instead then.

539
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,700
Okay. Come on.

540
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,200
Stop it. It's so ticklish.

541
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,200
Fei Sheng Zhe.

542
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,900
It's done.

543
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,300
Let's play again.

544
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,400
Once more. Once more.

545
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:42,000
♫ Nail and hook, little cat and little dog. Which one do we catch?

546
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,500
Daddy, you lost again.

547
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,200
What are you drawing this time?

548
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:55,500
One stroke, two strokes, and three strokes.

549
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,900
It's done? It's so ugly!

550
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,000
She drew it so ugly.

551
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Let's get married in two years.

552
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Daddy, are you really going to marry Xiao Fei?

553
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,500
Brother Xiao Fei, let me tell you something.

554
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,900
Whenever daddy feels shy, he hides in the bathroom.

555
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,300
Let me tell you. Daddy really does want to marry you.

556
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,500
And how do you know?

557
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,600
Because daddy said so last time.

558
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,100
He already pinky-promised Daddy that he'll marry me.

559
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,200
Really? But only a man and woman can get married.

560
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,400
That's not true.

561
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Two people who love each other can get married.

562
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,000
They can live together and grow old together.

563
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,200
Earlier, Daddy was really proposing to you.
