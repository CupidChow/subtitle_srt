[HIStory 2: Right or Wrong]

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,900
I'm begging you... For me, please stay.

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,400
I'm sorry, but I must go.

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,800
Why? We can finally be together after so long.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,000
I have my reasons. One day, you'll know.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
What reasons?

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,900
Tell me now.

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,200
We can find the solution together.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,100
You can't solve it.

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,100
Even I can't.

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,100
Xiao An!

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,400
Mommy, save me! Mommy, save me!

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,700
So, this is the reason you're leaving me?

22
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,800
Because you have a kid?

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,900
Who are you, little girl?

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,000
Smelly Xiao Fei,

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
stop adding random improvisations.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,800
Hey, why are you crying?

27
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
Her acting is really moving.

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,800
Little girl, why are you here all alone? Where's your mother?

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,500
A weird man was chasing me just now.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,300
Weird man?

31
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,400
He's over there.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,300
That's Xiao Jiang.

33
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,700
He's scaring little children again.

34
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,300
He isn't a weird man, little girl.

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,500
Yes. He...

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,800
He just dresses a little weird.

37
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,200
So, you're called Yo Yo?

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Yes, my name is Ke Yo. How about you?

39
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,500
I'm Ye Zi.

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,200
This place hasn't been cleaned for a long time.

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,300
My goodness.

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,800
Oh, dear. There's even a skeleton.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,900
Is this really a place for humans to live?

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,700
It stinks. It stinks.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,800
There's definitely a lot of cockroaches and rats.

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Yo Yo, do you really live here?

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,700
Yes.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What's that noise?

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,900
How would I know?

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Go on and take a look.

51
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,700
Why don't you go?

52
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,700
I don't want to.

53
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,500
Hurry up.

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,900
No.

55
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,600
Xiao Fei, you're the only guy here. Go!

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,300
All right.

57
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,300
What?

58
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,400
This!

59
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,400
Go!

60
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,100
What?

61
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,900
Daddy.

62
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,100
- Daddy?
- Daddy?

63
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,500
You're back?

64
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,600
I bought some bread for you.

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,900
Hurry and get up.

66
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,600
I bought some bread for you.

67
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,100
Wow. This...

68
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,800
Ye Zi, is this you?

69
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Isn't that so?

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,500
You can really cry.

71
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,200
Not bad, right?

72
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,600
Yes.

73
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,300
I couldn't tell.

74
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,300
Right? Right?

75
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,000
Does it look like an idol drama shoot?

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,800
Not bad.

77
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,500
You really made me look like the male lead in an idol drama.

78
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,700
Right?

79
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,300
But the director said we have a few more scenes to do.

80
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,300
We'll need to set a time.

81
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,700
Did you know?

82
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,500
The professor from the Life and Death Studies Department left early to give birth prematurely.

83
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,900
Premature birth? Really?

84
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,600
Then who's the substitute professor this time?

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,000
I think it's Death Note from the Anthropology Department.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Death Note?

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,500
Who's that?

88
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,800
Students!

89
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,400
Those who should leave, leave. Those who want to stay, stay.

90
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Once I begin the lesson, nobody gets to leave until the bell rings.

91
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,900
Mrs. Zhang gave birth prematurely but both the mother and baby are safe.

92
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,700
I will be taking over her class for the next two months.

93
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,100
Xiao Fei, isn't he...

94
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,700
Wow. He had a complete "face over."

95
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,200
Yes.

96
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,200
My surname is Shi. "Shi" as in "right" from right or wrong.

97
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,300
Shi Yi Jie.

98
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,900
Some of you have taken my class before,

99
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,800
so you should know my style.

100
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,500
As long as you follow the rules,

101
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,000
you'll be awarded marks that befit your efforts.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
If that's not what you want,

103
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,800
be prepared to be struck off (my list).

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,900
I will not hold back.

105
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,300
All right, let's begin class.

106
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:53,020
♫ Shadowed riverbank, cerulean streetlights ♫

107
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,350
♫ The past, how to let it go ♫

♫ What to do if I can't succeed? ♫

112
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,650
♫ I don't want to be lonely again so I let go of the heavy burden ♫

♫ I want to weave my future myself ♫

♫ No longer lonely ♫

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,700
Teacher?

120
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,300
Teacher? Wake up.

121
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Your first class is starting soon.

122
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,900
Okay.

123
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,200
I'll tidy things up for you.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,800
Good morning.

125
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Yo Yo, wake up.

126
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,500
Don't sleep any longer.

127
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,600
No!

128
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,700
You can't say no. Hurry and get up.

129
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,700
No sleeping in. Get up.

130
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,200
Where's Daddy?

131
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,000
Your dad is not home yet.

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,200
My stomach hurts. I don't want to go to school.

133
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,700
Liar. Get up.

134
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,800
You can't be like this. Get up and have breakfast.

135
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,600
Shi Ke Yo is naughty.

136
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
Get up.

137
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,400
Don't do that.

138
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,100
Are you trying to tickle me?

139
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,600
You're a bad girl, Shi Ke Yo.

140
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,300
Stop it.

141
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,900
Get up or else I'm going to carry you.

142
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,600
Yo Yo.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
You don't want it?

144
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,900
How about... this?

145
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,900
Your daddy won't even know if you don't eat it.

146
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,500
You really wanted Daddy to eat breakfast with you, didn't you?

147
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
No.

148
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I don't believe you.

149
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
That's why you don't want to eat when he's not here.

150
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,600
I said no.

151
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,300
Then, take a bite.

152
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll believe you if you take a bite.

153
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,300
Is it good?

154
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,600
No.

155
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,900
No? But you seem to be enjoying it.

156
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,200
That's not true at all.

157
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,600
You want more? Didn't you say it wasn't good?

158
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,000
You stinky guys.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,700
I hate all of you.

160
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,500
Yes, we are all stinky guys.

161
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,200
Our Yo Yo smells the best, right?

162
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,000
Then how about I eat breakfast with you?

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,700
Okay.

164
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,000
Great. Okay.

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
Do you want some juice?

166
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,100
No.

167
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,700
What do you want to eat?

168
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,500
You can't eat just that.

169
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,600
Have some kiwi.

170
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay, drink some juice.

171
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,300
Don't force me to eat.

172
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,700
Okay, I won't force you.

173
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,200
Email me your wills before next Tuesday's class.

174
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,000
What?

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,300
"What" what?

176
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,700
Teacher, I already wrote a will in high school.

177
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,200
Then write it again.

178
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
If you copy what you wrote before,

179
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,100
it will show how childish and clueless you were back then.

180
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,300
I will have you guys learn

181
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,200
how hard it is to write a proper will.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Class dismissed.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,700
He's indeed the Death Note.

184
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
If the allotted time for class changes wasn't over,

185
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,900
I would have switched out of this class long ago.

186
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:58,400
Teacher! I would like to speak with you.

187
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,200
Do you even remember that you have a daughter?

188
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,700
You haven't been home for five days.

189
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,600
Are you that confident about just leaving her home alone?

190
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,400
You're there. Did you forget about that?

191
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,300
I hired you to be her nanny.

192
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Do you even know me?

193
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,100
Am I a good or a bad person?

194
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,400
If I had wanted to do something to Yo Yo today,

195
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,700
would you have been able to protect her in time?

196
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,300
If you were a bad person

197
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,000
you wouldn't be telling me all this right now.

198
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,200
Don't tell me

199
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
that you left her with a nanny the whole time before.

200
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,000
She would tell me if she didn't like it.

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,600
Who does she tell it to if you're not home?

202
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,700
You're her only family.

203
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,900
How could you treat her so heartlessly?

204
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,100
Letting a child be lonely and sad?

205
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
What if she grows up with insecurities

206
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,300
and goes down the wrong path?

207
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,600
Whether someone becomes good or bad, it's personal to them.

208
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,500
F*ck. I can't believe you're actually a professor.

209
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,700
Fei Sheng Zhe, watch your tone.

210
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,300
You were a child once.

211
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,700
Do you not understand the feeling of wanting your parents' company?

212
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,500
I don't.

213
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,500
Shi Yi Jie!

214
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,000
What a jerk.

215
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,000
I only agreed because he couldn't find a nanny on such short notice.

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,300
Yo Yo is still too young to be left unattended.

217
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,400
Who knew that he wouldn't come home that day?

218
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,600
When he came home the next day, it was just to change his clothes.

219
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,800
Say, is there something wrong with his brain?

220
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,500
Is studying skeletons more important than his daughter?

221
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,600
Xiao Fei.

222
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,200
Does he even know

223
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
that raising a child is not like raising a pet?

224
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,800
It's not just giving them sunlight and wate--

225
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Are you sure you want to continue complaining like an aunty?

226
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I have no interest in hearing your domestic troubles.

227
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,500
Domestic troubles? Come on.

228
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,100
Yo Yo is only in Year One.

229
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,400
She's only seven.

230
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,200
This is when she needs her parent the most.

231
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
She doesn't have a mother.

232
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,300
The only person she can rely on is her heartless dad.

233
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,200
And, then, he actually just leaves her in a stranger's care.

234
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,300
Come on. The kid is naive, not stupid. Okay?

235
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,000
She might not know what abandonment is,

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,700
but I'm sure she can tell if she's being loved or hated.

237
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,300
Bye-bye.

238
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,900
Yo Yo. Yo Yo.

239
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,700
Why are you here?

240
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
I'm here to take you home.

241
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,200
Wait, we should buy some groceries first.

242
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't want to.

243
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,700
Why not?

244
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,200
If you don't come with me,

245
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,400
I might buy the wrong thing.

246
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,000
What if I buy bell peppers?

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,900
Don't buy bell peppers.

248
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
I hate bell peppers.

249
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,700
All right, I won't buy bell peppers.

250
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,400
If you go with me, then I won't buy the wrong things.

251
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,900
All right? Come with me.

252
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,900
Okay.

253
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,000
Where do I sit?

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
Oh, that's right.

255
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,400
Brother Xiao Fei, don't you think we look weird?

256
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,500
Where are we weird?

257
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,600
Because everyone else keeps staring at us.

258
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,900
Because they think we're so smart

259
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,200
since we thought to use the bike to carry the fruit.

260
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
No, they're laughing.

261
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,700
They're laughing

262
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,300
because Yo Yo is cute.

263
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,800
No, they're not.

264
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
They don't think I'm cute.

265
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,100
How do you know what they're thinking?

266
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,800
They feel happy when they see you, so they laugh.

267
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,600
Isn't that right?

268
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,700
What do you want to eat tonight?

269
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,300
Omelette rice!

270
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,100
Let's hurry home so I can make it for you. Okay?

271
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,500
Okay.

272
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,300
Let's speed up then. Okay?

273
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,400
Okay.

274
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,700
Speed up.

275
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,300
Stop.

276
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,500
Why are we stopping?

277
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,100
Let's see...

278
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,900
who will reach home first!

279
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,400
Start!

280
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,200
That's not fair. I'm going to ride the bike.

281
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,800
Run faster, Yo Yo.

282
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,900
I'm catching up to you.

283
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,400
Are you done?

284
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,700
Yo Yo, I'm almost done.

285
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,090
Just wait a bit more, okay?

286
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,100
Do you even know how to do it?

287
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,600
You're supposed to wait for me.

288
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,700
Be good, okay?

289
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
Another two minutes.

290
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,700
Are you done? I'm so hungry.

291
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,900
Take this first then.

292
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,700
Don't nibble it.

293
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,700
Here.

294
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,700
The delicious omelette rice

295
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,700
with Xiao Fei's special salad.

296
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,200
Let's eat.

297
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,100
What's wrong?

298
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,700
Why isn't there a smiley face on top?

299
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,000
Before, my mom used to draw a smiley face on it.

300
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,100
Why does a smiley face have such a dark history?

301
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,700
I'll draw one for you.

302
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,100
What's a dark history?

303
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,700
A dark history is...

304
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,400
You'll understand it when you're older.

305
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,000
Here.

306
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,400
A smiley face, right?

307
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,100
Yes.

308
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, it's angry.

309
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,900
Nose...

310
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,700
It's not like that.

311
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,900
Why not? It looks nice.

312
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,100
You should draw the mouth like this.

313
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,300
See? Like this.

314
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,500
And this is the nose.

315
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,000
You forgot the nose.

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,400
The nose is too big.

317
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,700
It's okay. I like it.

318
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,300
Why don't you draw it for me, too?

319
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay, I'll fill in your mouth.

320
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,100
Yours is bigger,

321
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,700
so I'm drawing a bigger one.

322
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Okay.

323
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,300
Okay. I'll practice how to draw smiley faces later.

324
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,300
Okay.

325
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,800
Let's eat.

326
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Let's eat.

327
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,600
Mom,

328
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,400
you're on the extra night shift today. Right?

329
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,600
Okay.

330
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,700
Please find the time to get some rest.

331
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,800
Okay.

332
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,400
I know.

333
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
Bye-bye.

334
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,500
Yo Yo,

335
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,300
are you sure your daddy will eat this?

336
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,400
Yes. He always eats the food I leave for him.

337
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,400
That's not how you use, "holding the fort."

338
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,900
Stop using idioms if you're going to use them wrong, Mister.

339
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,500
That's not the point.

340
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,900
The point is,

341
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,200
do you have any idea how to solve this problem?

342
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,900
Compared to that, you should worry about your will first.

343
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,800
Have you written it?

344
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,900
I don't want to.

345
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,700
Don't be so stubborn.

346
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,800
Listen, I asked Zhou Shao An

347
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,600
and he said Shi Yi Jie really strikes people off and fails them.

348
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,400
Don't take your credit points lightly.

349
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,800
Okay, okay, I know.

350
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,200
Brother Xiao Fei, I'm done showering,

351
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,700
but I forgot my towel.

352
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,000
Can you bring it to me?

353
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,600
Okay, Yo Yo. Hold on. I'll be right there.

354
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,900
Hey, I can't talk to you any longer.

355
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Yo Yo is done showering. I'm going to ger her a towel.

356
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,500
Bye-bye.

357
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Hey, wait.

358
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
That guy is addicted to being a nanny.

359
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,900
Daddy, my stomach hurts.

360
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,600
Yo Yo.

361
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,200
What's wrong, Yo Yo?

362
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,300
Where are you hurting, Yo Yo?

363
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,400
My stomach.

364
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,500
Your stomach hurts?

365
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,600
Here?

366
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,100
Don't shout. Don't shout.

367
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,900
Hang in there. I'll take you to the hospital. Okay?

368
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,600
Okay.

369
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,500
It's all right. It's all right.

370
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I'll take you to the hospital.

371
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:09,900
It hurts.

372
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,200
It's okay.

373
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,900
Really?

374
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,800
That's great!

375
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,400
I didn't think there would be more relics after the White Bone Pit.

376
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,300
This is a huge discovery. I'm very interested.

377
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,400
Why don't we do this?

378
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
Send me your files first.

379
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
I'll take a look and get back to you.

380
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,200
All right.

381
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,300
Okay.

382
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,600
Okay. Then let's leave it like this. Thank you.

383
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,290
[Emergency Room]

384
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,500
Fei Sheng Zhe.

385
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,300
Where's Yo Yo?

386
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,900
I called you so many times.

387
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,600
Do you know what happened to Yo Yo?

388
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,100
Neurogenic gastritis.

389
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,800
What kind of stress is she under to suffer from that?

390
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,000
Where is Yo Yo?

391
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,800
Do you know what Yo Yo needs?

392
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,600
She needs a real father.

393
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,300
One who stays by her side and helps her with homework...

394
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
and walks her to school.

395
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Not some skeleton researcher...

396
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,400
who leaves her with a nanny.

397
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,100
You don't deserve to be a father.

398
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,500
You're nothing but a jerk!

399
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,800
That's enough. That's enough.

400
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,000
Be quiet, this is a hospital.

401
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,600
Mom.

402
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
You're Ah Jie, right?

403
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,600
Sister Juan?

404
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,150
Why are you still like before,

405
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,850
always having a sour face?

406
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,350
Give me a smile.

407
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,350
Don't always have on a sour face.

408
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,450
You'll scare the children.

409
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,050
Sister Juan.

410
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,250
All right. After this,

411
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,150
get her medicine. After her drip infusion is done,

412
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,250
you'll be able to take your daughter home.

413
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,750
Thank you, Sister Juan.

414
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,750
You're welcome.

415
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,050
I didn't think that Fei Sheng Zhe would be your son.

416
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:34,350
And I didn't think the heartless father he talks about is you.

417
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,850
Indeed, I'm not fit to be a father.

418
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,650
Actually, everyone

419
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:49,050
learns how to become parents only after they have kids.

420
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,250
There's no need to be depressed.

421
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,850
I'm sorry.

422
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,650
My son is quite sensitive about this matter.

423
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,850
That's probably because

424
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,650
he only has a mother who's always busy with work.

425
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,450
Since young, I haven't had time to take good care of him.

426
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,850
So, he has always been lonely.

427
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,350
Even worse, because of my negligence,

428
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,150
he once got hurt.

429
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,550
I guess it's for this reason,

430
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,750
he decided to agree to take this job.

431
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,650
Because your daughter is in

432
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,550
a similar situation to his own at one time.

433
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,550
How does she tell you if you're not home?

434
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,850
You're her only family.

435
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,650
How could you treat her so heartlessly?

436
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,350
You were a child once.

437
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,250
Do you not understand the feeling of wanting your parents' company?

438
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,550
Daddy, where's Brother Xiao Fei?

439
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,250
He has gone home.

440
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,350
Does your stomach still hurt?

441
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,850
A little bit.

442
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,850
Let me tell you.

443
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,050
He carried me to the car

444
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,150
and also took me to the hospital.

445
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,950
He even cried.

446
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,550
But I didn't cry. I even comforted him.

447
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,750
He couldn't find you,

448
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,550
so he cried.

449
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,150
But luckily you came.

450
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,950
And I stopped hurting.

451
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,950
Mom, how do you know Shi Yi Jie?

452
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,950
It was probably about ten years ago.

453
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,150
I was volunteering at an orphanage.

454
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,450
It so happened that he came back for a visit.

455
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,350
Came back?

456
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,050
You mean,

457
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,150
he grew up in an orphanage?

458
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,250
I also heard it from the Dean.

459
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,250
His family of four went on a trip one time;

460
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,050
and at its end, an accident happened.

461
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,350
He was the only one who survived.

462
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,450
But, like a rubber ball,

463
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,650
he kept being tossed around, here and there,

464
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,750
by his relatives.

465
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,450
Ultimately,

466
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,650
he had to go to an orphanage.

467
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,350
I didn't think that guy's dark history

468
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,850
would really be this dark.

469
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,150
Will Brother Xiao Fei come tomorrow?

470
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,350
Do you like him?

471
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,050
Yes.

472
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,850
I like to eat his omelette rice.

473
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,250
He helps me with my homework after we eat.

474
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,550
He also signs my contact book after I finish my homework.

475
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,750
He comes to school to pick me up on his bicycle.

476
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,250
He brings me along when he buys groceries.

477
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,450
Go to sleep if you want to.

478
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,550
No. I want to talk with you.

479
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,050
Let me tell you.

480
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,150
I got 100% on my test this week.

481
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,850
I bought gummies for you.

482
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,550
But since you didn't come home,

483
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,150
I ate it myself.

484
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,450
Daddy is sorry.

485
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,150
Next time, tell me if you bought me gummies.

486
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,550
I'll make sure to come back and eat them.

487
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,150
They're probably asleep by now.

488
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,850
I beat him up and criticized him at the hospital today.

489
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,350
Why would he want to see me?

490
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,950
What if he really fails me?

491
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,850
Why did I have to be so rash?

492
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,150
It's too late for regrets now.

493
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,950
Delivery?

494
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,450
You bought pudding?

495
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,650
Yo Yo likes it.

496
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,450
Bread?

497
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,250
I reckon you guys are too busy to make breakfast.

498
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,950
Do I drink milk?

499
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,450
Children need it to grow.

500
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,850
Apples?

501
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,450
It's good for the skin.

502
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,250
I want to eat omelette rice.

503
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,850
What?

504
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,350
What are you looking at?

505
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,250
Have you never seen someone beating eggs?

506
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,150
I have never seen someone beating eggs for that long.

507
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,450
If you beat it longer, more air gets into it

508
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,150
and the eggs will become fluffier.

509
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,650
What would you know?

510
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,350
Why would you need fluffy eggs for omelette rice?

511
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,350
Mine do.

512
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,950
Enjoy the food. I'm leaving now.

513
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,950
Let's eat together.

514
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,350
This fluffy omelette is suspicious.

515
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,050
If anything were to happen,

516
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,550
at least it will happen to both of us.

517
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,550
Eat up.

518
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,650
Hey, I want a beer, too.

519
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,150
You're not of age yet.

520
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,550
I'm already 19.

521
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,750
I can buy my own alcohol.

522
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,350
Really?

523
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,050
That's too bad. This is the last can in the fridge.

524
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,650
I don't believe that you had your first beer only after you came of age.

525
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,310
I did.

526
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,750
Really?

527
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,650
I wouldn't ask someone

528
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,350
to do the things that I couldn't.

529
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,750
Drink your juice, brat.

530
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,250
When you were young--

531
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,750
Why did you stop asking?

532
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,550
Well?

533
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,750
Are you afraid of bringing up sad memories

534
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,250
and making the other person feel bad,

535
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,450
so you avoid the matter?

536
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,650
Do you know that your pretense

537
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,550
is more hurtful to others?

538
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,550
You might as well be straightforward and just ask.

539
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,990
So, I can ask about it?

540
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,950
But I don't wish to answer it.

541
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,850
Are you kidding me?

542
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,650
Cheers.

543
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,350
Thank you for taking care of Yo Yo today.

544
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,450
You must have been scared.

545
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,550
It was my first time encountering that situation.

546
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,450
Yo Yo is still so young

547
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,350
and she was in so much pain.

548
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,480
I thought the food I cooked made her sick.

549
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,950
You did well.

550
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,750
Thank you.

551
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,950
What are you doing?

552
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,650
I thought you wanted to cry.

553
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,250
I'll lend you my shoulder.

554
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,650
Who wants to cry? Not me.

555
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,850
I'm going home now.

556
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,150
Good morning, Brother Xiao Fei.

557
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,150
Good morning, Yo Yo.

558
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,150
Are you still feeling unwell, Yo Yo?

559
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,350
No.

560
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,250
Wait just a minute then.

561
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,350
Breakfast is almost ready.

562
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,950
Okay.

563
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,150
Good morning.

564
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,650
Daddy, I thought you disappeared,

565
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,850
but you're still here.

566
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,350
I won't disappear.

567
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,350
Do you want to brush your teeth?

568
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,850
Okay.

569
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,950
Dad, it stings.

570
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,250
Is the toothpaste too minty?

571
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,250
Yes.

572
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,150
Are you guys done? Breakfast is ready.

573
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,650
Brother Xiao Fei, did you brush your teeth?

574
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,250
Of course.

575
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,150
Let me tell you.

576
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,650
Dad gave me the adult toothpaste instead of a kid's toothpaste.

577
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,250
Then I'll buy you one tomorrow, okay?

578
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,550
Okay.

579
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,850
Quick, brush your teeth. Let's see who finishes first.

580
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,750
Bottom.

581
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,650
Let's see who's faster.

582
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,300
The left side.

583
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,650
This is all for today.

584
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,450
Submit your homework if there are no questions.

585
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,350
All right, class dismissed.

586
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,250
Ye Zi,

587
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,050
the teacher in the next class is on leave. Let's go write our reports in the library.

588
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,250
You still remember there's a report that we need to finish?

589
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,150
I'm really sorry.

590
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,350
You know that I have been busy lately.

591
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,050
How about I treat you to lunch?

592
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:36,750
You said it yourself.

593
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,150
Okay.

594
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,650
I want to go to the shop behind school for lunch.

595
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,250
Fei Sheng Zhe.

596
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,250
Yes, what is it?

597
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,450
I'm not coming home for dinner.

598
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,450
Please tell Yo Yo for me.

599
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,050
Sure.

600
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,050
This is the money for this week's groceries.

601
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,750
This is too much.

602
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,050
Two thousand is already enough.

603
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,250
That's fine. Return the extra or keep it yourself, if it's not too much.

604
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,450
Buy something for yourself, too.

605
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,550
Okay.

606
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,450
Then, I'll take Yo Yo to the supermarket

607
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,050
and buy some daily necessities.

608
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,850
The toilet paper at home is almost out.

609
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,050
And the washing detergent.

610
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,250
I'll leave the receipts on the table later.

611
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,750
You can check them when you get back.

612
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,850
Fine.

613
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,350
Also... don't eat instant noodles at night anymore.

614
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,550
Buy more nutritious food.

615
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,850
Okay.

616
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,450
Bye-bye.

617
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,750
What's the matter?

618
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,250
Hey. You and Shi Yi Jie have been really close lately.

619
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,950
It feels like you two are family.

620
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,750
We're not that close.

621
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,450
But you are!

622
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,550
Weren't you so annoyed with him before?

623
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,950
You called him a "heartless jerk."

624
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,250
Actually, he isn't that bad.

625
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,150
How so?

626
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,150
Since Yo Yo fell sick,

627
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,150
he's become nicer.

628
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,250
He calls me when he's unable to come home.

629
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,250
One time, he was so busy at school, he didn't come home,

630
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,150
but he hurried home the next morning to have breakfast with Yo Yo.

631
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,750
I guess he is a nice guy, then.

632
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,950
Then, why was he so indifferent toward Yo Yo before?

633
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,850
He looked like an irresponsible father.

634
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,150
He didn't do it on purpose.

635
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,550
It's just that he didn't know how to care for her.

636
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,750
Didn't know how to care for her?

637
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,150
Please. Caring is a natural instinct.

638
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,450
Shh, be quiet.

639
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,150
Even children know how to do it, okay?

640
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:50,150
Anyway, he has his own reasons.

641
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,350
He didn't do it on purpose.

642
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,350
He has his reasons?

643
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,750
What about you?

644
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,450
What reasons do you have?

645
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,850
But even if Yo Yo reminds you of when you were younger,

646
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,550
so you take very good care of her.

647
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,850
Isn't it too much to take care of Shi Yi Jie, too?

648
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,650
Why are you caring about it so much?

649
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,050
It's none of your business.

650
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,050
Watch your video.

651
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,350
Gossip.

652
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,450
Hey, Sissy.

653
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,550
Do you even have a penis?

654
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,450
Take off your pants so we can check.

655
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,050
Did you wear panties to class today?

656
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,950
Don't tell me you're wearing a bra, too.

657
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:47,850
Don't come near me.

658
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,650
That's so gross.

659
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,950
Hey, what's your cup size?

660
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,850
They're about this big.

661
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:52,550
Maybe it's a 23.

662
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,550
No, I touched it. It's probably a 25.

663
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,650
Don't come near me, gross. Go away.

664
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,950
Even a real fag wouldn't like you.

665
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,950
Do you have pictures of you dressed as a girl?

666
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,850
Do you fantasize about doing things with guys?

667
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,750
Hey, I heard you like our senior.

668
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,950
The school hunk.

669
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,650
Yeah.

670
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,650
He's the school hunk.

671
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,350
Are you two together?

672
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,450
He likes me, too.

673
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,550
He likes you?

674
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,450
You must be kidding.

675
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,250
No way.

676
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:17,750
Stop lying.

677
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,350
Nonsense. It'd make more sense if he liked me.

678
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,750
You're thinking too much.

679
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,050
Speak up.

680
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,550
I'm asking you something.

681
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,850
The senior's over there. He's here.

682
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,350
Come here.

683
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,150
Come. Come.

684
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,350
Come over here.

685
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,150
Senior.

686
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,050
Explain yourself. Hurry.

687
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,350
He said you two are together.

688
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,350
Does he like you or do you like him?

689
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,650
Yeah, are you two together?

690
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,950
Tell us.

691
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,050
Have you been together for a long time?

692
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,250
I'm not together with him.

693
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,250
So, you two are not together?

694
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,350
Hey, the Senior has spoken.

695
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,550
He doesn't want you.

696
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,350
Yeah.

697
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,850
You're the one pestering him, right?

698
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,550
Didn't you say you liked me?

699
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,250
You're the one who said you liked me first.

700
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,850
Stop spewing nonsense.

701
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,050
I'm not gay.

702
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,250
I like you. I really do.

703
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,650
Stop making the entire school misunderstand, okay?

704
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,250
There's no way I would like you.

705
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,050
See? He's walking away.

706
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:06,650
He doesn't like you.

707
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,750
He's gone.

708
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,350
He has abandoned you.

709
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,850
There are still some other guys here.

710
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,750
Which one do you like?

711
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,350
We have some here.

712
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,250
Who do you like?

713
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,950
You can give it a try.

714
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,750
Can I really?

715
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,550
Do whatever you want.

716
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,850
You dare lay your fingers on a high schooler?

717
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,550
He said it was fine.

718
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,050
It's okay just because he said it was?

719
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,050
Would you eat dung if he told you to?

720
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,750
Get out of here!

721
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,150
Are you okay?

722
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,350
I'm talking to you.

723
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,850
Do you want to do it with me?

724
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,050
Is this something you should say to a stranger?

725
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:46,450
