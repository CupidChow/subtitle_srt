Brother Meen took good care of me.

When are you planning to
tell me about this?

266
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,180
You’re being too old-fashioned.

268
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,820

Huh?

270
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,220
Well, Mom, here's the thing. We...

271
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,380
I only want to know this,
so I don’t have to worry.

272
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,030
You understand, right?

273
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,740
Auntie.

274
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,980
Huh?

275
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,420

276
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,940

277
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,620
More than just a brother.

278
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,580
That's easy.

279
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,440
Actually, since you were both about to
graduate from high school,

280
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,300
I’ve been hoping to set you up with him.

281
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,500
In my eyes, Tul is a wonderful person.

282
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,630
That’s why I let him bring over dog food
to win your favor.

283
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,460
I’m the one who brought you two together.

284
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,460
Forget it.

285
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,340
As long as you take care of each other,
that’s enough.

286
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,300
I’m one of the people supporting you,

287
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,780

288
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,500
Well, come on. Let’s eat together.

289
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,500
Okay, I’ll serve you.

290
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,940

292
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,940
Okay, thank you.

293
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,620

294
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,300
What's wrong, Brother Meen?

295
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,230
Why are you pretending to be angry?

296
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,180
It's scary!

297
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,900
Oh.

298
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,620
What? Can’t I tease you a little?

299
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,340
Huh?

300
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,460
You scared me.

301
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,100
Oh.

302
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
I was just kidding.

303
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,220
Can you stop joking like that?

304
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,060
OK. OK.

305
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,380
Oh.

306
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,940
Alright, Brother Meen.

307
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,180
Oh.

308
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,780
I'm so sad.

309
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,620
Okay, don't be sad.

310
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,420
It's been a while.
Can’t I just make a joke?

311
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,180
-No.
-Oh.

312
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,700
Cute.

313
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,220

314
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,620

Tul, you must make Meen
the luckiest man in the world.

318
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,060
Okay, Auntie.

319
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,390
Then I’ll head home now.

320
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,260
Come give me a hug, dear.

321
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,180
I'll miss you so much.

322
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,700
Don't lie to me.

323
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,830
What was that posture just now?

324
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,500
Doggy style.

325
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,700
Tul.

326
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Ah, why are you blushing?

327
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,910
That’s what people in relationships
call it.

328
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,860
But it’s different
when you actually tell others.

329
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,020
I'm not used to it.

330
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,700
Well.

331
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,420
Have you ever thought about
having a child?

332
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

333
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,980
My mom...

334
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,420
When I was young,

335
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,220
she told me she wanted
a grandchild one day.

336
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,980
Most heterosexuals

337
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,980
will raise kids, right?

338
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,740
So I want to know

339
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,100
if we can't have a child,

340
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,320
does that mean we might have a chance
of breaking up?

341
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,940
You know what, Brother Meen?

342
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,660
I hate separation.

343
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,140
Back then, when I first learned
you were moving to Chiang Mai,

344
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,660
I was just a kid.

345
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,590
All I wanted was to follow you,
but I couldn’t.

346
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,580
But I know...

347
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,980
No matter what,
we’ll be separated by death.

348
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,540
It depends on who dies first.

349
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,620
But if I can choose,

350
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,540
I’d rather be the one who dies first.

351
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,550
Then I wouldn't have to
live in my longing for you.

352
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,220
But I'm also afraid that if I die first,

353
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,180
you'll live in your longing for me.

354
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,380
What you want to say is
nothing lasts forever, right?

355
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,580
Every minute I'm here,

356
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,020

00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,980
Can I eat your sausages every day?

540
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,020
Here.

541
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,740
This is yours.

542
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,300
Fried rice with sausage.
I made it for my boyfriend.

543
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,180
Wait.

544
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,320
When did I become your boyfriend?

545
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,670
We've been living together for a year.

546
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,100
Are we still cousins?

547
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:38,060
A golden retriever puppy.

548
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,340
Hum.

549
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,100
Cousins can't do this.

550
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,260
Tul.

551
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,700
Be my boyfriend, Brother Meen.

552
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:12,180
Let me fill in the meaning
of home for you.

553
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,100
You know what?

554
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:30,940
I used to think
living alone was what I wanted.

555
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,300
Until I met you.

556
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,380
Here.

557
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,580
Love you, Mr. Nirun.

558
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,740
Let's be together forever.

559
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,500
Okay.

560
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,420
In that case,

561
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,740
Mr. Nirun will have two dads.

562
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,580
Yes.

563
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,100
Daddy Tul and Daddy Meen.

564
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,140
Come, let's put on the collar.

565
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,220
Here.

566
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,940
Look. How is it? Is it cute?

567
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,740
Wow, a new collar.

568
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,460
Isn't it cool?

569
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,380
Wow, it looks great on you.

570
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,660
Okay.

571
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,620
Wow.

572
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,140
-Wow, so cool.
-It looks so cool.

573
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,460
Careful, the balloon might pop.

574
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:07,940
Not yet.

575
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
-It hasn't exploded yet.
-Not yet.

576
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,660
I'm sorry.

577
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,420
Come on.

578
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,740
Excuse me.

579
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,300
-We're coming in.
-Are you going in? Go. Go.

580
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,540
Oh no.

581
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,220
Hello, everyone.

582
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,020
Hello.

583
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,260
Hello, kid.

584
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,420
Oh, what’s going on?

585
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,980
So cute.

586
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,860
Yes.

587
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,580
What?

588
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
Where did you buy this?

589
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,580
Right?

590
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,020
-It's blue.
-It's not bad.

591
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,260
Is it pretty?

592
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,260
Yes.

593
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,620
What?

594
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,660
I almost got late.

595
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,020
Look over there.

596
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,580
What?

597
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,310
There's something over there.

598
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,660
Where? I didn't see anything.

599
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,420
Here.

600
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,660
What are you doing?

601
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,460
Just kidding.

602
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,220
I'm going to help my friend
tidy things up.

603
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,540
Where are you going?

604
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,380
To help my friend tidy things up.

605
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,740
What are you looking at?

606
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,740
So cute.

607
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,740
An old dog and a puppy.

608
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,180
I get shy too.

609
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,340
I'm happy for you. You finally found
someone who truly loves you.

610
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,700
My former owner abandoned me,
so I should find a new owner.

611
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,060
Goodness.

612
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,300
You're making me feel guilty.

613
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,500
Just kidding.

614
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,300
But you're right.
It's best for us to be friends.

615
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,300
Yes.

616
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:55,060
How is it?
Not chasing after me saves you money, huh?

617
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,300
Well, he's obsessed with football.

618
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,420
I bought a plot of land to
build a football field.

619
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,780
So he doesn't have to
go too far away from me.

620
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,180
Can you stop acting like
you're from a novel?

621
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,060
Why?

622
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,520
You're handsome and rich.
You're not like a real person at all.

623
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,260
Can you give me a hug?

624
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,420
No.

625
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,780
A friend's hug.

626
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,300
Still nope.

627
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
The little puppy would get jealous.

628
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,060
I understand.

629
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,380
But this is okay.

630
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,740
Yes.

631
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,300
I'm really happy to have you as my friend.

632
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,900
Me too.

633
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,780
Hey.

634
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,820
Brother Meen, let's blow out the candles.

635
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,500
Yeah, we're about to go.

636
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,260
Did we interrupt you?

637
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,900
No, I'm leaving.

638
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,460
Take care of my friend for me, Phetai.

639
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,060
Okay.

640
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,540
Let's go.

641
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,300
What?

642
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,300
Let's talk.

643
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,820
You really get jealous, huh?

644
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,940
I’ve got a boyfriend. Being
a little jealous is normal, isn’t it?

645
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,420
Seeing my boyfriend chat with his ex.
Who wouldn’t be jealous?

646
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,060
But now I’ve got you.

647
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,060
Do you think we’ll be a good couple
in the future?

648
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,460
I don't know.

649
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,940
But I'm sure we won’t have an ending.

650
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,700
Let's go. They're waiting.

651
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,900
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

652
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,740
I’ve always felt that everyone who
walks into our lives is never by accident.

653
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,700
They might be friends who
bicker with us every day.

654
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,460
They might be right beside us,
yet we never noticed.

655
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,040
They might have been abandoned
for a long time,

656
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,180
[Lifemate care+]

657
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,170
but in the end, they still
find a place where they belong.

658
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,660
He may not be able to say it.

659
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,060
But every time we go home,
he’s the one who shows the most joy.

660
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,140
The one who makes us
want to come back every single day.

661
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,940
You know what?

662
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,000
I always dreamed of having a boyfriend
during college.

663
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,340
And you know what?

664
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,500
This is not a dream. It’s real.

665
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,500
Is it reality or a dream?

666
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,460
What are you doing?

667
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,580
What?

668
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,980
You're totally my type.

669
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,100
Like, completely my ideal.

670
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,740
How did a kid who got kicked out
and had to find a new place to live

671
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,620
end up here with me now?

672
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,220
Because you picked this kid up
and raised him.

673
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,460
Woof, woof, woof.

674
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,980
Woof.

675
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,740
You little puppy.

676
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,340
Oh.

677
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,060
Woof.

678
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,060
No, no.

679
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,740
Let me ask you something.

680
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:11,580
Why did you insist on
chasing after me back then?

681
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,580
Because I had hope.

682
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,380
And I felt like you gave me hope too.

683
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,580
When did I give you hope?

684
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:35,300
If it were a drama, you gave me hope
from the first episode to the final one.

685
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,870
But weren’t you the one
who liked me first?

686
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,140
I liked you first.
But you fell for me too.

687
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,380
We've been together for almost a year.
When we look at each other,

688
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,820
do you still get shy?

689
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,100
Yes.

690
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,900
Me too.

691
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,940
Can I ask you for a favor today?

692
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,420
What is it?

693
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,460
Can you be Meen Tul?

694
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,780
No.

695
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,620
I can only be Tul Meen.

00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,860
