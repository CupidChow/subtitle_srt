177
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,620
[An engineering school student
let his boyfriend use a 50% discount.]

178
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,530
Gosh!

179
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,390
Junior!

180
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,470
Miss, how much money was the discount?

181
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,670
I'll pay it to you.

182
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,050
No need. Is there really nothing
between you and that guy?

183
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,560
You look like a couple.

184
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,390
No, I'll pay the full price.

185
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,790
No need.

186
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,100
I'm a BL fan. He has paid for your food.

187
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,220
Uh...

188
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,190
Sorry, I used the kitchen
without your permission.

189
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,300
You know how to cook?

190
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,360
I cook, I'm good at caring animals
and people love me.

191
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,700
If a busy person like you

192
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,360
adopts me,

193
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,950
I promise I'll take good care of you
for the rest of your life.

194
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,990
I refuse.

195
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,160
It's already tiring to keep Mr. Nirun.

196
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,870
I made yours too. Have a seat.

197
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,100
Well, I've had lots of assignments
to do recently.

198
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,850
Can I invite a friend here
to do assignments with me?

199
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,650
Yes.

200
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,050
I won't mind if you ask people

201
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,590
to do assignments here with you here.

202
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,760
Mr. Nirun, this is for humans.
You can't eat it.

203
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,280
I've prepared something you can eat.

204
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,670
Here.

205
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,460
It's made according to the same formula
as Mali's mother's.

206
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,870
Eat up, Mr. Nirun.

207
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,990
You know Mali?

208
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,450
The food its mother cooks for it is
better than that she cooks for people.

209
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,390
Cute, right?

210
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,450
Which Mali? Show it to me.

211
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,870
Of course, Kitty.

212
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,450
What did you cook?

213
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,050
Fried rice with sausage.

214
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,160
There's some left in the fridge.

215
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,360
I still remember

216
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,850
when I was a kid, we had it together.
My mom made it for us.

217
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,020
Tul.

218
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,500
I've eaten. I'll get back to work.

219
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,620
Hey. You won't eat
the fried rice with sausage I made?

220
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,560
I don't want to.

221
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,160

Samoyed.

If I have a lover,

246
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,890
I also want to raise a dog with them.

247
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,690
You're so small just like a cat.

248
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,100
I think you'd better keep a Persian cat.

249
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,790
Don't say that. You may get scratched
by a cat.

250
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,750
A small cat's scratch
can get you really hurt.

251
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,470
You want me to teach you a lesson?

252
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,650
Come on!

253
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,300
Hey, I quit.

254
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,330
I'll get going then.

255
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,790
Okay, let me walk you out.

256
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,760
Okay.

257
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,160
Hey, your phone.

258
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,420
Bye.

259
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,150
Be careful on your way home.

260
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,420
Okay.

261
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,760
You're already missing me
after one minute?

262
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,720
I'll take a shower and get changed
so that my whole body will smell good.

263
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,220
Okay, bye.

264
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100
You look like a Samoyed dog.

265
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,670
You're more adorable than scary.

266
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,100
Should I pretend to be so scared

267
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,380
that I need someone to do CPR for me?

268
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,390
Nonsense.

269
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,500
Have you called your mom lately?

270
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,870
You've been here for almost a month.

271
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
No, I haven't, Brother Meen.

272
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,870
I've been living alone
since my first year in high school.

273
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,450
You know my mom
doesn't care about me at all.

274
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,320
When my mom came to Chiang Mai for work,

275
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,670
she asked me to live with you.

276
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,390
You still need to call your mom

277
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,890
instead of not telling them anything.

278
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,099
Is that a rule for living here too?

279
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,220
Why are you making it a big deal
and writing it down?

280
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,390
I wrote down everything you said.

281
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,100
Let me see.

282
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,620
No, you can't.

283
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,760
-Let me see.
-No.

284
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,420
-Let me see. Let me see.
-No, you can't.

285
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,190
You're stingy.

286
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,730
I follow all the rules you said.

287
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,820
Brother Meen, you should
be nicer to me from now on.

288
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,270
Okay.

289
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,070
I bought you a layer cake.
Don't forget to eat it.

290
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,990
A layer cake? Will you eat it with me?

291
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,870
What an old-fashioned joke.

292
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,130
Where did you learn that?

293
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,590
Are you dating someone?

294
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,560
Brother Meen, you don't want me
to date anyone?

295
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,960
You look like a naive puppy.

296
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,850
I'm afraid someone will break your heart.

297
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,220
Love makes so many people heartbroken.

298
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,590
What are you doing?

299
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,700
I was hurting myself.

300
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,050
Only in this way can I get true love.

301
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,160
Nonsense.

302
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,500
I mean

303
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,560
come and break my heart when you're free.

304
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,820
I'm busy.

305
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,590
Hey, Brother Meen.
I'm going to Pokpong's bar today.

306
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,160
How will go there?

307
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,070
Don't drive if you get drunk.

308
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,390
Maybe someone will pick me up?

309
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,270
I don't have time.

310
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,360
Go yourself and come back yourself.

311
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,960
Then I'll ask Phetai to give me a ride.

312
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,930
Phetai?

313
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,790
Yes.

314
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,470
But they might drink until morning.

315
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,420
I think I'll spend the night at Phetai's.

316
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,930
Until morning?

317
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,650
Yes. Those engineering students
always drink all night.

318
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,700
I'll go get prepared now.

319
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,590
-Come here.
-Hey.

320
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,850
I quit.

321
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,360
Does Tul have

322
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,420
a secret crush

323
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,930
on Phetai?

324
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,540
[7th Alley, Nimmanhaemin Soi]

325
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,160
Come on, bro.

326
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,670
Wow.

327
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,670
What other team can be the runner-ups 5 times
in a row like the engineering school's?

328
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,960
Cheers.

329
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,250
Cheers.

330
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,560
We're really a top team.

331
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,480
Let's stay on the football team
at least until our senior year.

332
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,100
Hey, I have a question to ask you.

333
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,820
Do you find it weird
if a man likes another man?

334
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,850
What's weird about that?

335
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,300
I like men too.

336
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,130
Huh?

337
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,300
If it is a man like you,

338
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,560
I will like him too.

339
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,190
You're so serious about romantic love.

340
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,280
How can I not fall in love with you?

341
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,250
Well, how is he?

342
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,620
Did he start to open his heart to you?

343
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,990
I'm not sure.

344
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,560
But I did my best.

345
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,900
You're so handsome.
You'll get him eventually.

346
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,160
You're a sweet-talker.

347
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,470
Let's have another drink.

348
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,020
Cheers.

349
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,980
Aren't they the losers
from the engineering school?

350
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,880
And they look like they want to be beaten.

351
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,420
Hey, we're having fun.
Why are you picking a fight with us?

352
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,500
Let's drink our own drinks.
Go back to your table!

353
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,160
Let's avoid trouble. Otherwise,
other customers will be unhappy.

354
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,270
Please.

355
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,220
It's none of your business.
Stay out of it.

356
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,650
Hey, mind your language.

357
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,850
What?

358
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,620
Are you this sissy's boyfriend?

359
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,390
Oh.

360
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,730
This sissy

361
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,560
works here.

362
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,590
Can you earn 300 baht?

363
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,860
Looks like you don't
have money for drink.

364
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,690
I know. You must get your food and drink
by amusing your friends.

365
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,990
What's wrong with being a sissy?

366
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,390
You're so rude.
I'll show you what I've got!

367
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,190
Hey!

368
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,020
Wait, let me handle it.

369
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,050
Get out of my bar.

370
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,250
I'll tell your seniors
not to step into my bar again.

371
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,850
Don't ever talk rudely here again.

372
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,820
Get out of my bar now!

373
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,560
Go!

374
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,270
Are you okay?

375
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,330
Sorry, Sun. Sorry, Pokpong.

376
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,330
It's all my fault.

377
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,070
Tul.

378
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,650
You are my bro.

379
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,500
Your friend is also my bro.

380
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,900
I'm Pokpong.
Of course I have to protect you.

381
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,280
I'm sorry, Pokpong.
I almost caused trouble at your bar.

382
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,850
It's okay.

383
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,740
I would've done the same if I were you.

384
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,020
Have fun. Enjoy drinking.

385
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,910
Cheers. Cheers.

386
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,710
Come on, let's dance and relax.

387
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,080
Go on. Come on.

388
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,140
Let's dance.

389
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,880
Yes, like this.

390
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,500
[Men]

391
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,820
Today I must know
who Tul is dating secretly.

392
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,850
Meen.

393
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,420
Who's Meen?

394
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,940
I'm not Meen.

395
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,340
I'm a cat.

396
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,840
What are you doing here?

397
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,780
Kim said you weren't coming today.

398
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,450
Are you looking for Tul?

399
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,680
Hey.

400
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,600
I'm looking for something to eat.

401
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,250
In the restroom?

402
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,650
It's my business.

403
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,310
I'm exhausted.

404
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,080
Meen, what are you doing here?

405
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,310
Well.

406
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,450
I'm walking Mr. Nirun.

407
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,510
Where's Mr. Nirun?

408
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,480
Here, here.

409
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,710
Where is Mr. Nirun?

410
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,020
Oh, it broke free.

411
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,600
-It broke free.
-Yes, it broke free.

412
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,480
-Mr. Nirun broke free.
-Nirun.

413
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,220
Mr. Nirun.

414
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,940
Mr. Nirun.

415
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,310
Where are you, Mr. Nirun?
You can come out now.

416
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,740
-Mr. Nirun.
-Mr. Nirun.

417
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,200
-Where are you, Mr. Nirun?
-Ouch.

418
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,340
-Mr. Nirun, come out. Please help find it.
-Where is Mr. Nirun?

419
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,850
Go to the men's room. Then you don't
have to wait in line for too long.

420
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,400
No, I'm shy.

421
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,450
If you hold your urine too often,
your boyfriend won't like it.

422
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,450
Stop complaining. You're a devil.

423
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,080
No, there're so many people.

424
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,170
I'll go to the ladies' room, but...

425
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,000
Meen, what are you doing here?

426
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,110
Didn't you say you weren't coming?

427
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,170
Come on.

428
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,020
It's as if you hadn't come together.

429
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,680
I'm leaving.

430
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,000
Hey, Meen.

431
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,650
I just saw your bro
being teased by your enemies.

432
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,250
-But I...
-Where is he now?

433
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,510
At the entrance.

434
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,600
-Hey.
-Hey.

435
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,400
What's going on?

436
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,480
Don't you think it's weird?

437
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,020
Do you have the same feeling?

438
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,510
How about we follow him?

439
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,680
-Do you want to go?
-No, no, no.

440
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,800
I think I smell love.

441
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,800
Did you smell it, Pokpong?

442
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,450
Love.

443
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,510
This is the men's room. Girls, get out.

444
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,800
I'm a man too.

445
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,710
Hey, Cutie.

446
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,310
So cute.

447
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,940
Can I take it home?

448
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,310
No. Put it down.

449
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,710
Put it down. Put it down. Give it to me.

450
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,170
Let it go.

451
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,110
Tul.

452
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,880
Tul.

453
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,510
Tul, wake up.

454
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,770
Wake up!

455
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,800
Wake up!

456
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,540
Wake up!

457
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,620
Hey, what are you doing to my bro?

458
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,740
Hey, Brother Meen.

459
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,510
Don't worry, he's Sun.
We're on the same side.

460
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,110
Really?

461
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,370
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,540
I thought you were our rival.

463
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,540
No.

464
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,050
Did he drink?

465
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,650
He drank a lot.

466
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,420
Something happened.

467
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,170
So he kept drinking.

468
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,910
Tul is allergic to alcohol.

469
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,170
See? He's blushing.

470
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,080
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

471
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,800
So I didn't stop him.

472
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,680
It's okay.

473
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,340
Sun.

474
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,050
Yes.

475
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,880
Phetai.

476
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,400
Yes.

477
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,620
You go back first. I'll take care of him.

478
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,820
Then I'll go.

479
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,340
Be careful on the way, Tul.

480
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,310
Bye, Brother Meen.

481
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,910
I don't want to go back yet.

482
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,220
I'm not drunk yet.

483
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,810
Are you going home alone
or do you want me to drag you home?

484
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,650
Who is this Samoyed dog
ordering me to go home?

485
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,650
I'm not going home.

486
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,510
I'm a Samoyed dog?

487
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,420
Okay.

488
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,600
A disobedient dog should treated this way.

489
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,540
Hey.

490
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,050
Come on.

491
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,310
I'm not going back.

492
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,210
Then I have to do this to you.

493
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,540
You can't everything at will.

494
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,680
I'm not going back.

495
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:27,910
Yes, you are.

496
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,420
No.

497
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,680
Yes.

498
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,340
No.

499
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,020

I've been hailing a car online.

520
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,740
But no one takes my order yet.

521
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,380

It's okay.

523
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,900
Hello, Mom.

524
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,620
I'm out for a part-time job.

525
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,340
I didn't fool around.

526
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,260
Well.

527
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,800
Do you want to talk to my friend at work?

528
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,720
My mom?

529
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Mom, why did you turn on the camera?

530
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,120
He's shy.

531
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,630
Where is he, Sun? Turn on the camera.
I haven't seen him yet.

532
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,690
Hurry up.

533
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,800
Hello.

534
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,000
Hello, kid.

535
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,460
We're about to close the shop.

536
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,720
