In a rush to go somewhere?

27
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,130
You were braver

28
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,630
last night when you kissed me.

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, you bit me first like a dog.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,660
Of course I had to bite back.

31
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,829
No wonder my lips are swollen today.

32
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,329

You won't see me there.

36
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,930
Then why are you here?

37
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,130

Satisfied now?

38
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,960
Hey, let me help you.

Hey, let me do it.

41
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,200
Doesn't it stink?

42
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,130
Tul,

43
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,160
what are you doing?

44
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,860
Covering up the smell of Mr. Nirun's poop.

45
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,930
That's so dramatic.

46
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,400
I can be more dramatic, Meen.

47
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,500
I'm leaving now.

48
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,730
Don't forget to come back
and pick up my heart.

49
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,700
Oh, my.

50
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,700
Are you here to see Meen?

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,260
I'm going home.

52
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,060
I'm on my way home.

53
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,600
Home?

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,200
This is my home.

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,360
Didn't Meen tell you?
My house is next to his.

56
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,960
I know, but...

57
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,590
Isn't this Aunt Cham's house?

58
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,300
Actually,

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,930
I'm her son.

60
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,830
Huh?

61
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,360
That's why I never missed any news
about you and Meen.

62
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,200
But just now I wonder
if I missed something.

63
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,030
You missed plenty of sweet moments.

64
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,260
The BL fans won't survive this sugar rush.

65
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,860
Then you'd better catch these moments.

66
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,460
I'm about to go full "sweet attack."

67
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,760
Hurry up then, I already hit follow.

68
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,400
Hey, Kim.

69
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,300
Wow.

70
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,460
Did I see something wrong?

71
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,730
You actually came back too, Miss Chum?

72
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,860
Show some respect when you call my name.
In Chiang Rai, they call me Madam Chavi.

73
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,830
Hah. Be glad I didn't
call you "Smelly Chum."

74
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,900
Kim, how have you been?

75
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,159
Pretty good, Ne.

76
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,600
I miss you so much. Give me a hug...

77
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,060
Nephew, stand in for your
brother-in-law—let him hug you.

78
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,900
Sure.

79
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,600
I miss you so much, baby.

80
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,159
So?

81
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,630
Did your mom buy you snacks?
I sent her all the money.

82
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,860
Of course he's fine—he eats premium
dog food, better than us humans.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,100
Little one.

84
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:58,900
Cutie pie.

85
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,230
Meen.

86
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,000
How have you been, Miss Chum?

87
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,800
Ever since you married and moved
to Chiang Rai, we hardly see each other.

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,660
I'm fine, Meen.

89
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,130
See? Even the neighbor greets me
warmer than my own brother.

90
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,730
And you, Kim? Why'd you come back?

91
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,100
My mom said if I didn't come back,

92
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,860
she would make a will and leave the house

93
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,060
to this dog.

94
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,200
So here I am.

95
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,000
He's so cute. What's his name?

96
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,860
It's called Crew.

97
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,060
So cute.

98
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,030
Cnew, I'll bring Mr. Nirun
to play with you sometime.

99
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,030
Oh, right,

100
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,800
Ne and Chum,

101
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Tul and that Boredy

102
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,630
really look like a couple with dogs.

103
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,600
Hey, Kim.

104
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,400
Don't be shy. I saw it just now.

105
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Even Mr. Nirun's poop smells sweet.

106
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,600
Wait, you two got married?

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,060
Yeah,

108
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,100
we registered earlier this year.

109
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,400
I actually started chasing him
back in my senior year.

110
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,960
But after graduation, we waited
another five years to tie the knot.

111
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,060
But I really love her.

112
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,530
She's just too cute.

113
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,560
I couldn't help falling for her.

114
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,430
So what's your secret
to winning her heart?

115
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,330
Maybe I can use it too.

116
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,260
Well...

117
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,130
Many people say having a kid

118
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,200
keeps you close.

119
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,659
So I got us a dog.

120
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,730
That way, she'll always
come back home for her baby.

121
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,100
Honestly, you two are adorable.

122
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,030
Take my advice—
once you graduate, don't wait.

123
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,160
Save a bit, get married, have kids.
Don't put it off.

124
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,530
Well...

125
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,530
Meen, this one's a rare treasure.

126
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,690
Don't let him slip away.

127
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,860
Hey, take a photo with Crew.
Come on, I'll take it for you.

128
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,560
Come on, let's take a photo together.
Come here, everyone.

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,030

164
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,660
So, how's your
"Moon of the School" prep going?

165
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,030
Not bad.

166
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,790
I've been focusing on my talent showcase.

167
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,430
No, Tul.

168
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,360

Give me a tough one.

183
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,690
If you win "Moon of the School,"
what's the first thing you'll do?

184
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,230
Mm.

185
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,490
It's simple.
First, clear answer.

186
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,160
I'd promote a rural
volunteer camp project.

187
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,060
Second, clear explanation.

188
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,460
To help patients in remote areas.

189
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,090
Third, highlight strengths.

190
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:38,630
I've joined such camps before
and want to keep supporting them.

191
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,190
See?

192
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,230
Simple, right?

193
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,460
Wow, you're amazing.

194
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,730
Told you. Our school was wrong
and and didn't send me that year.

195
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,630
Otherwise, I would've been famous by now.

196
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,990
Now, it's my turn to ask you.

197
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,760
I'll take this one.

198
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,090
Facing the flood in Chiang Mai,

199
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,060
as a representative of
the school hunk competition,

200
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,630
how would you help?

201
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,830
Oh, that's tough.

202
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,160
Take your time.

203
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,860
First, clear answer.

204
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,930
I'd rescue cats and dogs
swept away by the floods.

205
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:33,790
Mm.

206
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,190
Second, explain clearly.

207
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,560
Because cats and dogs have families too.

208
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,760
Mm.

209

Third, highlight strengths.

210
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,990
I have a dog myself,

211
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,990
so I want them reunited with theirs.

212
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,160
Perfect. Great answer.

213
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,630
It's so touching. I'm going to cry.

214
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,260
Don't cry, genius.

215
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,390
I haven't told you yet, right?

216
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,690
Mr. Nirun was also a flood rescue.

217
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,190
But we haven't found its owner yet.

218
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,190
Mm.

219
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,790
But I think Mr. Nirun's really lucky

220
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,090
to have you as his master.
He's so happy with you.

221
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,660
I once read an article, it said

222
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,060
if we take good care of our pets,

223
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,390
they won't be reincarnated after they die.

224
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
So I'm willing to spend money on him.

225
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,990
That's beautiful.
Mr. Nirun must be so happy.

226
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,090
Give me a hug.

227
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,790
Good boy, Mr. Nirun.

228
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,090
So this is the machine.
No wonder Mr. Nirun's fur never tangles.

229
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,860
It even has a brush
to clean the fur on clothes.

230
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,760
Mm.

231
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,020

all ready for tomorrow's contest.

the puppy in your heart, please?

242

Yeah.

This won't affect the contest, right?

250
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,490
But for us,
this will affect the contest.

The social media spread so fast.

272

One scroll through the tags and I saw it.

Do you feel uncomfortable?

So please stop saying those things
and stop leaving scars on people.

363
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,700
If you expect others to be noble,

364
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,700
maybe start by changing
yourselves to be better now.

365
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,820
Got it. The world's changed.

366
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,060
-We won't do that again.
-Okay.

367
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,340
Got it.

368
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,740
Then I'll be going.
See you, Chang, Phueak.

369
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,140
-Okay.
-Thank you.

370
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,940
See you, Tul.

371
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,700
We shouldn't have
done this from the start.

372
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,340
You instigated me to do it.

373
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,980
Did we put too much pressure on him?

374
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,140
Yeah.

375
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,540
How could we know? We just wanted to win.

376
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,540
Yeah.

377
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,740
And still… runner-up.

378
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,980
Guess our hopes were too high.

379
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,220
-Runner-up it is.
-Mm.

380
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,740
Pokpong, where are you taking me?

381
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,980
Come with me.

382
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,740
I have to go to the airport now.

383
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,740
Before we part...

384
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,340
can we talk?

385
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,060
I miss you so much.

386
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,140
Hey, did you just take Hawywan for a bath?

387
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,340
Yes.

388
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,460
I'm leaving here soon, Hawywan.

389
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,020
If anyone bullies you,

390
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,820
just run, okay?

391
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,820
You could take Hawywan
to Bangkok with you.

392
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,620
What do you mean?

393
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,860
I mean...

394
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,660
I'm opening a second branch
of Pokpong Bar in Bangkok.

395
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,940
Will you help take care of Hawywan in Bangkok?

396
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,700
Okay.

397
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,340
But...

398
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,740
as my boyfriend.

399
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,740
You...

400
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,740
What do you mean?

401
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,300
When my mother passed,

402
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,780
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

403
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,700
And now, seeing you leave,

404
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,000
I don't want to wait anymore, Sun.

405
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,020
If you think the same way,

406
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,780
be my boyfriend.

407
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,340
Well...

408
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,220
If you're not ready, just tell me.

409
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,740
I'll quit on my own.

410
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,740
All this time,

411
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,340
I've been waiting for love to come to me.

412
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,260

413
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,179
Okay.

415
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,620
Uh… okay.

484
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,710
Doctor, I read in an article:

485
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,430
If your heart races,

486
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,910
a kiss from someone you love will fix it.

00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,230
There you go again.

488
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:51,310
But this doctor here thinks
the article's credibility is very low.

489
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,650
