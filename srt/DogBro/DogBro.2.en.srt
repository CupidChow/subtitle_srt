00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,190
I forgot this morning.

183
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,560
Samoyeds have double coats.
I'm afraid it might get heatstroke.

184
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,260
I'm still in class, can't get back.

185
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,070
I already filled it this morning.

186
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,210
Thank you so much. Bye.

187
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,270
Hey, Meen. Don't hang up yet.

188
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,360
Do you like watching football?

189
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,390
Why do you ask?

190
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,530
Last time I watched…
must've been years ago.

191
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,190
What's the matter?

192
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,640
Nothing.

193
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,760
Get back to class, Meen.

194
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,190
How did it go?

195
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,290
He said he had filled it. It's fine.

196
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,270
Good.

197
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,210
Aren't you eating?

198
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,410
It'll be too late if you don't hurry.

199
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,140
Oh, my water is spilling.

200
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,030
You're such a mess while eating.

201
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,210
It's all your fault.

202
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,600
Hey, seniors.

203
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,060
I'm in for the football game.

204
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,460
Seriously?

205
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,930
We're gonna win for sure!

206
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,030
Thank you.

207
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,370
What are you doing here?

208
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,080
Well…

209
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,870
Tul's actually pretty handsome.

210

212

213
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,310
and small face.

214
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,260
Everything's well-proportioned.

215
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,000
Meen, you're back.

216
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,630
Yeah.

217

The mosquitoes will eat you alive.

218
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,540
I can't get in.

219
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,800
Why didn't you call?

220
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,830
I saw you had a full schedule today,

221
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,920
so I didn't want to bother you.

222
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,970
Here.

223
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,520
Next time, just send me a message.

224
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,320
[Meen: Thanks for today.]

225
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,080
For filling Mr. Nirun's water?

226
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,460
That too.

227
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,400
And…

228
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,170
for turning on the light for him.

229
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,210
Want to know

230
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,980
why I named him Mr. Nirun?

231
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,230
When I was little,
my mom left me in Chiang Mai.

232
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,370
I felt so lonely.

233
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,170
Never thought I could fit in anywhere—

234
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,630
that's how I got the nickname Boredy.

235
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,970
But ever since I met Mr. Nirun,

236
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,460
every time I came home,

237
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,080
whether I was happy, sad,

238
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,280
or upset,

239
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,540
Mr. Nirun was always there for me.

240
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,430
That's why I look forward
to coming home every day.

241
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,170
I really envy that dog.

242
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,470
What did you say?

243
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,940
Nothing.

244
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,740
Come on, let's go.

245
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,310
Mosquitoes can bite me,

246
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,860
but I won't let them bite you.

247
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,710
Let's go.

248
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,130
Hey, it's you.

249
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,060
Finally found you.

250
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,940
I've got a video of you
almost hitting it yesterday.

251
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,860
I'm posting it online—

252
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,060
and sending it to Num KanChai's show.

253
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,600
You're done for.

254
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,540
Hey, what are you doing?

255
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,510
Did you see my back seat?

256
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,140
My employee got burned by hot water badly.

257
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,140
I had to rush him to the hospital.

258
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,570
And for the record, I didn't hit anyone.

259
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,700
So you're saying
you won't take responsibility?

260
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,460
Come here.

261
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,370
Hey. Let go of me.

262
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,510
You want me to take responsibility?

263
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,630
Come here.

264
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,770
I'm not going! Let me go!

265
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,110
I'm not going!

tomorrow? I'll make it for you. -Read]

267
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,460
Don't scratch. It'll leave a scar.

268
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,860
Okay.

269
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,140
You haven't had this before, right?

270
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,370
Feeling better?

271
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,340
Keep it like this for now.
I'll get some ointment for you later.

272
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,880

273
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,400
Probability and statistics.

274
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,340
Perfect timing.

275
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,030

276
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,660
can you help me with this one?

277
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,570
This one?

278
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,510
X-bar...

279
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,310
is to add them all up
and divide by the total—

280
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,770
basically the average, right?

281
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,110
Uh… then what about…

282
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,140
this one?

283
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,660
How do you solve it?

284
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,140
Tul.

285
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,460
Don't mess with chemicals on the skin.

286
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,660
By the way, Meen,

287
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,400
a senior invited me
to join the freshman sports games today.

288
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,530
That's great.

289
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,680
Get involved more so you won't be bored.

290
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,770
But… I'm worried
no one will take care of Mr. Nirun.

291
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,460
If I make it to the finals,
will you come watch me play?

292
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,460

you're already on the team.

296

Oh.

297

Don't worry.

298
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,190

301
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,760
Hey, Meen.

302
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,090
Don't scratch,

303
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,010
or it'll leave a scar.

304
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,280

305
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,480

Yes.

Your skin is so white.

310
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,810
Does it leave scars easily?

Yes.

00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,490
I'll hire someone
to get the place fumigated.

Please let me talk, okay?

00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,880

338
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,580
You almost hit it.

339
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,090
Shouldn't the price be higher?

340
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,690
You mean compensation?

341
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,710
Yeah, that.

342
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,440

343
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,760

you won't come back and hurt it?

345
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,480
Hawaman is...

See?

It doesn't look like a stray dog,

348
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,910

00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,880
Whether it's a man or a woman,

368
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,750
it will make you feel good.

369
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,550
I really want to know who's
the handsome guy in your eyes.

370
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,430
Mind your own business.

371
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,530
Nope.

372
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,500
What?

373
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,930
I was born nosy,
and I must know everything I want to know.

374
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,850
This is my basic right.

375
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,850
So,

376
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,100
I'm asking.

377
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,350
Let me see.

378
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,360
Fine, do what you want.

379
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,050
What time's your last class?

380
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,410
I wanna go somewhere.

381
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,580
Come with me.

382
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,800
Where are you guys going?

383
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,180
Mr. Min has extra classes until six p.m.

384
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:24,960
Six?

385
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,950
So close to winning.

386
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,000
What a pity.

387
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,060
At least our engineering team
got five straight second places.

388
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,060
Let's celebrate some time.

389
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,450
But today you seemed distracted.

390
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,880
What's on your mind?

391
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,750
You can tell?

392
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,630
Like you've been thinking about someone.

393
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,830
Waiting for someone?

394
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,310
Your boyfriend?

395
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,330
No.

396
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,830
It's my brother.

397
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,680
Brother or lover?

398
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,750
It's not like that.

399
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,900
I looked up to him back in Bangkok.

400
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,580
Tell me when you're ready.

401
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,100
By the way,

402
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,700
I saw your dog photos on IG.

403
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,260
I want to play with it sometime.

404
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,430
Oh, Mr. Nirun, right?

405
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,330
Sure.

406
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,900
You can come over to my place to study

407
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
and play with him.

408
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:40,650
Okay.

409
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,400
Hey, Chokun.

410
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,930
Doesn't the champion smell good to you?

411
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,060
Honestly, not really.

412
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,630
The trainees sucked.

413
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,850
Indeed.

414
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,080
They played so badly,
of course they'd lose.

415
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,540
Who's playing badly here?

416
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,430
You guys?

417
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,780
We followed the rules.

418
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,680
You're so mean.

419
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,180
Hey, watch your mouth.

420
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,450
You played dirty by tackling my feet.

421
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,200
If you want to win,

422
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,150
play fair.

423
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,050
You're the dirty ones.

424
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,310
Your engineering guys

425
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,460
smell like engine oil.

426
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,600
Hey, mechanic, come help me pump my tires.

427
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,000
You're the one stinking.

428
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,580
You reek of cheaters.

429
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,930
Cheaters.

430
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,490
That jerk's got a sharp tongue.

431
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,110
What?

432
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,680
Want to pick a fight?

433
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,600
Hey, what are you doing to my friend?

434
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,460
Stay out of it.

435
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,430
Who threw it?

436
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,410
Sir, there's a fight!

437
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,930
Sir, they're fighting!

438
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,430
Sir!

439
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,380
Sir!

440
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,560
Sir, they're fighting!

Sir, there's a fight!

442
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,760
-Sir, they're fighting!
-Wait and see, you bastard.

443
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,260
You came here to compete, not to fight.

444
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,680
Just wait for your revenge.

445
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,910
Maniac.

446
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:37,960
Meen.

447
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,280
This is Phetai, my friend,

448
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,020
from the same department.

449
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,960
Hi, Meen.

450
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,130
Tul's told me about you.

451
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,190
I'm going home now.

452
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,460
I'll get going too.

453
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,260
You two talk it out.

00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,460
Meen, um...

455
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,380
Meen.

456
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,030
Meen.

457
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,280
Meen.

458
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,960
Why are you ignoring me?

459
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,400
Although I had broken my leg,

460
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,650
I still joined the game for you.

461
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,910
Even if I couldn't play as well,

462
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,560
I gave it my all.

463
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,480
Uh...

How dare you play with steel pins in?

466

Hey, Meen, it hurts.

467
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,210
Your nerves are fine, though.

468
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,950
Thought you couldn't feel pain.

469

Whether I let you stay or not

470
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,540
has nothing to do with winning or losing.

471
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,630
I just don't want
to see you hurt yourself.

472
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,830
Meen, are you worried about me?

473
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,550
Stop joking.

474
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,850
I'm serious.

475

Me too.

476

If Mom finds out, she'll scold me again.

477
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,970
Sorry,

478
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,960
I couldn't make it to your game today.

479
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,860
Be more careful next time.

480
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,900
Meen, wait for me!

481
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,270
You've been getting hurt

482
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,750
ever since you were little,

483
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,270
and I had to deal with it.

484
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,850
You still remember?

485
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,700
Of course.

486
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,370
You were always the naughty one,

487
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,220
always getting hurt,

488
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,300
too scared to tell your mom,

489
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,070
so you'd come to me and my mom for help.

490
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,460
When you broke your leg,

491
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,920
I helped fix it. Remember?

492
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,770
Any other injuries?

493
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,850
Hey, what are you doing?

494
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,270
Didn't you ask me where I was injured?

495
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,350
Oh, okay.

496
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,350
Whoa.

497
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,050
I'll disinfect the wound first.

498
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,000
Well...

499
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,230
Are you still allergic?

500
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,100
This is

501
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,800
Chlorhexidine.

502
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,150
Does it hurt?

503
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,820
I'll finish quickly.

504
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,250
It's done.

505
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,400
Don't cause trouble again.

506
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,070
By the way,

507
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,870
here's the house key.

508
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,380

00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,720
Well...

510
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,070
If I can't get in without the key,

511
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,420
you can go home every day.

512
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,770
Then why did you wait at the door?

513
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,910
Do you have a fever?

514
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:53,750
Yes.

515
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,070
Maybe being in the sun too much
and staying up late.

516
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,960
Probably catching a cold.

517
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,900
Then sleep on the couch today,
so you don't spread it.

518
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,180
I'll sleep at Chatterbox's dorm.

519
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,700
I have an early class tomorrow.

520
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,050
Put me to sleep first,

521
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,350
in case something happens to me.

522
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,320

Are you ordering me to go back?

526

I'm not going back!

527
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,340
Go back with me.

528
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,270
Don't.

529
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,620
I smell love in the air.

530
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,430
Pokpong, can you smell it?

531
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,940
The smell of love.

532
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,070
Kiss kiss.

533
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,440
