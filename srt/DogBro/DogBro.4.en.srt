You are staying at someone else’s place,
so just learn to adapt yourself.

Gosh!

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,900
Every time I come home,

00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,660
whether I am happy or sad,

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,060
or when something is bothering me,

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,160
Mr. Nirun is always by my side.

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,900
Stay with me first.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,060
If something happens to me,

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,330
you could save me in time.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,530
Later I will hire someone to spray
mosquito repellent all over the house.

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,460
I do not want them to bite you.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,260
I want to ask,

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,600
if we have a crush on someone,

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,130
do you think we should tell him?

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,560
Tell him.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,800
With your looks,
who would dare reject you?

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,789
I am going to make a key copy.

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,230
So... I let it guard the key,

24
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,060
in case someone comes home late.

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,060
Then he will know Mr. Nirun

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,260
and this little heart

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,860
are waiting at home.

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,160
Stop.

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,430
Hey, are you looking for trouble?
Why are you blocking my car?

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,860
How did you drive your car?

31
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,600
You almost hit it, did you not see?

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,259
Move, I'm in a hurry.

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,700
Is it in such a hurry?

34
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,160
What if it was your mom who got hit?

35
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,660
My mom wouldn't jump out
to block a car like you.

36
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,759
It doesn't look like a stray dog,
so I checked the CCTV.

37
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,320
I saw its previous owner abandon it here.

38
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,460
So I took it in.

39
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:59,259
If you do not believe me,
I will send you pictures later.

40
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,590
I'll friend you on Line.

41
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,960
That sissy.

42
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,500
Is he an employee here?

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,259
Does he even make three hundred?

44
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,660
I know. You must be lying on
your friends to feed yourself.

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,160
If there are still people like you,
who can never say anything good,

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,000
then get out of my shop.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,530
You're my cousin.

48
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,329
So I'll take your friends as my cousin.

49
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,829
I'm Pokpong. Of course I'll protect you.
[Note: Pokpong means “protect” in Thai]

50

You know what?

51
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,230
Every time I see you,

52
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,360
I think of someone.

53
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,930
Who?

54
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,730
My mom.

55
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,200
She loves to help others

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,820
and cannot stand seeing anyone bullied.

57

Sorry for always being mad at you.]

58

-Cheers.

Yes, very good.

Thank you, Seniors.

67
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,300
You've been living together for 2 months.
Has there been any substantive progress?

68
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,829
Any substantive progress?

69
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,700
No.

I can tell from your face
that you're upset.

99
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,700
Maybe it is because of the alcohol.
Don't worry.

Go back and have fun.

101
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,130
You're blushing after a few drinks.

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,030

Hey.

105
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,060
Don't touch my head.

106
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,330
People say when "a little puppy" is upset,

107
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,200
patting his head makes it feel better.

108
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,000
But my head

109
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,760
can only be touched by my boyfriend.

110
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,200
I really want to see what he looks like.

111
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,130
But it's hard enough
to make people like you

112
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,300
fall in love with someone.

113
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,200
You know me better than I do.

114
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,260
Well...

115
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,100
Well, Flint.

116
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,160
Huh?

117
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,300
Have you ever liked anyone?

118
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,800
Why do you ask?

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,900
Or... have you fallen in love with?

120
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,430
Well...

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,530
I don't know.

122
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,700
But every time I get close to him,

123
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,900
my heart beats fast.

124
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,260
When my friends make fun of me and him,

125
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,260
I feel happier than embarrassed.

126
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,800
Do you already feel that way?

127
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,030
I'm not sure.

128
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,760
You're the first person I told.

129
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,060
Because you are the only one in our group
who will not laugh at me.

130
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,860
That's why I'm telling you, bro.

131
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,460
I had that feeling too.

132
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,530
That is really what it feels like
to like someone.

133
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,900
Hey.

134
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,360
Don't do this.

135
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,400
I still want to be friends with you.

136
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,800
But I don't want to
just be friends with you.

137
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,530
I know you have a crush on me.

138
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,929
But I already have someone I like.

139
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,460
Don’t be like this.
I really only see you as a friend.

140
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,830
You knew

141
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,400
that I liked you?

142
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,730
I just found out.

143
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,330
I...That’s why
I wanted to tell you directly.

144
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,400
You know what?

145
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,300
I'm so embarrassed.

146
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,620
Knowing you always understood my feelings.

147
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,130
And I still treated you this way.

148
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,230
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,900
Hey, Flint, it's fine.

150
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,600
Don't think too much.

151
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,060
I don't mind.

152
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,130
Pay with my card, bro.

153
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,400
Flint.

154
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,930
Flint.

155
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,600
Come back and explain.

156
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,660
I don't know.

157
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,200
Hey, keep drinking.

158
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,560
Any more?

159
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,360
Baikhao. Just ask him.
Don't you want to know?

160
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,100
-It's me again.
-It's you.

161
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,300
Come on, I’ll ask.

162
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,030
You've been living with Boredy
for two months.

163
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,760
What do you feel about him?

164
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,930
Chatterbox, you're too straightforward.

165
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,100
Do you like Brother Meen, Tul?

166
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,060
Yes.

167
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,930
I... like Brother Meen.

168
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,000
That kind of love...

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,330
That goes beyond just cousins.

170
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,230
BL fan loves that.
I can have a good dream tonight.

171
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,130
An engineer and a doctor,
plus a little puppy.

172
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,660
And mean friends...

173
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,330
Even though it may look
a little strange in the end, but...

174
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,060
It's okay, right?

175
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,900
It's okay.
This could be a bestselling BL plot.

176
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,030
We'll help you.

177
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,630
Boredy doesn't know love.

178
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,930
He was tricked into being a boyfriend
by a girl called Milk last year.

179
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:03,860
Milk?

180
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,540
Chatterbox, didn’t we swear

181
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,340
never to mention
that annoying girl’s name again?

182
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,500
Hi, hi, doctors.

183
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,360
I knew you’d be at this bar.

184
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,130
Hi sis, is this seat taken?

185
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,330
Now it is.

186
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,600

-Kim.
-Yes.

200

and women’s clothes is out of fashion.

201

205

233
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,100
Not even a call.

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,060

236
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,160
The color is so pretty. What is this?

237
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,960
A new cocktail.

238
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,100
What is it called?

239
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,500
Sunshine Moning.

240
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,630
Why did you suddenly make a new drink
after the bar closed?

241
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,100
Normally

242
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,100
I only come up with new cocktails
when I’m inspired.

243
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,030
What... about the soju behind the bar?

244
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,060
Try it.

245
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,220
I'll drink it then.

246
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,400
So where did the inspiration
for this one come from?

247
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,230
Sun kiss.

248
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,700
The idea came from

249
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,200
when my mom passed away
from cancer last year.

250
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,960
I missed her smile
and her cheerful personality.

251
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,530
So this cocktail was born.

252
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm sorry about your mom.

253
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,660
Oh, it's okay.

254
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,530
Hearing that makes me sad.

255
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,300
But after drinking this, I feel better.

256
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,520
I’ve had a lot on my mind lately,
but this just makes me forget all of it.

00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,260
Mr. Nirun.

365
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,030
Mr. Nirun, where have you been?

366
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,160
Huh?

367
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,960
I missed you so much. I was going crazy.

368
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,100
Tul, I’m sorry.

369
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Flint.

370
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,500
I saw Tul’s friend
Phetai’s post about the lost dog.

371
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,730
So I had my workers stop everything
to help search.

372
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,460
I'm leaving.

373
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,960
Wait.

374
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,660
Flint, you are my best friend.

375
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,060

376
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,030
Mr. Nirun!

377
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,900
Are you okay, Mr. Nirun?

378
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,800
Beo, where did you find it?

379
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,500
About two kilometers from here.

380
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,900

381
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,600

So you’re the one
who found Mr. Nirun, huh?

420
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,100
Didn’t have your workers help?

Hey, Sun.

434
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,100

442
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,930
I came to pack up my stuff.

443
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,860

00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,660
I have something to tell you.

445
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,000

446
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,660
I want to quit.

447
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,560
Why?

448
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,530
It's not because of that day, right?

449
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,530
Well...

450
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:21,060
My family wants me to transfer to Bangkok.

451
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,160
So far?

452
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,560

How’s Mr. Forever?

460
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,660
He’s safe.

461
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,700
That’s good. Having a dog
is like a burden.

462
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,160
Don't think too much.

463
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,230
I bought you Americano fried rice.

464
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,930
I remembered you like this.

465
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,430
Have some. I'll feed you.

466
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,900
Milk.

467
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,530
I'll be frank.

468
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,600
I don't like you anymore.

469
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,730
But I still like you.

470
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,130
We broke up a year ago.

471
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,430
As long as you don't have someone new,
I still have the right.

472
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,130
Have some.

473
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,100
Okay?

474
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,960
Please.

475
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,960
Have some.

00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,030

Ah!

480
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,660
Stop! And listen to me.

481
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,060
Meen doesn’t want milk anymore.

482
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,300
Because he wants
Northern Thai sausage now.

483
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,500
That's right.
Stop pestering him, Milk.

484
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,260
Hey! Don't bother me anymore, okay?

485
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,020
I'm going to find Meen.

486
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,030
Stop!

487
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,430
How dare you ask others to use eye cream?

488
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,160
You’re shamelessly chasing after a guy.
Aren’t you embarrassed?

489
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,500
I’ll just tell you.

490
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,000
Boredy asked me to take him home yesterday

491
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,460
because he didn't want to be with you.

492
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,260
He was worried that
Tul would feel uncomfortable.

493
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,830
And I know
you don't study here.

494
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,900

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,630
