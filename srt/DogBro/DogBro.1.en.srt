Pheemwasu.

376
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,080
You can't do it. You can't do it.
[Note: Bus for Thailand] Pop group Beach of You I shine.

377
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,000
BUS is 12.

378
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,680
B-U-S

379
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
BUS is 12.

380
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,400
Yo.

381
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,000
Can I?
Okay.

382
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,320
If you can remember the textbook like this...
Your academic level will definitely rise.

383
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,680
Hey, naggy. This is my happiness.

384
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,360
Did I step on your head?

385
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,640
You don't have time to study medicine.

386
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,800
You have to do TPOP and watch a rotten drama.

387
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,040
This is called softness, you know?

388
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,800
You have to promote TPOP and a rotten drama.

389
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,240
Right?

390
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,760
Yes.

391
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,840
Yes
Right

392
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,980
What food do you have?

393
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,900
Hello.

394
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,640
This is my brother.

395
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,060
Set me up
Hello, Tul.

396
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,640
Can you introduce me?

397
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,040
Yourself
Yourself

398
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,520
That's what I mean.

399
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,040
Ah hello everyone

400
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,800
Hello.

401
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,980
My name is Tul, a freshman of engineering school. Ha

402
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,360
Wow, you speak Thai dialect.

403
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,840
I'm from Thailand. I'll give you full marks.

404
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,000
Didn't you say you'd give him a hard time?

405
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,720
You are obviously welcoming him.

406
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,120
Look how cute he is.

407
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,320
Enough. Go back to your seat.

408
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,920
Tul, sit here.

409
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,740
OK.

410
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,800
Sit here

411
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,880
Do you want a cup

412
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,200
What should we eat It looks delicious

413
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,920
Later...

414
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,080
Hello siblings

415
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,400
Hello.

416
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,080
Hello

417
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,760
Whoosh

418
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,080
I heard there's a freshman here.

419
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,880
I have a new version of a new recipe.
so you can have a taste before the opening.

420
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,680
Wow.

421
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,880
It looks delicious
Try it

422
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,160
Uh.

423
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,560
Poking made it

424
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,880
I...

425
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,560
Do you usually drink

426
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,600
I don't drink

427
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,000
Ah

428
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,600
Enough.

429
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,400
Tul is allergic to alcohol.

430
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,080
I’ll drink this.

431
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,840
If anything happens to you, your mom will kill me.

432
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,480
You know I'm allergic to alcohol.

433
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,440
I just talked to your mom.

434
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,360
Everyone has a cup, right?

435
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,960
Yes
Yes. Yes.

436
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,800
Drink it.

437
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,640
Okay.
Okay.

438
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,760
Cheers.
Cheers.

439
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,640
This new recipe smells good.
Poking.

440
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,360
What did you put?
It's good

441
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,960
My water of vitality.

442
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,760
Keep it for yourself, Poking.

443
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,840
Just kidding.

444
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,440
Hey.
I can drink.

445
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
I almost fainted.
I thought it was true.

446
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,240
It smells just now.

447
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,160
But you're amazing, Poking.

448
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,440
Your mom's medicine hotel is going viral
You're awesome

449
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,840
To be honest, Brother Poong,

450
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,280
Actually the business is getting busy

451
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,600
Aren't you going to get help?

452
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Actually, a employee quit yesterday.
I'm looking for a new one.

453
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,800
Hey, Poking.

454
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,880
A friend of mine is looking for a part-time job.

455
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Do you want me to recommend you?

456
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,440
That's great.

457
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,760
I'll give you my number.
Can he add it?

458
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,480
Sure.

459
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,600
Not you.

460
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,000
Okay.

461
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,640
Thank you so much.

462
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,560
Tul, let me introduce my friends to you.

463
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,560
This is "complaining brother".
My nickname is "The coolest King of Boring".

464
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,280
He's been my best friend since freshman year.

465
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,000
What are you doing?

466
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,440
What?

467
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,520
Crazy.

468
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,840
This is Baikhao.

469
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,320
Among us,
She's the only girl with a label on her.

470
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,360
Her dream is to become an orthopedic doctor.

471
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,920
Without her,
our class will be over.

472
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,480
This is Kim.

473
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,800
She's the cheerful one among us.

474
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,080
She's a national celebrity.

475
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,880
She has a webpage for the review of a rotten drama.

476
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,440
What is it called?

477
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,880
Debate before falling into the trap.

478
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,480
Did you follow this move?

479
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,640
I ordered it twice.
Great.

480
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,800
I ordered four times.

481
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,840
You ordered a pause.
Oh

482
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,600
I know you have a new store.

483
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,400
It took you so long.

484
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,520
This is the big shot of Flight Medical School.

485
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,960
He's a rich and handsome man.

486
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,200
If we're not friends
It's impossible to see him.

487
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,200
Who is this?

488
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,440
Brother Tul, the boring ghost's brother.

489
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,720
I just moved to a boring ghost's house.

490
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,080
Hello, I'm...
Then let's eat.

491
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,960
I'm late. It's on me tonight.

492
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,160
Great.

493
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,160
No, no. You're buying again.
You treat us often.

494
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,280
I can treat you.

495
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,320
No need. AA.

496
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,520
We're even.

497
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,520
[Dogs lie on the top of the mountain and stay alone in the golden name]

498
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,480
Oh.

499
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,440
Am I drunk

500
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,920
No, I'm not.

501
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,560
Alcohol is just temporarily suppressed.
It's just the function of your brain.

502
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,840
It hurts.
You just think it's different.

503
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,640
Stop complaining.

504
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,960
I'm afraid I'll get drunk.
Don't people know you're medical students?

505
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,240
Just follow the plot.

506
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,000
One is drunk and the other is not drunk.

507
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,800
Wow
Right.

508
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,880
What do you mean?

509
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,600
Awesome
Stop gossiping

510
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,520
Hey.

511
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,320
What?

512
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,360
What time is it

513
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,000
It's 11:30.

514
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,720
Drama.
Drama.

515
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,600
What should I do? Go back.
Go back.

516
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,760
Go back.
Please take care of my friend.

517
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,640
Okay.

518
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,920
Okay.
Thank you. Let's go.

519
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,000
Anything else?
That's all.

520
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,120
No, I'm leaving.
Bye.

521
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,280
Bye.
The rotten drama is coming.

522
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,240
Bye.

523
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Where are you in a hurry
Bye

524
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh.

525
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Is this your first time here I haven't seen you before

526
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,680
Yes, it's my first time.

527
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,000
You can come to me. I'll sit over there.

528
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,320
I come here often.

529
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,880
Okay, thank you.

530
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,360
Wow, Tul.
You're so popular on your first visit.

531
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,640
You can come to me.

532
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,200
I'll sit over there.

533
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,600
Do you want to go home first?

534
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,080
I'll ask the driver to take you home.

535
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm fine. I'm not drunk.

536
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,360
You have to order until your bank card is out.

537
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,760
You don't have to buy us anymore.

538
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,840
But my card is not limited.

539
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
What should I do?

540
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,560
Whoosh

541
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,480
Poking
I'm going to buy the whole store.

542
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,440
I'll pay with Flight's card.

543
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,240
Wrap it all up.

544
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,720
Let me tell you.

545
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,720
No matter it's this shop,
or I can afford the whole Ningman Road.

546
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,719
You're the only one I can't buy.

547
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,560
That's a foul.

548
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,960
I'm not satisfied.

549
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
