1
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,593
Help!

2
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:12,705
Help me, please!

3
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:27,819
Arthur! Arthur!

4
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:36,715
Come here!

5
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:40,219
I got accepted for the scholarship!

6
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,697
- Really?
- Look!

7
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:45,034
Wow!

8
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:47,649
I'll be able to study in Manila!

9
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:25,931
Are you really not going
to change your mind?

10
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:34,773
Hardly anything has changed
here since we were kids, right?

11
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:43,250
I thought it's fine?

12
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:50,828
I'm sorry. Manila is just so far away.

13
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,920
Four years is just a short amount of time.

14
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:01,069
And I will come home
during vacations, anyway.

15
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:35,609
But I already got the scholarship!

16
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:42,149
What about food there? It's tough
enought to find a decent meal in here.

17
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:46,914
Then I'll work to
support my education!

18
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:50,994
Manila can be dangerous...

19
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:53,427
something might happen to you there.

20
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,167
Will we remain like this forever?

21
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,756
Okay then, Lena, answer me...

22
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:08,762
Who here on this island went
to Manila and had a better life?

23
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,765
Or who among us returned?

24
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,483
Huh? Answer me!

25
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:14,707
It's me!

26
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:18,316
I'll make sure to give you a good life!

27
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:20,301
Stop forcing it. That's enough.
No more of this.

28
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,807
Put your clothes back in the closet,

29
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,671
come down here,
and help me dry the fish.

30
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,155
Come on, let's do this.

31
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:28,797
Let's go.

32
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:38,976
Lena!

33
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:41,486
Lena!

34
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:42,605
Lena!

35
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:45,691
What's happening?

36
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:49,428
If you won't support my education,
I'll put myself through school!

37
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:51,307
Just let me get out of this place!

38
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:54,568
Listen to your mother, dear.

39
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,571
Not you, too, Dad!

40
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:03,489
Weren't you the one who taught me
how to dream when I was a kid?

41
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:07,565
It's different now,
things have changed!

42
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:11,892
Dear, just accept that some dreams
never come true! Right?

43
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:15,429
If only I knew you'd
grow up to be so stubborn,

44
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,040
I would've suffocated you
when you were a baby!

45
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,200
I wish you did!

46
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:20,789
- Maring, enough!
- I'd have preferred that!

47
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:24,282
- Lena!
- If you're happy with this life, I'm not!

48
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,859
You ungrateful, disobedient child!
You're worthless!

49
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:29,901
Maring, enough!

50
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,805
You ingrate! All you have,
you owe it to us!

51
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,540
You're a worthless child!

52
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:38,776
- Maring, stop it!
- You have a lot of nerve to go against us?

53
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:41,969
You want to go to Manila?
Fine, then leave!

54
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:44,757
But you will not
bring anything with you!

55
00:08:44,782 --> 00:08:47,284
Everything you have,
we gave to you!

56
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:49,967
So, go ahead, strip!

57
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:52,537
- You bitch, take off your clothes!
- Maring, that's enough!

58
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:55,680
I told you, strip!

59
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:58,235
Strip! Strip!

60
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,016
Aren't you ashamed
in front of the neighbors?

61
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,876
No! Because your daughter
is shameless!

62
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,610
Lena, that's enough, she's your child!

63
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,977
You're humiliating her!

64
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:11,068
I raised you, I gave birth to you!

65
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:15,672
I could also kill you!
Do you understand? Huh?

66
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:18,422
- You ingrate!
- Stop it!

67
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:20,313
- Stop it, please.
- You animal!

68
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:21,370
Maring, that's enough!

69
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,562
This is embarrassing!

70
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,273
She deserves it!

71
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:25,571
What the hell are you doing?

72
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:26,863
Let go of me!

73
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:27,972
Maring, stop!

74
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:31,250
Enough of this. Please.

75
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,411
Go ahead!

76
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,639
Just remember,
you're no longer my child!

77
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,249
- Damn you!
- Stop it, please.

78
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:43,662
Maring, enough.

79
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,371
Lena.

80
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,365
Lena, go home.

81
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:50,695
Stop this.

82
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:07,149
Thank you.

83
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:08,488
Let's eat.

84
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,698
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

85
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:17,329
It's fine.

86
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:22,124
I talked to Tatang, and he
agreed for you to live here.

87
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,897
I'll head to Manila
once I save enough money,

88
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:29,917
so I can catch up with the enrollment.

89
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:31,792
Lena,

90
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:36,365
what if your mom completely
disowns you for pushing through with this?

91
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:45,280
I'm sure she'll forgive me
once I prove to her I'm right.

92
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,465
Well , if you're really determined...

93
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,404
then I'll take care of your tuition.

94
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,622
I'll sell the boat.

95
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,619
Thanks...

96
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,872
but even helping with
my fare would be enough.

97
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:12,483
I can manage once I'm there.
I'll take care of myself.

98
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:17,458
I'll take you there...
until I'm sure you're settled.

99
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,406
I can handle it.

100
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,434
And your dad might
get sick if you're not here.

101
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:31,409
Alright... but let me
help you with your tution,

102
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,804
and let me visit you every now
and then once my Dad's okay.

103
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:42,658
Actually, I prefer that you continue
with your studies as well.

104
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:44,293
They have Marine Engineering in there.

105
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:48,458
Don't worry about me,
I'll do that once you graduate.

106
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:51,639
Arthur...

107
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:55,487
It's best for our future kids.

108
00:11:57,378 --> 00:11:58,588
They're lucky,

109
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,209
their mom has a degree...

110
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:06,615
and think about it, you'll be
the first accountant here in Sitio.

111
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,698
Can you wait for seven years?

112
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,496
Seven years?
I thought it was only four?

113
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:18,501
Because after graduation,
there's a board exam...

114
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:19,886
and...

115
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:25,790
I plan to help Mom and Dad for
a couple of years before we get married.

116
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:30,450
No matter how many years
it takes, I'll wait...

117
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,247
just as long as you stay mine!

118
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,644
Of course!

119
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,136
Let's eat.

120
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:46,316
Mmm, delicious.

121
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,238
Motor-taxi!

122
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,325
Motor-taxi!

123
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,535
Motor-taxi!

124
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,290
Motor-taxi!

125
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,502
Motor-taxi!

126
00:13:16,857 --> 00:13:17,922
Motor-taxi!

127
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,325
Make sure to always call
and chat me, okay?

128
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:24,888
If anything you'd be the one having
problems with the signal in this place.

129
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:29,554
I'd climb any mountain just
so I could get to talk to you.

130
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:34,353
There are lots of
handsome guys in Manila...

131
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:37,153
don't replace me that easy, huh?

132
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:39,521
Maybe it's you who
won't be able to resist,

133
00:13:39,592 --> 00:13:41,200
you're like a rabbit.

134
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:04,326
I could see Manila from here.

135
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:07,845
Seems like you want
to cross over. It's quite far.

136
00:15:10,153 --> 00:15:11,779
It's unlikely she'll get back to you.

137
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:13,819
Lena's not like that.

138
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:16,278
she loves me.

139
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:17,876
That's what I said back then,

140
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:20,110
when my wife went to Manila.

141
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:21,773
Gemma's not like that...

142
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:23,965
but she ended up with someone else.

143
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,534
She even forgot about our kids.

144
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,931
She's probably in an air-conditioned
room right now.

145
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:36,685
Yeah, so, buddy, just a friendly advice.
Don't expect too much.

146
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:55,637
Hey, Lena, how are you?

147
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:59,365
I'm okay, still adjusting.

148
00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:01,948
Do you have any money left?

149
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,737
There's still some of
the money you gave me.

150
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:09,185
The down payment and advance
for the boarding house are quite expensive.

151
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:12,764
But I'll start looking for a job.

152
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:17,479
No need, just focus
on your studies.

153
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:21,521
I'll send you some money.
I have a little saved up here.

154
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:23,254
Thank you, Arthur!

155
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,404
I'll pay you back
once I find work.

156
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:39,415
Lena, are there men
in your boarding house?

157
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,151
Yes, most of the people
here are students too.

158
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:46,445
Maybe you could move to
an all-girls boarding house.

159
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,719
Come on, Arthur...

160
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,720
It's hard to find
a cheap boarding house.

161
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,365
- And it's close to the school, so—
- Just move.

162
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:59,599
Where it's all girls.

163
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:03,111
I'll do something about your deposit.

164
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,029
Okay. Okay, bye.

165
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:27,371
So, Arthur, can you handle it?

166
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:29,922
I told you, construction work is tough.

167
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,227
Fishing isn't a walk
in the park either.

168
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,738
one foot already floating
in a grave of water.

169
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:40,143
If luck is against you,
you'll come home empty-handed.

170
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,310
That's why I avoided fishing...

171
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:45,932
the sea doesn't give easily.

172
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:49,833
But people are also abusive.

173
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:55,157
Just let me know when
you have a project, I'll join you.

174
00:17:57,348 --> 00:17:59,240
I'm impressed with you, kid.

175
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,636
It's just you and your old man...

176
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:04,834
but you work hard as all hell,
what do you even need the money for?

177
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:24,207
Have you been here long?

178
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,187
Kind of.

179
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,161
I can't reach Lena.

180
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:31,961
She probably ran out of battery outside.

181
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,310
I wish someone would contact me as well.

182
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,883
My boyfriend, I can't reach him either...

183
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,318
He might have someone else
in Manila already.

184
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:45,622
So now I'm looking for a foreigner...
like Letty.

185
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:48,311
Do you know Letty?

186
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,411
No, I don't.

187
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:55,380
Well, if that's how it is.
Why don't you find a new boyfriend?

188
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:57,727
I feel like...

189
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,749
I've already found one.

190
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:07,705
You know,

191
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,690
you're beautiful,

192
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:14,506
but I'm sorry, I don't have time
for that kind of thing.

193
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:15,888
Even this?

194
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:23,099
You don't have time... for this?

195
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:41,349
I'm really sorry, I need to go.

196
00:19:57,934 --> 00:20:02,613
Why do you like Arthur so much?
He's already with Lena.

197
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:06,270
Me, I promise I'll take care of you.

198
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:11,520
Everybody says that.

199
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:16,129
Do you want me to prove it to you?

200
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:19,383
There are so many people here.

201
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,285
No, that's fine.

202
00:22:16,257 --> 00:22:17,524
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

203
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,304
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

204
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:27,930
- Happy birthday!
- Arthur!

205
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:33,413
Thank you, Arthur.

206
00:22:35,093 --> 00:22:39,577
But please don't tell me you traveled
all this way just for my birthday.

207
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:51,331
Arthur, it's quite far.
You wasted money.

208
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:55,124
Is it a waste if I got to see you?

209
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:57,877
Arthur...

210
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:01,946
Let it go, it's your birthday...

211
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,759
Of course, I want to be with you.

212
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,516
You didn't come home
during vacation either...

213
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:09,972
It's been a year since
we last saw each other.

214
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:16,710
I'm sorry, but I'm just
being practical.

215
00:23:20,284 --> 00:23:21,702
How's your dad?

216
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,653
She's with Aunt Saling.

217
00:23:25,975 --> 00:23:27,183
How are you?

218
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,384
You know, I miss you.

219
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:40,693
I'm sorry if we don't talk much...

220
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:44,757
I have a lot to do in school.

221
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:51,671
By the way, who's the guy
who drove you here?

222
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:59,374
Ah, he's a classmate,
they greeted me for my birthday.

223
00:23:59,842 --> 00:24:00,912
Treated me, as well.

224
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:04,718
Who's over there?

225
00:24:05,623 --> 00:24:07,834
Those are my schoolmates.

226
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:10,562
And on the other side?

227
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:16,382
Hmm, a married couple,
but they don't come often.

228
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:20,358
So, can we?

229
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,420
What's wrong with you?

230
00:24:23,335 --> 00:24:24,711
Let's do it quietly.

231
00:24:25,194 --> 00:24:29,010
Arthur, don't! Someone might hear us.

232
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,124
Please!

233
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:58,909
You've only been here for a year,
but you've changed a lot.

234
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:03,339
Who knows, next time,
I might not even recognize you.

235
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:06,158
Lena,

236
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:10,118
what if I just work
here in Manila?

237
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:14,892
I find it hard,
us being so far apart.

238
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:17,558
What about your dad?

239
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,080
I'll bring him here.

240
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:25,903
Arthur, it's not that simple.

241
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:28,789
The cost of living here is no joke.

242
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:33,919
And it's hard to find a high-paying job

243
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,629
if you're not a college graduate.

244
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,964
Or even if you are a college graduate,

245
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:39,996
it's still not that easy!

246
00:27:40,122 --> 00:27:44,307
I thought I could endure
four years of being apart.

247
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,085
Don't think about it too much.

248
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,941
You won't even realize
it's been four years.

249
00:27:53,996 --> 00:27:58,035
I've already graduated
and returned home.

250
00:27:58,332 --> 00:28:02,676
What if, after four years,
you realize...

251
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:05,298
our small town isn't
big enough for your dreams?

252
00:28:08,697 --> 00:28:10,366
Your allowance, by the way.

253
00:28:14,117 --> 00:28:15,574
Do you really love me?

254
00:28:16,914 --> 00:28:18,113
Of course!

255
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:21,583
Thanks for this.

256
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,901
I failed in a major subject.

257
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:01,469
My grades didn't meet
the scholarship requirements.

258
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:04,330
Maybe you could still
talk to your professor.

259
00:29:04,957 --> 00:29:06,787
You're studying hard, after all.

260
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,123
It is what it is.

261
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:16,153
Maybe I'll work for a while
to save up for my enrollment.

262
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:18,973
No, let me do something about it.

263
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:32,427
It's dangerous, man!
We won't go through with it.

264
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:36,723
You go ahead, but
I'm telling you it's dangerous!

265
00:29:36,748 --> 00:29:37,748
Let's go!

266
00:29:38,368 --> 00:29:40,078
Come on, let's go home.

267
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,655
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

268
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,653
No, man. I'm leaving.

269
00:30:03,957 --> 00:30:07,416
Don't go through with this,
the weather tells you so.

270
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,229
Look how dark it is!

271
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:11,333
You can't see anything!

272
00:30:12,754 --> 00:30:15,254
See that! A storm is coming!

273
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:19,108
Lena isn't even your wife yet, son.

274
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,946
Just take it easy.

275
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,194
Hey, you got here ahead of us.

276
00:31:03,782 --> 00:31:07,285
You fool, you scared us.
We thought you wouldn't come back.

277
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:11,439
I thought the same,
the weather was so bad.

278
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,279
But luckily, it cleared up today.

279
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:17,341
I really needed the money
for Lena's enrollment.

280
00:31:17,366 --> 00:31:18,785
Is that why you're here?

281
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,511
There it is!

282
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:24,191
Ma'am, island hopping!

283
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,193
Island hopping, ma'am!

284
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,432
- Ma'am, here's my boat.
- Isla Verde! Isla Verde!

285
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,873
- I wanna ride you.
- Sorry?

286
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,184
I mean, I wanna ride your boat.

287
00:31:42,295 --> 00:31:43,548
Sure.

288
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:44,675
Is it okay?

289
00:31:47,036 --> 00:31:48,036
Shall we?

290
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,152
Okay, turn around.

291
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:26,869
Wait,

292
00:32:27,302 --> 00:32:28,795
that wasn't part of the deal.

293
00:32:29,061 --> 00:32:31,451
Don't worry, I'll add
another five thousand.

294
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,204
I'm sorry, no.

295
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:38,217
I bust quickly,
and I brought a condom!

296
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,928
How about I do you instead?

297
00:32:41,488 --> 00:32:43,600
No, bro, I'm a top.

298
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:46,045
What if I make it seven thousand,
will that work for you?

299
00:32:47,623 --> 00:32:50,699
And you won't earn much
from fishing anyway.

300
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:52,735
I know a lot of gay guys,

301
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,467
I'll refer you if I enjoy it.

302
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,685
So, are you okay with it?

303
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:25,362
Hey, wake up, we're here.

304
00:33:26,227 --> 00:33:27,353
We're here!

305
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:34,146
- You pervert!
- Arthur, that's enough!

306
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,826
- Asshole!
- Enough!

307
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:38,667
- Asshole!
- You'll know your place soon!

308
00:33:38,692 --> 00:33:40,350
Hey, cut it out!

309
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:43,705
The boat is about to leave,
and you're still picking a fight.

310
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,107
The nerve on that guy!

311
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:02,178
I wish you just let it go,
you could've been sued.

312
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:08,694
I'm sorry, I really can't stand it
when someone disrespects you.

313
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,853
Mom! Dad!

314
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:23,955
Lena!

315
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,376
Lena, I know I have to wait
for three more years

316
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:30,320
before we get married,
as you requested of me.

317
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:33,337
But if we're headed in that direction,

318
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,634
why should we delay it?

319
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,650
Lena...

320
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,638
Will you marry me?

321
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,295
Did I say it right in English?

322
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,268
Arthur, I'm sorry.

323
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,198
Sorry, sorry.

324
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,448
I'm really sorry.

325
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:00,755
I'm sorry!

326
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,189
Ah, the food is getting cold.

327
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,798
Let's eat.

328
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:16,883
Please continue playing.

329
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,932
Lena, Lena, wait a minute.

330
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,303
Lena, let's talk.

331
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:50,412
Sorry if I surprised you earlier.

332
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:56,874
You're not ready yet, it's okay.

333
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,145
I understand.

334
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:04,726
I'll wait for you!

335
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,159
Unless I'm no longer the man

336
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,858
you see as your future partner.

337
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:20,325
I'm still the one, right?

338
00:37:24,615 --> 00:37:26,867
You wouldn't replace me
with someone else, right?

339
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,583
You love me, don't you?!

340
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,002
Lena?!

341
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,547
I love you so much.

342
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,176
Don't leave me.

343
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,306
Don't leave me, please!

344
00:37:52,223 --> 00:37:53,224
Lena!

345
00:37:54,713 --> 00:37:57,716
Tell me what I did wrong, Lena!

346
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,219
Lena...

347
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:04,449
Lena!

348
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,672
I love you so much!

349
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,170
Lena!

350
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,001
Let me go!

351
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:20,881
Lena!

352
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:25,366
Lena!

353
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,807
Lena!

354
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:33,343
You embarrassed the man.

355
00:38:36,093 --> 00:38:39,888
You know what, I already forgave you,
despite your stubbornness.

356
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:46,906
Because your dad said

357
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:52,448
your education in Manila
might bring something good.

358
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:57,185
But right after you arrived,
you proved to me

359
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,172
that you didn't learn anything.

360
00:39:01,315 --> 00:39:05,027
What more do you want, Lena?

361
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,811
Arthur sacrificed a lot for you.

362
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:11,600
You wouldn't even graduate without him.

363
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,998
Men like him are rare, Lena.

364
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:20,123
Sure, be picky as hell,

365
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:22,775
you might end up with a loser.

366
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,594
Make up your damn mind!

367
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:25,750
Maring,

368
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,092
that's a decision
we shouldn't meddle with.

369
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,702
What do you mean
we shouldn't meddle with,

370
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,495
that's our job as her parents!

371
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,113
To make sure she ends up with
someone who will provide for her.

372
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,182
Then what the hell are you doing?

373
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:39,274
And it's embarrassing, Lena.

374
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:41,786
What will other people say?

375
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,882
That we're a family of users?

376
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:49,095
Mom, I'll pay back everything
Arthur spent on me.

377
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:54,701
And there's a job waiting
for me in Manila already.

378
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,437
That's something you'll never
learn in Manila.

379
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,060
You can't repay a debt
of gratitude with money.

380
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:07,155
And you can't return the pain
you caused to someone!

381
00:40:08,193 --> 00:40:10,737
What else, Lena, what else?

382
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,329
Did Arthur do something
wrong to you, huh? Answer me!

383
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,875
Nothing, right?

384
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,549
Do you have a boyfriend in Manila?

385
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:33,637
Or do you not want to
be tied to this land forever?

386
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:07,507
I wanted us to have a proper
conversation before I go back to Manila.

387
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:14,129
Didn't we agree that
you'll be working here?

388
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:19,786
We'd start a business here
once we've saved enough capital.

389
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,396
I won't be able to do that now.

390
00:41:25,224 --> 00:41:26,568
Arthur. Please forgive me.

391
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:28,678
Is it because of what happened yesterday...

392
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,013
at the port?

393
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,665
It's my fault, please forgive me.

394
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,377
Just be honest with me.

395
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,048
Do you have someone else?

396
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,950
I didn't mean to.

397
00:41:57,907 --> 00:41:59,492
I didn't mean to.

398
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,818
Shit!

399
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:02,376
Since when?

400
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:04,730
Damn it!

401
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,200
You still love me, right?

402
00:42:18,504 --> 00:42:21,341
I'll forgive you,
let's fix this.

403
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:26,659
Lena... I love you so much.

404
00:42:33,023 --> 00:42:35,700
- Forgive me.
- Lena, don't do this to me.

405
00:42:37,607 --> 00:42:41,305
Lena, don't leave me.

406
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:43,169
Lena...

407
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:45,688
Arthur!

408
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:49,469
- Lena!
- Cut it out!

409
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:54,723
Lena, I love you
so much, don't leave me.

410
00:42:58,785 --> 00:42:59,785
Lena.

411
00:43:14,228 --> 00:43:15,354
Here, sir.

412
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:16,643
- Ah.
- Here.

413
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:18,966
Alright. Thank you, kid.

414
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,990
Here, this is for you.

415
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:22,565
Thanks.

416
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:26,559
Excuse me.

417
00:43:27,778 --> 00:43:28,778
Yes?

418
00:43:29,355 --> 00:43:33,317
Good day, sir. Is this Lena's house?

419
00:43:39,797 --> 00:43:41,298
Why, what do you need?

420
00:43:44,184 --> 00:43:46,061
I'm looking for her.

421
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,296
Sit down.

422
00:43:54,911 --> 00:43:55,911
Thank you.

423
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,180
Right here?

424
00:44:10,012 --> 00:44:11,597
What do you need from my daughter?

425
00:44:13,326 --> 00:44:15,203
I'm Onjie.

426
00:44:25,408 --> 00:44:26,951
Lena's boyfriend.

427
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:37,642
I'll be straightforward.

428
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:42,388
Lena has a boyfriend here,
did you know that?

429
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,392
Yes, ma'am. She told me about it.

430
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,150
And you're fine with it?

431
00:44:55,878 --> 00:44:57,505
Well, you see.

432
00:44:58,761 --> 00:45:01,013
She told me that
she's choosing me.

433
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:05,542
That's why she came back
here to sort things out.

434
00:45:07,181 --> 00:45:11,852
But, I received a text from her.

435
00:45:13,151 --> 00:45:14,527
She's breaking up with me.

436
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:17,613
What else are you doing here?

437
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:24,194
I just wanted to know why.

438
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:27,666
We never disagreed on anything.

439
00:45:29,433 --> 00:45:31,059
We love each other.

440
00:45:33,384 --> 00:45:36,095
So I mustered up the courage to come here.

441
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:39,988
Is she still here?

442
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:47,453
What are you talking about?
She left the other day.

443
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,581
She went to Manila!

444
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,540
Huh?

445
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,087
Are you sure?

446
00:45:57,938 --> 00:46:00,441
I just came from her
boarding house in Manila.

447
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,798
She hasn't arrived there yet.

448
00:46:02,823 --> 00:46:04,206
That's what she told us.

449
00:46:18,516 --> 00:46:19,558
Arthur.

450
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:21,168
Arthur.

451
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:24,156
Arthur.

452
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:26,853
Arthur.

453
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,121
I'm sorry, I was going to ask you,

454
00:46:30,146 --> 00:46:31,887
do you know where Lena is?

455
00:46:33,909 --> 00:46:38,580
In our last conversation,
she said she was going to Manila.

456
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:46,589
She told us that too, but she's not there,
and we can't reach her either.

457
00:46:49,576 --> 00:46:50,576
Who told you?

458
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:56,259
Oh, Onjie, Lena's new boyfriend.

459
00:46:57,245 --> 00:47:03,651
He went to our house
and he's looking for Lena.

460
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:07,161
Arthur, sorry for what our daughter did.

461
00:47:07,314 --> 00:47:10,317
We are truly sorry for
what she did to you.

462
00:47:11,157 --> 00:47:14,493
Arthur, maybe our daughter
told you where she is.

463
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:17,930
We're just so worried.

464
00:47:19,498 --> 00:47:20,791
Maybe you can help us.

465
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:25,249
I really don't know either.

466
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:31,378
I want to keep my distance from anything
related to your daughter for now.

467
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,868
But if I get any
information about her,

468
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:38,335
I'll let you know right away.

469
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,347
You son of a bitch.

470
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:20,272
You asshole!

471
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:23,401
You son of a bitch!
Where's Lena?

472
00:48:23,664 --> 00:48:25,224
I don't know what you're talking about.

473
00:48:25,974 --> 00:48:27,409
I don't know her!

474
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:44,612
Help!

475
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,644
Help!

476
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:11,290
Help! Help!

477
00:49:41,784 --> 00:49:46,077
I brought some food, but you should
change your clothes first.

478
00:49:46,102 --> 00:49:47,622
You might get sick.

479
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:06,169
You asshole.

480
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,190
What is it that you're
planning to do with me?

481
00:50:28,244 --> 00:50:30,004
There's a fiesta in
the neighboring village.

482
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:33,617
The usual boats here
joined the race.

483
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:37,423
If it's okay with you,
I'll take you to town.

484
00:50:37,874 --> 00:50:42,182
Thank you, Arthur.
I'll wait for now,

485
00:50:42,532 --> 00:50:44,503
in case someone arrives.

486
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,921
It's already late, and
the waves are getting high.

487
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,887
No other boats will
be traveling at this time.

488
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:56,061
If you really need
to get to town today,

489
00:50:56,843 --> 00:50:59,596
let me take you there.

490
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:07,901
Why, Lena? Are you afraid
that I might harm you?

491
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:10,993
Do you think I'm that bad?

492
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:20,077
I'm sorry for the things I said.

493
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:22,386
I was just really hurt.

494
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:26,390
But I won't cause you harm or anything.

495
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,089
I understand.

496
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:38,888
But I hope that
you can forgive me.

497
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:41,307
If not today,

498
00:51:43,648 --> 00:51:45,567
but I hope that it'll come.

499
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:50,042
Not for my sake,
but for yours.

500
00:51:50,652 --> 00:51:53,628
You deserve to be happy, Arthur.

501
00:51:54,534 --> 00:51:57,203
If this is really is
the last time I'm seeing you,

502
00:51:57,768 --> 00:52:00,771
at least let me
take you to town.

503
00:52:01,631 --> 00:52:04,737
So, I can make sure you're okay

504
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:06,597
until you can catch a bus.

505
00:53:35,055 --> 00:53:38,433
Arthur, this place seems
far from town.

506
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:41,957
Arthur!

507
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,305
Arthur! Please answer me!

508
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:51,815
Arthur, where are you taking me?

509
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:58,027
Don't break my trust!

510
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:09,257
- Damn it!
- Help!

511
00:54:18,156 --> 00:54:20,499
What the hell!

512
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:23,360
- Stop, I said!
- Help!

513
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,970
Help!

514
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,183
- Help!
- Stop it!

515
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,440
Damn it!

516
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,893
Arthur, please.

517
00:55:03,899 --> 00:55:05,979
Let me go.

518
00:55:10,327 --> 00:55:12,371
If you can just be kind to me,

519
00:55:14,587 --> 00:55:16,965
and listen to everything I say,

520
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:20,899
I won't hurt you.

521
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,171
We won't have any problems.

522
00:55:27,465 --> 00:55:29,592
Don't even try to
escape from me, okay?

523
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:36,273
Because I will kill you
and your parents.

524
00:55:40,487 --> 00:55:42,965
Eat, I said! Eat this!

525
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,925
Eat!

526
00:55:50,866 --> 00:55:53,368
Then die from hunger, you bitch!

527
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:49,893
You should eat.

528
00:56:53,658 --> 00:56:57,373
Come on now.
I won't poison you.

529
00:56:57,756 --> 00:56:59,897
What's wrong? I love you so much.

530
00:57:39,065 --> 00:57:44,529
Arthur, let's stop this game now.

531
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:49,490
Let's go back, please.

532
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:53,608
It's happy here, it's quiet.

533
00:57:55,527 --> 00:57:57,362
Our own little world.

534
00:58:00,483 --> 00:58:01,984
I have no rival here.

535
00:58:04,354 --> 00:58:06,487
It's just the two of us.

536
00:58:08,459 --> 00:58:11,754
We'll build a happy family here.

537
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:24,483
Do you think I'll still love you
with what you're doing, huh?

538
00:58:27,694 --> 00:58:29,404
You're going crazy, Arthur!

539
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:32,456
You're insane!

540
00:58:32,481 --> 00:58:33,481
Yeah.

541
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:35,319
Yes, I'm crazy.

542
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:37,681
I'm crazy for you!

543
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:40,501
And you're mine, Lena!

544
00:58:40,956 --> 00:58:42,207
You're mine alone!

545
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:18,472
You're disgusting, Arthur!

546
00:59:18,784 --> 00:59:23,229
Even I'm disgusted with myself.

547
00:59:24,571 --> 00:59:26,615
In order to make your dreams reality,

548
00:59:28,534 --> 00:59:30,828
I even sold my body.

549
00:59:35,432 --> 00:59:37,355
So, are we good?

550
00:59:37,683 --> 00:59:39,893
Shall we continue?
Are you okay?

551
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:42,479
Turn around!

552
01:02:58,423 --> 01:03:00,721
If I only relied on fishing

553
01:03:01,382 --> 01:03:05,219
and occasional construction
work for your education,

554
01:03:06,186 --> 01:03:07,565
it wouldn't be enough.

555
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:11,753
Especially when you
lost your scholarship.

556
01:03:13,446 --> 01:03:15,933
Just so you get to keep
on going to school,

557
01:03:17,111 --> 01:03:20,501
I had to resort to
selling myself to tourists.

558
01:03:23,018 --> 01:03:27,487
Gay men, matrons, old people...

559
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:30,376
I didn't choose.

560
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:33,672
As long as they could pay.

561
01:03:36,176 --> 01:03:42,809
Some were generous, some were stingy,
some were weird.

562
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:49,396
Over time, they all
looked the same to me.

563
01:03:49,881 --> 01:03:54,182
When you were doing your thesis,
it cost a lot!

564
01:03:55,029 --> 01:04:00,287
That's why I had to turn
to dealing drugs.

565
01:04:02,645 --> 01:04:07,639
It's a shame, you were
so close to graduating.

566
01:04:09,617 --> 01:04:12,328
You know, one time,

567
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,732
the police caught me with shabu.

568
01:04:17,586 --> 01:04:18,586
Get down!

569
01:04:19,826 --> 01:04:21,670
- Please have mercy.
- Get down!

570
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,905
Please don't kill me, sir.

571
01:04:31,086 --> 01:04:33,248
My father is sick.

572
01:04:34,029 --> 01:04:36,528
He only relies on me.

573
01:04:36,553 --> 01:04:41,592
You drug pushers always
say that when you're caught.

574
01:04:42,433 --> 01:04:44,403
There are too many of you.

575
01:04:44,502 --> 01:04:46,504
How about we trim the numbers?

576
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:49,615
Please, sir, don't kill me.
I'll do anything.

577
01:04:52,023 --> 01:04:53,023
Anything?

578
01:04:53,783 --> 01:04:55,061
Put it in your mouth.

579
01:04:56,324 --> 01:04:58,076
Swallow it!

580
01:05:04,647 --> 01:05:10,457
Okay, now.
Swallow this.

581
01:05:10,482 --> 01:05:12,512
No, please.

582
01:05:12,537 --> 01:05:14,573
- What do you mean no, huh?
- Have mercy, sir!

583
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:19,018
Will you do it? Or should I
blow your fucking ass?

584
01:05:19,043 --> 01:05:20,043
Suck it!

585
01:05:28,288 --> 01:05:29,959
Turn around!

586
01:05:34,857 --> 01:05:36,364
No please!

587
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:40,717
You bastard!

588
01:06:05,578 --> 01:06:07,372
I made it home alive.

589
01:06:08,829 --> 01:06:10,956
That bastard didn't file charges
against me either.

590
01:06:11,888 --> 01:06:15,224
But it was like
I was imprisoned too,

591
01:06:16,061 --> 01:06:18,420
because every time
he needed release,

592
01:06:20,392 --> 01:06:21,966
I couldn't refuse.

593
01:06:25,374 --> 01:06:26,834
I endured it all!

594
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:32,545
But you know, there's one
thing I couldn't take.

595
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,552
I lost my father.

596
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:40,702
Because I didn't bring him
to the hospital right away,

597
01:06:43,395 --> 01:06:44,897
because I put you first.

598
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,254
I put your needs first.

599
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:52,008
I never once blamed you

600
01:06:52,695 --> 01:06:56,264
or held it against you.

601
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:58,778
I wanted to do those things for you.

602
01:07:00,472 --> 01:07:01,932
Because I love you.

603
01:07:09,044 --> 01:07:12,630
I love you. Please
don't leave me, Lena.

604
01:07:18,145 --> 01:07:20,439
Forgive me, Arthur.

605
01:07:24,213 --> 01:07:26,507
I hope you can forgive me.

606
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:03,752
I admit that when
I went to Manila,

607
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:08,686
I saw how small our world in Sitio was.

608
01:08:10,013 --> 01:08:11,932
The world is so big.

609
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,467
I reached a point where
I didn't want to come back to you.

610
01:08:20,659 --> 01:08:22,453
I felt...

611
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:28,253
I no longer fit the simple life
you wanted for us.

612
01:08:30,878 --> 01:08:36,675
Maybe that's why I let
myself fall for another man.

613
01:08:38,248 --> 01:08:41,626
So I had a reason
not to return to you.

614
01:08:46,991 --> 01:08:52,282
If this is how I can make up
for all your hardship and sacrifices,

615
01:08:53,425 --> 01:08:54,504
I'll do it.

616
01:08:56,913 --> 01:08:59,402
I'll do whatever you want.

617
01:09:02,323 --> 01:09:06,911
I need to pee, too,
I have to relieve myself.

618
01:09:09,598 --> 01:09:12,351
Can you please remove this chain?

619
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:17,957
Don't worry, I won't run away.

620
01:09:37,736 --> 01:09:38,736
Come on.

621
01:09:57,959 --> 01:10:00,394
Hurry up, hurry up.

622
01:11:31,183 --> 01:11:32,434
Thank you.

623
01:11:36,563 --> 01:11:39,399
But if we stay here
any longer, Arthur,

624
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:42,877
people from our place
might look for me.

625
01:11:42,902 --> 01:11:44,262
I've thought it through,

626
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:47,428
just do what I'll tell you.

627
01:11:47,799 --> 01:11:49,944
I'll go back to Sitio tomorrow morning,

628
01:11:49,969 --> 01:11:52,055
I have pick something up.

629
01:11:53,622 --> 01:11:55,207
When are you coming back?

630
01:11:56,583 --> 01:12:00,337
Arthur, I can't be here alone.

631
01:12:00,944 --> 01:12:02,695
Please!

632
01:12:14,512 --> 01:12:16,745
We've also posted on social media

633
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:19,189
if anyone knows Lena's whereabouts.

634
01:12:19,572 --> 01:12:20,573
But there's nothing.

635
01:12:23,743 --> 01:12:28,540
Are you sure your daughter
doesn't have any enemies?

636
01:12:31,308 --> 01:12:35,353
My daughter and I don't really
see eye to eye on a lot of things.

637
01:12:37,903 --> 01:12:40,972
Maybe she just ran away

638
01:12:40,997 --> 01:12:42,621
to cool things off a bit.

639
01:12:44,816 --> 01:12:47,360
It's hard to believe that, sir.

640
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,153
What if

641
01:12:51,227 --> 01:12:53,646
something bad
happened to our daughter?

642
01:12:55,889 --> 01:13:01,683
Her ex-boyfriend mentioned that he got into
a fight with someone who disrespected Lena.

643
01:13:01,963 --> 01:13:03,048
He suspects

644
01:13:05,701 --> 01:13:07,621
that the guy took revenge
on Lena instead of him.

645
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:12,956
If that's the case,
you can file a formal complaint.

646
01:13:13,345 --> 01:13:14,886
So we can investigate it.

647
01:13:16,144 --> 01:13:21,480
Sir, can you make sure
to investigate Lena's ex too?

648
01:13:22,874 --> 01:13:26,246
He still holds a grudge against
Lena because she left him.

649
01:13:27,413 --> 01:13:28,873
Good day, sir.

650
01:13:30,617 --> 01:13:32,410
Arthur, come in.

651
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,374
Mr. Lito, Mrs. Maring.

652
01:13:36,117 --> 01:13:39,621
It's Lena. She sent
a voice message.

653
01:13:41,944 --> 01:13:45,823
I wanted to ask for your
forgiveness again, Arthur.

654
01:13:46,253 --> 01:13:49,173
I hope that one day
you can forgive me.

655
01:13:49,514 --> 01:13:55,191
And I also hope that you find
a woman who can reciprocate your love.

656
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,748
I'm going away for a while,

657
01:13:57,992 --> 01:14:01,332
I want to be alone and
think things through.

658
01:14:01,852 --> 01:14:05,738
Please tell Mom and Dad that I'm okay.

659
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:09,761
I'll come home when
I'm ready to face them.

660
01:14:14,933 --> 01:14:16,152
You heard it.

661
01:14:16,901 --> 01:14:20,154
Next time, before you report us,

662
01:14:20,568 --> 01:14:22,529
make sure to confirm the facts.

663
01:14:23,493 --> 01:14:26,145
The trip to your place is quite far,

664
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,713
it takes three hours to cross.

665
01:14:29,094 --> 01:14:30,512
I'm sorry, sir.

666
01:14:30,537 --> 01:14:32,289
Thank you very much.

667
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,433
Alright, we'll go ahead now.

668
01:14:34,587 --> 01:14:37,882
I'm sorry, sir. Thank you!

669
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:39,027
Come on.

670
01:14:53,997 --> 01:14:56,338
You're probably just going
to follow Lena to Manila,

671
01:14:56,363 --> 01:14:57,949
that's why you're going
to work there.

672
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:03,087
Cut it out, man. There are plenty
of other girls around here.

673
01:15:04,544 --> 01:15:09,257
No, man. I'm really
looking for a job there.

674
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:12,238
Plus, I'll go back to school.

675
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,653
I want to prove something to myself.

676
01:15:16,902 --> 01:15:21,402
I managed to send Lena to school,
why not myself?

677
01:15:22,802 --> 01:15:27,765
That's right! Well, there's
no progress here in our place.

678
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:32,441
Just don't forget us
when you get rich, okay?

679
01:15:33,335 --> 01:15:35,144
- Of course, right?
- Yes.

680
01:15:35,204 --> 01:15:37,290
You're my friends ever since.

681
01:15:37,893 --> 01:15:40,437
- Here, take a shot.
- We shouldn't leave anyone behind.

682
01:15:40,462 --> 01:15:43,019
So we get to drink more, right?

683
01:15:50,263 --> 01:15:51,308
There you go.

684
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:59,252
So, you're not just a home-wrecker,
you're a thief too.

685
01:18:00,655 --> 01:18:01,948
You're the thief here!

686
01:18:02,608 --> 01:18:04,401
Why do you have Lena's phone?

687
01:18:04,784 --> 01:18:06,578
And her clothes, too.

688
01:18:10,775 --> 01:18:11,775
What?

689
01:18:14,569 --> 01:18:15,820
Where's Lena?!

690
01:18:19,392 --> 01:18:22,107
You son of a bitch!

691
01:18:22,716 --> 01:18:23,801
Where's Lena?!

692
01:18:26,712 --> 01:18:28,172
Asshole!

693
01:18:29,348 --> 01:18:30,907
You're crazy!

694
01:18:31,026 --> 01:18:32,322
Are you insane?!

695
01:18:35,273 --> 01:18:36,622
You son of a bitch!

696
01:20:14,246 --> 01:20:17,374
Sorry, it took me a while.

697
01:20:18,835 --> 01:20:19,835
Are you hungry?

698
01:20:20,342 --> 01:20:22,230
Who did you have
a fight with this time?

699
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:26,365
You're letting your temper
get the best of you again.

700
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:28,809
Huh? It's nothing.

701
01:20:36,183 --> 01:20:41,103
I'm going to finish building
this hut so you won't get wet.

702
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:06,135
Why aren't you
going for a swim?

703
01:21:06,805 --> 01:21:09,155
You used to do that, didn't you?

704
01:23:37,077 --> 01:23:40,414
When I catch fish using this net,

705
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:43,504
it means I won't go hungry.

706
01:23:43,983 --> 01:23:48,488
I'll be able to support my family.
I can start my own family.

707
01:23:48,894 --> 01:23:53,621
I'll regret it for the rest of my life
if it's not you who I end up with.

708
01:23:53,646 --> 01:23:58,552
Arthur, I don't know if you
can trust and love me again,

709
01:23:58,988 --> 01:24:02,450
but I'll try if you give me a chance.

710
01:24:03,741 --> 01:24:06,912
Arthur, should we get married?

711
01:25:39,779 --> 01:25:44,033
I am Arthur De Luna.

712
01:25:51,165 --> 01:25:53,584
I am Malena Magpayo.

713
01:25:56,071 --> 01:26:01,943
I pledge to love you...
in good times and bad,

714
01:26:04,887 --> 01:26:06,701
until death do us part.

715
01:26:41,265 --> 01:26:42,766
Let's eat.

716
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,645
I'm going to town later.

717
01:26:52,089 --> 01:26:55,358
I'll buy some materials for our home.

718
01:26:55,383 --> 01:26:56,982
Ah, this is fine as it is.

719
01:26:57,056 --> 01:26:59,193
It's a shame to put in the effort
to improve it

720
01:26:59,218 --> 01:27:01,255
when we're going to leave it anyway.

721
01:27:01,399 --> 01:27:02,399
Leave?

722
01:27:03,179 --> 01:27:07,055
Why? Aren't we happy here?

723
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:10,750
We left a life
outside this island, Arthur.

724
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:14,771
And you know we can't
just turn our backs on it easily.

725
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:17,716
Life here is safer
and quieter, Lena.

726
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:22,216
I want to start a family here.

727
01:27:22,785 --> 01:27:23,785
What?

728
01:27:24,622 --> 01:27:25,972
What family?

729
01:27:27,048 --> 01:27:28,425
What are you talking about?

730
01:27:30,407 --> 01:27:33,702
I don't want to live
on this island forever, Arthur!

731
01:27:34,774 --> 01:27:36,192
I want to dream,

732
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,737
and I want you to
dream for yourself, too.

733
01:27:39,904 --> 01:27:44,117
All I want is to be with
you for the rest of my life.

734
01:27:44,364 --> 01:27:47,451
If you truly love me,
you won't be selfish.

735
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:52,643
All I want...

736
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:00,554
is to be with you
for the rest of my life.

737
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:05,930
And I won't allow

738
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,832
that dream not to come true.

739
01:32:46,188 --> 01:32:47,773
You son of a bitch!

740
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:49,736
Get back here!

741
01:33:47,229 --> 01:33:48,229
Lena!

742
01:33:53,486 --> 01:33:55,154
Lena!

743
01:34:02,953 --> 01:34:04,163
Lena!

744
01:34:06,415 --> 01:34:09,126
Don't leave me, Lena!

745
01:34:21,305 --> 01:34:22,389
Lena!
