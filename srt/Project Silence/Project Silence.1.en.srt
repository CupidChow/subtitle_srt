00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:44,555
PROJECT SILENCE

2
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:49,842
Securing the captives' location is
no guarantee a rescue will succeed.

3
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:50,907
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

4
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:52,981
We can't lose more men for nothing.

5
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:55,226
We have to buy time. At least a month.

6
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,175
Let's impose a press embargo,

7
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,429
and quietly pursue negotiations.

8
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,930
What? A month?

9
00:02:02,074 --> 00:02:04,749
Good grief, you're
Secretary of Security.

10
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:08,299
What if they kill all the
captives while we waste time?

11
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,107
What do other secretaries think?

12
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:18,405
What's that?

13
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,157
Speak for yourself.

14
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:26,655
I'm Jung-won Cha,
Deputy Security Director.

15
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,020
What's unique about this case

16
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:32,390
is they've made no request
to talk in five months,

17
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:35,295
which suggests two possibilities.

18
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,197
One,

19
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:40,262
the terrorists are trying to raise the
ransom by delaying negotiations.

20
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:44,626
Two, the captives are already dead,

21
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:47,320
so there's no leverage for negotiation.

22
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:50,882
Either the captives are dead
or we wait for talks to happen.

23
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:52,328
So no need to rescue them?

24
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:56,698
Let's not jeopardize the Secretary's
ratings for the presidency, huh?

25
00:02:56,816 --> 00:03:00,954
With so much uncertainty,
it would be unwise to risk

26
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:04,928
damaging this administration
considering the upcoming election.

27
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:11,198
Sir, it simply amounts to dereliction
of our duty as public officials.

28
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:12,661
It's a nation's duty

29
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:15,899
to protect its citizens no
matter where they are.

30
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:19,420
Our duty is to serve the half
of the nation that supports us.

31
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:23,596
That majority expects wiser political
judgment from this government.

32
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:27,202
How dare a mere deputy director
preach about political judgment?

33
00:03:27,203 --> 00:03:31,287
Have you ever considered
how this affects their families?

34
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:32,954
Is your approval rating that important?

35
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:36,018
Good day.

36
00:03:52,313 --> 00:03:53,005
Hey.

37
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:57,256
Pretty bold of you to talk
to ministers so brazenly

38
00:03:57,574 --> 00:04:01,250
I don't care about that. Only
about winning this election.

39
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:06,826
If I had two more men like you,
I'd be the President already.

40
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:10,151
You're almost there now
You will be. The President.

41
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:19,491
Doesn't your aspiring
rapper leave today?

42
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:21,970
Yeah.

43
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,843
You did a good job
raising her on your own.

44
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:28,859
- I appreciate it, but I can't.
- Just take it.

45
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:31,011
I can't.

46
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:34,514
I know how tough it was raising
her alone while looking after me.

47
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,912
So it's my wise political judgment.

48
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:40,353
Just take it.

49
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:51,226
The sooner the better.

50
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:53,555
Actually. Saturday works better...

51
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:56,111
Thanks.

52
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,351
Great. I'll see you then.

53
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:02,131
...experiments were conducted
on the two surviving samples,

54
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:05,694
Statistics reveal over 3 million animals
were used for lab testing since last year...

55
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:08,780
Did you have to go this far?
Selling the house too?

56
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:12,114
To afford you studying
abroad, we have to.

57
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:16,759
Be on your best
behavior with your aunt.

58
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:18,636
Study, no rapping.

59
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,212
Why did you pack mom's book?

60
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:26,857
Why take something you don't need?

61
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:30,596
You don't get to decide
what I need or don't.

62
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,638
Yes, I do. Because I'm your dad.

63
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:36,054
- Work with me here, please?
- It's the last copy of her book.

64
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:40,341
...leading the runner-up
by a landslide.

65
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:45,709
- Chung is topping the poll.
- Okay. Go get him.

66
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,596
Chung is sailing off in taking
the next presidential office.

67
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:59,172
Due to the still atmosphere
a fog warning has been issued,

68
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:03,478
with a high chance of thick fog
building up along the west coast.

69
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:07,191
Drivers passing through the
area, please take extra care.

70
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:15,228
LAST GAS STATION BEFORE AIRPORT

71
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,950
Did you two fight?

72
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:31,915
Was it a mother-daughter row?

73
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:34,272
You mean father-daughter?

74
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:40,225
- Hey... hey!
- How much...

75
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:46,801
He should grab a nap,
at least a short one.

76
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,654
If you see that truck
on the way, stay clear.

77
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:55,597
That driver played poker all night,
so avoid him if you want to live.

78
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:57,542
- How much do I owe you?
- $64.40.

79
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:02,714
Our card reader's not working.

80
00:07:02,976 --> 00:07:05,712
- Can you pay cash?
- I don't have any on me.

81
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:07,744
Oh, sure you do.

82
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:15,787
Alright, fine. I'll give
you a little discount.

83
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,125
I have cash.

84
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:25,150
You're a tow truck driver, right?

85
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,058
No. I work here at the gas station.

86
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:33,486
Why would a pump attendant
carry a master key?

87
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,233
Huh?

88
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,770
It's illegal to unlock a car even
for a wrecker driver, you know.

89
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:42,952
Uh... Hey. Well.

90
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:47,923
Fine. Give me your
card. I'll see if it works.

91
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:49,354
Forget it.

92
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:53,516
Tell the owner I'll pay him
directly on my way back.

93
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,892
What...? Are you for real? Hey!

94
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,735
Dad. You can't leave without paying.

95
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:04,342
This punk won't rip me off.
Pulling a trick on me?

96
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:05,716
Hey! Hey, you! $64.40.

97
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:09,425
- I'll take care of it. Don't worry.
- Hey! Hey!

98
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:18,141
Thank God we live close
to the airport, right?

99
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:22,552
We can get an emergency passport
when the office opens in the morning,

100
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:24,473
then get the first flight out.

101
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:25,865
Miran...

102
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:29,478
Forget the tournament.

103
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:34,045
I still have a lot to learn about
being your tour manager.

104
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,998
Don't give me a long excuse about
forgetting to renew my passport.

105
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,466
I'm tired of your lame excuses.

106
00:08:41,826 --> 00:08:44,128
I'll pull out of the tournament.

107
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:48,393
- Come on, Yura. I'm really sorry.
- Excuse me!

108
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:52,134
But you're... right?

109
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:56,172
Oh, you must be a golf fan.

110
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:58,909
Yes. It's Yura.

111
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:01,568
She hasn't been on TV much lately.

112
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:05,161
Come on, Yura. Give
the lady an autograph.

113
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:06,879
- Don't get ahead of yourself.
- Golf?

114
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:10,965
I thought you were my cousin.

115
00:09:12,846 --> 00:09:14,583
- You look so much like her.
- Honey?

116
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,567
I've been looking all over for you.

117
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,309
Come on, we'll miss the bus.

118
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:25,431
It's chilly, huh?

119
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,450
Put this on. You'll catch a cold.

120
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,012
Honey, be careful!

121
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:34,340
Sweetheart..

122
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,354
Ma'am.

123
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:38,844
- That was close.
- That crazy driver!

124
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,748
Are you okay?

125
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:45,504
It's me. Your husband.

126
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:56,840
Thank you. Hold my hand, darling.

127
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:59,644
Oh, that lady must be senile.

128
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:00,458
Hush up, Miran.

129
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:11,205
This visibility is the
worst. This is unreal.

130
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:14,689
What's unreal is that it's
just the two of us on duty.

131
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:16,990
Go on a patrol.

132
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:21,064
Being on call on a day
like this... Just my luck.

133
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,292
Oh God, what's this?

134
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:36,776
Yura, what's all this?

135
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,252
It's called fog, alright?

136
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,368
Is it really fog? It's so thick.

137
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:49,211
It can't be anything else.

138
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:52,533
What should I do?
Pull over until it passes?

139
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:56,114
What for? Just drive normally
like everyone else.

140
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,467
Oh my God...

141
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:07,702
Come on, buddies.

142
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:10,960
If you don't call it.
I could really die.

143
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:14,688
Oh! Thank you! Thank you!

144
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:28,190
What the hell?

145
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:46,843
It takes about 20 minutes
to the Incheon Lab.

146
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:49,690
It's been an honor working with you.

147
00:11:50,738 --> 00:11:53,256
Vehicle 1, entering the Airport Bridge.

148
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:59,275
- Where's this?
- It's Vietnam, two days ago.

149
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:07,263
How come I look like an old lady here?

150
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,534
Are you okay?

151
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:28,550
Fuck!

152
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:44,944
What's going on?

153
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,748
This... cannot be real.

154
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:57,412
Thank goodness for my
fabulous driving skills.

155
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:02,933
- You okay, Miran?
- Are you okay? What's going on?

156
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:06,063
There's been a pileup in
the Seoul-bound lanes.

157
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:08,817
It's massive. What should I do?

158
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:11,467
I can see it from here.
How's the airport side?

159
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:12,640
Unaffected.

160
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,247
What's that?

161
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:20,489
Don't fuck with me! Give me my $64.40.

162
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:21,890
I'm telling the truth!

163
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,505
A major pileup on the Airport Bridge...

164
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:26,774
Beware of the fog on your way out.

165
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,451
The bastard must be stuck there.

166
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,473
I'm going out there to get your money.

167
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:35,675
- What the... Come here, you bastard!
- Trust me, I'll be back.

168
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:38,360
Just give me my money.

169
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:42,024
Let's go, Jodie!

170
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,643
I'm not done with you.
Come here you thief!

171
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:51,014
Switching to the second lane.

172
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:52,256
Check.

173
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:02,718
This looks real bad. Be careful. Dad.

174
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,942
Caution ahead.

175
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,092
What's he doing?

176
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:19,221
Dad, look out!

177
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:22,956
Commander! Sir!

178
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:55,392
It's Goo, not Boo... As in Google.

179
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:59,772
Oh no... I'll fix it. As good as new.

180
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:02,792
How are you going to do that?
Fix the damn car instead.

181
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:08,466
No. We're on the bridge.
The Airport Bridge.

182
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,083
Hey, man. Did Kyung-min leave safely?

183
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:16,934
Hello, sir. I'm on the
Airport Bridge right now.

184
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:20,736
On our way, there was a massive
pileup due to thick fog.

185
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,620
This will be tomorrow's news headline.

186
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:27,442
You better come to the scene before
they criticize our late response.

187
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:30,541
Give me the location.
I'll be there ASAP.

188
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,652
Yes, sir.

189
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:35,946
Dad... There was a flipped car.

190
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:37,235
Aren't you going to help?

191
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:43,812
Hey. What are you doing?

192
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:50,567
I'll go check. You stay put, okay?

193
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:01,121
Go check on the dogs.

194
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,143
Are you okay?

195
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,488
Come in. Come in, V-1.

196
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:08,545
Can you hear me, V-1?

197
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:12,917
Respond. Come in, V-1,

198
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:14,524
Hey.

199
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:17,268
Check for yourself. You, too.

200
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:19,977
- Please stay with the doctor.
- What?

201
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:29,404
Where in the hell are we?

202
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,047
Jam the cell signal on the bridge.

203
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:41,156
Yes, Commander.

204
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:56,366
We're 10.4 km in the airport direction.

205
00:17:59,106 --> 00:17:59,736
Yes.

206
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:06,898
Hello?

207
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:10,308
What the...?

208
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:12,393
SERVICE NOT AVAILABLE

209
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:17,172
- There's no signal?
- Hello? Hello?

210
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:20,295
Hey, Kyung...

211
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:26,412
Kyung-min!

212
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:30,074
Where did she go? Kyung-min!

213
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,662
Hey... Stop that.

214
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:50,625
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

215
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,873
Do you want this? Take it.

216
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:03,769
E9.

217
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,062
Is that your name? Here, it's for you.

218
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:09,111
Kyung-min!

219
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:11,887
What the hell are you doing?

220
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,125
It's dangerous.

221
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:16,561
I think it's hurt.

222
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:19,567
Even so, don't touch it.
You don't know that dog.

223
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:22,492
It's bleeding from the head.

224
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,016
Ugh, she thinks she's the boss.

225
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:34,201
It's just a club. I'll
straighten it back.

226
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:37,217
What's that?

227
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:49,506
Oh, I hate dogs. Don't come near me.

228
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:52,230
- Did you check on them?
- The Echoes have escaped.

229
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:53,044
What?

230
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:56,488
The order just came to
activate the control program.

231
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:59,138
- What... now? Here?
- Yes, Doctor.

232
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,210
- Wait.
- Step back.

233
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,133
I need to know what's going on.

234
00:20:07,513 --> 00:20:10,195
A helicopter will arrive
soon. Get on it.

235
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:12,382
Wait a minute. A helicopter?

236
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:15,348
In this visibility?

237
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,733
That's against flight protocol.
State your military branch.

238
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:24,247
Who are you? Who the hell are you?

239
00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:30,118
I'm Department of Security
at the Blue House.

240
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:33,708
Did you jam the cell phone signal?

241
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:37,131
This is an emergency.
I ask for your cooperation.

242
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:40,911
What emergency? Are
you escorting the President?

243
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:44,865
If not, I won't cooperate.
Shut down the jamming.

244
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:47,478
Fucking bureaucrat...

245
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:49,966
He just won't shut up.

246
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,506
What the hell?

247
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:54,365
You bastards...

248
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:58,093
- This is an active operation.
- How dare you! Get off me.

249
00:20:58,094 --> 00:21:00,290
- Dad?
- What do you think you're doing?

250
00:21:01,517 --> 00:21:02,689
- You lunatics!
- Dad!

251
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:03,880
- Hey, kid.
- Hey! Don't!

252
00:21:03,905 --> 00:21:05,246
- Stand back.
- What are you doing?

253
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,552
Don't worry, Kyung-min. Daddy's fine.

254
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:15,928
All hell broke loose here.
What should we do, Jodie?

255
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:19,143
I can't see a thing... there he is.

256
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,302
Here! Over here. Stop. Stop.

257
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,476
- Okay, fine.
- Stop.

258
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,589
You're hard at work.

259
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:32,462
Can you tow my car
first? I'm in a hurry.

260
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:34,186
I can do it quick if you pay double.

261
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:37,539
Fine. Just do it.

262
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:38,737
Okay.

263
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:46,289
When will you release him?

264
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:49,908
When the boys get back.

265
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:56,811
Uncuff me while I'm being nice.

266
00:21:57,085 --> 00:22:00,267
Don't try to be smart.
I'll make you regret it.

267
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:03,402
Regret is something
I live with every day.

268
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:10,018
If this goes haywire,
then we're all dead.

269
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,344
So, stop interrupting me.

270
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,491
You're safest with me.

271
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:25,211
Inputting target now.

272
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,481
Emergency code #04. Project Silence.

273
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,145
Configuring a new target.

274
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,716
Guideline one.

275
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:41,210
This code may be issued
to control the Echoes

276
00:22:41,211 --> 00:22:43,991
and enable damage
control by their handlers.

277
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:45,464
Target configured.

278
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:48,761
Starting in...

279
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,767
three, two, one.

280
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:23,913
What are you doing?

281
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:27,031
- I asked what you're doing.
- Quiet! You want to die?

282
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:37,161
Why isn't she moving?

283
00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:09,327
We don't have control on E9.

284
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:13,727
We got the rest of the pack,
so I'm stopping the program.

285
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,738
Locate the transport vehicle.
We've located the vehicle.

286
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,687
We'll lower the cage from
its current position.

287
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:35,102
Be ready to move.

288
00:24:35,103 --> 00:24:36,406
Locate the transport vehicle.

289
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,462
What's that?

290
00:24:57,673 --> 00:24:58,354
Jodie?

291
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:01,667
Where are you going, my girl?

292
00:25:01,692 --> 00:25:05,037
- Where are you going, man?
- No, Jodie! Come back here.

293
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:14,473
State your branch, and what is
going on with those mad dogs.

294
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,258
You have five minutes to explain.

295
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:21,369
Why don't you ask your superior
about the Silence Project?

296
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,182
- What?
- The Silence Project.

297
00:25:24,844 --> 00:25:28,894
Transfer the retrieved
Echoes first. Move fast.

298
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:30,944
This is an active operation.
You can't be here.

299
00:25:30,969 --> 00:25:35,225
Shut down the damn jammer.
How else can I report to my boss?

300
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:37,906
- Let me go!
- Step back.

301
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:39,723
What's that mutt doing there?

302
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:44,656
- You can't go past.
- Jodie! She's my family, bastards!

303
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:48,764
- Jodie!
- Please leave.

304
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:51,399
Jodie!

305
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:53,688
- Come here, Jodie!
- You can't, sir.

306
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,309
- Get rid of that thing.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:04,227
- You there.
- Come here.

308
00:26:05,153 --> 00:26:08,092
- Kyung-min! What are you doing?
- You can't be here, kid.

309
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:11,211
- Let go of her.
- Who are you?

310
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:13,789
You! Hey

311
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,979
$64.40, right?

312
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:21,427
Bring over Jodie and my money. Now!

313
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:24,041
Echo 9 is not moving.

314
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:28,256
I'll take care of E9 later.
Hoist up the cage.

315
00:26:28,257 --> 00:26:31,040
You just saw me, right? Let me go.

316
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:32,454
You can't go through.

317
00:26:33,923 --> 00:26:36,837
Oh, geez.

318
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,549
Something's wrong.

319
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,257
It's still there.

320
00:26:49,132 --> 00:26:50,383
Hoisting up the cage now.

321
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,985
E9's control chip has fallen out.

322
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,908
I repeat. E9's control chip
has been detached.

323
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,247
Lieutenant.

324
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:04,952
What's that?

325
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:20,179
This could trigger an error response.

326
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:25,666
The dogs will go out of control again.

327
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,636
Stay here. Don't wander off.

328
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:38,982
What the hell are you up to?

329
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,850
Tell me straight.

330
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,839
The dogs are out of control again.

331
00:28:43,714 --> 00:28:45,822
- What?
- It's not my fault.

332
00:29:55,412 --> 00:29:55,978
Dad.

333
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,598
Kyung-min!

334
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:03,118
Why is it coming here?
Do you know that dog?

335
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:09,154
Run!

336
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:22,516
Miran!

337
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:27,134
Yura!

338
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,805
Run, Miran.

339
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:42,992
Down!

340
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:34,580
Step on it!

341
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,367
Get in, in.

342
00:31:42,005 --> 00:31:44,448
Hurry!

343
00:31:56,138 --> 00:31:57,180
Hey!

344
00:31:58,102 --> 00:32:00,142
Dad, that's the guy from earlier.

345
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:05,972
The bastard left me here to die.
Goddamn murderer.

346
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:08,859
What are you doing? We can take him.

347
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,603
What are you doing?

348
00:32:20,077 --> 00:32:21,944
We can take him, Dad.

349
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:30,039
You okay, Jodie? I'm sorry.

350
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:32,596
We can live. We'll live.

351
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:43,687
Let's go!

352
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,026
Mister!

353
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:52,136
Driver.

354
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:16,745
$64.40! You drove
right past us, murderer.

355
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,224
How can you step on the gas
when you see a person in danger?

356
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:23,743
You better step on it
now. Yeah, step on it.

357
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,071
Harder!

358
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,475
Shit! Fire, fire!

359
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:43,375
Jodie, go bite that man.

360
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,915
Hey, are you driving
with your eyes closed?

361
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:51,690
Shit, this man's dead.
Move the car now.

362
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,486
Ugh, blood. Bastard.

363
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:04,274
Jodie.

364
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:08,502
Papa's gonna die out here.

365
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:15,171
Who'll take care of you after I'm gone?

366
00:34:17,845 --> 00:34:19,147
Damn it.

367
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:25,034
You scared me, asshole.

368
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:27,527
Can anyone hear me? Please respond.

369
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:33,178
Can anyone hear me?

370
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,570
What the hell is that?

371
00:34:38,365 --> 00:34:40,519
What's that? On its snout?

372
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,591
Who jammed the signal?

373
00:34:45,932 --> 00:34:47,668
It was a military decision.

374
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:50,106
What? When is the fog likely to clear?

375
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:51,776
No idea until sunrise.

376
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,969
No rescue chopper can
be dispatched until then.

377
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:55,991
And a military cargo has crashed.

378
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:57,666
And access from the sea?

379
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,794
Can't you get civilian boats
underneath the bridge?

380
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:05,200
The bridge is 70m above sea level.

381
00:35:05,232 --> 00:35:08,657
Plus, it's low tide so
ships just can't approach.

382
00:35:09,227 --> 00:35:10,225
Geez.

383
00:35:10,421 --> 00:35:12,245
What's up with the dogs?

384
00:35:12,594 --> 00:35:13,592
There he comes.

385
00:35:13,593 --> 00:35:16,373
- I'll debrief you in a moment.
- Any update on the rescue?

386
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:18,730
Is it true there's a risk the
bridge might collapse?

387
00:35:18,755 --> 00:35:20,231
Why is the network blocked?

388
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:22,218
Do you have an estimate of casualties?

389
00:35:22,243 --> 00:35:27,109
We're employing all means
possible in order to save lives.

390
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,849
If it gets inside, we're all dead meat.

391
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:47,655
Back off the car now.

392
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,399
Open your mouth again,
and I'll open the trunk.

393
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:52,945
I swear to God.

394
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,402
Go on then, murderer!
Go ahead and murder me.

395
00:35:55,427 --> 00:35:56,425
- I'll do it.
- Go on.

396
00:35:56,488 --> 00:36:00,387
Because if you don't open
it, I'll kill you myself.

397
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:06,185
- Please, don't open it. I beg you.
- It's okay... It's okay...

398
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,859
Please, don't open the trunk.

399
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:09,333
Wake him up.

400
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,151
Excuse me?

401
00:36:11,176 --> 00:36:12,917
That doctor next to you. Wake him up!

402
00:36:12,942 --> 00:36:14,810
Yes, I'll do my best, sir. Hey!

403
00:36:16,935 --> 00:36:19,540
Man, you better wake up.

404
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:22,498
Come on, we're here.

405
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:26,917
Shouldn't we help those people?

406
00:36:26,942 --> 00:36:29,846
Let's not be rash. They might be dead.

407
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:32,607
We won't know that unless we check.

408
00:36:32,632 --> 00:36:35,463
She's right. They're alive.

409
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:36,338
Right?

410
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,936
The dogs are lingering around.

411
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:44,579
Do you know how many people
were killed by your mad dogs?

412
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:50,679
I developed rescue dogs
that respond to human voices.

413
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:53,721
But the military made me
reprogram them for hunting.

414
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:56,371
For what purpose? Why?

415
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:59,657
The U.S. and European countries
commissioned us

416
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:01,651
to develop killer canines
to hunt terrorists.

417
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,846
They're trained to recognize any
target's voice and attack them.

418
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:10,230
But the project was scrapped
due to serious issues.

419
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:12,214
Then, what are they
doing on the bridge?

420
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:14,813
We were disposing of
the failed samples today.

421
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,848
But they got loose
during transportation.

422
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:23,761
Who's in charge of the program?

423
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:29,177
I'm only a researcher. I only
did what was requested.

424
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:30,990
I'm not responsible.

425
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:35,113
You made them go mad? Fucking psychos!

426
00:37:35,138 --> 00:37:37,180
If a dog goes mad, it's on the owner,

427
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:38,550
Cut out the dog crap.

428
00:37:39,613 --> 00:37:41,567
Can I have some water, please?

429
00:37:41,857 --> 00:37:44,115
Please respond. Can anyone hear me?

430
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,334
I'm Jung-won Cha,
Department of Security.

431
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:51,582
Where are you?

432
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:53,929
You okay, man?

433
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,380
We're okay for now.

434
00:37:57,289 --> 00:38:00,168
We're near the main tower.
There's a tanker in front of us.

435
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:03,514
Get out of there right now.
It's carrying toxic gas.

436
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,565
The rescue team is getting ready.

437
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:10,206
Listen. Have you heard
of the Silence Project?

438
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:11,559
Yes, just now.

439
00:38:12,641 --> 00:38:15,116
I'm with the researcher
who developed the project.

440
00:38:15,141 --> 00:38:17,877
Apparently, it's some
fucked-up fantasy scenario.

441
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:21,368
Once I get out, we can take down

442
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:26,040
any related military personnel and
that damn Defense Minister, too.

443
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:30,106
I have the key witness statement.
If it doesn't get tracked back to us,

444
00:38:30,994 --> 00:38:32,992
it'll all go well for us.

445
00:38:32,993 --> 00:38:34,686
Listen to me carefully.

446
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,164
This is connected to us.

447
00:38:39,189 --> 00:38:41,160
The project was approved
by the Blue House

448
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:43,890
in the early days after taking office.

449
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:49,509
- What?
- Do you understand what I'm saying?

450
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:56,387
You okay, man? Jung-won!

451
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,531
Smoke's getting in.

452
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:03,122
Come here, Jodie.

453
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,240
- They're telling us to get on.
- You're right.

454
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:13,437
Cover your mouth, Kyung-min.

455
00:39:19,502 --> 00:39:21,322
No matter what, don't breathe.

456
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:23,676
We'll run on three. Run
back to the bus, okay,

457
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:27,611
I'm depending on you
to open the trunk, sir.

458
00:39:29,593 --> 00:39:31,547
Hold your breath, Jodie.

459
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:35,314
One... Dammit!

460
00:39:35,315 --> 00:39:36,649
Dammit, who ran out first?

461
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,793
- Open the trunk, hurry!
- Get out, Kyung-min.

462
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:46,306
Let's go.

463
00:39:47,697 --> 00:39:49,391
- Dad!
- Go on, baby!

464
00:39:49,392 --> 00:39:51,269
Go. Run!

465
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:56,027
Sir, you need to dispatch
SWAT, not a rescue team.

466
00:39:56,756 --> 00:39:59,109
When they get here,
take out the dogs first.

467
00:39:59,393 --> 00:40:01,019
Kill all of them. Do you understand?

468
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:03,663
If the press ask about the situation...

469
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:06,573
Dad!

470
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:09,484
Maintain communication failure.

471
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:11,772
Stick to a rabid dog story,
not trained military dogs.

472
00:40:17,946 --> 00:40:19,216
I hear you, so please,

473
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:21,091
just get out of there,
the bridge will collapse.

474
00:40:21,116 --> 00:40:25,578
If you just learned about this,
we can easily make it go away.

475
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:27,085
Dad! Hurry!

476
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,370
I'll call you back.

477
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:31,938
Get inside. Hurry.

478
00:41:11,491 --> 00:41:13,706
The bridge's going to collapse.

479
00:41:57,729 --> 00:41:58,641
I'm...

480
00:42:00,293 --> 00:42:02,933
Jung-won Cha, Department
of Security at the Blue House.

481
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:07,504
I'm sure you must be shocked
from this unexpected disaster.

482
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,390
The rescue effort is hampered
due to the thick fog.

483
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:13,832
However, I made contact
with the authorities

484
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,013
who are organizing a response team.

485
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,604
Thank God. We're saved.

486
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:23,472
If you follow my instructions,
we'll all be rescued safely.

487
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:25,223
Thank God.

488
00:42:25,248 --> 00:42:28,334
What's wrong with the phones?
Why is there no network?

489
00:42:30,032 --> 00:42:32,985
The connection's down
due to the explosion.

490
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,831
The response team is working
on getting the network back up.

491
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:41,472
What about those dogs attacking people?

492
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:42,936
Well...

493
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,951
Based on the information I have,

494
00:42:47,952 --> 00:42:52,513
there was an outbreak of rabies
in the military canine unit.

495
00:42:52,514 --> 00:42:56,120
The infected dogs were
ordered to be disposed of,

496
00:42:57,582 --> 00:43:02,360
but escaped due to the crash
while being transferred.

497
00:43:02,616 --> 00:43:03,614
Rabies?

498
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:07,799
If your loved ones were
affected by this atrocity...

499
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,737
I extend my sincerest condolences.

500
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:17,386
The dogs looked fine at first.

501
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:18,377
He's right.

502
00:43:18,607 --> 00:43:22,529
Then they suddenly flipped,
attacking at random like crazy.

503
00:43:22,923 --> 00:43:28,570
What dog has "mad dog"
written on its forehead.

504
00:43:29,546 --> 00:43:33,041
They seem normal at first
wandering around the neighborhood

505
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:35,335
until they bite you out of the blue.

506
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:38,809
That's why you call them mad.

507
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:40,587
Isn't that right?

508
00:43:41,461 --> 00:43:42,591
Is it?

509
00:43:45,028 --> 00:43:49,067
When is the rescue team coming anyway?

510
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,050
These are man-killing dogs.

511
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,483
Shoot on sight.

512
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,098
What's this?

513
00:44:19,607 --> 00:44:22,300
Somebody left behind a good bottle.

514
00:44:30,013 --> 00:44:34,672
Kyung-min, this is something
no one benefits from knowing.

515
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,312
Hey. Can I have a word?

516
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:51,909
Well. Your manner's changed.

517
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:54,018
Cut the crap.

518
00:44:54,043 --> 00:44:57,841
You're cooking some scam to fool
everyone but I won't play along.

519
00:44:57,866 --> 00:44:59,238
I heard everything in the car.

520
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:05,891
How much did I owe you?

521
00:45:05,892 --> 00:45:09,410
$64.40. Asshole.

522
00:45:09,411 --> 00:45:13,321
I'll make sure you get a
patriot's medal, class 1.

523
00:45:13,365 --> 00:45:16,010
A patriot's what?
What the hell is that?

524
00:45:16,035 --> 00:45:18,502
- It's a civilian award.
- An award, my ass.

525
00:45:18,527 --> 00:45:23,783
It's awarded in recognition of
outstanding bravery in saving lives.

526
00:45:24,982 --> 00:45:27,444
The reward is at least $100,000.

527
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:29,761
You bastard, I may
have no connections...

528
00:45:29,786 --> 00:45:32,077
If you work with me, I
could get you even more.

529
00:45:33,024 --> 00:45:34,110
Listen.

530
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:37,502
Get out alive, mouth shut,
and the reward's yours.

531
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:40,323
Maybe buy that gas station and
live comfortably ever after.

532
00:45:40,348 --> 00:45:43,700
Or get torn to pieces by mad
dogs and turned into food.

533
00:45:45,606 --> 00:45:46,821
It's your call.

534
00:46:01,394 --> 00:46:03,565
We arrived at the collapsed bridge.

535
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:05,129
Team 1 is going in.

536
00:46:11,006 --> 00:46:13,256
Get ready for a presser as
soon as they're rescued.

537
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:14,383
Yes, sir.

538
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,615
- Help's coming.
- Where?

539
00:46:29,462 --> 00:46:30,243
That's a relief.

540
00:46:30,782 --> 00:46:31,259
What about the dogs?

541
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:35,454
We searched the perimeter
on arrival but didn't see any.

542
00:46:36,158 --> 00:46:37,765
Looks like they've run away.

543
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:39,625
Please, out of the bus.

544
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:41,753
Let's go. Come on.

545
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:42,386
Wait.

546
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:44,450
Hold up.

547
00:46:49,162 --> 00:46:52,376
We agreed to take out the
dogs before coming for us.

548
00:46:52,705 --> 00:46:56,975
But they can't see them. We'll
evacuate the survivors first.

549
00:46:57,269 --> 00:46:59,695
The SWAT team's heavily
armed so it'll be safe.

550
00:46:59,748 --> 00:47:02,267
We estimate 30 minutes
to reach the edge.

551
00:47:07,782 --> 00:47:09,631
Move to the edge behind the bus.

552
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:10,911
Come this way.

553
00:47:11,864 --> 00:47:12,451
Aren't you coming with us?

554
00:47:14,503 --> 00:47:15,177
Get off.

555
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,775
Just leave me here. I beg you.

556
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:19,859
I said get off.

557
00:47:20,565 --> 00:47:24,299
The dogs... they didn't
run off. They're hiding.

558
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:25,880
Cut the bullshit and get
out. You're my witness.

559
00:47:25,905 --> 00:47:30,925
No... no! If we leave, we'll all die.

560
00:47:54,764 --> 00:47:57,761
Geez! Don't touch me.

561
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,774
Get up on your feet, bastard.

562
00:48:23,983 --> 00:48:26,198
You're really a handful.

563
00:48:26,324 --> 00:48:28,705
Can't even walk straight?

564
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,475
They never stop hunting the target.

565
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,716
What did you say?

566
00:48:32,257 --> 00:48:34,600
- They never lose their target.
- What?

567
00:48:34,714 --> 00:48:37,873
Bring me my laptop. We have to find it.

568
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:41,546
Hey, Blue House. The
Doc has lost his marbles.

569
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,501
- Find my laptop... my laptop.
- What laptop?

570
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,397
Resume moving. Swiftly.

571
00:48:55,939 --> 00:48:58,568
What's the matter, Doc?

572
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,277
Wasn't it you?

573
00:49:04,888 --> 00:49:06,886
Yura, I have goosebumps.

574
00:49:07,325 --> 00:49:09,365
- Be quiet for a moment.
- Check the rear.

575
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:10,659
Yes, sir.

576
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,326
All clear, sir.

577
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:36,251
Check. Keep moving.

578
00:49:49,723 --> 00:49:50,256
Check!

579
00:49:53,939 --> 00:49:55,197
Secure the evacuees' safety.

580
00:49:57,205 --> 00:49:58,002
Dammit.

581
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:12,412
Infiltration team.

582
00:50:13,525 --> 00:50:14,264
Come in!

583
00:50:15,873 --> 00:50:16,741
What's going on?

584
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,719
What is that?

585
00:50:18,764 --> 00:50:19,675
Answer me.

586
00:50:22,283 --> 00:50:24,845
Guard the perimeter.
Permission to fire at will.

587
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:56,247
Die!

588
00:50:59,343 --> 00:51:00,942
My leg, my leg!

589
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:04,928
Miran.

590
00:51:20,846 --> 00:51:21,853
Bori?

591
00:51:24,235 --> 00:51:26,450
Is that you, Bori?

592
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:27,015
Honey.

593
00:51:27,016 --> 00:51:27,884
Ma'am!

594
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:29,942
Honey, no. No!

595
00:51:32,336 --> 00:51:33,262
Ma'am!

596
00:52:11,621 --> 00:52:12,466
Kyung-min!

597
00:52:22,502 --> 00:52:24,005
Don't look at me!

598
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:31,835
Dad...

599
00:52:32,046 --> 00:52:32,913
Kyung-min!

600
00:52:34,204 --> 00:52:36,563
Jodie! Shush, be quiet.

601
00:52:41,937 --> 00:52:42,891
Let me go!

602
00:52:43,153 --> 00:52:44,977
- No, Kyung-min.
- Mom's book's in here.

603
00:52:45,002 --> 00:52:46,030
Let go of the bag.

604
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,165
No.

605
00:52:52,986 --> 00:52:54,375
Get out of here.

606
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,944
Let's go.

607
00:53:07,788 --> 00:53:08,911
Come on, Dad.

608
00:53:13,222 --> 00:53:18,825
The government is taking all possible
measures to rescue those stranded...

609
00:53:18,872 --> 00:53:19,914
Yes, sir.

610
00:53:21,762 --> 00:53:24,287
No one from the SWAT
teams is responding.

611
00:53:32,094 --> 00:53:35,917
The press is waiting outside.

612
00:53:41,236 --> 00:53:42,191
Get in.

613
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:51,796
You okay, Dad? You're bleeding...

614
00:53:51,797 --> 00:53:53,617
- I'm alright, honey.
- You're bleeding.

615
00:53:53,642 --> 00:53:55,291
Don't worry about it.

616
00:54:03,165 --> 00:54:03,796
The radio!

617
00:54:05,026 --> 00:54:08,947
I'm really sorry. I have
to go back for the radio.

618
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:10,731
We can't escape without that.

619
00:54:10,756 --> 00:54:13,171
No, I won't let you.

620
00:54:14,598 --> 00:54:18,202
You saw how the bridge was collapsing.

621
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,832
Stay here. Dad will be right back.

622
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,839
The book...

623
00:55:12,972 --> 00:55:17,028
Across the sky these
pretty little toes paddle.

624
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:21,396
Everything coming together
to make my beautiful baby.

625
00:55:21,744 --> 00:55:22,932
Your books have sold out.

626
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:25,317
Really? Already?

627
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:30,933
Yeah, Dad's bought 300 copies,
so they ran out in the bookstores.

628
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:34,701
What? You bought them all, then?

629
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:37,950
Jung-won! You come here, honey.

630
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:46,097
This concludes a book reading session
by the author of "Knock Knock Knock."

631
00:55:46,406 --> 00:55:50,577
Can you turn that down?
Better yet, take it outside.

632
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:56,559
I'm trying to die in peace
here, and you're not helping.

633
00:55:57,311 --> 00:55:59,959
So much drama in your family.

634
00:56:10,384 --> 00:56:13,715
Don't come up. I want to be left alone.

635
00:56:16,368 --> 00:56:18,745
Geez, you scared me.

636
00:56:20,037 --> 00:56:22,642
You're still alive.

637
00:56:24,855 --> 00:56:27,364
You said the government would save us.

638
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,427
Look where we ended up.

639
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:31,985
Can you pipe down?

640
00:56:32,404 --> 00:56:35,141
Those dogs... they're trained, right?

641
00:56:35,498 --> 00:56:38,886
I told them everything.
About the medal and the lying.

642
00:56:40,502 --> 00:56:43,632
Anyway, the dogs took
the guns off dead soldiers.

643
00:56:43,913 --> 00:56:44,830
Terrible.

644
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,507
Oh God.

645
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:51,747
I'm sorry.

646
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,226
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

647
00:56:58,532 --> 00:57:02,201
- It's okay...
- It hurts!

648
00:57:02,943 --> 00:57:04,395
Okay, so now what?

649
00:57:06,585 --> 00:57:07,276
We'll get out of here.

650
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,058
No matter what.

651
00:57:10,403 --> 00:57:12,386
- What then?
- Tell us something we don't know.

652
00:57:15,707 --> 00:57:18,218
How am I supposed
to walk? I've been shot.

653
00:57:21,694 --> 00:57:23,689
Why are you licking the gasoline?

654
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:39,140
Do you still believe your
dad will come back safely?

655
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:48,845
We're all gonna die here.
You, me, and your dad too.

656
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,445
Over there.

657
00:57:57,219 --> 00:57:58,626
Do you see that dog there?

658
00:58:04,257 --> 00:58:05,486
That's Echo 9.

659
00:58:08,807 --> 00:58:09,637
E9...

660
00:58:11,569 --> 00:58:12,766
Is that the boss?

661
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:15,400
Not the boss.

662
00:58:17,964 --> 00:58:20,917
But all of the dogs out there

663
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:23,861
were cloned from her.

664
00:58:28,902 --> 00:58:33,312
It makes her their mother.

665
00:58:34,254 --> 00:58:35,614
In order...

666
00:58:35,869 --> 00:58:39,550
to make the dogs more brutal,

667
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:43,188
they killed so many of
her puppies in front of her.

668
00:58:46,232 --> 00:58:52,183
So what she's doing now,

669
00:58:53,621 --> 00:58:58,674
it's not hunting. It's revenge.

670
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,621
She's taking revenge

671
00:59:05,526 --> 00:59:07,699
for her murdered babies.

672
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:35,997
Come in, Control. Sir?

673
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:40,139
Is that you, Jung-won?

674
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:42,827
Can you see us?

675
00:59:47,157 --> 00:59:48,894
You shot that flare, right?

676
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:52,322
We're starting to move toward Seoul.

677
00:59:52,544 --> 00:59:57,000
No, that way's cut off by toxic gas.
You have to go the other way.

678
00:59:57,541 --> 01:00:01,385
SWAT teams are on standby
at the break in the bridge.

679
01:00:01,737 --> 01:00:06,880
Then, we'll find the
nearest bus to reach them.

680
01:00:06,905 --> 01:00:09,017
We'll travel together on a bus.

681
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:13,870
Please have snipers
ready to take out the dogs.

682
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:15,624
We can't use the snipers.

683
01:00:15,657 --> 01:00:19,581
Press and TV cameras will be nearby...

684
01:00:19,606 --> 01:00:22,863
Collect the survivors and get out.
We'll take care of the dogs later.

685
01:00:22,888 --> 01:00:24,929
No. They know everything.

686
01:00:26,134 --> 01:00:27,132
What?

687
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:31,299
Everyone here knows
about the Silence Project.

688
01:00:31,656 --> 01:00:32,480
We can't cover it up anymore.

689
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:35,947
I will take them out of here first.

690
01:00:45,932 --> 01:00:46,870
It's Dad.

691
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:48,522
Dad...

692
01:00:48,523 --> 01:00:51,129
We need to open the door.

693
01:00:51,464 --> 01:00:54,312
- How do you open this door?
- Don't.

694
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,759
How do you open it?

695
01:00:56,784 --> 01:00:59,293
I said don't. Don't you
see the dogs outside?

696
01:01:05,636 --> 01:01:06,677
Geez!

697
01:01:07,421 --> 01:01:09,090
Damn... they are in front of the bus.

698
01:01:09,115 --> 01:01:11,156
It's because of him?

699
01:01:11,984 --> 01:01:13,734
- Who?
- Him.

700
01:01:14,373 --> 01:01:15,459
- What is he doing?
- Don't move!

701
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,564
Kyung-min! Let her go, you bastard.

702
01:01:17,589 --> 01:01:18,147
Dad!

703
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:19,893
Go away!

704
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,610
Let her go.

705
01:01:23,566 --> 01:01:25,179
- Dad!
- Kyung-min.

706
01:01:25,204 --> 01:01:26,984
Go. Hurry.

707
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,723
- Dad!
- Open this up, bastard.

708
01:01:30,365 --> 01:01:31,407
Kyung-min.

709
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:35,387
The fire's dying out. Open the door.

710
01:01:35,412 --> 01:01:36,789
Ma'am, Ma'am!

711
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:37,671
No!

712
01:01:40,606 --> 01:01:42,083
Go away.

713
01:01:42,617 --> 01:01:43,484
Go! Go!

714
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,717
- Ma'am? Ma'am!
- No, no!

715
01:01:49,253 --> 01:01:51,142
Ma'am!

716
01:01:55,232 --> 01:01:56,751
Go away, you dirty dogs.

717
01:01:58,635 --> 01:01:59,633
Dad!

718
01:02:04,832 --> 01:02:07,698
Ew, hot. Don't get any closer.

719
01:02:08,544 --> 01:02:09,542
Hurry.

720
01:02:17,825 --> 01:02:18,965
Open up!

721
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,133
Everyone, close your eyes.

722
01:02:34,589 --> 01:02:35,631
Dad!

723
01:02:36,093 --> 01:02:37,369
Hurry up!

724
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,850
Hurry.

725
01:02:49,498 --> 01:02:51,970
Hey, look at me! Look at Papa.

726
01:02:55,059 --> 01:02:57,664
I'm beating a man, and
I don't feel bad one bit.

727
01:02:57,665 --> 01:03:02,139
Does it hurt? Do you
feel pain, psychopath?

728
01:03:04,111 --> 01:03:06,049
You okay, baby?

729
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:09,694
- Are you okay, Dad?
- I'm sorry.

730
01:03:13,009 --> 01:03:14,745
Oh, no...

731
01:03:16,748 --> 01:03:18,717
- There's no key.
- What?

732
01:03:19,418 --> 01:03:21,372
Of all the vehicles,

733
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,620
you had to pick the one with no key?

734
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,512
But you have one.

735
01:03:28,523 --> 01:03:29,044
The master key.

736
01:03:32,812 --> 01:03:36,069
Okay, but you can't hold
this against me later.

737
01:03:36,094 --> 01:03:40,252
If you do, I'll kill you.

738
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,757
- It worked.
- Yes, yes, yes!

739
01:03:49,713 --> 01:03:51,790
Back it up towards the airport.

740
01:03:52,884 --> 01:03:54,274
There's a bus moving.

741
01:04:01,047 --> 01:04:05,369
Sir, I asked the military for snipers.

742
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,886
The Head of Military
Intelligence is outside.

743
01:04:11,413 --> 01:04:15,442
The authorities have canceled
the Secretary of Security's briefing

744
01:04:15,467 --> 01:04:20,714
to discuss the bridge collapse and
the subsequent rescue efforts.

745
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:26,472
All eyes on him how this going to do
for his candidacy for President.

746
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,036
Are you really going to
carry out the rescue?

747
01:04:31,989 --> 01:04:34,562
You have two scenarios:

748
01:04:35,402 --> 01:04:42,092
First, the tragic loss of lives due to
the unexpected collapse of the bridge.

749
01:04:42,934 --> 01:04:50,411
Second, a civilian massacre by attack dogs
authorized by the leading presidential candidate.

750
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,180
The Minister will let you do choose.

751
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,552
Control, we're 10m out
from where the bridge ends.

752
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,002
Control center?

753
01:05:30,877 --> 01:05:33,324
Look. The dogs were waiting for us.

754
01:05:37,556 --> 01:05:39,998
Don't worry. There
are snipers on standby.

755
01:05:43,127 --> 01:05:44,295
Ma'am...

756
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:48,436
Give it a moment. We'll
get out of here soon.

757
01:05:50,164 --> 01:05:53,291
Control, we're ready to
leave. You may shoot.

758
01:05:58,813 --> 01:06:01,098
Do you read me?

759
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,344
Control!

760
01:06:11,345 --> 01:06:13,128
Why aren't they answering?

761
01:06:13,535 --> 01:06:14,886
The bridge will collapse soon.

762
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:17,888
Do something or we're dead.

763
01:06:20,816 --> 01:06:23,925
We shouldn't have followed you here.

764
01:06:26,696 --> 01:06:28,915
You're going to lure them out.

765
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,632
You created this situation.

766
01:06:32,177 --> 01:06:37,018
When this jerk lures the dogs away,
you break the back window to get out.

767
01:06:37,043 --> 01:06:38,606
- I'm just a researcher.
- Come on!

768
01:06:38,631 --> 01:06:41,180
I did as I was told...
I followed orders.

769
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:43,549
Don't do it, Dad. Please!

770
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:48,682
We should set a trap instead.

771
01:07:19,473 --> 01:07:20,732
Honey.

772
01:08:00,513 --> 01:08:03,108
They're all in. Pull.

773
01:08:03,893 --> 01:08:05,265
Everyone, focus.

774
01:08:06,202 --> 01:08:07,393
On three...

775
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:19,655
- Get out, Miran. Come on.
- Get out, Kyung-min.

776
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,951
Come on! Go, go, go!

777
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:36,792
We have to go now.

778
01:08:38,268 --> 01:08:42,098
I can't leave her here.

779
01:08:42,123 --> 01:08:43,513
You have to, sir.

780
01:08:44,735 --> 01:08:48,080
I beg you. Just go.

781
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:55,589
- I'll hold it. You go.
- No... You go.

782
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,767
Let it go. Come on!

783
01:08:59,101 --> 01:08:59,776
Sir!

784
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:03,000
- What the... Hell, no!
- Sir!

785
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:04,550
Get out of there.

786
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:07,791
- Come on, Blue House!
- Let me go.

787
01:09:10,283 --> 01:09:13,068
No! Let me go.

788
01:09:28,694 --> 01:09:30,172
Sir...

789
01:09:30,173 --> 01:09:33,839
- Sir!
- Let it go, man.

790
01:09:34,734 --> 01:09:36,879
Let it go.

791
01:09:37,036 --> 01:09:40,469
If any of those dogs
get out, we're all dead.

792
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:43,206
All of us, including your daughter!

793
01:10:04,524 --> 01:10:09,040
You fucking bureaucrat!
Where's our rescue?

794
01:10:10,491 --> 01:10:12,145
The rescue isn't here.

795
01:10:14,686 --> 01:10:16,510
They are not here.

796
01:10:17,054 --> 01:10:18,923
- Want another smack?
- There's no one.

797
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:22,942
- What? It's just the damn fog.
- They're not here.

798
01:10:22,967 --> 01:10:24,630
Look over there.

799
01:10:29,107 --> 01:10:30,253
They're really not here.

800
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:32,136
- No?
- You said to come here?

801
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,539
How can we go up there?

802
01:10:41,308 --> 01:10:42,403
What to do...

803
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:47,598
- My leg is hurt.
- Hey, parachute kid.

804
01:10:48,048 --> 01:10:52,087
You do know who your
dad's been talking to?

805
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:59,031
Hyun-baek Chung... Hyun-baek Chung...

806
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:02,147
Good old uncle Hyun-baek...

807
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:10,227
He's the one that started
this whole Silence Project.

808
01:11:11,053 --> 01:11:14,336
The project was approved by him when
he was on the Defense Commission.

809
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,090
That must have earned him
his seat at the Blue House.

810
01:11:20,054 --> 01:11:21,367
Did you meet him there?

811
01:11:22,715 --> 01:11:24,426
You had no idea.

812
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:26,325
Sir...

813
01:11:30,338 --> 01:11:31,826
Are you the one

814
01:11:33,824 --> 01:11:35,456
who approved this project?

815
01:11:39,097 --> 01:11:40,739
Is that why you pulled
the rescuers out?

816
01:11:43,377 --> 01:11:44,399
To cover it up?

817
01:11:47,913 --> 01:11:49,232
We are still out here.

818
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:02,503
Agreed...

819
01:12:05,383 --> 01:12:07,250
I would've done the same if I were you.

820
01:12:08,843 --> 01:12:11,188
The bridge will collapse any minute.

821
01:12:12,302 --> 01:12:15,211
The dogs you want to
bury are on that bridge.

822
01:12:17,349 --> 01:12:19,563
What would benefit you the most?

823
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:25,456
So you reached a
logical political decision.

824
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:29,058
After long consideration. I understand.

825
01:12:37,826 --> 01:12:39,552
Still, if you were here...

826
01:12:45,012 --> 01:12:47,835
and saw what happened, then
hell, you couldn't do this.

827
01:13:06,617 --> 01:13:07,571
Listen.

828
01:13:07,932 --> 01:13:12,451
We're heading to Seoul, which
you say is so dangerous

829
01:13:12,686 --> 01:13:13,962
and full of toxic gas.

830
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:15,665
It'll be one of two things.

831
01:13:16,023 --> 01:13:20,670
Either the bridge will collapse
or the toxic gas will get us.

832
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,127
I just ask for one thing.

833
01:13:23,543 --> 01:13:26,283
If you sent medics and the press
off because of the collapse,

834
01:13:26,308 --> 01:13:28,731
get them back on standby.

835
01:13:29,148 --> 01:13:30,645
Or I'll make you regret it.

836
01:13:33,164 --> 01:13:35,465
Hey, wrecker! That's your truck, right?

837
01:13:35,802 --> 01:13:36,843
Let's go.

838
01:13:37,248 --> 01:13:39,463
I would go with you

839
01:13:39,599 --> 01:13:43,492
but I don't have the key.
My keys are on that bus.

840
01:13:49,641 --> 01:13:52,110
The damn master key...

841
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:53,501
This is where the cage was before.

842
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,081
I dropped my laptop around here,

843
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:59,802
It has to be here somewhere.

844
01:14:00,668 --> 01:14:03,488
I can try something with
that. Do you hear me?

845
01:14:04,264 --> 01:14:05,426
My laptop.

846
01:14:23,995 --> 01:14:26,775
I found it. It's here.

847
01:14:31,937 --> 01:14:33,403
Oh, poor Captain Kang...

848
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:36,867
So you'll lure the dogs into
the cage using your laptop.

849
01:14:36,968 --> 01:14:40,153
Then I retrieve my keys, tow
the cage with my wrecker

850
01:14:40,178 --> 01:14:43,393
and drive through that burning inferno.

851
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:47,564
- Who's going into the cage?
- I will.

852
01:14:47,912 --> 01:14:50,127
I'm impressed, Blue House.

853
01:14:50,805 --> 01:14:52,456
But what if the plan fails?

854
01:14:53,191 --> 01:14:55,537
It won't, or we'll all die.

855
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:59,286
Yeah, he's not convinced
either. I don't trust him.

856
01:14:59,831 --> 01:15:03,393
You trust him because you have
to, not because he's worthy of it.

857
01:15:06,342 --> 01:15:08,280
I trust you. So drive properly.

858
01:15:08,657 --> 01:15:11,005
Man, even my mom has never said that.

859
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,668
If you fail, you're making
your daughter an orphan.

860
01:15:14,693 --> 01:15:16,813
You must know that.

861
01:15:20,931 --> 01:15:23,276
Better than being a father
that lost his little girl.

862
01:15:27,464 --> 01:15:28,071
Done.

863
01:15:30,662 --> 01:15:31,661
Okay.

864
01:15:32,705 --> 01:15:33,623
Okay, what?

865
01:15:39,157 --> 01:15:40,199
Get moving.

866
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:44,414
Dad.

867
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,670
I've been thinking about it...

868
01:15:48,485 --> 01:15:50,108
I don't want to study abroad.

869
01:15:52,277 --> 01:15:54,273
Do you have something to read?

870
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:58,307
You must keep talking even
after the target's reconfigured.

871
01:15:58,424 --> 01:16:00,335
- Alert me when you're ready.
- Okay.

872
01:16:03,883 --> 01:16:04,577
Kyung-min.

873
01:16:06,217 --> 01:16:08,417
Give me that book. I need
to read something out loud.

874
01:16:23,665 --> 01:16:27,083
You know it's the last copy.
You have to give it back to me.

875
01:16:48,554 --> 01:16:50,291
It won't snap in one swing?

876
01:16:51,077 --> 01:16:56,594
I'm sorry, Yura, for making
you tee off in a place like this.

877
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:57,788
Distance?

878
01:16:59,029 --> 01:17:03,250
80 yards. No wind.

879
01:17:04,802 --> 01:17:08,146
How come I get the most dangerous task?

880
01:17:10,595 --> 01:17:14,212
If only I double-checked the passport.

881
01:17:14,627 --> 01:17:17,494
Stop whining, because
it's not your fault.

882
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:19,780
What?

883
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:22,872
I knew my passport had expired.

884
01:17:23,446 --> 01:17:27,616
I didn't say anything. I
was too afraid too play.

885
01:17:29,219 --> 01:17:31,086
Thus, it's not your fault.

886
01:17:34,294 --> 01:17:36,675
Hey! Hit it.

887
01:17:36,676 --> 01:17:37,845
We haven't got all day.

888
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:40,823
Change the club.

889
01:17:42,414 --> 01:17:43,734
Let's go with a utility.

890
01:17:43,735 --> 01:17:46,471
A utility can easily
cover that distance.

891
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,226
From now on, no one
except the target speaks.

892
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:57,549
Okay.

893
01:17:57,909 --> 01:17:58,734
Here we go.

894
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,719
Three, two,

895
01:18:10,361 --> 01:18:10,814
one.

896
01:18:15,318 --> 01:18:17,981
A black cave house behind the bushes.

897
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:27,090
There's someone's sleeping here.

898
01:18:27,886 --> 01:18:29,236
Give her a signal.

899
01:18:38,309 --> 01:18:39,698
Good shot.

900
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:44,623
All of these come together...

901
01:18:45,424 --> 01:18:46,857
Whoa... the bridge is rocking.

902
01:18:48,259 --> 01:18:49,301
Dammit.

903
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:54,938
We're running out of time.

904
01:18:55,075 --> 01:18:56,028
Toss me the ball.

905
01:19:02,903 --> 01:19:03,772
Almost there.

906
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:06,773
They're coming out.

907
01:19:20,405 --> 01:19:23,548
Such pretty baby eyes
and the soft downy hair.

908
01:19:26,696 --> 01:19:28,451
You did it! Awesome.

909
01:19:56,353 --> 01:19:57,742
Where's the key?

910
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,790
No, Yura. You can't get him off.

911
01:20:56,176 --> 01:20:58,440
Say something, Blue House. You okay?

912
01:20:58,477 --> 01:21:01,187
Hang in there. We're on our way to you.

913
01:21:01,802 --> 01:21:03,191
No, wrecker. Don't come.

914
01:21:03,216 --> 01:21:05,605
Don't come any closer. Stop.

915
01:21:08,676 --> 01:21:09,892
- Hey, kid.
- Dad?

916
01:21:09,917 --> 01:21:13,836
Where are you going? No.

917
01:21:14,901 --> 01:21:16,464
Come back. Hurry.

918
01:21:19,631 --> 01:21:22,876
What do we do? Shit! Blue House.

919
01:21:23,901 --> 01:21:25,355
Wrecker, can you hear me?

920
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:33,974
- Dad!
- No...

921
01:21:34,373 --> 01:21:38,152
Kyung-min! Are you listening?

922
01:21:39,859 --> 01:21:42,508
With your truck weight on
top this bridge will break.

923
01:21:43,947 --> 01:21:45,361
Don't worry about me.

924
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:47,848
Just go by yourself.

925
01:22:05,022 --> 01:22:07,523
Sorry for not being there with you...
- Your mom & your wife

926
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:08,669
I'm sorry, too.

927
01:22:12,835 --> 01:22:13,659
Dad.

928
01:22:16,116 --> 01:22:16,983
Dad!

929
01:22:18,019 --> 01:22:19,204
What the hell... Kyung-min?

930
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:20,683
Kyung-min.

931
01:22:28,206 --> 01:22:29,380
Kyung-min!

932
01:22:32,884 --> 01:22:33,839
Dad!

933
01:22:39,676 --> 01:22:40,209
Dad!

934
01:22:40,234 --> 01:22:41,536
Don't move, honey.

935
01:22:46,887 --> 01:22:48,407
Shit! Don't look there.

936
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:52,815
Go back to the truck! Now!
Listen to your dad for once.

937
01:22:55,255 --> 01:22:56,344
Kyung-min!

938
01:22:58,418 --> 01:23:01,149
Go back to the truck!
Please do as I say.

939
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:12,338
- Dad!
- Kyung-min.

940
01:23:24,826 --> 01:23:25,998
Kyung-min!

941
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:51,403
- Dad!
- Kyung-min.

942
01:23:52,606 --> 01:23:55,430
What are you doing? I
told you to wait for me.

943
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:57,949
You...

944
01:23:59,187 --> 01:24:01,575
Pull, mister!

945
01:24:01,904 --> 01:24:03,858
Pull now.

946
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,733
Got it! Wait.

947
01:24:11,772 --> 01:24:14,370
I said pull.

948
01:24:29,136 --> 01:24:32,272
We got him. Let's go.

949
01:24:45,592 --> 01:24:47,191
- You okay?
- Yeah.

950
01:24:54,863 --> 01:24:55,905
What's that?

951
01:24:56,945 --> 01:24:58,404
Hurry! It's collapsing!

952
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:12,419
Are you okay?

953
01:25:12,714 --> 01:25:16,162
It's the toxic gas. Cover your mouth.

954
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:17,482
Don't breathe it in.

955
01:25:18,142 --> 01:25:19,325
Cover your mouth.

956
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:49,607
Hold on tight!

957
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:14,912
The cage is gone.

958
01:26:16,453 --> 01:26:19,599
He's gone. I guess he died a hero.

959
01:26:20,863 --> 01:26:23,904
Blue House!

960
01:26:36,735 --> 01:26:39,053
Man, he has nine lives.

961
01:26:39,914 --> 01:26:41,410
He made it.

962
01:27:04,847 --> 01:27:08,531
My truck's a little damaged
but insurance will cover it.

963
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,503
I didn't do this for any
sort of recognition.

964
01:27:11,858 --> 01:27:13,457
You'll get your medal.

965
01:27:13,716 --> 01:27:15,920
They'll reward a great
civil hero... Probably.

966
01:27:17,788 --> 01:27:18,830
Probably?

967
01:27:20,337 --> 01:27:21,599
What do you mean?

968
01:27:22,086 --> 01:27:24,229
Are you going back on your word again?

969
01:27:33,183 --> 01:27:35,393
We were so close.

970
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:38,597
They're coming.

971
01:27:38,622 --> 01:27:40,310
There's a truck coming.

972
01:27:40,335 --> 01:27:41,818
They're coming.

973
01:27:54,536 --> 01:27:55,767
Any information on the survivors?

974
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:57,398
Not yet, sir.

975
01:28:13,404 --> 01:28:14,205
Everyone!

976
01:28:15,147 --> 01:28:16,710
Let's welcome the survivors.

977
01:28:19,146 --> 01:28:22,881
By a miracle, they came back
to us from this dire situation.

978
01:28:24,797 --> 01:28:27,359
Jung-won, think about
what matters now...

979
01:28:30,279 --> 01:28:31,998
He's so violent in nature.

980
01:28:32,031 --> 01:28:35,896
Saving its citizens in danger
is a nation's basic duty.

981
01:28:35,921 --> 01:28:38,766
Think about your daughter's future.

982
01:28:38,872 --> 01:28:41,120
She's not going abroad, you son of a...

983
01:28:43,204 --> 01:28:44,854
Scumbag lower than a dog.

984
01:28:53,443 --> 01:28:57,173
I'm Jung-won Cha from the Department
of Security at the Blue House.

985
01:28:57,859 --> 01:29:01,464
Everything that happened on
the bridge has been recorded.

986
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:06,580
All the evidence about the
Silence Project is on here..

987
01:29:07,298 --> 01:29:09,846
...and on here.

988
01:29:10,665 --> 01:29:16,586
Where are you going? That's
the Secretary of Security.

989
01:29:17,379 --> 01:29:21,255
He's responsible for all this.
And the proof's on here.

990
01:29:21,388 --> 01:29:27,066
Look how he changes his
position so quickly. Amazing...

991
01:29:29,838 --> 01:29:31,416
So you're not going to study abroad?

992
01:29:33,707 --> 01:29:35,591
No. I'll live with my dad.

993
01:29:35,616 --> 01:29:37,457
I devoted myself...

994
01:29:37,909 --> 01:29:39,920
Good thinking.

995
01:29:40,071 --> 01:29:42,867
Besides, why go to
Australia to study music

996
01:29:42,892 --> 01:29:45,055
when you rap in Korean?

997
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,562
And about your dad...

998
01:29:47,587 --> 01:29:48,842
Miran, stop.

999
01:29:48,867 --> 01:29:51,616
You talk too much for
someone who's been shot.

1000
01:29:51,641 --> 01:29:53,326
Doesn't it hurt anymore?

1001
01:29:53,351 --> 01:29:55,986
Can you please put
her in the ambulance?

1002
01:29:56,011 --> 01:29:58,314
I've been shot. Please take me away.

1003
01:29:59,272 --> 01:30:00,759
My blood type is AB.

1004
01:30:21,311 --> 01:30:26,163
An investigation will be launched
with the information provided by Cha.

1005
01:30:26,188 --> 01:30:29,680
The Silence Project was a
classified animal experiment

1006
01:30:29,705 --> 01:30:32,572
that involved cloning
and brutal experiments...

1007
01:30:32,789 --> 01:30:36,654
...causing a deadly accident
taking more than 100 lives.
