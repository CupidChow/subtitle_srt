1
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:25,042
(Butterflied Lover)

2
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:28,887
(Episode 8: Uncertain Way Ahead)

3
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,270
There are days when I can't tell

4
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:35,042
what time frame is real and what isn't.

5
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:37,913
The present moment

6
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,722
feels like a lifetime away.

7
00:00:40,803 --> 00:00:44,794
It's like I'm in an extended dream.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,460
I didn't know that

9
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,882
so many things have happened between us.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,640
Chang Feng, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:58,082
I never dared to tell you my true identity.

12
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:03,014
I only realize that humans and beasts are different

13
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:05,522
the moment you put my shoes on.

14
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:07,943
Humans need shoes.

15
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:10,722
It was you

16
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:15,784
who taught me how to be a normal person.

17
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,442
Your Excellency, I will leave immediately

18
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,940
if you let me.

19
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,722
Stop right there.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,520
Who told you to go?

21
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:44,482
Your Excellency,

22
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,153
since you don't want to let me go,

23
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:56,323
do it.

24
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:59,482
I'll leave this to you.

25
00:02:05,703 --> 00:02:07,642
Leave this to me?

26
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,202
All these years,

27
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:44,961
you said I taught you to be a normal person.

28
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:48,122
What you have taught me is

29
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:51,762
to live in a way that I have never experienced before.

30
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:55,562
You helped me understand how I should live as a person.

31
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:57,522
Tang Qian Yue,

32
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:00,563
you are my wife.

33
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:02,922
But I'm a Butterfly Slave,

34
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:05,266
the Butterfly Slave who almost harmed the princess.

35
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:07,557
Butterfly Slaves are condemned in the city.

36
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,401
What are you going to do?

37
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:11,554
Chang Feng,

38
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,162
just let me leave

39
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:15,842
if you don't want to hurt me.

40
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:18,042
Let me go back to where I should...

41
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,961
No one can take you from me.

42
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:08,162
That includes yourself.

43
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,162
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:10,203
Qian Yue,

45
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,642
no matter what's in your past,

46
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:16,858
no matter what the world thinks of you,

47
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:19,642
none of them matter.

48
00:05:20,622 --> 00:05:22,243
Anyone can leave me,

49
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:25,362
but not you.

50
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:26,882
You cannot,

51
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,802
and you're not allowed to.

52
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:43,077
Chang Feng,

53
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,682
although you just see me as your wife

54
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:48,162
and don't mind that I'm a Butterfly Slave,

55
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:51,122
there's still a good chance that I might hurt you.

56
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:56,552
I'll find a way to turn you back to normal.

57
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,577
Turn me back to normal?

58
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:01,282
Since Butterfly Curse made you a Butterfly Slave,

59
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:05,082
we'll find a way to remove the curse for you to become a normal human.

60
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,002
(I have tried that.)

61
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,640
What's wrong?

62
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,922
Chang Feng,

63
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:16,641
I never figured out

64
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,642
why I never lusted blood in the past

65
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:22,570
although I became a Butterfly Slave,

66
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:25,922
and why couldn't I control myself this time

67
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:28,322
when the princess was having a nosebleed?

68
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:30,202
That could be because

69
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:32,842
I saved you with Kirin Blood

70
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:35,002
when you were in distress.

71
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:36,826
Kirin Blood?

72
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,962
I did hear that Kirin Blood feeds Butterfly Curse,

73
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:48,047
and the curse is only attracted by it.

74
00:06:50,157 --> 00:06:51,722
Could it be because

75
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:54,552
Bao Zhu is...

76
00:06:56,278 --> 00:06:58,642
Chang Feng, it was just a nosebleed.

77
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,667
You don't have to come all the way here to visit me.

78
00:07:01,556 --> 00:07:02,955
It's a relief to know that you're fine.

79
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,801
My dearest and most honorable Princess Bao Zhu

80
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:08,761
did not just have a nosebleed recently.

81
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:12,465
He Ying scratched your hand by accident a month ago,

82
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:14,322
and you bled so much.

83
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:15,582
He Xi,

84
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:17,001
it was just a minor incident,

85
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:18,542
and there was no major injury.

86
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,041
How about before that?

87
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,475
Have you been injured before?

88
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:25,063
Let's say five or six years ago.

89
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,640
Five or six years ago...

90
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:31,122
Yes, once.

91
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,642
I was young at that time.

92
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:34,283
There was a night when I was sleeping soundly

93
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:37,705
when my father suddenly came over and slashed my palm with a dagger.

94
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:39,480
That really scared me.

95
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,612
(It turns out that)

96
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:43,672
(the Kirin Blood I obtained from the late emperor)

97
00:07:43,753 --> 00:07:45,276
(for my eldest sister five years ago)

98
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:46,981
(is from Bao Zhu.)

99
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,761
(She is Kirin Blood.)

100
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:52,314
Chang Feng?

101
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:53,961
Chang Feng?

102
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,739
Your Highness, you must be careful in the future.

103
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,040
Don't get injured anymore.

104
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,682
Chang Feng, you are thinking too much.

105
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:03,562
How can I get hurt so easily?

106
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:04,981
By the way,

107
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,042
Qian Yue caught the flu recently.

108
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:09,010
You should stay away from her for now,

109
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:11,205
your body has been weak since childhood.

110
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:12,882
It's better if you don't go see her.

111
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:15,633
Sure, I won't.

112
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,082
I'll take leave first.

113
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:19,431
Goodbye, Chang Feng.

114
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,870
Your Excellency, Marquis Wu An sent people over several times

115
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:27,299
to set fire to Butterfly Slaves, but I remember you instructed that

116
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,921
we shouldn't act rashly on them.

117
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,160
I really have no choice but to call you over.

118
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,901
Jin Ming, take care of the Butterfly Slaves. I'll figure out the rest.

119
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:36,040
Yes, Your Excellency.

120
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:38,440
Your Excellency, Marquis Wu An is here.

121
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,500
- In person? - Yes.

122
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:48,961
Marquis.

123
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:54,242
Why are you being so formal suddenly?

124
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,961
I'll just cut to the chase.

125
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:59,122
The Butterfly Slaves in the dungeon are still unidentified,

126
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,540
so we can't get rid of them yet.

127
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:02,641
You are still as soft-hearted as ever.

128
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:04,275
Butterfly Slaves will be Butterfly Slaves.

129
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:05,489
What other identity can there be?

130
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,109
They must be remaining members of the Yilan Tribe

131
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,320
who wanted to take revenge on our city on New Year's Eve.

132
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,761
There's nothing to be pitied about.

133
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,631
Let me show you something.

134
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,921
This is a dossier from five years ago.

135
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,685
Dongxun Village was raided by bandits five years ago,

136
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,691
and numerous villagers were killed and injured.

137
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:29,295
When the Department of Household Affairs was cleaning the scene

138
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:30,380
and checking the households,

139
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,789
they noticed that 48 people were nowhere to be found.

140
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:36,296
I think they were used by Yilan Tribe,

141
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,979
similar to what happened to our eldest sister.

142
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,476
Our priority now is to find the head of the Yilan Tribe who is using them.

143
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:45,310
Fine.

144
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:48,667
We can choose not to kill Butterfly Slaves in my cell,

145
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:51,067
but Chang Feng, you have to remember.

146
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,042
Our sister was turned into a Butterfly Slave by the devious Yilan Tribe

147
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:56,962
when she was sent there to get married.

148
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:58,922
We are now sworn enemies.

149
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,162
If we find that those Butterfly Slaves are not citizens of our city

150
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:03,922
but the members of the Yilan Tribe,

151
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,200
I will definitely kill all of them.

152
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:16,620
(If Father or Chang Jin finds out about Qian Yue, )

153
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:19,108
(the consequences would be unthinkable.)

154
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:22,469
(I have to find a way to convert her back to normal as soon as possible.)

155
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:46,074
This is the Butterfly Curse from Yilan Tribe.

156
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,642
Ling Chang Jin, just deal with me however you want.

157
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:52,343
Stop showing off in front of me.

158
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,562
You're the Crown Prince of the Yilan Tribe.

159
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,362
You've been lurking in our city while holding a grudge

160
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,762
and plotting the incident of New Year's Eve for many years.

161
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:01,483
How sinister.

162
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:04,122
It'd be too easy if I kill you just like that.

163
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:05,634
What do you want?

164
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:10,602
Your Highness, I will give you a chance and spare you now

165
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:14,242
if you tell me where to get Kirin Blood.

166
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,955
You and I will meet again on a battlefield five years from now.

167
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:18,549
What do you think?

168
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:29,947
Ling Chang Jin, your princess is really naive and kind.

169
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,536
She didn't even blame the eunuch who injured her.

170
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:36,361
Taking her blood is easier than I thought.

171
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,440
Princess Bao Zhu?

172
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,681
Let him go.

173
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,120
Just wait.

174
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:56,202
I can't wait for five years.

175
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,282
(Butterfly Curse.)

176
00:12:07,989 --> 00:12:09,409
(Kirin Blood.)

177
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,040
Marquis, Lord Ling is here.

178
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,340
Chang Jian.

179
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:22,922
What are you doing here?

180
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,029
Can you hand me the Book of Curses

181
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,362
that you seized when you were destroying the Yilan Tribe?

182
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:38,233
Your Excellency, what are you doing here?

183
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:41,054
Can't I come if I no longer work here?

184
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:42,422
No.

185
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:44,189
You will always be our Lord Ling.

186
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,160
What brings you here?

187
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:49,433
Go and get a few literate officers

188
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,882
to help me take a look at the Book of Curses.

189
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:53,985
It's not that thick,

190
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,448
I can finish the whole book within half an incense's burning time.

191
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:09,964
Read it word by word.

192
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:12,105
Notify me when you see the word Butterfly.

193
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,164
(Marquis Wu An's Residence)

194
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,699
How is she?

195
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:53,602
Marquis,

196
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:56,522
Young Lady is acting as she usually does, nothing unusual.

197
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:04,282
Sister,

198
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:06,008
I'm here to see you.

199
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,019
Sister,

200
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:27,882
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:28,204 --> 00:14:31,107
I should've objected strongly

202
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:33,562
when the late emperor forced you to marry into Yilan Tribe.

203
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:35,504
You wouldn't have

204
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,451
ended up like this today.

205
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:56,402
In spite of that,

206
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,282
I have found Kirin Blood.

207
00:14:58,372 --> 00:14:59,882
As long as there's Kirin Blood,

208
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:02,522
it will feed Butterfly Curse within you,

209
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,842
and I'll find a way to save you.

210
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Marquis,

211
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,355
but Princess Bao Zhu is royalty.

212
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:16,442
So what if she's royalty?

213
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,480
Years ago,

214
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,015
the reason Yilan wanted to marry her is to take Kirin Blood from her.

215
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,841
What happened then?

216
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:30,921
Because of her royal blood,

217
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,002
the late Emperor got my sister to replace her by marrying him.

218
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:38,362
This should be a sin bear by her,

219
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,079
she can never escape.

220
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,260
Sister,

221
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:49,100
her blood will be yours.

222
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,940
Sister, I'm exhausted.

223
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,162
I don't want to write anymore.

224
00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:58,664
You don't want to write anymore?

225
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:02,480
I'll get Marquis Wu An to watch you write, then.

226
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:03,842
Sister, no.

227
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:05,882
I'll keep writing.

228
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:07,452
Zi Yan, you're a good boy.

229
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:08,665
Finish this,

230
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,681
and I'll get you some milk cakes.

231
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,993
Your Highness, are you really treating His Majesty

232
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,305
as an ordinary five-year-old?

233
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:19,794
Marquis, what are you doing here at the palace today?

234
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,658
I am here to request His Majesty to draft a decree.

235
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:25,325
Sister, I'm scared.

236
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:27,266
It's fine, I'm right here.

237
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,442
Marquis, what is the decree about?

238
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,362
His Majesty doesn't know many words,

239
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:34,922
I'll draft it on his behalf.

240
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:36,145
Sure.

241
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:37,866
Your Highness,

242
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:40,291
please prepare the decree for me.

243
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:43,164
Marquis, you may speak.

244
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:45,602
The late emperor promised me in the past that

245
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:48,602
I will be rewarded

246
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,015
if the day Yilan Tribe is exterminated ever comes.

247
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:54,467
I have been thinking about it, and there is only one thing I ask for.

248
00:16:55,672 --> 00:17:01,282
Your Majesty, please arrange a marriage for me and Princess Bao Zhu.

249
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:16,097
Your Highness, please keep writing.

250
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,242
Thank you, Your Majesty.

251
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:09,242
(Mingde Hall)

252
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,320
My dearest and most honorable Princess Bao Zhu,

253
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:14,245
I heard that Marquis Wu An requested His Majesty

254
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:15,949
to make arrangements for marriage for you two.

255
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:17,394
Is that true?

256
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:20,809
It is.

257
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:23,602
Your Highness,

258
00:20:23,986 --> 00:20:25,966
you don't need to force a smile.

259
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:28,882
Just cry it out.
