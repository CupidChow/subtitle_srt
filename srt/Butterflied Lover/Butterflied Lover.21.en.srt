1
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:26,642
(Butterflied Lover)

2
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:30,522
(Episode 21: When to Return to the West?)

3
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:36,264
Take it slow.

4
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,722
Bao Zhu, you're not fully recovered yet.

5
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,122
You should stop here.

6
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,602
Qian Yue,

7
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,679
are you sure you don't want to stay for a while more?

8
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:46,876
It's fine.

9
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:50,366
I am at ease as long as you're well.

10
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:53,018
Marquis,

11
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:58,402
please protect Bao Zhu in the coming days.

12
00:00:58,497 --> 00:00:59,585
No worries.

13
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:04,962
I will protect her with my life.

14
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:10,919
Qian Yue,

15
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,042
please let me know if Chang Feng returns.

16
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:26,362
(Marquis Wu An's Residence)

17
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:28,762
Marquis,

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,320
tell me,

19
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:34,122
why must people go separate ways?

20
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:41,242
You should go back inside.

21
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:44,162
Come.

22
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:53,383
Marquis.

23
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:00,177
Come.

24
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:02,562
We'll talk somewhere else.

25
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:06,983
Have you prepared everything I asked for?

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,160
Yes.

27
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:10,522
Have you visited Madam Yuan?

28
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,879
I did, but she didn't mention that she was willing to help the princess.

29
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:18,442
She only said that the method may not work for the princess.

30
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:29,082
Kun Qing.

31
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:30,682
Yes, sir.

32
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:32,602
Do you know

33
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:35,682
what the most helpless thing is for couples,

34
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:38,722
regardless of how close they are?

35
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,362
Do you know the answer?

36
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:42,312
No, I don't.

37
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,599
They are not blood relatives.

38
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,122
A butterfly?

39
00:04:27,463 --> 00:04:28,802
Bao Zhu?

40
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:34,402
Marquis, look. There's a butterfly.

41
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:36,882
A butterfly?

42
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:38,522
Where is it?

43
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,002
Over there.

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,202
Bao Zhu?

45
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:51,522
Bao Zhu!

46
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:55,963
Bao Zhu...

47
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,762
Your Highness!

48
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,722
- Bao Zhu!  - Your Highness!

49
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,562
Your Highness!

50
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,239
Eunuch He, hurry and find Imperial Physician Xun.

51
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:10,882
Yes, sir. I'll go right away.

52
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:15,685
- Kun Qing.  - Yes, sir.

53
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:18,242
Butterfly Curse. Go get it now.

54
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:19,509
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,082
Bao Zhu.

56
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:31,642
Bao Zhu.

57
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,402
Marquis, I'm so sleepy.

58
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,962
I know, don't fall asleep.

59
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,762
Just hold on for a while, okay?

60
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,602
Bao Zhu!

61
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:51,522
Kun Qing!

62
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:55,002
Marquis, here's the Butterfly Curse.

63
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,882
Marquis,

64
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:00,602
you look really handsome.

65
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:21,722
Bao Zhu!

66
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:23,362
Bao Zhu?

67
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,082
Bao Zhu!

68
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,082
Bao Zhu!

69
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,642
Your Highness!

70
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:51,242
Bao Zhu.

71
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:54,842
Hang in there.

72
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,402
Princess Bao Zhu?

73
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:59,122
Just a bit more.

74
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:09,922
Madam Yuan, please help me save Bao Zhu.

75
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:28,162
You implanted a Butterfly Curse on her?

76
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:33,319
Yes.

77
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:37,162
I know this is the Yilan Tribe's secret technique to save lives.

78
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,835
Madam,

79
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:41,162
I know that you succeeded in helping Chang Feng to save his wife

80
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,882
by drawing the curse out with blood.

81
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:44,722
Please save my wife too

82
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:48,562
by drawing the curse to me.

83
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:52,839
Marquis,

84
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,282
I need the princess's blood relatives to make it work.

85
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,402
You are not related to her by blood.

86
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:00,122
But Bao Zhu has Kirin Blood,

87
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:02,522
and her blood has saved many people.

88
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,602
What if it is compatible with mine?

89
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:08,002
Although it is indeed possible,

90
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:12,522
you will turn into a Butterfly Slave if it fails.

91
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:16,642
Madam Yuan,

92
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,319
there's no time.

93
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,002
Black peonies trees are about to bloom.

94
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:21,602
Please, I'm begging you.

95
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,762
(There's no other way.)

96
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,139
(She can't die.)

97
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,762
(I will take all her suffering.)

98
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:22,282
Marquis!

99
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:41,042
My dearest and most honorable Princess Bao Zhu,

100
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:43,322
you're finally awake!

101
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:46,762
What happened to me?

102
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,082
Nothing.

103
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:51,042
It's just that you slept a little longer.

104
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,722
Sergeant Kun, come here!

105
00:09:57,822 --> 00:10:00,042
Princess Bao Zhu is awake!

106
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,042
Your Highness.

107
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:05,882
I'm glad you're awake.

108
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:07,802
Good to see that.

109
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,282
Sergeant Kun, what's wrong?

110
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,162
Why are you crying?

111
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,482
Where is the marquis?

112
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:26,762
Why didn't he come to see me?

113
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:32,802
The black peonies trees

114
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,722
bloomed a month ago.

115
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,722
It's snowing.

116
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,242
New blushes!

117
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,964
They're better than Fengyue Pavilion's!

118
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:03,002
Come and take a look!

119
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,922
Gold and silver jewelry!

120
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,102
Various styles are available.

121
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,082
Come and take a look.

122
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:42,901
Candied hawthorns!

123
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,282
Sir, please give me one.

124
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,882
Sure.

125
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,122
- Here you go.  - Here.

126
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:52,962
Candied hawthorns!

127
00:11:57,143 --> 00:11:59,322
It will be cold when it snows.

128
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:04,302
- Look! Your mother is back!  - Si Si.

129
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,402
- Si Si!  - Mother!

130
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:09,202
Here you go.

131
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:13,482
- The candied hawthorns that I promised. Happy?  - Yes.

132
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:15,282
Welcome back, Madam Yue.

133
00:12:15,454 --> 00:12:18,042
Si Si insists on waiting for you to come back before she goes to sleep.

134
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,882
I'll take leave now.

135
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,722
Thank you, Madam Hong.

136
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,122
Si Si.

137
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:34,882
- Have you been good today?  - Yes.

138
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:38,562
Madam Hong?
