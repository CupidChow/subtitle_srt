1
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:24,922
(Butterflied Lover)

2
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:28,802
(Episode 12: That is Home)

3
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:31,720
I don't want the child.

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,260
Chang Feng, calm down and listen to me.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,578
Tang Qian Yue.

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,975
You're clearly aware that you might lose your life

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,002
if you give birth because of your body condition.

8
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:43,632
Why are you insisting on giving birth?

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,561
Besides, the baby is not the only thing within your body,

10
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:48,539
there's also the irremovable Butterfly Curse.

11
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:50,979
- You won't be able to take it.  - I can.

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,442
If that's the case, your body wouldn't be like an ordinary Butterfly Slave.

13
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,642
It turns out that your body changes because of the baby.

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,202
I can't take the risk.

15
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,434
I don't fear death.

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,922
The only thing I fear is

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,122
what you're going to do when I'm gone?

18
00:01:22,644 --> 00:01:23,980
No way.

19
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,802
I wouldn't want the baby

20
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:29,642
no matter what you say.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,958
Are you hungry? I'm going to cook.

22
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:38,842
(Ling Residence)

23
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:40,996
Chang Feng,

24
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,286
you're

25
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:46,839
back.

26
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,402
Chang Feng?

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,202
Chang Feng?

28
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:12,642
(It has been a long time since we had such good weather.)

29
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:20,098
Qian Yue, are you awake?

30
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:30,965
The weather is nice today.

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,481
Qian Yue,

32
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,842
shall we go out for a walk?

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,903
Qian Yue,

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,482
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,897
I know how important this child is to you.

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,653
But...

37
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,362
Qian Yue?

38
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:55,922
Qian Yue?

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,762
Qian Yue, wake up.

40
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:01,956
Qian Yue?

41
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,958
Qian Yue, wake up.

42
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:08,082
Wake up, Qian Yue.

43
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,901
Qian Yue!

44
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,562
Chang Feng?

45
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,638
- What's wrong?  - You weren't responsive.

46
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:25,120
I thought...

47
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:29,762
You're silly.

48
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:33,482
I'm just exhausted like any other ordinary pregnant woman.

49
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:35,078
Why are you overreacting?

50
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,242
You're not an ordinary pregnant woman.

51
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:39,202
This is just the beginning.

52
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:42,823
No physicians will be able to help when you show different symptoms later.

53
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:44,642
What am I supposed to do, then?

54
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,002
Chang Feng, I'm sorry.

55
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,762
I wasn't being considerate of your feelings.

56
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,362
I'll take you to someone.

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,820
I was originally a witch doctor of the Yilan Tribe.

58
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,562
As I grow older,

59
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:13,600
I've lived here in seclusion without a care for worldly matters

60
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:15,242
for many years now.

61
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,642
Lord Ling, there's no need to be wary.

62
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:20,922
I disassociated myself from the Yilan Tribe a long time ago.

63
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,122
Shall we proceed?

64
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,162
I apologize.

65
00:04:28,432 --> 00:04:32,642
Madam Yuan, may I ask if the baby in Qian Yue's womb

66
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:35,562
will be affected by the Butterfly Curse?

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,815
Don't worry.

68
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:38,482
Butterfly Curse cannot be passed-on.

69
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:40,463
The child will become an ordinary human

70
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:42,202
when he gets delivered safely.

71
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:47,428
Good to know.

72
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,722
Madam Yuan, is there any other way

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,642
to turn Qian Yue back into a normal human?

74
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,722
I've asked that before.

75
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,075
There is none.

76
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,322
It's a shame that she's an orphan

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,002
who was born and raised in the woods

78
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,882
with no blood relatives.

79
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,380
There is no other way.

80
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,044
Qian Yue,

81
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,759
we don't visit often.

82
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,860
Let's have dinner at Madam Yuan's place tonight.

83
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,903
Sure.

84
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,522
That'll do.

85
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:29,692
Qian Yue, bring me some firewood from the woodshed.

86
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,460
I'll go now.

87
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,042
Madam, you mentioned that Qian Yue is an orphan without blood relatives.

88
00:05:51,324 --> 00:05:54,202
Does that mean there's another solution?

89
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,339
There was no other solution,

90
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:58,762
but she's currently pregnant

91
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,332
and brought you here.

92
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,598
There is now a way.

93
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:04,840
What is it?

94
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:07,002
Drawing the curse with blood.

95
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,772
Watch out.

96
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:22,998
- Are you all right?  - I'm all right.

97
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,118
Xiao Long Bao!

98
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,759
- Are you hurt?  - Xiao Long Bao?

99
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,122
- Where's your mother?  - Xiao Long Bao?

100
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:28,762
She is at the back.

101
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,099
What happened? Where were you?

102
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,642
You scared me.

103
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:35,097
- Did you hurt yourself?  - No.

104
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,740
Madam, I apologize.

105
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,122
It's fine.

106
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,962
Let's go home.

107
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Stop running everywhere.

108
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,518
Where am I supposed to find you if you get lost?

109
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,562
You just follow anyone these days.

110
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,002
Let's go.

111
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,722
I don't know where your father went to get food.

112
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,042
- Qian Yue, are you all right?  - I'm all right.

113
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,762
Qian Yue,

114
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:03,422
is it true that all mothers, after having children,

115
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:05,842
prioritize their children over their own lives?

116
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,362
Of course.

117
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:09,118
Why are you asking such a silly question?

118
00:07:09,237 --> 00:07:12,298
A child is the apple of a mother's eye.

119
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,583
Look.

120
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,628
Come here.

121
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:21,162
Daddy, I want Xiaolongbao.

122
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:23,085
Let me see.

123
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:25,762
Where's the little glutton who wants Xiaolongbao?

124
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:29,082
It turns out to be Xiao Long Bao.

125
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:31,122
Look, I bought everything.

126
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,420
Let's go home and eat, shall we?

127
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:33,614
Yes.

128
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,460
What took you so long?

129
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,619
I'll be quicker next time.

130
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,882
That's more like it.

131
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:39,442
Xiao Long Bao, let's go.

132
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,002
I heard that it is the secret recipe of Zuixian Restaurant.

133
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:48,402
Chang Feng, before I met you,

134
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,642
I don't even know what a home feels like.

135
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:53,305
Look at them.

136
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,219
That is home.

137
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:59,661
I used to imagine that one day,

138
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:01,722
our children

139
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,242
would also hold our hands like that.

140
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,802
(Our children)

141
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:12,002
(would hold our hands like that.)

142
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,122
Drawing the curse with blood.

143
00:08:15,543 --> 00:08:17,322
Drawing the curse with blood?

144
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:22,319
Does that mean you can draw the curse from Qian Yue's body to the child?

145
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,519
Yes.

146
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:27,082
I can only operate this method on a blood relative.

147
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,900
Must it be someone blood-related?

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,642
You can only save your wife

149
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:33,682
at the expense of your child.

150
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,620
There is no other way.

151
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:42,482
Your Excellency, both you and Madam Yue won't be in the capital anymore.

152
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:44,882
These pastries will be hard to come by for you.

153
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,570
I bought these when I was on the way here.

154
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,282
Thank you for that.

155
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,860
Thank you, Officer Jin.

156
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,255
Try it.

157
00:08:57,239 --> 00:09:00,122
You shouldn't eat Hawthorn, you're pregnant.

158
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,742
Madam Yue is pregnant?

159
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,529
Congratulations!

160
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,091
Chang Feng.

161
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:20,642
Does that mean you're no longer objecting to me giving birth?

162
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,762
The baby is in your womb, not mine.

163
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,922
Even if I object again, I have no say in this.

164
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:31,282
That's great, Chang Feng!

165
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,962
Don't worry, I can see Madam Yuan when I have any issues.

166
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:35,642
She will help us out.

167
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:46,564
You guys talk first, I'll head back inside.

168
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,900
Thank you, Officer Jin.

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,442
Madam Yue, take care.

170
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,700
Your Excellency, as per your orders,

171
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,740
I have protected those Butterfly Slaves discreetly.

172
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:11,042
The commander will never know about this matter.

173
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:13,240
Hurry and gather some black peonies' tree roots

174
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:15,302
and make black peonies soup according to this prescription

175
00:10:15,383 --> 00:10:16,746
for the Butterfly Slaves.

176
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,058
Is this the unique method?

177
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:22,922
We have to try every possible solution.

178
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:28,002
Your Highness.

179
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:29,392
Come in.

180
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:33,282
Your Highness,

181
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,242
we received a letter from Lord Ling's residence.

182
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:54,882
He Xi, I have to go to Qian Yue's residence.

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,442
I will go with you.

184
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,179
- No need.  - I have to follow you.

185
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,717
He Xi, you have more important things to do.

186
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,922
Right. What is it?

187
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,660
You have to help me to coax the marquis for me when he's back.

188
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,642
Just tell him that I...

189
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,202
I...

190
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:12,122
Just make something up.

191
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,082
Your Highness, what should I tell him?

192
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:35,762
(Thousand Character Classic)

193
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:46,962
(Ling Chang Feng, Tang Qian Yue)

194
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:53,794
(Marriage Certificate)

195
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,802
(I might not come back again after leaving this time.)

196
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,922
(I should bid a proper farewell)

197
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,838
(to the house.)

198
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,098
Qian Yue.

199
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,482
Princess Bao Zhu?

200
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,900
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

201
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:25,117
Qian Yue, I sneaked out to ask you this.

202
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:27,238
Why are you and Chang Feng leaving suddenly?

203
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:29,238
Is it because Marquis wants to catch Butterfly Slaves

204
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:31,033
and he found out your identity?

205
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:33,362
Your Highness, calm down.

206
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:34,644
We...

207
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,562
This place is a mess.

208
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,882
Your Highness, come with me.

209
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:43,482
Let's find a place to sit down and talk.

210
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,747
Lord Ling.

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,372
Lord Ling.

212
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:52,482
(No Entry)

213
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,322
Lord Ling.

214
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,139
Your Excellency., I have made black peonies soup

215
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,537
as the prescription you gave me.

216
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:00,442
- Lord Ling.  - We fed them soup.

217
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:02,963
You should've seen their faces in agony.

218
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:04,482
It hurts to watch.

219
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,940
They were so loud.

220
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,562
Are they all fed?

221
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,802
There are only three left.

222
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:16,482
They refused to drink no matter what.

223
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,962
What do you think?

224
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:24,484
Keep trying.

225
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,609
Your Excellency, Butterfly Slaves injured countless people.

226
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,421
Do we really need to put the effort to save them

227
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:31,083
behind the commander's back?

228
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:33,562
They were all normal human beings

229
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:35,483
before they were used to turn into Butterfly Slaves.

230
00:13:35,638 --> 00:13:36,962
Jin Ming,

231
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,162
if one day.

232
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:41,882
I become like them,

233
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,842
you must kill me yourself.

234
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,962
Your Excellency, what are you talking about?

235
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:53,804
Nothing.

236
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,522
I'll entrust the Ministry to you from now on.

237
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,722
When I'm not around,

238
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,482
you must inform me if something happens.

239
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,202
Your Excellency, rest assured.

240
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,858
What is that smell?

241
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,882
Is it the smell of black peonies soup?

242
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,436
It's not the soup.

243
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,718
It smells like black peonies' pollen.

244
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:23,670
I can smell it.

245
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:25,443
There's an intense black peony scent.

246
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,166
(No Entry)

247
00:14:35,247 --> 00:14:36,871
What's happening?

248
00:14:48,282 --> 00:14:50,202
Black peonies?

249
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,762
Qian Yue, petals are falling from the sky.

250
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,409
Black peonies?

251
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,642
Your Excellency, what is going on?

252
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:41,716
Aren't the black peonies trees in the city not blooming yet?

253
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:43,359
Where are the petals coming from?

254
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,480
Good grief,

255
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,842
someone wants to execute the Butterfly Slaves in the city.
