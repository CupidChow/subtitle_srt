1
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,922
(Butterflied Lover)

2
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,700
(Episode 9: Family)

3
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:32,371
Father.

4
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:33,922
Why did you call me so urgently?

5
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,442
You unfilial son!

6
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:38,242
How dare you act clueless and ask me why I call you here!

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,460
You have been flaunting your authority at the court,

8
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,900
and I've turned a blind eye to it,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,232
but you are trying to marry the princess forcefully.

10
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:46,002
What intention do you have?

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,602
I have no other intentions.

12
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,922
I like the princess.

13
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,420
Nonsense!

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,362
How many times have you seen the princess?

15
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:54,072
Father, I've made my decision.

16
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:55,402
I must marry the princess.

17
00:00:55,716 --> 00:00:57,056
If you are free on the wedding day,

18
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:58,812
remember to come and have a drink at the banquet.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,642
I'm not done yet!

20
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,322
Come back!

21
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:07,872
Won't you have dinner first before you leave?

22
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,642
(Did the black peonies soup completely fail?)

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,579
The princess is here!

24
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:31,402
Your Highness.

25
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:33,482
Qian Yue!

26
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,562
- Qian Yue. - Your Highness.

27
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,579
You better stay away from me.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,922
Qian Yue, did you recover from your cold?

29
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,460
Cold?

30
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:48,626
I'm feeling much better.

31
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:51,242
- Thank you for your concern, Your Highness. - That's great.

32
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:53,950
Qian Yue.

33
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:56,842
I'm getting married.

34
00:01:57,312 --> 00:01:58,882
Married?

35
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:04,082
I see. You are going to marry Marquis Wu An.

36
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,399
Yes.

37
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,362
I want to marry the one I love.

38
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:08,922
Everyone in the palace is afraid of him.

39
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,740
I have no one to tell my joy to.

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,380
So, I'm here to tell you.

41
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,980
You look so happy.

42
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,322
I'm sure you like him a lot.

43
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:17,922
In that case,

44
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:20,242
I will use tea instead of wine

45
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,300
to congratulate Your Highness.

46
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:24,802
Thank you, Qian Yue.

47
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,499
It's getting late.

48
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,994
I'm going back then.

49
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:36,920
If He Xi realizes that I've sneaked out, he will start nagging again.

50
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:56,362
I only need one more day.

51
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:59,235
No. Just a while longer.

52
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:08,122
Whether it's another day or a while longer,

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,740
you still failed.

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,202
Madam Yuan, are there any other ways?

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,619
Drink this soup.

56
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:27,002
- This is... - Just an ordinary ginger soup to get rid of your cold.

57
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,659
It doesn't help much.

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Your Excellency.

59
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,162
This is not the "Book of Curses".

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,522
This should be the "Book of Million Curses".

61
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,699
My back hurts and I have a headache.

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,219
You don't even blink. Aren't you tired?

63
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,579
Search every word.

64
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,882
Don't talk to me before you find the word "butterfly".

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,580
Yes.

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,499
Black peonies soup.

67
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,322
Madam Yuan.

68
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:12,348
Can I still drink black peonies soup again?

69
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,740
The Butterfly Curse was a secret technique

70
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,748
used to save people by the witch doctors of Yilan.

71
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,128
I didn't expect it to be used

72
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:20,322
to harm countless people right now.

73
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:22,242
As long as there's a chance,

74
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:24,012
I will definitely help you.

75
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:32,002
Three years ago, you came to me.

76
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,162
I gave you black peonies soup,

77
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,962
and it made you suffer in pain for seven whole days.

78
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:38,762
Haven't you had enough?

79
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,340
If I can become normal,

80
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,322
even if I have to suffer the pain ten times,

81
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,820
I'm still willing to do it.

82
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,882
Madam Yuan,

83
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,474
is there really no other way?

84
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,002
When a living person is planted with the Butterfly Curse,

85
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:02,995
he will become a slave.

86
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,980
Butterfly Slaves are as vicious as beasts.

87
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:06,971
Butterfly Curse can be removed when the Butterfly Slaves

88
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:08,322
drink black peonies soup.

89
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,860
Your Excellency, there's a cure for the Butterfly Slaves.

90
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,010
Before the curse is removed, one must overcome

91
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:18,019
the seven days of heart-piercing pain of black peonies soup.

92
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,442
After experiencing death...

93
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,242
Where have you been the last seven days?

94
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:25,042
Your Excellency,

95
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,139
can I not tell you?

96
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:34,162
(Heart-piercing pain.)

97
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:37,546
(Experiencing death.)

98
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:44,602
(You have been suffering so much for the last few years.)

99
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:57,817
Qian Yue!

100
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:00,562
Qian Yue!

101
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:03,747
(You went missing for seven days)

102
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,874
(because of me.)

103
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,432
Chang Feng.

104
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:01,242
You are back.

105
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,056
Your Excellency!

106
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:04,567
You are back.

107
00:07:04,812 --> 00:07:06,111
You are back.

108
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:07,842
You are back.

109
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:13,042
Why did you come back so late today?

110
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,639
What's wrong?

111
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,482
(How did you overcome the suffering for seven days?)

112
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:36,433
(Your hope is crushed after three years.)

113
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,802
(You must have felt so much despair.)

114
00:07:46,894 --> 00:07:48,274
Have you eaten?

115
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:50,113
Let me heat up...

116
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:19,682
Qian Yue.

117
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:21,474
You are my wife.

118
00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:25,082
You are the most important person in my life.

119
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:28,282
No matter when, where, or in what situation,

120
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:31,634
I will never give you up.

121
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,754
I know.

122
00:08:58,907 --> 00:09:03,039
Chang Feng, you looked troubled since last night.

123
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:04,834
What's wrong?

124
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:06,794
It's nothing.

125
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:09,153
It seems like many things happened

126
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:11,714
over the last few days.

127
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:13,888
Are you worried about me?

128
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:18,682
It's fine.

129
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:21,984
I am in front of you just fine, am I not?

130
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,420
I've been doing well in the last few years.

131
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:28,799
I don't think anything will happen in the future.

132
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:31,913
It's fine even if I'm not a normal person.

133
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:37,815
Perhaps it's just temporary.

134
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:39,221
In the future,

135
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:41,113
it will get better.

136
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:42,761
It will get better.

137
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:45,594
Soon,

138
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:47,428
something auspicious will happen.

139
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:48,842
Something auspicious?

140
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:52,466
Princess Bao Zhu is getting married.

141
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,333
To whom?

142
00:09:54,414 --> 00:09:55,834
Marquis Wu An.

143
00:09:57,494 --> 00:09:58,882
Marquis Wu An?

144
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:00,714
My second brother?

145
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,562
Why would he marry Princess Bao Zhu sincerely?

146
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,440
You are so nice.

147
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,454
I'm sure your second brother is a very nice person too.

148
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:21,042
The Yilan Tribe proposed to Princess Bao Zhu back then.

149
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,482
The late emperor did not want Princess Bao Zhu to get married

150
00:10:23,694 --> 00:10:25,482
because she was too young,

151
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,242
so my sister was made into a princess to replace her.

152
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,920
Unexpectedly,

153
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,874
the Yilan Tribe turned my sister into a Butterfly Slave

154
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,380
and sent her to the underground.

155
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:55,953
Father, I got the Kirin Blood!

156
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:06,242
Sister!

157
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:08,754
The commander shot her himself?

158
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,841
Yes.

159
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:11,313
Since then,

160
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,082
Chang Jin hated the Yilan Tribe.

161
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,362
So, I think he wants to marry Bao Zhu

162
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:18,642
because he has an ulterior motive.

163
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:21,136
It has been many years since that incident.

164
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:24,632
I think he has let it go.

165
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,162
Bao Zhu looked so happy.

166
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:30,953
I think this will be a good marriage.

167
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,760
I hope so.

168
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:34,193
Qian Yue.

169
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,267
You must not let my second brother find out about your identity.

170
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:39,369
I'm afraid he will look into your background.

171
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:40,737
I understand.

172
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,000
The princess also got someone

173
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,099
to send us the wedding invitation a few days ago.

174
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:54,953
However, I can't attend.

175
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:56,359
Chang Feng.

176
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,941
Help me take this gift

177
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:01,625
to the princess.

178
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:04,227
Sure.

179
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:11,447
I want to take a quick peek at the princess.

180
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:12,842
Can I?

181
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:14,242
Congratulations.

182
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,193
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

183
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:19,642
You are too polite.

184
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:23,082
Marquis, make a toast to everyone.

185
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,002
Chang Feng.

186
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,741
There are many people inside. It's very lively.

187
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:39,480
I think your brother is sincere towards the princess.

188
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,162
Don't worry.

189
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:42,674
I hope so.

190
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:45,275
Why don't I get down, so you can climb up and take a look?

191
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:46,762
No.

192
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,889
I don't want to.

193
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:52,513
Fine. I'll help you see.

194
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:59,082
Come. The marquis is making a toast to everyone.

195
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,882
(Marquis Wu An's Residence)

196
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:10,339
Commander.

197
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:12,642
- Softer. - Since we are already here,

198
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:15,682
why don't we just go inside?

199
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,601
We are just passing by.

200
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:21,394
I don't think it's necessary to go inside.

201
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:23,387
I think we just took a detour.

202
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:29,116
Besides, I am the commander of the empire.

203
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,892
If I go inside without getting an invitation from them,

204
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:34,175
isn't it too embarrassing?

205
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:38,642
There's nothing inside.

206
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:40,054
Nothing.

207
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:43,036
How boring.

208
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,260
- Let me hold you. - Be careful.

209
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:48,683
Come.

210
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,242
Be careful.

211
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:53,122
It's a pity that I didn't get to see the princess.

212
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:54,759
If you can't see her, I'll go to the roof

213
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,362
and take off a piece of tile.

214
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:57,722
Sure.

215
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:03,221
- Commander? - Commander.

216
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,920
He didn't give you two an invitation as well?

217
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:12,874
However, isn't this a little dangerous?

218
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:20,829
Sang Qi, let's go.

219
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:27,042
I'm the only one without an invitation.

220
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,313
I'm the only one who got hurt.

221
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:36,834
He Xi.

222
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:38,855
When will the banquet finish?

223
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:41,271
It looks lively outside.

224
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:43,762
When will the marquis return?

225
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:47,554
My precious Princess Bao Zhu.

226
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:49,554
The marquis is a cruel man.

227
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:53,874
A few days ago, he just got rid of He Ying a few days ago.

228
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:56,702
You must be careful in the future.

229
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:59,834
The marquis will also be soft-hearted.

230
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:04,775
Oh, He Xi.

231
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:10,033
Are there any steps to a wedding night?

232
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:15,834
I do know,

233
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,202
but I don't know much.

234
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:19,825
What do you mean?

235
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:23,082
I can't get married.

236
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,913
I should have asked Qian Yue.

237
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,714
The marquis is entering!

238
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:39,247
Thank you, Marquis.

239
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,953
I hope you have a child soon.

240
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:48,642
Congratulations, Marquis.

241
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:50,162
Eunuch He,

242
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,882
you may go out.

243
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:54,202
Thank you, Marquis.

244
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,391
I will be leaving.

245
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,640
Marquis.

246
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:41,113
The precious Princess Bao Zhu.

247
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:51,888
Eunuch He.

248
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:55,785
What are you doing?

249
00:16:57,701 --> 00:17:00,360
I'm worried about the princess and the marquis

250
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,183
since this is their first marriage.

251
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,856
I'm afraid they don't know the necessary procedures.

252
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:40,547
It hurts!

253
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:43,842
It hurts? Your Highness!

254
00:17:46,977 --> 00:17:48,717
It's a necessary procedure.

255
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:59,113
Marquis.

256
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:01,042
I'm bleeding.

257
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:02,562
She's bleeding?

258
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,333
Eunuch He, get the imperial physician!

259
00:18:04,422 --> 00:18:06,162
I'm going inside.

260
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:08,206
Calm down.

261
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,816
A normal procedure.

262
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:20,434
Marquis.
