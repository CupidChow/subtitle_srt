1
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:25,055
(Butterflied Lover)

2
00:00:25,136 --> 00:00:29,002
(Episode 11: Jin)

3
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:36,362
Father.

4
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:38,497
Why did you find me?

5
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:42,202
Were you the one who executed Yilan Crown Prince in secret?

6
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:46,419
Yes.

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,522
Why didn't you report it to me then?

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,602
What are you planning?

9
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,928
I only executed someone from the Yilan Tribe.

10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,202
What plans could I have?

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,765
Didn't you have a grudge against me

12
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:58,432
because of your elder sister's death

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,499
and keep trying to defy my orders?

14
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:09,442
Father, you are overthinking.

15
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:11,082
You tried to protect the city,

16
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:13,122
so I can understand your decision back then.

17
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:15,098
All right.

18
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:17,719
Let me ask you.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,842
Did you execute all the Butterfly Slaves

20
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,930
by burning them?

21
00:01:22,205 --> 00:01:25,820
Did Ling Chang Feng pity the Butterfly Slaves

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,722
and asked you behind my back

23
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:30,570
to let him take care of the Butterfly Slaves himself?

24
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,218
No. I'm dealing with them.

25
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:33,802
Nonsense!

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,202
You haven't gone out for days.

27
00:01:40,324 --> 00:01:44,122
I can understand because you just got married,

28
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,959
but you need to know when to stop. Understand?

29
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:48,968
Father, I'm busy. Farewell.

30
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:53,122
These two useless sons.

31
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:54,562
One is too soft-hearted,

32
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,442
and another one is mysterious.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,176
The Butterfly Slaves in the city is a hidden risk.

34
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:04,740
We must get rid of all of them.

35
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:07,082
The black peony trees at the outskirts haven't bloomed.

36
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:10,042
If we want to get rid of them all in one go, I'm afraid...

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,402
In that case, we will think of a way

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,922
to make these black peony trees

39
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,762
bloom in advance.

40
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:23,402
Chang Jin, why did you invite me and Qian Yue to your residence?

41
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:25,675
Chang Feng.

42
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:26,936
Qian Yue.

43
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:31,122
Both of you did not attend my wedding banquet.

44
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:32,842
It was a pity.

45
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:36,082
I invited you two for a small family gathering.

46
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,650
Yes. I didn't know that Marquis and Chang Feng

47
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,322
are half-siblings.

48
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,049
Have some tea.

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,082
This is brewed with black peonies. Try it.

50
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,722
Qian Yue, please have some tea.

51
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,082
It's delicious.

52
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,362
Black peony tea is fragrant, but it has a cool nature.

53
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:47,072
You just recovered from your cold.

54
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,211
Don't drink this.

55
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,482
Your Highness, you should drink less too.

56
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:53,732
I won't drink it then.

57
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:56,319
Chang Jin.

58
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:59,442
I'm going to the store with Qian Yue. Let's meet again next time.

59
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:05,186
Chang Feng.

60
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:07,603
- I think he found out about my identity.  - Let's talk about it later.

61
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,682
Chang Feng and Qian Yue, take care.

62
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:22,735
Marquis. Are we mistaken?

63
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:25,543
I investigated the season when black peonies bloom in recent years.

64
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:27,789
Lord Ling's wife was always in the city.

65
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:29,436
If she is a Butterfly Slave,

66
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:30,897
she won't be safe.

67
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,744
No. I'm sure she is a Butterfly Slave.

68
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,922
The Yilan Tribe

69
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:39,562
has a unique way of activating the curse.

70
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:41,922
Only when the curse is activated

71
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:43,882
will they become Butterfly slaves.

72
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:47,082
This is the reason why they can hide

73
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:49,922
among the people for so many years.

74
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:51,620
If the curse needs to be activated all the same,

75
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:55,442
why does Tang Qian Yue look so different from the Butterfly Slaves?

76
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,322
She looks like a normal person.

77
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:01,122
I remember in the "Book of Curses",

78
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,922
it is stated that the curse that the Yilan Tribe plants

79
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,482
will keep the hosts' consciousness

80
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:07,202
unlike other tribes.

81
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,699
If Tang Qian Yue is from the Yilan Tribe,

82
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,322
it will be a different story.

83
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,002
There must be another culprit to the Butterfly Slave incident.

84
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,322
Tang Qian Yue is our clue now.

85
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,402
I must avenge my sister.

86
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:24,042
I need to think of a way to confirm this immediately.

87
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:29,162
Only the Kirin Blood can lure out Butterfly Slaves.

88
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,202
Our Kirin Blood

89
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,842
is used to feed the Butterfly Curse of your sister.

90
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,242
It's just Kirin Blood.

91
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,179
My precious Princess Bao Zhu.

92
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:45,562
Why hasn't your hand healed yet?

93
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:47,763
Come and show me.

94
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:51,482
It will recover soon.

95
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,882
I just haven't removed the gauze.

96
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,242
- Your Highness.  - Marquis.

97
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,518
- You're back.  - Marquis.

98
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:01,922
Eunuch He. Please leave.

99
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:03,482
Marquis.

100
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:06,362
I still need to take care of Her Highness's meal.

101
00:06:06,637 --> 00:06:08,298
I will be eating with her.

102
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,202
He Xi, go out for now.

103
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:15,682
- I will be eating with the marquis alone.  - Yes.

104
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:21,766
- He Xi, close the door.  - Yes.

105
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,042
Marquis, please take a seat.

106
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,202
You know what I'm going to do.

107
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,002
On the day of our wedding, you cut my hand to take my blood once.

108
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:49,562
You fed me medicine to enrich my blood,

109
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:51,034
forced me to train my body,

110
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:52,562
and said my life is precious.

111
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:55,602
Later, I found out I have Kirin Blood,

112
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,162
so I could guess it more or less.

113
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,562
My right hand will heal soon.

114
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:04,602
I won't be using my left hand to eat anyway,

115
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:06,322
so let me give you this hand.

116
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,362
No.

117
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,682
Wait.

118
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,642
Use this hand instead.

119
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:17,764
If both my hands are injured,

120
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:19,522
people might get suspicious.

121
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:35,602
Are you willing to give it to me?

122
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:39,042
I'm sure you have your use for it.

123
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:48,282
Wait.

124
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:56,578
What are you doing?

125
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,059
He Xi knew my hand will heal soon.

126
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,525
I'm afraid he might get suspicious.

127
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,033
I will tell him

128
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:05,122
that I broke the bowl and was cut by the broken pieces.

129
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,402
Don't think I'll be soft-hearted.

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,802
Marquis, everything is ready.

131
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:49,015
Oh.

132
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,882
We will be leaving for a long time.

133
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:52,282
Bring more clothes.

134
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,082
We will depart after I go to the ministry tomorrow.

135
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:57,775
Sure.

136
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:06,362
(He already had many troubles recently.)

137
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:10,922
(I should wait until we left before telling him about the baby.)

138
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:26,298
Marquis Wu An, why are you here?

139
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,202
This is the Marquis Residence's business. Move!

140
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:30,158
Why would Marquis Wu An come at this time?

141
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,002
Your Excellency, what are you doing here with so many men?

142
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:35,282
What are you doing? Are you trying to trespass?

143
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:37,682
Stay inside. I'll deal with them.

144
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:44,877
Chang Jin.

145
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:46,722
Why did you come without informing me?

146
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:48,322
You even brought so many men.

147
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:52,122
- What's wrong?  - I'm capturing a Butterfly Slave tonight.

148
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:55,265
Someone told me a Butterfly Slave has entered your residence.

149
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:58,402
- I came here to take a look.  - My residence is peaceful.

150
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,202
There are no Butterfly Slaves.

151
00:10:00,502 --> 00:10:02,562
Perhaps you scared them away.

152
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:06,545
Are you sure there are no Butterfly Slaves?

153
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:08,451
I'm sure.

154
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,362
What are you trying to do?

155
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,362
This is Kirin Blood.

156
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,122
With a try,

157
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:22,122
I will know if a Butterfly Slave is hiding in your house.

158
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:23,482
How dare you!

159
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,446
This is my residence.

160
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:33,362
Lord Ling, put down the sword.

161
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:39,242
Chang Feng.

162
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:41,082
I promised you.

163
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:44,442
If I confirm the Butterfly Slave is from Dongqian Village,

164
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,482
I won't harm him.

165
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:49,322
If it's someone from the Yilan Tribe,

166
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,202
I won't spare any one of them.

167
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:56,202
I also won't let anyone disturb my family!

168
00:10:58,215 --> 00:11:00,802
Don't you want to avenge our sister?

169
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:18,078
Marquis.

170
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:20,442
If there are Butterfly Slaves near the Kirin Blood,

171
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:22,202
they should have appeared by now.

172
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,740
Chang Jin.

173
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:32,162
I know you hate the Yilan Tribe

174
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,682
and want to annihilate them.

175
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:36,282
Don't forget.

176
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:37,986
They are just like you.

177
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,999
No matter how much you try to wipe them out,

178
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:42,134
you still won't wipe their vengeance.

179
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:45,122
The night of New Year's Eve was the consequence of getting revenge.

180
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:47,919
There are many people who lost their lives.

181
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:49,642
Are you still not going to stop?

182
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,362
Chang Feng.

183
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,242
Being soft-hearted

184
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:56,402
won't save the person you love the most.

185
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:02,722
Let's go.

186
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:12,882
Qian Yue.

187
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:17,058
Qian Yue.

188
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:20,602
Qian Yue!

189
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,842
Qian Yue.

190
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,820
Chang Feng.

191
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:38,242
I controlled it just now.

192
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,082
I didn't rush out.

193
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,342
Qian Yue.

194
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:46,879
Qian Yue.

195
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:49,642
Qian Yue.

196
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,540
I will definitely turn you back.

197
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,242
Definitely.

198
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:17,242
Chang Jin.

199
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:22,682
The Kirin Blood you have is obtained from Bao Zhu, right?

200
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:25,922
Her hand was also hurt by you a few days ago, right?

201
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,682
I don't care why you married Bao Zhu,

202
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:30,314
but the night she married you,

203
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,682
she came to my residence and said something.

204
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:34,722
What did she say?

205
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,042
She said she is going to marry the person she loves.

206
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:42,562
Can you treat her that way

207
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,602
and live with a clear conscience?

208
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,162
Marquis!

209
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,722
You are back.

210
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:09,402
Why did you come back so late?

211
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,202
What's wrong?

212
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:27,962
It's nothing.

213
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:29,497
Wait.

214
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,802
Marquis, you are hurt.

215
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:39,842
Come. Follow me.

216
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:48,741
I'm fine.

217
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,122
Marquis, don't move. I'll be done soon.

218
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:02,402
You should hate me.

219
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,482
Why are you doing this?

220
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,522
Why am I treating you after you took my blood, right?

221
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:15,358
My father spoiled me when he was alive,

222
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:16,962
but he let me read a lot.

223
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:18,282
He said

224
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,219
a real princess should know the helplessness of people

225
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:22,842
and be understanding.

226
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,179
I don't remember many things in the book,

227
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,682
but I remember a sentence clearly.

228
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:28,772
What is it?

229
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:33,762
A life is as precious as a thousand gold.

230
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,882
Saving a life's merit is worth just as much.

231
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:38,882
Since I know that,

232
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:41,402
I can't neglect your injury

233
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,362
just because you took my blood.

234
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:50,402
Marquis,

235
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,722
can you tell me

236
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:55,682
why you took my blood?

237
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,482
You won't do that for no reason.

238
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:05,562
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

239
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:11,762
I took your blood

240
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,882
to do something.

241
00:16:15,522 --> 00:16:16,537
What is it?

242
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,242
Your blood

243
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,842
can help me

244
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:25,220
save a very important person.

245
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,202
I knew you didn't take my blood for no reason.

246
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:31,457
You used it to save someone.

247
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:57,495
Marquis, you can take as much as you want in the future.

248
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:04,104
Don't be too naive.

249
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:05,362
Rest early.

250
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:50,282
(How can she be so unaware and sleep so soundly?)

251
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:56,362
(It's really hard.)

252
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:34,999
Chang Feng.

253
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:39,202
You are awake.

254
00:20:39,944 --> 00:20:40,961
Come.

255
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:45,122
Are you all right?

256
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,780
What happened last night?

257
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:52,722
I don't really remember.

258
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,700
Did I do anything bad?

259
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:58,762
When I was dealing with my brother,

260
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,082
you were afraid that your identity would be exposed,

261
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:03,962
so you used chains

262
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,922
to tie yourself up.

263
00:21:11,524 --> 00:21:13,282
Thankfully, I was prepared.

264
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,122
After you drank black peonies soup,

265
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:29,362
did you also tie yourself up in chains

266
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:31,882
and suffered alone for the next seven days?

267
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,840
Why do you know about black peonies soup?

268
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:44,042
The Yilan Tribe's "Book of Curses" recorded this method.

269
00:21:44,158 --> 00:21:46,242
You also went missing for seven days.

270
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:47,860
Qian Yue.

271
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:49,922
Sorry.

272
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,122
I didn't protect you well on the night of New Year's Eve.

273
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,122
No matter what happens in the future,

274
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:58,166
you must tell me, all right?

275
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:06,962
Chang Feng,

276
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,962
I am pregnant.
