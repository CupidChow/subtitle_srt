1
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,980
(Butterflied Lover)

2
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:28,831
(Episode 14: It Was the Wind That Brushed Up the Moonlight)

3
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:31,672
Commander, a total of 28 Butterfly Slaves' corpses in the city

4
00:00:31,753 --> 00:00:32,917
are incinerated,

5
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:35,070
which sums up to a total of 48 Butterfly Slaves,

6
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:36,831
including the ones that were disposed of some time ago.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,240
This corresponds to the number of Butterfly Slaves on New Year's Eve.

8
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:42,893
However, there are five Butterfly Slaves that are not incinerated

9
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:45,922
and gradually turned back to normal

10
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,002
in the Ministry of Security's dungeon.

11
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,280
Turned back to normal?

12
00:01:15,788 --> 00:01:17,242
Qian Yue,

13
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:19,362
it has been three days.

14
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,602
Can you please wake up?

15
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,191
Malt sugar!

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,400
One tael for each!

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,682
Taking these at specific periods of time benefits the spleen and the heart!

18
00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:37,482
Malt sugar!

19
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:39,038
One tael for each!

20
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:42,642
Taking these at specific periods of time benefits the spleen and the heart!

21
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:58,202
(Wine)

22
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:05,138
(Butterfly Slaves in the city)

23
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:06,682
The commander?

24
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:08,155
It's really him.

25
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,578
He's using the same method as before.

26
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,122
(The commander is to massacre)

27
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:14,914
Chang Feng?

28
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,122
I'm glad that you're awake.

29
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,762
I'm glad that you're awake.

30
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:59,562
I'm fine.

31
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:02,307
I woke up, didn't I?

32
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,015
How is she?

33
00:03:34,103 --> 00:03:35,143
She's fine now.

34
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:39,733
Thank you, Madam Yuan.

35
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:44,051
Chang Feng, Princess Bao Zhu saved me twice.

36
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:45,472
Yes,

37
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:47,705
she did,

38
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,242
so, you have to stay well.

39
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:54,199
We'll take our baby to the princess to reciprocate her favors

40
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,034
when our baby is born.

41
00:03:58,648 --> 00:04:00,002
Are you hungry?

42
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:02,162
Madam Yuan and I will get you something to eat.

43
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:03,441
Have some rest.

44
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:07,583
I'm fine now.

45
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:35,722
Madam Yuan,

46
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:40,431
will Qian Yue's current body condition affect the plan?

47
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:46,258
(Marquis Wu An's Residence)

48
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:50,322
Sergeant Kun.

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,962
Your Highness.

50
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:53,763
Come here.

51
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:59,551
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

52
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:02,882
Sergeant Kun, I'd like to ask you something.

53
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:04,658
Can you

54
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,282
answer me truthfully?

55
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:09,055
Your Highness, please ask.

56
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:12,762
I wanted to ask

57
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:16,082
if you can tell me

58
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:19,562
what happened to the marquis' eldest sister?

59
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:23,367
About that...

60
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,642
Your Highness, I'm afraid I can't talk to you about this.

61
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,722
Sergeant Kun,

62
00:05:31,894 --> 00:05:34,922
you are the best sergeant in Marquis Wu An's Residence.

63
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:37,994
Nobody other than you would be able to answer me this.

64
00:05:39,074 --> 00:05:41,882
Your Highness, only the marquis can talk to you about this.

65
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:46,002
Look, look at the injury on my hand.

66
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,562
I bled so much, yet I don't even know who I was doing this for.

67
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:51,182
How pitiful.

68
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:53,627
So pitiful.

69
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,042
- Your Highness...  - Kun Qing.

70
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:00,402
Marquis.

71
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,263
Have you completed the tasks I assigned you?

72
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:05,482
Marquis, you're back.

73
00:06:09,777 --> 00:06:12,362
Your Highness, you look really pale. You shouldn't be moving around.

74
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,202
You should go back to your room and rest.

75
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,969
- I'm fine, I'm just...  - Your Highness.

76
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,002
Kun Qing and I have something to discuss.

77
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:22,682
I shall go back first, then.

78
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,682
Marquis, I've said too much.

79
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:40,813
The black peony petals shower

80
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:43,054
has cleared all the Butterfly Slaves in the city at once.

81
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:45,322
Find out about Tang Qian Yue's condition.

82
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:46,482
Yes, sir.

83
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:58,250
So, black peonies can kill Butterfly Slaves.

84
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:02,082
Qian Yue must've been in grave danger.

85
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,120
(I wonder how she's doing.)

86
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:10,842
(I have to find a chance to visit them.)

87
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:31,161
Are you feeling better?

88
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:34,193
Much better, don't worry.

89
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:40,832
I feel sorry whenever I think about Princess Bao Zhu

90
00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:42,522
who hurt herself to save me.

91
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:44,042
Right,

92
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:46,602
we owe her many favors.

93
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:49,162
She even wrote us a letter to ask about your condition.

94
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:51,082
Since Madam Yuan was heading out,

95
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,322
I asked her to convey a message to Bao Zhu to reassure her.

96
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,682
Where are you going?

97
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:05,214
Although Madam Yuan is not here,

98
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,602
the interior and exterior of the house need some cleaning.

99
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:11,282
Have some rest, I'll do it.

100
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:13,002
You?

101
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:17,042
You're holding a rag instead of a sword now.

102
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:19,136
You should focus on your pregnancy with peace of mind.

103
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:21,377
Leave everything else to me.

104
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:26,042
You have to clean more thoroughly.

105
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,522
You left out the corners.

106
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,602
Look.

107
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:17,470
I brought you something very important.

108
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,162
What is it?

109
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:25,416
You brought this too?

110
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:57,842
Did you prepare all these?

111
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:00,642
I thought you could only cook noodles.

112
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,122
Chef Liu has been cooking at home for many years,

113
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,122
and I just learned a little bit.

114
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:09,082
I only realized that it was you who had been doing this all these years.

115
00:10:10,238 --> 00:10:13,197
Let me take care of you from now on.

116
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:19,642
Madam Hong used to secretly show off to me that

117
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:22,293
her husband is the only man

118
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:25,362
who knows how to cook and clean in the whole city.

119
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,008
I didn't understand why she was bragging in the past.

120
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:32,152
Now I finally understand how happy she must be.

121
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:36,722
Chang Feng,

122
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:38,455
I am now

123
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,931
truly happy.

124
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,193
Here.

125
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:53,073
Aren't all these

126
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:56,239
what you have been doing for the past three years?

127
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:58,768
I am truly happy, too.

128
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:02,796
Come, eat while it's hot.

129
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:06,682
I shall judge your cooking skills.

130
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:09,056
I'm not sure if it's good.

131
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:13,638
Not bad, right?

132
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:17,762
To be honest, this is better than I expected.

133
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:21,082
Did you secretly practice at home every day without letting me know?

134
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:23,322
I just practiced a little.

135
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:56,682
- You scared me. - Look.

136
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:00,627
Where did you pick these?

137
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,225
Near the back of the mountain.

138
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,730
The weather is fine today.

139
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:06,947
Let's go out for a walk.

140
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:09,442
I haven't finished sewing this.

141
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:10,962
I'll help you when we're back.

142
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:12,162
Let's go.

143
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,655
Wait, at least let me keep it first.

144
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:16,175
I'll help you keep it when we're back.

145
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:21,841
This is the place.

146
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,720
Chang Feng, why are you taking me here?

147
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,204
Give me a moment.

148
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:19,482
I know you like petal showers,

149
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,162
but there are no nice flowers here.

150
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:24,442
I can't give you a special flower petal shower,

151
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,642
so I can only make it up for you with bamboo leaves.

152
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:30,162
I believe there will be a day when black peonies bloom,

153
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,482
and you can stand underneath the petal shower

154
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,962
like the rest of the people on the streets.

155
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:40,442
When we go back, I'm going to tell Madam Hong...

156
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:45,562
No, I'm going to tell everyone that.

157
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:51,592
I have the best husband in the whole world.

158
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:16,922
What's wrong?

159
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,762
Chang Feng, you came just in time. Can you help me scratch my back?

160
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:21,825
- What's wrong?  - It's itchy.

161
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,891
Right here. I can't reach it.

162
00:14:24,057 --> 00:14:26,488
- This spot?  - Yes. Harder.

163
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:28,482
Scratch harder.

164
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:31,308
- Come on, be serious. I'm suffering here.  - Sure.

165
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:32,922
Where is it? Here?

166
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:34,522
Further down.

167
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:35,930
Is this nice?

168
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:41,242
Chang Feng,

169
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,555
I realize it's been a while since I took a bath after I came here.

170
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:52,562
How about you get Madam Hong here to help me take a bath?

171
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:54,965
Why must we trouble her?

172
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:56,442
I'll help you.

173
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,242
Chang Feng,

174
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:25,522
do you really want to help me?

175
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:28,482
We are going to be parents soon.

176
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:30,242
Why not?

177
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:31,602
Come.

178
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:49,482
What a beautiful night.

179
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:50,635
Yes.

180
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:54,402
I had a dream on New Year's Eve.

181
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,682
I dreamed that we happily went to the lantern festival.

182
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:03,322
However,

183
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:06,949
all the beautiful things in the dream did not come true.

184
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:10,105
Only the terrible ones did.

185
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,762
I'm so scared that

186
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,242
this moment is also just a dream.

187
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:30,082
Come here.

188
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:01,473
This is not a dream.

189
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,482
This is real.
