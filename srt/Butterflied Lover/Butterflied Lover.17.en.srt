Qianyue.

5
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,520
Look,

6
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:57,880
all the clothes I brought

7
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:58,961
can hardly fit anymore.

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,720
He has grown so big.

9
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,441
I thought something big happened.

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,201
Isn't this a big deal?

11
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,280
My fault.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,720
I didn't prepare clothes for every stage.

13
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:29,121
How did he grow so fast?

14
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,280
I don't have anything else to do later.

15
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:34,161
I'll buy you some well-fitting clothes, alright?

16
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:35,161
Great.

17
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:36,441
Buy expensive ones.

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,561
Alright.

[Welcome to my mansion. By Ling Changjin.]

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,841
How did you know where I live?

21
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:23,400
I went there with Bao Zhu once.

22
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,281
Oh, I see.

23
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,281
But why am I

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,641
invited over today?

25
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,361
Changfeng,

26
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:37,960
I know your wife

27
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
is a YLBL member,

28
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:41,921
and she's pregnant now.

29
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:45,001
Don't worry,

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,481
I won't do anything to her.

31
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:48,641
I just want to ask you one thing.

32
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:50,600
What is it?

33
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,561
You knew how to save her, didn't you?

34
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,761
I did, then what?

35
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,721
I want to save our sister.

36
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:09,800
Sister?

37
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,641
Sister is really pitiful,

38
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:15,481
lying in this sunless place for years.

39
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,281
Your Royal Highness,

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,040
Prince Wu'an no longer allows me to take your blood.

41
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:22,481
Why did you come here?

42
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,680
I promised,

43
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,721
I will help him save his sister.

44
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,440
I'll do as I say.

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
But you look

46
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,600
so pale.

47
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,841
I've had fair skin since childhood,

48
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,040
always giving people an impression of

49
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:43,561
being weak and fragile.

50
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:47,761
Your Royal Highness,

51
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:48,721
no way,

52
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,160
you better go back.

53
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,440
If he finds out,

54
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,481
he will definitely blame me.

55
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,361
Kun Qing,

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,081
let's just keep it a secret.

57
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,121
Besides,

58
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:58,281
I can take more blood-replenishing meds.

59
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,600
Sister is right here.

60
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,201
Gosh, he is coming.

61
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:03,641
Quick, hide.

62
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,880
Sister.

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,680
I could hardly believe it.

64
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:29,361
But didn't she...

65
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,681
Yilan Clan turned her and others

66
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,201
into YLBL members,

67
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:36,961
and sent them back to our city.

68
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:38,840
I saw her fighting against

69
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,560
our own soldiers,

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,401
and get hurt

71
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,320
by them.

72
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:47,361
When you rushed for the Kirin blood,

73
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,201
our father was ready to burn her.

74
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,440
By the time I got her replaced,

75
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,521
she had already become like this.

76
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:03,361
Neither dead nor living YLBL member.

77
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:05,720
So, you planned

78
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
to revive the butterfly poison in her body,

79
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,160
turning her into a living member,

80
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,600
then to use the purple peony soup

81
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:17,720
to make her normal.

82
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,880
Yes.

83
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,481
After experiencing all these with Qianyue,

84
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,521
I can empathize with you.

85
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,761
But reviving the butterfly poison...

86
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:35,801
But it

87
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,600
requires the Kirin blood.

88
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,521
You married Bao Zhu

89
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:42,280
for her blood.

90
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:44,040
Yes.

91
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:46,600
Only she can do that.

92
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,280
She is so kind and innocent,

93
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,961
longing to marry you.

94
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,681
Even if the Kirin blood is a must,

95
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,521
you should find someone else.

96
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:59,160
Where can we find so much blood?

97
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,320
Don't you know why did

98
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,560
the Yilan Clan want a political marriage with us?

99
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,361
They never wanted a princess,

100
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
but only Bao Zhu.

101
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,120
Kun Qing,

102
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:16,481
what does Prince Wu'an mean by this?

103
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:21,440
What do you mean?

104
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,201
The Clan wanted

105
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:28,201
Bao Zhu's blood to nurture the butterfly poison.

106
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,120
Our sister was given a name by the late emperor

107
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,000
as a substitute for marriage.

108
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:39,241
All this falsehood was exposed.

109
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,160
The Clan in violent rage

110
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:46,641
turned her and others into the members

111
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,641
with the butterfly poison.

112
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,081
It turned out that everything

113
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,840
was caused by me.

114
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:25,320
Why isn't Changfeng back?

115
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:42,440
Changfeng.

116
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,000
Changfeng.

117
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,720
You're finally back.

118
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:57,401
What's wrong?

119
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:12,000
I just feel that life

120
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
is too bitter.

121
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,521
Everyone is bearing their own

122
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,401
indescribable suffering.

123
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,241
I know.

124
00:08:57,081 --> 00:08:58,320
Why didn't you eat?

125
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,120
What do you want to eat?

126
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:14,800
Here.

127
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,841
I can do it myself.

128
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,401
Prince Wu'an.

129
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,680
Princess, the side room is ready.

130
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:52,961
Why?

131
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:54,401
Dr. Xun said

132
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,240
I need rest.

133
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:57,761
Starting from today,

134
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,081
I'll live in the side room.

135
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,680
I'm full.

136
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,521
He Xi,

137
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:04,281
let's go outside for fresh air.

138
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:10,360
Princess, what's going on between you?

139
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:24,761
Bao Zhu,

140
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,560
why are you here?

141
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,281
Qianyue.

142
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,761
What happened to you?

143
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:36,320
I...

144
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,240
Qianyue.

145
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:41,560
Alright, don't cry.

146
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,761
I'm here. Don't worry.

147
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,601
Calm down. Don't cry.

148
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,000
Bao Zhu.

149
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,201
Thank you.

150
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,120
So you were there that day too.

151
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,000
You heard everything we said.

152
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:06,841
Changfeng, don't blame Prince Wu'an.

153
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,880
If it were you,

154
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:11,641
you wouldn't give up on Qianyue either.

155
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,920
He has no other choice

156
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,360
but to save his sister.

157
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:15,281
Besides,

158
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,961
I am willing to give him the blood.

159
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:21,120
Bao Zhu, Changfeng understands that.

160
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,360
But he's really worried about you.

161
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,281
Changfeng, give this to Prince Wu'an.

162
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:38,601
What is this?

163
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:42,601
Kirin blood!

164
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,761
Didn't you...

165
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,601
Changfeng,

166
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:49,440
your sister ended up like that

167
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,360
because of me.

168
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:58,240
I also want to save her.

169
00:11:58,641 --> 00:11:59,360
But never

170
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,800
sacrifice anyone else.

171
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,320
What sacrifice?

172
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:04,161
Just a bit of blood.

173
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
No need to sacrifice my life.

174
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:07,000
And

175
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:08,880
I dragged him into a dilemma.

176
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:11,360
That's why I'm here.

177
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,320
We will find another solution.

178
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:16,721
But until then,

179
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,920
let me continue to do so.

180
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:19,841
Changfeng,

181
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:21,680
persuade him for me, Okay?

182
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,041
Please.

183
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,601
Alright, stops here.

184
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:26,841
Bao Zhu,

185
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,360
you rarely come here.

186
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,601
Let's eat first.

187
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:31,841
Let's go.

188
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,680
Here.

189
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:53,081
Qianyue, what are you doing?

190
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:54,240
Roast sweet potatoes.

191
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,120
Come over quickly.

192
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:55,641
Okay.

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,920
Here.

194
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:00,800
Be careful, it's hot.

195
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:05,680
It smells so good.

196
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:07,961
Is it delicious?

197
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,961
It's so sweet and really delicious.

198
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,120
Can't believe you eat such delicious food

199
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:13,641
for the first time.

200
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:20,041
Bao Zhu,

201
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,480
do you know what my biggest wish

202
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:25,201
has always been?

203
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,920
What is it?

204
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,800
To live as an ordinary person.

205
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:33,920
To live the most ordinary life.

206
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,081
To spend the most ordinary life.

207
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:37,721
Actually, I feel the same way.

208
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,281
But after all these things,

209
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,961
I realized that being an ordinary person

210
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:46,281
and living an ordinary life

211
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:48,521
is the most difficult.

212
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:51,081
Because every ordinary person

213
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:52,120
has to face

214
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,360
various unexpected changes in life.

215
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:56,161
Qianyue,

216
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,201
although I don't understand much of

217
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,721
what you're saying,

218
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,240
I can still understand a little.

219
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:05,081
What I mean is,

220
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:06,841
Bao Zhu,

221
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,880
I can't stop you from

222
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,680
saving the sister.

223
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:12,641
But the blame lies with

224
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:15,480
the greed and cruelty of the Yilan Clan back then.

225
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:16,680
It's not your fault.

226
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,240
You're the best princess in this world.

227
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,000
Really?

228
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,480
So,

229
00:14:26,521 --> 00:14:28,601
don't blame yourself anymore.

230
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
If you've done everything you can

231
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,721
but still can't change it,

232
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:36,240
then just let it be.

233
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:37,281
It's a deal.

234
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,961
C'mon,

235
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:40,601
here,

236
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:41,680
feel it.

237
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:46,401
So soft.

238
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,320
You saved me and my baby.

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,281
Next time,

240
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:54,961
please come and see me

241
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:57,000
and the baby happily, alright?

242
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:01,680
He has grown so fast.

243
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:02,961
Next time you come,

244
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,161
he will be this big.

245
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:28,201
I will handle this.

246
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,440
Don't look at my face.

247
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,041
What's wrong with your face?

248
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,641
Ugly.

249
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:48,401
Let me see.

250
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:50,521
I've seen every look of you.

251
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:58,240
Ms. Yuan said,

252
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,161
as the pregnancy progresses,

253
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,880
I will become like this.

254
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:06,440
Look,

255
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,880
it's ugly, isn't it?

256
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:14,401
A storm in a teacup.

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,401
Auntie Hong said she was also like this

258
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:17,041
when she was pregnant.

259
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:18,281
She returned to normal after giving birth.

260
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:20,841
Really?

261
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:24,641
But,

262
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,521
you did look a bit of pale today.

263
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,081
I'll apply some lip balm for you.

264
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,320
Ms. Yuan said

265
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:36,120
both you and the baby are doing well.

266
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
Don't worry.

267
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:39,601
Everything will be fine.

268
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,680
Look,

269
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,401
it's the same as usual, right?

270
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:13,281
Changfeng,

271
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:18,441
I've been wanting to ask you,

272
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,000
when did you

273
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,600
truly wanna keep the baby?

274
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:26,240
Silly girl,

275
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,161
this child connects us.

276
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:31,600
I always wanted him to be born.

277
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,321
I love him too.

278
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,480
Are you hungry?

279
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,041
I'll make you some breakfast.

280
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,801
Take a rest.

281
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,080
Don't catch a cold.

282
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:54,600
Don't worry.

283
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:10,840
Almost there, Changfeng.

284
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,921
Let me take care of

285
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,480
this last thing for you.

286
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:18,801
Only one month left.

287
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,480
It's time to prepare.
