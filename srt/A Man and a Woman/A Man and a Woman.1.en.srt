1
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,357
Yeah.

2
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,527
Her session just ended.

3
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,283
We're heading home now.
Yeah, OK.

4
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,744
Dial 8282

00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,253

00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,709

7
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,922
Here comes
my handsome son!

8
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,212
Dial 8282

9
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,255
Hi!

10
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,675
I was just wondering what song it is
the jonghwa sings all the time?

11
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,344
It's from a TV commercial in Korea.

12
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,842
OK.
Good bye!

13
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,684
Go... go...

14
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:01,520
Hurry to Loan Loan King.

15
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,191
There's a car coming.

16
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,537
What is it, Jong-hwa?

17
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,839
I was afraid
you might get hurt.

18
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,473
Mom is sorry, okay?

19
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,312
Mom is sorry.

20
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,025
Yes, sorry.

21
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,816
Mom is sorry.

22
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,032
Mom is sorry.

23
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,948
Mom is sorry.

24
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,508
Kids who went to the camp
said it's great.

25
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,801
You'll have fun.

26
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:20,011
I'm worried you'll like it so much
you won't come back.

27
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,641
I love you.

28
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,772
Speedy Loan Loan King

29
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,065
Please..

30
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,527
I'm afraid not.
You have to follow our rules.

31
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,579
I'll just watch from a distance.

32
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,115
I won't get in your way

33
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,789
Yes.. But there's no point to this camp,
if parents comes along.

34
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,547
You just have to trust us
and let us take care of him

35
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,421
I promis.
I won't be in your way.

36
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,794
My son needs me with him.

37
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,840
If you're this concerned, then maybe
you should take him home with you

38
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,717
<i>Parden?</i>

39
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,850
Think about the reason
you came all the way here.

40
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:51,109
No interest for
first two months

41
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,903
regardless of credit rating...

42
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,956
Excuse me.

43
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,539
Do you have a light?

44
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,482
Thank you

45
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,737
You're from Korea, right?

46
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,486
Yes.

47
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,616
Is the camp far from here?

48
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,749
It's near Tampere.
It'll take 3 to 4 hours.

49
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,687
You're really okay with this?

50
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,015
Yes.

51
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,941
Anyway...

52
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,980
You thanked me already.

53
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,540
Are you sure we're going
in the right direction?

54
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,630
Yes.

55
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,177
You don't talk much.

56
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,973
Not really.

57
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,288
It's over there.

58
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,599
It's dangerous.

59
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,600
No, it's not. You can come.

60
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,776
Let's go to the camp.

61
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,782
Across this lake?

62
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,278
We need to get to the kids.

63
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,999
We can go by car,
but let's try this way.

64
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,084
Just kidding.

65
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,732
Let's go back now.

66
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,361
We're not seeing the kids?

67
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,405
It's okay.
I've seen where they are.

68
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,263
Your coffee.

69
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,762
Only one cup?

70
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,181
I don't drink coffee
because of my stomach.

71
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,189
But all they have to eat
are sandwiches.

72
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,020
Coffee is enough.

73
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,276
I think you should eat
something warm.

74
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,280
That would be nice,
but we'd better hurry.

75
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,699
Shall we?

76
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,368
How about finding
a place to eat first?

77
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,248
My treat.
You drove all this way.

78
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,179
This kind of food
don't suit me.

79
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,135
My tastes are too Korean.

80
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,351
I like soybean paste
and that sort of thing.

81
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,271
So when I go abroad,
I carry around red-pepper paste.

82
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,444
Do you have it with you?

83
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,734
Why?

84
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,782
May I have it?

85
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,220
Is it good?

86
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,971
Yes.

87
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,370
So you've been here two years.

88
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,160
Is life better here?

89
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,161
Well, it's alright.

90
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,500
It took some time
getting used to it.

91
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,333
But life is the same everywhere.

92
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,342
What?

93
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,973
What kind of answer is that?
Vague and thoughtless.

94
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,854
I mean, it's nice.

95
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,352
Quiet and dean.

96
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,356
Lots of snow...

97
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,047
The roads blocked,
we need to wait.

98
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,548
Until when?

99
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,884
It has to stop snowing first,
so they don't know yet.

100
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,508
What shall we do...?

101
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:24,388
You can probably catch a train
at Tampere.

102
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,976
Let's try that.

103
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,317
And you stay here alone?

104
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,231
I guess.

105
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,445
It's a common thing here.

106
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,942
Then I'll wait with you.

107
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,277
It might take really long.

108
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,076
It's alright,
we're near the camp anyways.

109
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,623
I'll bet the kids
are doing better than we are.

110
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,481
So did your girl get better
living here?

111
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,068
Well, yes and no.

112
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,231
- Another vague answer.
- No, I mean it.

113
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,903
You can't see progress on
the outside.

114
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,281
Depression isn't cured easily.

115
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:33,048
Oh, I thought she was like my son,
being at the same school.

116
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,965
The condition of my son is...

117
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,552
really quite bad.

118
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:59,069
Since coming here,
I check the time constantly.

119
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,988
I've lost all sense of
if it's day or night.

120
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,499
I've been there, too.

121
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,674
- You're up.
- Hi...

122
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,648
Why are you up so early?

123
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,731
I thought I'd take a walk.

124
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,273
We walked quite a bit,
are you okay?

125
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,608
I'm fine.

126
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,771
The place I work
is by a mountain.

127
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,148
So every day I walk
up and down the hill.

128
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,658
Which mountain?

129
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,654
Mt. Namsan.

130
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,825
You can call it a mountain, too.

131
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,886
Look.

132
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,598
I think it's a sauna.

133
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,274
Are you okay?

134
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,673
Is it okay to just come in?

135
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,759
Don't know.

136
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,909
Someone's just been here.

137
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,269
A sauna deep in the forest...

138
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,355
People here love saunas.

139
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,694
They say Finns build themselves
saunas before houses.

140
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,534
Even 100 years ago,
women gave birth in saunas.

141
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,454
They even have a legend

142
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:01,792
about 'Saunatonttu',
an elf living in the sauna.

143
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:06,878
If people are naughty here,
the elf gets angry and...

144
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,968
Sorry.

145
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,515
What were you talking about?

146
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,812
About...

147
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,770
the elf in the sauna.

148
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,572
I woke up this morning,

149
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,492
And I was alone.

150
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:29,075
I thought Pd fall apart
if my son wasn't by my side.

151
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,045
But strangely, I felt calm.

152
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,045
I haven't felt that before...

153
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,944
Take care.

154
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:04,947
Wait.

155
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,655
I don't even know your name.

156
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,011
It's me.

157
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,725
Hey...

158
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,805
Did I wake you up? Sorry.

159
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,891
Today is Sunday.

160
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,226
Is something wrong?

161
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,694
No, I just called.

162
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,098
Hi.

163
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:59,099

164
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,438
Your feet are cold?
Yes, let's go home.

165
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,933
- My feet...
- Poor Jong-hwa's feet are cold?

Hurry to Loan Loan King.

174
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,027
He seems to be calmer.

175
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,117
How was it there?

176
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,445
Okay.

177
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:01,790
- Heard it's freaking cold.
- Yeah, it is.

178
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,998
But it's nice.
Quiet and dean.

179
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,001
Lots of snow.

180
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,791
We have quite a lot here, too.

181
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,468
It's different, really.

182
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,842
What's so different?

183
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,391
It's just...

184
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,849

00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,863
With this high ceiling,
it feels too big.

187
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,492
It seems that way
because of the glass.

188
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,578
But the mood totally changes
after sunset.

189
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:51,374
How many guests
were you thinking?

190
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,259
About 200 to 300?

191
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,215
What do you think?

192
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,055
I like the open space,

193
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,802
but with a square shape
the runway and seating

194
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,516
Will be hard to arrange
in an interesting way.

195
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,149
Shall we keep looking?
There's not much time.

196
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,108
Finding a place with
glass walls won't be easy.

197
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:18,200
And if you think about parking,
there wouldn't be

198
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,110
better options in Seoul
for a fashion show venue.

199
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,911
Hello, Teacher.

200
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,122
I want to see how
it looks like in the evening.

201
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:27,125
- I went to Jong-hwa's school.
- So?

202
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,954
He tore up
his classmates' textbooks.

203
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,294
Thank god
he didn't hit anyone.

204
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,626
Did you pay them?

205
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,053
I sent them the money
and gift certificates.

206
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,889
Called all of them to apologize.

207
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,221
Problem solved then.

208
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,978
How about transferring
out of Gangnam district?

209
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:51,267
Schools near here are more difficult,
and the parents are picky.

210
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,562
Look, Ms. Lee Sang-min.

211
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,441
You think that's
the real issue here?

212
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,657
Ordinary schools will
all be the same.

213
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,577
But we could at least try.

214
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,130
I told you not to insist
on an ordinary school.

215
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,133
Special schools in Korea
aren't bad.

216
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,387
But special schools...

217
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:29,684
We need to face reality.

218
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:35,652
From an objective view,
this is vanity.

219
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,655
Great, you know its name!

220
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,113
Crabs walk sideways
like this...

221
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,573
There are so many!

222
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,577
Which animal is your favorite?

223
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,032
- Hello!
- Yes? Hello.

224
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,792
What brings you here?

225
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,374
Pardon?

226
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,755
What are you doing here?

227
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:23,093
I was...passing by.
I had business near here.

228
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,435
CEO Lee Sang-min.

229
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,438
I didn't expect that.

230
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,321
You mean the work I do
doesn't suit me?

231
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,408
I just didn't see you
as a CEO type.

232
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,250
What exactly does
a CEO look like?

233
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,292
I didn't mean to...

234
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,791
It's okay.
It's just a title.

235
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,675
I'm hired to manage
the boutique.

236
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,420
The real owner is someone else.

237
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,432
Her...?

238
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,181
Yes.

239
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,697
Are you back for good?

240
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:33,406
Yes...and no.

241
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,245
Guess you got well.

242
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,250
You said you don't drink coffee
because of your stomach.

243
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,878
You remember that...

244
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,680
The display team is here.

245
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,891
- Shall I tell them to wait?
- Yes.

246
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,733
You must be busy.
Go ahead.

247
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,242
It's not a coincidence, is it?

248
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,417
50/50.

249
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,337
It's nice to see you.

250
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:34,926
It's a little distracting
because of the reflection.

251
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,268
Then how about taking out
some pendants?

252
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,228
<i>IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU TOO.
KIM KI-HONG</i>

253
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,475
What do you think?

254
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:48,280
Or should we take out
all of them?

255
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,708
This is so heavy...

256
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,417
Where's Yoo-rim? Sleeping?

257
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,215
Yeah.

258
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,256
You working?

259
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,962
Need to change the layout.

260
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,971
Sena's giving you a hard time?

261
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,424
You're friends,
she can go easy on you.

262
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,968
Does she have to play the client?

263
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,516
The wine was on sale.

264
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,777
- You want some?
- Sure.

265
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,786
Did you accept that job?

266
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:41,291
I met them today
and asked for more time.

267
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,536
Need to think about it.

268
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,378
Anyway I need to finish
Sena's gallery first...

269
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,012
Are you okay?

270
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,806
This opener sucks.

271
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,858
I'll do it. Leave it.

272
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,023
I'll shower first.
Don't drink without me.

273
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,055
<i>Why do we feel stress?</i>

274
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,351
<i>The bottom line is
there's only one reason.</i>

275
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:53,692
We want something, but because of
inner or outer obstacles,

276
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,069
we can't get it...

277
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,692
and we perceive
a feeling of discomfort.

278
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,452
<i>IT'S KIM KI-HONG.
CAN WE TALK NOW?</i>

279
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,030
Jong-hwa!

280
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,373
No, Jong-hwa!

281
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,081
That's not for drinking!

282
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,585
It's dirty!

283
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,038
Are you okay?

284
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,957
Let me handle it.

285
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:15,048
Enough, Jong-hwa.
Let's stop it.

286
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,472
My baby will catch a cold.

287
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,885
Let's dry your body.

288
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,977
Oh no, Jong-hwa.

289
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,738
Let's stop. It's dirty.

290
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,906
Jong-hwa!

291
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,359
Stop, Jong-hwa please!

292
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,135
Now my son can outfight me.

293
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,067
<i>I looked through
the pictures you sent.</i>

294
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,901
<i>Is there any place more casual?</i>

295
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,898
I'm on it.
Don't worry.

296
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,113
Mr. Kim from Busan's on hold.
Will you take it?

297
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,579
<i>Oh the second brand?
How's it going?</i>

298
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,616
I'll go to Busan
to present it myself.

299
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,617
<i>Good. Thanks!</i>

300
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,045
Hello.

301
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,049
Hello.

302
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,059
Hello...

303
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,730
Were you waiting for me?

304
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,062
You can say that.

305
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,649
You could've called.

306
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,527
I texted you a few days ago.

307
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,905
But you didn't reply <i>so...</i>

308
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,073
I'm sorry, I forgot.

309
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,002
- Have you had lunch?
- Not yet.

310
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,502
I know a nice place.
Want to go?

311
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:25,090
You need to eat anyway.

312
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,156
Lunch is ready.

313
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,658
You said it's
a nice restaurant.

314
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,502
Isn't it nice?

315
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:58,006
Quiet, nice view.

316
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,549
Why isn't anyone here?

317
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,004
They went out for lunch.
One person needs to stay on site.

318
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,887
Here.
Your favorite, soybean stew.

319
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,563
So this is what you do.

320
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,060
I didn't expect that.

321
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,151
Meaning the work I do
doesn't suit me?

322
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,566
Right.

323
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,155
Just kidding.

324
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,654
Oh, it's good.

325
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,994
Do you like your job?

326
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,077
I chose it because I liked it.

327
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,997
But now, sometimes I do,
sometimes I don't.

328
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,002
It's your habit.

329
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,174
Giving vague answers.

330
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,298
Is it?

331
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,976
It's amazing.

332
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,313
To have a place like this
in a container building.

333
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,777
The containers are narrow.

334
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:09,658
So we extended the deck here
like a center garden.

335
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,136
Isn't it a little chilly?

336
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,806
You're warmer now.

337
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,664
So what's the progress
of the construction?

338
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,667
About 70% done.

339
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,356
Did you have lunch, Ki-hong?

340
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,236
When do we pick up the jewelry?

341
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,657
The cawing will be done this week.
I'll go this weekend.

342
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,205
We'd better hurry.
The boss is arriving next week.

343
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,046
Yes, ma'am.
I should've gotten it earlier.

344
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:28,382
Ran, how's the
presentation file coming?

345
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,342
I'm working on it now.
It'll be done tomorrow.

346
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,756
Okay.

347
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,350
. I'm going.
- Okay, bye.

348
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,843
I'll wait downstairs.

349
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,934
Are you staying?

350
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,351
I think I should leave too.

351
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,184
It's quite late, right?
I'm sorry.

352
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,104
Jong-hwa fell asleep
in the fitting room again.

353
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,276
Got it.

354
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,029
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

355
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,743
Shall we grab a bite?

356
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,456
- At this hour?
- Why not?

357
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,285
I'm here to shop for clothes.
Am I too late?

358
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,748
We're closed.

359
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:50,044
I see.

360
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,755
Shall I come another time?

361
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:15,107
What if you showed up
and I weren't here?

362
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,283
Then I'd go home.

363
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,243
It's true.

364
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,162
It ended at my father.

365
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:33,332
- It wasn't passed down to me.
- You're stuttering.

366
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,295
I just have a hand tremor.

367
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,001
Hi Mom.

368
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,634
We'll grill the beef and stuff.

369
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,302
You know he can cook.

370
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,180
<i>Why do you always
make him do everything?</i>

371
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:50,929
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mom, I'll call you back.

372
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,723
Where's your daughter?

373
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,316
In her room.

374
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,937
Why not have her eat with us?

375
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,654
She's not comfortable
with strangers yet.

376
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,492
She's a shy girl.

377
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,953
Just like you.

378
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:16,378
Should I walk naked
around the neighborhood?

379
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,341
Stop, I brought my girlfriend!

380
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:24,178
- This is really pretty.
- Isn't it?

381
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,343
They have great furniture
in Finland.

382
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,966
Like Alvar Aalto.
Why didn't you ship some back?

383
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:34,309
I wanted to, but I couldn't.
Things were so uncertain.

384
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,649
Why, are you going
back to Finland?

385
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,726
Giving it some thought.

386
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,066
But I thought you'll
join Han's company.

387
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,157
You should decide quick.
My gallery is almost done.

388
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,159
- I also...
- Right?

389
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,405
That precious gallery's
tied him up for months.

390
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:56,081
I thought he came back
to Seoul for my sake.

391
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:00,422
But it turns out
it was for your gallery.

392
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,338
Or was it just an excuse

393
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,345
for something else
between you two?

394
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,345
I suppose that's possible.

395
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,811
That's a bad joke.

396
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,811
How do you say “Cheers" in Finnish?

397
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:26,282
It's fine. I have a meeting
early tomorrow, that's all.

398
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,827
Don't worry, just keep up
with the gallery work.

399
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,035
Let's go!

400
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,405
Thank you for the dinner.

401
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,249
- Take care.
- Bye.

402
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,304
That looks dangerous.

403
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,807
Moon-ju!
Come down, you'll get hurt.

404
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,480
You come up, too!

405
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,607
Moon-ju!

406
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:09,321
Such a coward!

407
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,860
Come down, I said!

408
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,331
Ki-hong.

409
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:30,672
It's my sweet girl!

410
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,184
<i>Oh...you peed.</i>

411
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:42,271
Don't go! I'll be right back.

412
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,158
If you want to see a whale

413
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,873
you'll have to
just ignore the roses.

414
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,870
And all their pink
and all their sweet

415
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:48,546
and all their wild
and all their waving.

416
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,886
<i>I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'RE DOING OK</i>

417
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,357
<i>DELETE</i>

418
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,672
Yoo-rim, what are you doing?

419
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,773
Moon-ju! Moon-ju!

420
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,369
You tired?
You haven't slept at all.

421
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:04,871
I'm alright.

422
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,709
I'll take her at my house
when she leaves hospital.

423
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,624
Yoo-rim, too.

424
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,794
Since she wants to
stay by her mom.

425
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:22,514
What should I do?
Got to take care of my girl.

426
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,356
Don't blame yourself,
it's not the first time.

427
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,354
Her mood swings

428
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,448
and victim mentality...

429
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,078
She got married too young,

430
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:46,868
and depended too much on you.
She could never grow up.

431
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,876
How could you forget this?

432
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:41,134
That presentation caused us
so much trouble.

433
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,550
Come on.
I'll drive you to the station.

434
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,484
One minute.

435
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,726
What are you doing here?

436
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,147
Did you eat breakfast?

437
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,737
I'm hungry.

438
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:47,742
Sorry, I don't have time.
I have a train to catch.

439
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:52,201
- Going where?
- Busan. For work.

440
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,170
I'll give you a ride.

441
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,047
To Busan?

442
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:03,011
Why not?
I gave you a ride once before.

443
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,178
You don't have to today.

444
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,219
Then just to the station.

445
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,648
Sang-min!

446
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,653
You look terrible.
You didn't even shave.

447
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,910
What's up?

448
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:28,988
Do I look that bad?

449
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,996
Maybe because
I skipped breakfast.

450
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,058
- Don't skip breakfast.
- Yup.

451
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,729
And shave, too!

452
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,266
<i>KIM KI-HONG</i>

453
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,805
You want something to eat?

454
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,318
Here you go.

455
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,758
So laid-back.

456
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,393
Me?

457
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,015
You seem to have nothing
to worry about.

458
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,942
Do I look that way?

459
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,363
Do you work at all?

460
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:13,368
The construction
is almost complete.

461
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:17,865
Then you're going back
to Finland?

462
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,755
I wish I could,

463
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,874
but I don't think I can.

464
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,384
There you go again.

465
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,337
I can't go back
because of you.

466
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:05,871
I wasn't sleeping.

467
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,250
You even snored.
Go back to sleep.

468
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,256
You're too far away.

469
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,344
Don't want to bother you.

470
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,170
You'd better go now.

471
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:59,762
I want to see you off this time.

472
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:05,351
Okay then.

473
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,336
What are you drinking for?

474
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:37,304
Celebrating... we passed
the final building inspection.

475
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,340
Sorry, I should've taken care of it.

476
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,469
Forget it.
We took care of it anyhow.

477
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,846
I assumed you couldn't make it.

478
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,182
You look terrible.

479
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:55,026
Well, that's to be expected.

480
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,538
I don't know...

481
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,204
why everything in my life
is so vague.

482
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,840
You realize it now?

483
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,218
You've been that way
since you were little.

484
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:24,559
I have a date. Gotta go.

485
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:29,977
Hey...

486
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,604
something's different about you.

487
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,446
It's not just because
of your wife, is it?

488
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:50,460
This is our first big investment
in the fashion business,

489
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:54,127
so we're depending on you
for a great result.

490
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:59,637
Money types like us should
support artists, shouldn't we?

491
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:04,300
- Ms. Lee will do it great.
- We have to have good results, seriously.

492
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:08,053
Take the call,
a busy person like you.

493
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,227
<i>Busy?</i>

494
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,569
A little.

495
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,613
Ah...

496
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,453
Hello?

497
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,865
<i>Did you drink?</i>

498
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,962
Yes... a little.

499
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:39,042
Get some rest.
You looked really tired.

500
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,301
1 just...

501
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,138
<i>wanted to hear your voice.</i>

502
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:50,686
<i>Okay, then.</i>

503
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,368
You're warm.

504
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,796
I wish I could sleep like this.

505
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:11,670
Go ahead.

506
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,678
What time is It now?

507
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:22,684
The watch...

508
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:24,687
No.

509
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:31,774
It's better not to know.

510
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:43,369
I like this place.
Excellent choice.

511
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,242
Thank god you like it.

512
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,960
I had so much trouble finding it.

513
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,629
How's Dad doing?

514
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,380
The same.

515
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,804
Says he feels anxious
after giving up smoking.

516
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,681
He wants to leave New York
because of terrorism.

517
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,842
He hates everywhere.

518
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:06,813
LA's too boring, and he's scared
of earthquakes in San Francisco.

519
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,977
What are we going to do
with him?

520
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,441
He could come here.

521
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:11,939
Seoul?

522
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,857
No way, he's scared of the war.

523
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,439
That's our Dad...

524
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:22,616
Hello! So, they wanna change rehersal schedule.
Push back in an hour. Is that okay?

525
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:24,864
OK

526
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:25,706
You need anything?

527
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,371
Ne. Everything's fine.

528
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:28,618
- Alright.
- Yeah.

529
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,545
Are you two serious?

530
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:35,041
My relationships are
always serious, every time.

531
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:40,047
But if you mean marriage,
then... not yet.

532
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,557
I don't think
I could live like you.

533
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,059
What do you mean,
live like me?

534
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,891
Happily married. Aren't you?

535
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:58,110
She talks quite a lot
to the kitty.

536
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,610
Do they connect in some way?

537
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:03,903
Curious.

538
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,078
She looks good, right?
Yoo-rim.

539
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,040
You do, too.

540
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,044
Still, I'm locked up.

541
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,549
Why do you think so?
Who's locking you up?

542
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:27,556
You must think
you know me well,

543
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,598
but you don't.

544
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,547
What do you think, Sang-min?

545
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,964
Good. A little more
glamour wouldn't hurt.

546
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,051
Hun...gry.

547
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,053
You said 'hungry'?

548
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,809
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?

549
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,053
OK. I'm sorry.

550
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,730
Sang-min, let's eat first.

551
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:14,645
Let's resume after lunch.

552
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:24,658
- Keep those outfits.
- Yes.

553
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:27,745
- Put things in order.
- Yes.

554
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,558
How can I help you?

555
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:52,141
I'm looking for
Mr. Kim Ki-hong.

556
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:57,066
He's not here now.
What do you need?

557
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:00,561
I'm a friend of his.

558
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,148
I was just passing by.

559
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,905
He won't be in today.

560
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:09,988
I see.

561
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,448
And your name is...?

562
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:16,160
I'll call him later.

563
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,054
Excuse me!

564
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:35,977
Did you happen to know...that he's going through some trouble lately?

565
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:43,654
You didn't.

566
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,905
Well...

567
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:53,164
His wife is very ill.

568
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,545
Which clothes go with these?

569
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:04,838
These ones.

570
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,807
Or something like this with
a similar tone could work.

571
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,095
Your phone is ringing.

572
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,765
- These are good.
- Really?

573
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,263
Then we'll change them all.
What about this?

574
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,981
That one goes with...

575
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:31,660
Yes.

576
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:33,533
<i>Can you talk?</i>

577
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,076
Go ahead, please.

578
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,162
Hello?

579
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:45,542
- It's strange.
- What's strange?

580
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,545
<i>You sound strange.</i>

581
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,765
<i>And you look worried.</i>

582
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,071
Come out for a sec.

583
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:13,861
<i>I can't, I'm busy.</i>

584
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,868
<i>You came to see me earlier.</i>

585
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,258
You won't talk to me?

586
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,030
Let's just have sex.

587
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:55,077
What's this about?

588
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,744
You like me, and I like you too.
That's enough.

589
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,412
Why bother talking?

590
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:06,376
Sang-min!

591
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:15,013
I just want to talk to you.

592
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,179
What's there to talk about?

593
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:20,769
Why are you so angry?

594
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:31,359
I need a cigarette.

595
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,359
Can you buy some for me?

596
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,370
I'm not angry at you.

597
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:49,749
At myself...

598
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,751
I'm angry at myself.

599
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,868
<i>WE SHOULD END IT HERE.
LET'S END WHEN IT'S BEST.</i>

600
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,040
Let's go, Jong-hwa!

601
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,123
Hello.

602
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:14,124
Be careful!

603
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,335
<i>How could you !eave like that?</i>

604
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,181
I'm sorry, but please
don't call me again.

605
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:29,015
<i>If you're really sorry,
tel! me in person.</i>

606
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,184
<i>I can't end it like this.</i>

607
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:02,385
It's better to end it now,
before it gets too hard.

608
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,598
Was it nothing to you?

609
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:14,106
What can we do?
We don't have a choice.

610
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,197
<i>INCOMING CALL: LEE HA-JUNG</i>

611
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:24,407
Hello, Ha-jung.

612
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:26,872
Hi, are you on your way?

613
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:28,616
What are you talking about?

614
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,828
I'm waiting for Jong-hwa.

615
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:34,121
He went in a while ago.

616
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:36,465
<i>I've been waiting
here at the entrance.</i>

617
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:42,220
Wait...
You haven't met him yet?

618
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:46,309
No, did you really see him
come in here?

619
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,972
Just before...

620
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:54,399
I'm sure he went in.

621
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:55,938
<i>Where is he then?</i>

622
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,108
<i>Let me look for him.</i>

623
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,865
I'll go now.
Call me if you find him.

624
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:12,668
I'm almost there.
Did you find him?

625
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:15,374
The instructors and I
searched every floor

626
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,294
But I don't think
he's in the building.

627
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:21,634
Then...what do...

628
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,047
He could be outside.

629
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:27,057
I'll go out and look for him.

630
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:29,685
Please do that.
I'll look for him on the way.

631
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:59,335
Don't worry, he'll be alright.

632
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,727
Should we go a bit further...?

633
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:38,328
Look!

634
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,723
Jong-hwa!

635
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,392
Jong-hwa!

636
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,316
What are you doing here
in the rain?

637
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:05,406
Let's go home.
Come with Mommy.

638
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:08,241
- Drifting away.
- What?

639
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,660
Drifting away.

640
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:14,244
Drifting away.

641
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:21,247
Give me his shoe.

642
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:29,676
Sang-min!

643
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,432
I found your shoe!

644
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,146
My shoe...

645
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,274
My shoe...

646
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:51,235
- Mommy found it!
- My shoe...

647
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:52,828
Let's go home now.

648
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:10,053
Years ago,
while playing by the sea

649
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,594
his shoe came off and
was swept away by the waves.

650
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,262
He must've remembered it.

651
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:17,769
A memory hard
for a kid to forget...

652
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:24,773
You found it for him.
Now he can forget it.

653
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:29,782
Some memories are
better when forgotten.

654
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,744
The sea .

655
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:35,658
The sea .

656
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:37,824
Sea...

657
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:39,582
The sea. <i>. .</i>

658
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:40,872
You want to go to the sea?

659
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:43,791
Let's go again sometime.

660
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:46,874
<i>The sea... sea...</i>

661
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:48,755
The sea. <i>. .</i>

662
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,262
The sea. <i>. .</i>

663
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,752
Thank you.

664
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:36,594
I'm glad you were with me.

665
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:48,686
You're not answering?

666
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:01,240
You're not answering?

667
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,376
They can call back.

668
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,764
It seems whenever we meet,
we're traveling.

669
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:20,597
It's true.

670
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,351
Shall we not go back?

671
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:27,600
Sure.

672
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:35,365
I'm not kidding.

673
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:42,994
We really are in trouble.

674
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:55,669
What did you draw?

675
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:57,508
- Shoe.
- Hold on, Jong-hwa.

676
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:59,677
Why is a shoe in the sea?

677
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:02,012
It drifted away.

678
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,975
I see, it drifted away.

679
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:07,481
But whose shoe is it?

680
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:15,856
Despite getting so soaked,
he seems to be fine.

681
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,608
That's a relief.

682
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:19,944
Why go to the sea,
all of a sudden?

683
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:24,035
He wanted to go.

684
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:27,785
Well done.

685
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:32,252
Sometimes you need to be impulsive.

686
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:38,257
<i>This is heart-shaped.</i>

687
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:40,631
<i>Right! How many are there?</i>

688
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,684
One, two, three...

689
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:47,805
Dad is home.

690
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,436
Here you are.

691
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:53,443
Are you done eating?

692
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:56,442
Really? Then I'll take that.

693
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,360
Did you eat?

694
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:04,621
I made pasta.
You want some?

695
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:08,705
Yoo-rim, brush your teeth.

696
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:14,791
It's a simple one I made
with the things in the fridge.

697
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:28,640
You know...

698
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:34,935
I like you a lot.

699
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:38,939
Maybe too much.

700
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:46,118
I needed a man who
loves me as a woman.

701
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:48,790
I didn't want a guardian.

702
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:53,791
But with you
I feel like a patient.

703
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:57,041
I know...

704
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,051
I'm a bit weird.

705
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:04,548
And you, staying by my side...

706
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:09,560
The thought just came to me.

707
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:13,356
Have I ever understood
my husband?

708
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,612
It must've been
so hard on him.

709
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:23,950
He must've been so lonely.

710
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:59,652
Daddy's fine.

711
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,551
Check if it's correct.
One, two, three, four.

712
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:35,726
That's right.

713
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,980
Much better, right?

714
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:42,820
Are the earrings too much?

715
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:44,564
We'll change it later.

716
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:48,739
Is this the right order?
Doesn't it overlap?

717
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:52,997
Make a fierce look!

718
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:55,542
Good.

719
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:59,208
It's me.
Can we talk?

720
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:01,460
<i>Yes.</i>

721
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,881
<i>You must be busy.</i>

722
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:08,547
Today's the big day,
so it's been hectic.

723
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:10,549
How have you been?

724
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:14,804
Ma'am.
Your sister's looking for you.

725
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,890
Sorry. I'll call you later.

726
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:22,728
<i>I miss you.</i>

727
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:27,239
<i>Let's meet after the show.</i>

728
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:33,705
It'll be quite late.
Is that okay?

729
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,666
I'll wait.

730
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:02,559
Good job, everyone!

731
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:08,573
Your sister was tired,
so she went back to the hotel.

732
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:09,566
I know.

733
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:13,745
Her boyfriend is quite cute.

734
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,914
Though I'm not really into
foreign guys.

735
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:21,077
I'm glad the show went well.

736
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:24,339
- Aren't you?
- Yeah, me too.

737
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,759
Take her stuff.

738
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:33,094
I'll drive you home.

739
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:37,303
- I'll manage, go ahead.
- Alright then.

740
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,266
Let's go!

741
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:42,273
Take care. Good job today!

742
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:44,643
Thank you, good night!

743
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:56,075
Shall we call mom?

744
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:02,002
Look, Jong-hwa.
Mommy's over there!

745
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:10,836
<i>Jong-hwa...</i>

746
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:13,175
Surprised to see us?

747
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,257
The show finished early?

748
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:20,145
Jong-hwa, if we were any later,
we would have missed her.

749
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:22,018
What brings you here?

750
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,191
Jong-hwa's been
missing you all clay.

751
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:28,858
So we decided to take a drive
and pick you up.

752
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:31,397
You must be tired.

753
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:35,743
Let's bring Mommy home.

754
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:46,208
You're not coming?

755
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,422
Be careful, son.

756
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,190
So your busy stretch
is over now?

757
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:15,075
Jong-hwa, let's take
a trip with mom, shall we?

758
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:51,486
<i>I'M SO SORRY, TONIGHT I CAN'T</i>

759
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:03,449
What?

760
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:05,491
You're going out?

761
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:08,123
Yes.

762
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:10,041
Going where?

763
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:13,504
I need to see someone.

764
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,469
At this hour?

765
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:22,476
I see...
It seems you have a lover?

766
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:27,848
Yeah.

767
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:39,367
I can't live without him.

768
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:45,039
You don't have to forgive me.

769
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:49,164
Even I can't forgive myself.

770
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:53,506
Lee Sang-min.

771
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:57,048
Sit down here fur a sec.

772
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:00,133
Let's talk it through.

773
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:02,348
- I'm sorry, really.
- Lee Sang-min!

<i>ONE YEAR LATER</i>

775
01:38:38,955 --> 01:38:40,957
You want me to come
for no reason?

776
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:43,209
<i>Does it have to be for work?</i>

777
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:45,678
<i>Just come and have fun.</i>

778
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:49,971
New York is too cold.
I'll go when it warms up.

779
01:38:50,216 --> 01:38:52,344
Dad's worried about you.

780
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:54,520

<i>Alright, let's talk again.</i>

783
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:09,489
Bye, sis.

784
01:39:52,695 --> 01:39:56,620
It would catch more light,
if they touched the traverse.

785
01:39:57,533 --> 01:40:00,537
Yes, but also disrupt the flow of
light in the room.

786
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:02,376
That's true

787
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:10,471

788

791
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:39,761
Ah.. Where is the toilet?

792
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,888
Toilet? Just around
the corner over there.

793
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:49,316
Give me a bite.

798
01:43:53,853 --> 01:43:55,355
