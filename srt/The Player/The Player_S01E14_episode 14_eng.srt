1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,170

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,780

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,220

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,260

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,050

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,770

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:38,590

8
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,050

9
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:52,010

10
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,630
Why are you guys here?

11
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,440
We came because we thought you were going to get your ass beaten.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,950
Stop trying to act cool all by yourself.

13
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,840
Thanks anyway.

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,500
You can go ahead. I'll handle this.

15
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,420
Go follow him quickly.

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,160
Okay, take care of this for me!

17
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,960
I'm the type of person who hates being in debt to people.

18
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,880
All done?

19
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,890
Yes.

20
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,590
You beat the living daylights out of him.

21
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,460
Let's go... to Ha Ri.

22
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,480
Why is he so full of energy?

23
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,040
He normally has a lot of energy.

24
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,000
Hey, are we just leaving him here? Isn't he dead? Huh?

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,020
We're just leaving him there?

26
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,500
Please help me. That man has a gun.

27
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,070
He's a wanted criminal.

28
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,050
- Stop there, you bastard!
 - Wait, wait a minute!

29
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,530
- Hey...
 - Let go!

30
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,790
Stop there!

31
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,330
Hands up!

32
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,940
Hands up! Put your hands up!

33
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,570
Hands up.

34
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,070
You punk!

35
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,520
Are you going to keep acting alone like this? It's not like you're in puberty or anything.

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,810

37
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,580
You didn't get hurt, did you?

38
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,160
Huh?

39
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,930
I'm fine.

40
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,480
Why did you go in alone from the start? So cheap.

41
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,090
Hey, Ha Ri, I mean... Soo Hyeok.

42
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,120
Just call me the way you normally do. Soo Hyeok, my foot.

43
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,530
Yeah, well, I know how you guys must feel, but...

44
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,180
I'll do the rest alone. I'm a wanted criminal anyway.

45
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm a wanted criminal too.

46
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,880
So is he.

47
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,310
- What?
 - I'm not.

48
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,130
I envy you.

49
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,660
Why are you guys on the most wanted list? What happened?

50
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,820
When they were searching Prosecutor Jang's office,

51
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,850
I think they found ours as well.

52
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,520
He had data on us from back when he was chasing us.

53
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,620
Anyway, he's so careless.

54
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,870
Then that's even more of a reason why you can't.

55
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,150
What are you saying? If we're doing it, we should do it together!

56
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,490
That's right. You don't even have a plan.

57
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,800
And you don't even know where "that man" ran off to.

58
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,160
That's right! But we already know.

59
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,640
What?

60
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,650
Hey, no way. Did you guys...

61
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,110
Did we what?

62
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,610
Huh?

63
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,490
Call an emergency meeting immediately.

64
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,720
 Why did they park their car here?

65
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,820
There are so many people.

66
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,110
Before I came up, I put a tracker on his car.

67
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:01,130
Hey, that's not all. We caught Yoo Gi Hoon and Chairman Cheon, too.

68
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,180
Exactly. We ripped them from limb to limb.

69
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,930
You still don't need us?

70
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,120
All of us except Ah Ryeong are on the wanted list.

71
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,100
Okay! Yeah.

72
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,430
Let's do it, together, okay?

73
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,510
So then, Byeong Min and Jin Woong get in my car. Ah Ryeong, you follow us in that car, okay?

74
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,730
We're going in two cars?

75
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,430
Yes, that will be for the best.

76
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,020
Then, I'll just go in this car.

77
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,750
Just get in.

78
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,870
Then I'll ride in this car. Yeah.

79
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,900
I'll ride this one.

80
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,680
Her driving is way too rough.

81
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,910
What do you mean? My driving is so smooth.

82
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,770
Oh, right. Now that I think about it, when I'm in her car,

83
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,350
I always get carsick because she drives recklessly.

84
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,610
We'll go first, follow behind us.

85
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,980
What's up with that all of a sudden?

86
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,030
Just follow us driving recklessly.

87
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,130
Hey, are you... Ah Ryeong...?

88
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,420
Yes, that's the right thing to do.

89
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,020
I guess it is.

90
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,910
What do you think?

91
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,920
That's the right thing to do.

92
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,260
Byeong Min, the program you made before still works on that car, right?

93
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,030
Oh, that? Yes it does.

94
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,610
Okay! Let's go.

95
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,510
Let's go.

96
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,920
Is it ready?

97
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,820
Yeah, it's all ready.

98
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,010
You guys won't regret this? We might not make it back this time.

99
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,770
I know, you punk.

100
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,520
What's the big deal? I can just go to jail again.

101
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,980
I think I'm okay with going to jail this time.

102
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,830
Last time, I was betrayed,

103
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,430
but this time, we're doing it together, so it's okay.

104
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,660
So let's catch him together no matter what... "That man."

105
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,860
Start it.

106
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,060
- Okay.
 - Here.

107
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,750
Oppa, something's up with the car, I need to stop and check on it for a moment.

108
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,560
 Oppa.

109
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,930
 Oppa, why aren't you answering me?

110
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,430
Oppa, open the door! Open the door!

111
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,950
 Oppa, answer me!

112
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,180
Open the door! Open the door!

113
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,240
Thanks, Cha Ah Ryeong.

114
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,200
Please open the door!

115
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,750
 Open the door...

116
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,800
I said open the door!

117
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,820
Please open the door.

118
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,220
Oppa!

119
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,100
Just up to there. We're here. It's here. Just a little further.

120
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,690
I think it's that way.

121
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,740
- That's it, right?
 - Yeah, that's the car.

122
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,570
Hey, find out.

123
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,130
Control room and the equipment room are in the second basement level.

124
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,390
There are two security men at the front and back entrances each,

125
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,880
and there are the ones that are walking around.

126
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,810
Two, three, four... There are five of them.

127
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,220
And of course, there are probably many more of them on standby in case of emergency.

128
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,230
Why is there so much security in the middle of the night?

129
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,010
Yeah. As you said, we might not be able to come back out if we go in.

130
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,980
Seriously, I'll ask this one last time.

131
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,420
- Are you guys sure you won't regret—
 - I said we get it!

132
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,020
I'm nervous as hell. Why do you keep...

133
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,680
Why do you have so much to say, like an old grandpa?

134
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,600
Okay.

135
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,800
Let's go before it gets too late.

136
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
Let's go.

137
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,050

138
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,420
Stop making nonsense.

139
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,640
- Nothing special going on, right?
 - No.

140
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,390
- Hey, are you done yet?
 - Wait.

141
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,040
Hey, hey, hey, I found it! I found it, hurry up!

142
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,560
This is the video from ten minutes ago. Twenty-fifth floor.

143
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,420
There's no view of the hallway here?

144
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,240
That one's not here. It's so strange that's the only one missing.

145
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,050
Something seems fishy.

146
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,810
Hey, hey, hey, look at this!  Are these bastards Mi Chang Party Assemblymen?

147
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,220
These are the punks we saw on TV, right?

148
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,300
We came exactly on time.

149
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,390
You turn the power off and prepare the broadcast as we planned.

150
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,900
And upload the confidential files taken out of the camp.

151
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,690
I'm going to the meeting room to set up the camera, got it?

152
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,100
Hey, you have to come back quickly, alright? It only takes three minutes for the power in the security system to restore.

153
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,540
- Okay, don't worry.
 - I'm serious!

154
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,780
You really have to come back quickly!

155
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,430
Why do I feel uneasy about him?

156
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,680
Why is he calling for an emergency meeting?

157
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,630

158
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,810
Have a seat.

159
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,630

160
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,770

161
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,540
It's three minutes. You have to finish and get out of there in three minutes.

162
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,650
Five.

163
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
Okay.

164
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,530
Three.

165
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,370
Two.

166
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,390
One!

167
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,800
What's this? Why did the power go out again? Turn on the flashlight.

168
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,380
Yes.

169
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,350
Rebounding—

170
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,330
What's going on?

171
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,530
How are they maintaining the building, these punks?

172
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,590
I don't even have my cellphone. My goodness.

173
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,020
Don't worry about it. Just wait.

174
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,390
It's going to turn on soon.

175
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,290
Control room!  Control room, answer me!

176
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,130
Yes, it's being fixed. It should be on in 30 seconds.

177
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,390
Ha Ri, there's less than 30 seconds left. Hurry, huh?!

178
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,960
 Ten seconds.

179
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,840
 Five, four,

180
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,720
- three, two...
 - Did it work?

181
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,990
Okay. It's done.

182
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,190
Yeah!

183
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,560
Wow, this punk. He really got the best angle.

184
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,300
- Look at them.
 - Let's broadcast it.

185
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,230
- Before we start, call Prosecutor Jang.
 - Okay.

186
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,530
Adding this first.

187
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,390
You bastards, get messed around by me...

188
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,830

- They're Mi Chang Party assemblymen, aren't they?
 - They are.

189
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,700

190
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,720
Prosecutor, take a look at this!

191
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,150
Where did this get uploaded from?

192
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,890
I don't know but this is a live broadcast.

193
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,690
Live?

194
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,870
No, this punk, he shouldn't...

195
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,630
Prosecutor Jang, are you enjoying the broadcast?

196
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,040
You should get started on your work now.

197
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,810
Don't you know you guys are wanted criminals?

198
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,590
If you get caught doing—

199
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,080
You're saying useless things again.

200
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,300
Forget that. Just come here before it's too late and clean up the mess.

201
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,100
You should take responsibility.

202
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,140
You're the one who told Ha Ri that you wanted to work with him.

203
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,410
I'll text you the address.

204
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,760
Wait a second— Ah, you bastard!

205
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,420
Ah, this bastard.

206
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,530
They really shouldn't...

207
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,020

208
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,510
First, let's get ready to leave.

209
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,640
- Yes, sir.
 - You're going too, Prosecutor?

210
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,810
Yeah, I did say it so I have to stand by my word. My crutch.

211
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,230
Let's go.

212
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,620
Did we do everything we were supposed to?

213
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,680
No, not yet.

214
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,090
I have to upload the files that I retrieved from the camp.

215
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,960
Okay.

216
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,440
Well, with this one blow...

217
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,640
Hey, hey, hey.

218
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,110
Hey. Why is he there?

219
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,860
Ah, this crazy bastard— Sh...

220
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,500
It's you again?

221
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,660
 Ten seconds...

222
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,550
 What the...! What... What's this?

223
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,390
 What's going on?

224
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,450
 What?

225
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,590
It's you again?

226
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,920
We should finish our conversation.

227
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,990
Aish... Hey, you crazy bastard! Why are you still in there?

228
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,690
Hey, hey. Let's go quickly.

229
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:48,350
Ah, seriously!  He would get in really big trouble, crazy punk!

230
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,280
Hey, it's Seon Building!  They're the wanted criminals so make sure to catch them!

231
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,980
Yes!

232
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,960
What are these idiots doing? Ah really.

233
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,130
Ugh! Really, why doesn't this door open?!

234
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,650
You're much better than I expected... in terms of your perseverance.

235
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,090
I appreciate that you think that way.

236
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,930
Who is this punk?

237
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,750
I thought nobody could come in this place.

238
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,360
He is Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi's son.

239
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,760
- What did you say?
 - What? Ch-Ch-Choi—

240
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,220
Do you mean Choi Hyeon Gi who was on the special investigation team?

241
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,390
Right.

242
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:04,160
All of you know him well. I'm the son of Choi Hyeon Gi who you framed and killed 15 years ago.

243
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,330
No, how does he...

244
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,430
How does this punk know all about what happened in the past?

245
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,730
Didn't you keep this completely confidential?

246
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,230
It doesn't matter because he will die in here anyway.

247
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,150
- Hey, hey! Hey, wake up!
 - Wake up!

248
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,850
Hey!

249
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,350
Hey, bring a walkie-talkie.

250
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,020
Yes.

251
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,280
You're doing the exact same thing as 15 years ago.

252
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,850
That's why you're targeting Prosecutor Jang this time?

253
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,740
To set him up with the opposing presidential candidate's bribes?

254
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,800
 That's why you're targeting Prosecutor Jang this time?

255
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,930
 To set him up with the opposing presidential candidate's bribes?

256
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,450
Let's go quickly.  As quickly as possible.

257
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,270
Understood!

258
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,340
Are you just going to listen to what this bastard is saying?

259
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,800
What if this bastard spills the beans outside?

260
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,720
Don't worry.

261
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,380
Because all of the people in the nation already know it.

262
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,070
What?

263
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,620
What is he saying right now?

264
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,630
What?

265
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,120
- No, this...
 - Is it broadcasting right now?

266
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,700
 He is... Choi Hyeon Gi's son.

267
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,310
Wow, this is big news.

268
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:38,900
 I'm the son of Choi Hyeon Gi who you framed and killed 15 years ago.

269
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
 No, how does he...

270
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,840
 How does this punk know about the things that happened in the past?

271
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,250
 Didn't you keep this completely confidential?

272
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,880
 It doesn't matter because he will die in here anyway.

273
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,990
We were all videotaped just now.  What should we do?

274
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,570
You bastard!

275
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,210
You said to me,

276
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,870
"only by killing a few people and framing someone,

277
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,590
this whole world moves as I please."

278
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,280
When the power authorities who are sitting here, or the chaebols

279
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,320
would come and lick your feet to make a big haul, what would be the reason not to want it?

280
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,960
That's right.  You're the means to this, not the cause.

281
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,340
You're here, in this position, because these bastards who are crazy about power and money want it.

282
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,650
So I, too, thought about

283
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:32,100
how I could play around with you. And the answer came right away.

284
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:39,470
You're a voyeuristic bastard who uses elders to ridicule the people of the nation.

285
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,120
So I decided to make you be ridiculed by the people of the nation.

286
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:50,450
What are you going to do now? No one's going to seek you out anymore, right?

287
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,660
Because you're useless now.

288
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,140
You bastard.

289
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,350
You ruined all my plans.

290
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:25,340
I'm leaving. I'm not the one who will deal with you.

291
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,930
Don't make me laugh, you bastard!

292
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,880
Right. Even if you did this to me, do you think no one would seek me out?

293
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,290
On the contrary. The world is filled with trash like them.

294
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:57,350
These bastards? They wouldn't be able to do anything without me!

295
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,990
These bastards are the stupid idiots who never know

296
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,710
what to do or to plan in order to get what they want!

297
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,430
Right. I guess so.

298
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,220
But remember one thing.

299
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:18,360
If a guy like you comes back, a guy like me will show up for sure.

300
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,550
Oh.

301
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,990
In this game...

302
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,000
You lost.

303
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:07,050
Hey, is it over?

304
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,950
You punks!

305
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,070
Yeah, it's all over.

306
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,780
Hey, you punk! Stop doing whatever you want.

307
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,600
How good does it feel to smile?

308
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,810
Ok, now we should also slowly start to...

309
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,280
Ah, we should run, right?

310
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,640
Aiyoo, you punks. I should've known.

311
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,980
Stand still!

312
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,600
Stop! You!

313
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,830
Are you alright?  Let's get out of here.

314
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,850
What is this?

315
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,300
Who are these punks?

316
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,060
We're the prosecutors from Seo Eun Branch Prosecution Service.

317
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,280
Wh-What?

318
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,080
What?

319
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,080
Aigoo, I enjoyed the broadcast.

320
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,400
You guys became famous, doing a live broadcast nationwide.

321
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,430
I feel sorry that I'm alive like this.

322
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,170
- Take them away.
 - Yes, sir.

323
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:31,610
Hey, hey, wait!

324
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,740
Let go! Jang In Gyu,

325
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,850
you... Don't you know who I am?

326
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,620
Up to now, I don't care who you were.

327
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,550
What's important is, from now on

328
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,280
you're nothing.

329
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,770
Take him away.

330
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,140
Let's go.

331
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,660
Let go!

332
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,000
I've been curious for the past 15 years.

333
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,970
I finally get to meet you.

334
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,070
But,

335
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,640
you must be photogenic.

336
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,430
You don't look that great in person.

337
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,220
How ugly.

338
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,250
- Arrest him.
 - Yes, sir.

339
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,210
Prosecutor, there's an issue.

340
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,890
What? Those punks?

341
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,910
This way!

342
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,050
Hurry!

343
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,840
Hurry, hurry in!

344
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,800
Ah seriously!

345
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,430
I told you not to follow me!

346
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,710
- Bring the key!
 - Yes.

347
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,710
Hey, nothing is here! What should we do now?

348
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:18,190
Ha Ri, Ha Ri, what should we do?

349
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,380
Ha Ri!

350
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,330
Ah, we'll get caught for sure now.

351
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,930
You crazy bastard, what are you doing right now?

352
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,950
That's why I said not to follow me!

353
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,690
What follow—

354
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,890
Ah really!

355
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:36,600
The trouble started when I trusted and followed you, really!

356
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,510
Aish! You crazy, you're laughing?

357
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,720
Ah really! Is it laughable? Ah seriously.

358
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:56,000
Aigoo, really!

359
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,000
The weather is so nice!

360
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:05,310
Hey, we won't see each other for a few years, right?

361
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:10,340
A few years? My butt. You could live in jail for several dozens of years only with your beating people.

362
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,910
Hey, I would get out of jail earlier than you.

363
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,690
What a joke!

364
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,220
Hey, I heard you passed the bar exam.

365
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,030
Who committed the heavier crime between him and me?

366
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,490
- You guys?
 - Yeah. How many years would we get sentenced?

367
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,870
Well... Life sentence. You, too. Life sentence.

368
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:32,160
- Ah really.
 - For you? Death penalty, you punk!

369
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,000
Making him labor under the scorching sun for the rest of his life, you punk!

370
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,540
Can you laugh right now?

371
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,880
Ah, kill me.

372
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,140
Can you laugh?

373
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,270
Ah, I don't know.

374
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,330
Hey! Wait a minute!

375
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:53,350
Hey, we didn't do it yet! We didn't! Give me the phone, hurry!

376
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,950
Ah, right!

377
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,210
Quick, give me your phone

378
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,460
Hurry!

379
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,320
Where is the key?

380
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,190
- You have to do—
 - That's enough!

381
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,640
I told you that—

382
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,470
What are those?

383
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,390
Hey, send it quickly. Hurry send it!

384
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,620
Hands up, everybody!

385
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,650
- Ah, yes.
 - Hands up! I told you to hands up, you bastards!

386
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,690
- Hands up!
 -Yes!

387
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,310
Yes.

388
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,460
Arrest them.

389
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,400
Ah, easy!

390
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,550
I-I'm scared of g-guns.

391
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,050
Take it easy, please!

392
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,640
- I didn't do anything wrong.
 - I've never beaten people.

393
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,180

394
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,320
Ah, ah, ah. I'm going with you.

395
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,150
Wait a minute! Halt there for a minute! Please wait—

396
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,080
Prosecutor!

397
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,660
- Prosecutor.
 - Let go of me.

398
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,550
Excuse me.

399
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,900
The only crime that they have is cooperating with the prosecutorial—

400
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,880
Let's go.

401
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,590
There are so many solicitors.

402
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,450
Ah, really. They are so mean.

403
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,140

404
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,360
 Here, here.

405
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,850
 Here.

406
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:04,410
 Cha Ah Ryeong! When you watch this, you may get mad.

407
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,440
 Still, we think we have to at least say our goodbyes.

408
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,700
 - I, I will do it first.
 - Okay, Byeong Min, you do it first.

409
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,170
 Hello Ah Ryeong, it's me Oppa Byeong Min.

410
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,210
 I sometimes taught you how to use the computer.

411
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:26,330
 But you really have to be careful of people. You can't do internet banking in public places like cafes.

412
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,360
 People would hack into your information,

413
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:35,150
 - and take all your information. Then your life would be ruined—
 - Move, move aside.

414
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:38,060
 Hey, hey, be quiet!

415
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,390
 Ah Ryeong, it's me, Oppa Jin Woong.

416
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:45,450
 Ah Ryeong, I just need to say one thing.

417
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,020
 Ah Ryeong, health is the most important.

418
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,940
 You kept eating ramen because you were being lazy. If you keep doing that, you'll really get scolded by me.

419
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:59,000
 - Take vitamins—
 - Besides ramen, if you eat cup ramen, you'll get scolded. And do some exercise too.

420
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,980
 - Move aside. Move aside.
 - I'm in the middle of an important talking—

421
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,830
 Hi, Cha Ah Ryeong!

422
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:13,970
 We're the guys who originally chose to live like this.

423
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:18,500
 But for you, since you were young, you haven't had a choice.

424
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,000
 Even if it's from now on,

425
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,800
 you choose the way you want to live or the way your heart goes. Understand?

426
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,960
 The way your heart goes!

427
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:36,000
 It was so nice and made us happy to meet you.

428
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:39,860
 Make sure to be happy! Okay?

429
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:45,140
 -  Be happy! And Ah Ryeong you—
 - Goodbye.
 - Do exercise and take vitamins as well!

430
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,690
Ah, they're doing what they want until the end.

431
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:57,080
♫  Anyone there  ♫

432
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:02,320
♫  Anyone else  ♫

433
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,120
 Even though the presidential election is now over,  the video called "The Man Scandal"

434
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,200
 is still a hot topic on the internet.

435
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,560
 The man in the video uploaded anonymously is identified as Yeon Jae Seok.

436
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,520
 Evidence continues to show that he has steadily worked as a political consultant for Mi Chang Party for 15 years.

437
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,470
How could he do that?

438
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,720
 Besides that, he laid out the plans for some of the upper positions to conduct corruption.

439
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,900
 He is suspected of helping them to evade the law.

440
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:42,600
 On the basis of a video uploaded and broadcast anonymously, prosecutors started an investigation into the present scandal...

441
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:48,420
 They've announced that they would also thoroughly investigate the presidential election scandal from 15 years ago.

442
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,580
 Meanwhile, interest is focused on whether the false accusation of Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi,

443
00:41:54,580 --> 00:42:00,040
 who was considered the main criminal at that time, will be cleared.

444
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,540
Do you have to do this?

445
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:21,450
I can't be a cheapskate and leave myself out of this.

446
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,420
But, still...

447
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:35,490
Investigator Kim Tae Won; Investigator Hong Seong Min;

448
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:39,050
Investigator Jeong Do Yeon; Investigator Lee Hae Young;

449
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,990
Investigator Lim Jin Dong; Investigator Noh Young Im.

450
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:49,440
You've suffered a lot, all this time.

451
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,010
I'm asking you to finish up this case well.

452
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,520
Prosecutor Jang.

453
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,980
Prosecutor.

454
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,940

455
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:35,900
Witness, was everything you said true?

456
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:48,560
Yes, sir. It's the truth.

457
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,490
I entrusted the case to them.

458
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:01,680
I ordered them to bring the evidence to me and

459
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,450
I let them slide with their illegal acts during their conducting my order,

460
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:11,130
within my prosecutor's power.

461
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,020
This man is a really funny ahjussi.

462
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,520
Are you trying to intercept our accomplishment?

463
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,190
You're going to get indigestion being so greedy like that.

464
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,000
Don't you think you went too far when we met each other first time?

465
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Be quiet, please!

466
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,930
Witness, do you have any evidence that can prove your testimony?

467
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,690
Yes. I do.

468
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:58,470
This is the cell phone that I used while working with those punks.

469
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,360
I used it to contact them, although the call records

470
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,270
were hacked and mostly deleted by them.

471
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:10,280
But when I first started working with them, the voice file that I recorded

472
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,350
is still left in this phone.

473
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:21,920
 All I need from you is definitive evidence. Concrete evidence they can't worm their way out of.

474
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,460
 Well, the money that you guys collect from the case will be...

475
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,670
 - split?
 - What?

476
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,820
 I was kidding.

477
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:37,360
 Keep all yourselves.I'll promise this.

478
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,750
 But how can we trust you?

479
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:47,750
 Everything that we discussed until now, is recorded on this phone.

480
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,530
 From now on, the only point of contact is that phone.

481
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,200

482
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:02,950
This cell phone, I submit as evidence.

483
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,990
I'll accept it as evidence.

484
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,670
Please play it.

485
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:41,210
 - Now, we will formally introduce ourselves. 
 - I'm Prosecutor Jang In Gyu from Seo Won District Prosecution.

♫  when you bite into it, that slowly melting strawberry flavor   ♫

488
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,720
♫  the candy shop, come find it, baby  ♫

489
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,060
♫  my favorite flavor of summer  ♫

490
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,520
♫  I want to fall asleep under the shade of a tree  ♫

491
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,530
♫  become the wind on a hot summer night  ♫

492
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,630
♫  I'm at the age of 19, so easy to fall in love ♫

493
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:09,250
Order in the court!

494
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,710
Witness, are you joking around during the trial?

495
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,110
Your Honor, something seems to have gone wrong.

496
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:17,670
What are you doing? Turn it off, quickly!

497
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,980
Yes, Your Honor.

498
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,900
I will announce the final judgment.

499
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,990
Inmate 3294, Choi Soo Hyeok.

500
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:38,550
Including fraud, extortion,

501
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,960
grand larceny, forceful injury,

502
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,050
assault, obstruction of business operations,

503
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:46,290
the defendant has committed fourteen crimes overall.

504
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:51,480
Though he claimed to have acted to punish the greedy,

505
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,320
the damage he has caused in that process cannot be ignored.

506
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,640
His crimes cannot be deemed light.

507
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,610
 Therefore, I sentence the defendant Do Jin Woong to 12 years in prison,

508
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:09,160
 Im Byeong Min to receive a 12-year sentence,

509
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,560
 and Choi Soo Hyeok to 15 years in prison.

510
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,830
Wait a moment.

511
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,550
Can I speak with him for a moment?

512
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:35,980
What's with your expression? Did someone die?

513
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,660
Why did you do that? You didn't have to do this.

514
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,990
- Why even the things I did—
 - Who's going to put those assholes in jail then?

515
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,060
Isn't that true?

516
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,060
That's true, Prosecutor. You're going to have to pick up our slack.

517
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,920
Stop thinking about resting in prison.

518
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,900
Also, the money that we collected...

519
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,910
It's in a safe in our hideout.

520
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,600
Go confiscate it.

521
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,780
Justly.

522
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,560
What?

523
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,990
Crazy punk.

524
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:34,160
Then, work hard for a bit longer... Jang In Gyu.

525
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,750
Prosecutor.

526
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,200
- Soo—
 - I'm going now.

527
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,950
In Gyu Hyung, there's a lot of money in the safe, so just take a bit out and put it into our prison fund.

528
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,830
Just go!

529
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,140
Ignore what he said!

530
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:00,300
I'll call when I get out.

531
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,920

532
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,080
Soo Hyeok...

533
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,220
Ah, seriously.

534
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:35,180
I guess even I get to ride this kind of car.

535
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,130
It's the car from "A-Team."

536
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,620
- It's that one, right?
 - Yes.

537
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,090
It is pretty cool.

538
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,050
But, seriously,

539
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,860
I'm the only one with 15 years. Isn't that too harsh?

540
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,320
What did I do that was so wrong that only I get 15 years?

541
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,690
No, the judge ruled correctly.

542
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:57,060
You're the worst out of all of us, and you're also the leader.

543
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,620
Our country's judicial system is very fair.

544
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,420
Of course, justice is still alive.

545
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,690
Justice?

546
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:05,880
- Hey, if justice is alive then you two punks should get the death penalty.
 - Seriously

547
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,430
Damn.

548
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:10,200
- Just wait eight years and I'll go visit you.
 - Eight years?

549
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,360
You got 12 years, though.

550
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,480
I'm going to be the model prisoner as soon as I get in.

551
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,380
You are? Aigoo.

552
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,260
Yeah, right!

553
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,590
You! You have to watch what you say!

554
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:22,930
Punks like you, who are so cunning and sly,

555
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,560
you're going to get beat up everywhere you go, idiot.

556
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,990
You just take care of yourself.

557
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,520
I still think that I had the most fun when I was with you guys.

558
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,110
Right?

559
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,930
Now that I look at it, my life's had lots of ups and downs.

560
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,460
 I think I'm really going to cry.

561
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,940
 I have narcolepsy, narcolepsy.

562
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,080
 - Push him.
 - Hey!

563
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,890
 I am Section Chief Maeng, Prosecutor.

564
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:05,290
 Yes, I'll keep an eye on them, so take your time.

565
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:09,520
 I came to pick up my best accomplice.

566
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,100
 Ugh, why can't I reject him.

567
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,790
 Hurry up.

568
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,580
 Did you fall for me?

569
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,950
 Get her!

570
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,390
 You're seriously the best!

571
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:36,840
 We did it!

572
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,960
 Let's think of it positively.

573
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:42,380
 Oh, you got injured! Who did this? Was it you? Was it you guys?

574
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,120
 - You're hurt! 
 - Who said you could leave like that?!

575
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,250
 - I told you not to go around doing strange things! 
 - That's why you got injured!

576
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:48,070
 Yes, all together.

577
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,580
 - We have to collect our labor costs.
 - Me too, me too, me too.

578
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,030
 Give me 30,000 won (~$30) so that I can buy chicken breast.

579
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,860
 - No, no. 
 - You said that there's a lot!

580
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,530
 Hey, stop using strength!

581
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,400
 - I can just lower my head. 
 - Why would you lower your head?

582
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,390
 One, two, okay!

583
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,780
 Alright, work hard!

584
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,100
 Hey, how long are you planning to wear that wig? It suits you though.

585
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,210
 That idiot, really!

586
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,670
 Cheese.

587
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,540
 - We're going to put this on the internet. 
 - Smile!

588
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:27,560
 What's going on?

589
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,210
 Yes! Woohoo!

590
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,460
 Good job! As expected, Cha Ah Ryeong!

591
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,430
 President, you look like a striped marlin today.

592
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,620
 Oh, Ah Ryeong, wow.

593
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,830
 Because the shoulder parts look very good.

594
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:47,300
 He just said it to tease you because you look pretty.

595
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,370
 We can set a trap with a beautiful woman too.

596
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:49,620
 Beauty? Who?

597
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,500
 - You want to die? Seriously! 
- Who do you think?

598
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,580
 But, for real, who is it? Huh?

599
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,080
 - Cheers! 
 - For Byeong Min!

600
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,130
 You're such a blabbermouth.

601
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,520
 - You are a bit of a big mouth. 
 - You're so carefree.

602
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,850
 I don't think you're like that, Prosecutor.

603
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,140
 You guys did a good job!

604
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,920
Yeah...

605
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,450
It was really fun.

606
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:27,650
I wonder if Ah Ryeong would think so too.

607
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:29,870
Of course.

608
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,820
She would.

609
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,150
Yeah.

610
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,790
Now that you say it, I kind of miss her.

611
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:41,470
At first, she was so annoying, rude and ill-mannered and I really didn't even want to see her at all.

612
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,350
We seem to have really grown to like her.

613
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:46,680
 You abandoned me but now you're talking about me like that. So cheap.

614
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,340
Huh? Did you guys hear that?

615
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,690
- I heard it.
 - You, too?

616
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,280
You too?

617
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,520
Wow, we must really miss her a lot to be hearing things.

618
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,410
- Right, right?
 - Aigoo.

619
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:03,530
Wait, wait a second. Everyone, a ghost? Ghost?

620
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,670
No way.

621
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:09,770
- Did she die?
 - D-Die??

622
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:12,270
What the hell are you saying, dead?

623
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:15,630
Cha Ah Ryeong! What's going on?!

624
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,300
What's going on?

625
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,840
Ah Ryeong!

626
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,120
What happened?

627
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:39,210
 Jang In Gyu.

628
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,690
 Prosecutor.

629
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,140
What happened?

630
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,920
- Cha Ah Ryeong!
 - Ah Ryeong!

631
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,710
- Ah Ryeong!
 - How did this happen?

632
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,960
Ah Ryeong, Ah Ryeong!

633
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,640
Hey, hey, what happened?

634
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,920
You oppas told me, right?

635
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,620
From now on, live my life making my own decisions.

636
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:14,170
This is my decision.

00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:02,220
 Prosecutor! I found it!

647
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,660
 You should've tipped us off somehow.

648
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,060
I really can't beat you.

649
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,960
Yeah.

650
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,080
Hey, wait, wait. Ah Ryeong!

651
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,500
What happened to our money?

652
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,580
Yes. 30,000 won (~$30) is all there is.

653
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:48,570
Ah, seriously, these jerks.

654
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,260
Are you okay?

655
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,220
Let's go.

656
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:07,930
 I already took care of it.

657
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,870
- What? Really?
 - Of course.

658
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,490
Wow, seriously.

659
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,200
You've become a full-blown con artist now!

660
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,960
Whoa!

661
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,600
Then, we're starting over again, right?

662
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,100
Again? Again?

663
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,780
Ah, strangely, I can't say no.

664
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:28,240
Yes!

665
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,280
Now, let's slowly start over again, all together! Okay?

666
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,830
- Let's go!
 - Okay!

667
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:34,550
- Okay! 
 - Okay.

668
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,690
 Go, go, go!

669
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:40,860
 Let's go! Wait, the cops behind us?

670
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,740
 Should we lose them first?

671
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,890
 Step on it, step on it!

672
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:59,210

673
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:09,940

674
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,650

675
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:35,180
 Behind the scenes  
I have something to tell you.

676
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:42,300
Wow, it's a commercial.

677
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:49,650
- Hello, everyone.
 - Hello, everyone.

678
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,430
Action!

679
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,270
Get out?

680
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:59,590
No, Oppa.

681
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,740
Aigoo, nice job!

682
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:05,280
Nice job, nice job!

683
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,960
Okay, dance! Dance!
