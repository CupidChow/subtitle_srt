1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,220

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,850

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,260

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,240

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,090

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,830

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:38,960

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:45,080

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,070

10
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,760
No, I'm not the one that's trapped.

11
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,450

12
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,220
Bastards.

13
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,720
I really need that ledger.

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,640
If you hand it over to me without making any fuss, I can let you off.

15
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,670
This bastard.

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,170
Are you showing off your nerve right now?

17
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,700
Well.

18
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,240
You're curious, aren't you?

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,810
Then come and check it out yourself.

20
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,090
Oh, I'm so freakin' curious.

21
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,230
You bastard!

22
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,700
Hey,  you're dead today!

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,910
Wow! What?

24
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,070
Why does everything look the same?

25
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,030
Look at the map again.

26
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,580
Yes, sir!

27
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,400
Over there! Over there!

28
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,260
Run!

29
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,130
I think it's around here.

30
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,090
I think so too.

31
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,000
Open it.

32
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,750
Come on.

33
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,240
What the...

34
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,660
You're here?

35
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,050
You're doing it by yourself again—

36
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,800
Ugh! Come on.

37
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,020
Can you clean up the mess here?

38
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,400
What, you punk? Am I your subordinate?

39
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,060
Like you're my boss, you order me to clean up here!

40
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,500
Just stay put!

41
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,280
That jerk. Hey!

42
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,460
Stop right there you punk!

43
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,400
Hey you!

44
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,860
Stop there.

45
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,910
Hey, hey! Come here.

46
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,570
Come on, you bastard.

47
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,490
Ah, I'm tired, you punk!

48
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,500
Why do you keep chasing me?

49
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,420
Hey.

50
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,420
- Come here you punk!
 - Don't come!

51
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,330
Come here, come here!

52
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,070
I'm second to none in running away.

53
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,630
Really. I think you've misunderstood.

54
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,080
This is my journal.

55
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,600
I'll buy you a new one so just give it to me.

56
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,740
I have money.

57
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,080
If you really want this, I'll give it to you.

58
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,360
- Here.
 - Give it to me.

59
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,450
One, two...

60
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,140
I'm just pretending to give it to you but am actually running away.

61
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,890
You're dead, you bastard.

62
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,110

63
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,160
Aish! Is it really here?

64
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,360
If it's not here, there's nowhere else to hide it.

65
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,700
Did they put it in the car?

66
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,860
There's no place to hide outside, right?

67
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,180
I don't think

68
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,510
that I can say that there isn't.

69
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,860
What?

70
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,990
What do you mean?

71
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,190
Don't push me.

72
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,680
- Give me a little space.
 - I'm stuck here.

73
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,590
- You did it first.
 - Really?

74
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,270
I'm not lying. You did it first.

75
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,040
You idiot.

76
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,100
This guy's fast.

77
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,720
Aish! This bastard, seriously.

78
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,800
You could never catch me.

79
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,670
I can run a hundred meters in seven seconds. Really, this punk.

80
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,190
It takes me six seconds, you bastard.

81
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,960
You bastard!

82
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,580
Good, good. You're doing very well.

83
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,300
Ah really, Ah Ryeong. You're really doing well.

84
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,750
What are you doing not cheering her on?

85
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,160
My stomach s-suddenly hurts.

86
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,210
I'm going to the restroom. Keep it up.

87
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,230
Hey!

88
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,750
Good, good, my Ah Ryeong. Yes.

89
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,170
Hold up.

90
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,750
- I found it!
 - Hey, move over.

91
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,390
Wow! Really awesome!

92
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,330
Yes!!

93
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,880
Hey, how did you know it was here?

94
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,940
Just looking at it, it seemed like it would be.

95
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,670
- Here it is, too.
 - Wow, awesome.

96
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,070
It's awesome! How much is it?

97
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,340
You guys are excited.

98
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,770
What are you so happy about?

99
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,550
Hey, it's you again.

100
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,750
Do you need me to help?

101
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,910
No, I can handle this on my own.

102
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,800
Will you help?

103
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,230
Walk straight!

104
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,190
Wait. Hey!

105
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,370
Wait, wait.

106
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,890
Ugh, this bastard! Hey, come to your senses.

107
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,130
Hey! Where's the ledger? The ledger?!

108
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,580
Where the hell is the ledger, you bastard!

109
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,150
- It was taken.
 - What?

110
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,340
Taken.

111
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,230
Yes. yes. If you personally take care of this matter,

112
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,860
there's nothing more reliable than that.

113
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,460
Of course! I should definitely escort you.

114
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,360
At the end of your term of service,

115
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,930
I'm sorry that I need to ask this kind of favor.

116
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,260

117
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:28,600
Ah yes, yes. Prosecutor General, I will call you back.

118
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,970
Yeah, did you take care of it?

119
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,060
 Hello, it's me, Reporter Shin.

120
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,120
You won't believe me anymore if I say I'm a reporter.

121
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,900
You. Who are you? Why do you keep appearing and—

122
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,470
Ey! It's not the time to be asking those kinds of questions.

123
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:58,400
Aren't you more curious as to who's got your ledger? Even the prosecutors are involved.

124
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,970
No need to drag it on. Let's make a clean exchange.

125
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,390
I think five billion won will work for me.

126
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,940
If you don't like it, then do it according to the law.

127
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:21,210
The law? How dare you speak of the law in front of me?

128
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,590
Ah, you're looking down on me.

129
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,930
Even though I'm like this, I studied a bit of law when I was young.

130
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:35,580
If I report that you violated the attorney law, your illegally earned fees will all be confiscated, right?

131
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,400
Okay, let's see. Let's see.

132
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,650
When I look at it here, it seems like you made around 50 billion won.

133
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,500
 So in plain terms,

134
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,220
you really stuffed yourself.

135
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,940
I hope your stomach bursts, you greedy bastard!

136
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,760
Is this seriously why

137
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,170
you guys study to death?

138
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,300
You should be ashamed.

139
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,510
Aigoo, seriously.

140
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,950
Anyhow, what are you going to do? The caretakers who watch your back are going to be arrested too.

141
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,300
You bastard, where are you right now?!

142
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,620
Whoa, whoa. Don't get too excited now.

143
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,710
What are you going to do if you know where I am?

144
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,930
Why? Are you curious? Do you miss me?

145
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,350
Where is he, this bastard?

146
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,150
- Hey, you bastard!
 - I'll text you a location because there are so many eyes on me right now.

147
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,460
Hey, you bastard! Where are you going?

148
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,360
- Taxi! 
  - Hey! Give me the ledger!

149
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,410
- Go, go, go, go!
   - You! Stop right there!

150
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,900
Catch him!

151
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:02,880
Stop there! Hey!

152
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,410
If we're done here. Can I go now?

153
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,900
Oh no, no.

154
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,620
- It's protocol for drug cases to be investigated under imprisonment.
 - What?

155
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,610
So, what I'm saying is, until the crime is revealed,

156
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,130
you have to wait in jail.

157
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,220
If you're hungry, you can have some blood sausage soup.

158
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,600
Look here, Prosecutor Jang.

159
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,960
I'm not sure what you're relying on to be acting like this, but can you take responsibility for this?

160
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,880
The presidential election is just around the corner.

161
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,170
When the election is over, the owner of this country will change. Do you know that?

162
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,840
I know. I know better than anyone else.

163
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,170
- But we have to wait and see how it will change, right?
 - What?

164
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,100
I was going to stay and eat with you but I can't because I'm busy.

165
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,590
When the food is delivered, take your time and enjoy it.

166
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,120
Is my blood sausage soup here? Bring it to my office!

167
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,700

168
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,320
So why are you doing this?

169
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,530
Oh, you're here.

170
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,310
How many times did I tell you? Yes.

171
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,500
I'm telling you we have evidence and we're sure she committed crimes.

172
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,840
Prosecutor! Even the Prosecutor General called here. People from the supreme prosecutor's office are making a fuss about letting her go.

173
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,470
It's protocol that we investigate people under imprisonment for drug cases.

174
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,710

175
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:46,150
What? Oh, hold on, I can't hear you, one moment.

176
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,950
Hold on! Quiet, quiet!

177
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:58,110
Yes. What happened? What?!

178
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,240
- Ah really!
 - What do you want to do then?

179
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,000

180
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,590
You bastard! What are you thinking of doing this time? Huh?

181
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,370
Why did you take such an important piece of evidence?

182
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,890
I told you it would be a judicial gate that would shake the whole prosecution.

183
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,190
Even Prosecutor General probably took action already.

184
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,670
Will you be able to cover it by yourself?

185
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,890
 No, why do you keep saying that? I'm really upset.

186
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,530
Let's finish it in one go.

187
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,130
All of them, even the ones that were hidden all this time.

188
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,300
So then, what are we supposed to do now?

189
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,870
Just wait and see. I'll send you the whole package.

190
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,580
By yourself?

191
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,860
No. I have a few reliable punks.

192
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,600
Though they sometimes act strangely.

193
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:43,170
Ah really.  I usually don't like men but you're an exception.

194
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,690
This is why women fall for me.

195
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,900
Ah Ryeong, you can't though.

196
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,620
What the...

197
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,350
What should I do?

198
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,090
You dreadful bastard. Ah Ryeong, move aside.

199
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,600
Aigoo. There was a gentleman here, though he doesn't look it.

200
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,870
What is this? Are you dissing my oppa because he's ugly?

201
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,990
He didn't say I'm ugly.

202
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,990
What funny punks.

203
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,480
I can't stand you bastards!

204
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,790
- Oppa!
 - Byeong Min!

205
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,150
You bastards!

206
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,950
Wh-Why isn't it working?

207
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,690
Really, you idiot!

208
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,050
Are you kidding me right now?

209
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,960
Do you think I'm kidding when I'm in this situation?

210
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,760
You bastards!

211
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,960
No, no.

212
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,090
- Ah Ryeong! Get the money first!
 - Okay.

213
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,900
This is so heavy.

214
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,840
- Ahhh!
 - It's me, it's me!

215
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,000
No, no. Move forward and kill them!

216
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,740
Don't follow! Don't follow!

217
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,290
Here you go, bastard!

218
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,140
Chase them!

219
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,000
Hurry! Hurry! Faster!

220
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,930
Hey, hey, hurry, hurry! Don't come!

221
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,270
You get off!

222
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,270
- Don't follow us!
 - Pull together!

223
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,150
Don't come!

224
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,590
You! Bastard!

225
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,350
You. Don't ever appear in front of me again.

226
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,660
Hurry it up!

227
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,800
I got it. I'm doing it!

228
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,740
Let's go! Go!

229
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,450
We succeeded in escaping. You idiots!

230
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,340
- Jin Woong Oppa!
 - Just leave him.

231
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,340
You're horrible.

232
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,140
Just kidding.

233
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,140

234
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,310
Aish!

235
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,560
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

236
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,180
Hurry! Get in!

237
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,720
Stop! You bastards!

238
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,600
What?! All of it?

239
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:27,010
Hey!

240
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,730
AH!

241
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,650
Bastard! Bastard!!

242
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,680
Wow!

243
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,160
If I hadn't sprayed them with the fire extinguisher in that situation,

244
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,070
we wouldn't have had all this! Because of me, we have it all!

245
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,390
You're always clumsy but you show off so much after doing well once.

246
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,290
What do you mean I'm clumsy? I calculated everything from the beginning.

247
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,820
By the way, Ah Ryeong, you called me "my oppa" earlier.

248
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,700
What?

249
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,650
- When did I?
 - You did, earlier.

250
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,340
Right. I heard it too.

251
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,550
What do you mean? How cheesy. I didn't say that.

252
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,920
You're shy.

253
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,890
- Ah really.
 - It's okay. We allow you to call us in the name of brotherhood.

254
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,970
Hey, isn't that between men?

255
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,180
That's what I'm saying. I allow brotherhood among all three of us.

256
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,230
That's enough!

257
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,760
Ah seriously.

258
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,450
Yes?

259
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,030
Yes. We just finished up.

260
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,550
Okay.

261
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,590
- Was it Ha Ri?
 - Yes.

262
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,780
What did he say?

263
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,300
He said there is a plan that we will like.

264
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,750
A plan that we like?

265
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,300
- Are we going on vacation?
 - Vacation?

266
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,090
I have to take care of my skin.

267
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,730
Yes. Where are you?

268
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,230
Come to the place that I texted. I'm going there.

269
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,690
Yeah.

270
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,780
Hey you!

271
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,420
You f**k!

272
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,360
Bastard.

273
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,180
Die, you bastard!

274
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,460
That's right, die you bastard!

275
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,850
Yeah, run away!

276
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,130
Run away, you bastard!

277
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,390
What's this? What's this?!

278
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,980
Are you okay?

279
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,170
Are you okay?

280
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,040
We have to take him to the hospital.

281
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,100
It's epidural hemorrhage.

282
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,450
The affected area is very wide, and the intracranial pressure is high. So we have to wait and see.

283
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,060
Luckily, the bleeding stopped.

284
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,430
Then he's going to live?

285
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,500
There'll be no issues to his survival, will there?

286
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,700
When the patient becomes conscious, we'll test him again.

287
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,080
Doctor, please tell us if he's going to be okay or not—

288
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,090
This punk, what was he doing?

289
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,010
This must've been done by Jin Yong Joon, that bastard, right?

290
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,840
No. When I asked the police, they said this was just an accident.

291
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,520
Will he be okay?

292
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,470
Yeah, he'll be okay.

293
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,170
He is not a guy who would give up his life that easily.

294
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,420
I knew this kind of thing would happen to him someday.

295
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,300
It's a good thing that we took some money for ourselves—

296
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,680
How can you say that in front of someone who's hurt?

297
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,200
Hey, did I say anything wrong?

298
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,540
This happened to him because he tried to show off all by himself without discussing it with us.

299
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,590
You still should speak while considering the situation!

300
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,030
Ugh, so frustrating, really.

301
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,660
Hey, Ah Ryeo— Ah Ryeong.

302
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,040
Just because you said useless words.

303
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,650
Hey, it's because I'm also frustrated! I'm frustrated.

304
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,180
Geez.

305
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,170
Yes.

306
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,310
Yes. I got it, Prosecutor General.

307
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,720
Yes.

308
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,020
Proceed, and quickly.

309
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,870
Search, seize, and investigate that bastard Prosecutor Jang's office too.

310
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,580
Find everything related to us.

311
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,520
Yes, Chief Prosecutor.

312
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,050
Impertinent bastard!

313
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,190
Where is Prosecutor Jang In Gyu?

314
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,710
He is not here right now.

315
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,020
What's the matter, Deputy Chief?

316
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,020
Won't you move?

317
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,930
You're nothing special.

318
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,720
Let's go, Madam.

319
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,480
You go ahead and continue investigating.

320
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,190
- Yes
 - Yes.

321
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,300
Tell Prosecutor Jang...

322
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,500
Let's wait and see what will happen in the future.

323
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,160
Where did everyone go?

324
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,660
I have to acknowledge your persistance.

325
00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:01,320
You should have hidden and stayed low if your life line was long.

326
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,730

327
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:10,040
Did you... want this that badly?

328
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:14,470
Why? Because of money?

329
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,850
No.

330
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:23,770
It couldn't have been just money, right?

331
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,240
If you had done all this only for money,

332
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,530
you wouldn't have prepared this kind of stuff secretly.

333
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,250
Isn't that right?

334
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,990
Hey, I'm sorry.

335
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,280
I just brought up the money because I was upset momentarily.

336
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,540
Sorry! I made a mistake!

337
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,500
Are you the only ones with tempers?

338
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,480
I'm just going home then.

339
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,190
Aish! I'm leaving!

340
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,060
- I'm sorry... What? What—
 - Run!

341
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,050
- What?
 - Just run!

342
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,020
Why, you punk? Use your words!

343
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,230
Come here, you bastard!

344
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,760
Why did you, a complete stranger,

345
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,610
visit me twice?

346
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,400
Did Prosecutor Jang order you to do it?

347
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,160
Or... because of a personal grudge?

348
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,130
That must be it! Well...

349
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,110
You're not only one person who would feel wronged.

350
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,280
Even so,  you should've selected a person

351
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,970
after you put in some consideration.

352
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:40,090
I must've looked like an easy person, right?

353
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,810
Everyone will soon find out what kind of jerk you are.

354
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,850
If they find out, what are you going to do?

355
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,880
Right. I did it!

356
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,910
I received money and covered up the incidents. So?

357
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:03,730
So?  Who is going to do what?  Look here! All these bastards here.

358
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,070
All of the guys listed on here are prosecutors and judges.

359
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:11,870
All of the guys who entrusted the cases to me were all politicians and chairmen!

360
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,990
Except for those people,

361
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:21,110
who could catch me? You? A mere you?

362
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:29,290
So do you think I'll give up?

363
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,820
No. If you had been that kind of bastard,

364
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,060
you would've given up a long time ago.

365
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,870
But what are you going to do?

366
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:45,250
I think you won't have any chances from now on.

367
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,270
Then, die.

368
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,810
Jin Woong! Wait for me!

369
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,180
Wait for me!

370
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,770
This way!

371
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,180
Die! Die, bastard!

372
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,470
Die, die!

373
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,930
- Why? It won't open?
 - No.

374
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,880
I'm going to go crazy.

375
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:47,080
- Let's finish up.
 - Mustache Ahjussi.

376
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,270
Why do you keep chasing us? It's tiring for both of us.

377
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:53,530
I know, right? I would also like to know.

378
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:11,360
You shouldn't have set everything up by yourself.

379
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,260
You're the one who set things up.

380
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,780
Hey, computer. Move!

381
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,460
You stupid.

382
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,220
You should have used your brains.

383
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,930
See? I told you to stop fighting.

384
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,340
Come on! Come at me, you punk!

385
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,780
Ta-da.

386
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,600
Now, cheese!

387
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,260
Smile. We're going to put this on the internet.

388
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,270
Smile! Nicely!

389
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,040
Who are you, bastards?

390
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,990
I told you.

391
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,320
You're the one who set things up.

392
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,310
From the start.

393
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,110
Wow, what a great picture.

394
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,880
 There's no time, hurry, hurry.

395
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,470
 Okay, I got it.

396
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:24,240
 - Hey can I get out too?
 - No. You're fat and you'll be caught as soon as you get out.

397
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,680
 - Are you ready?
 - Yes.

398
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,470
 Let's go.

399
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,720
 Hold on tight, hold on.

400
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,750
 You hit him too hard, didn't you?

401
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,030
 Hey, hey, hey! Take this.

402
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,750
 Are you okay? Come to your senses.

403
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,500
-  Aigoo, are you okay. 
- I'm okay.

404
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,410
 Come to your senses.

405
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:58,160
 Ah Ryeong, you didn't hit him too hard, did you?  I'll pour some of this here.

406
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,200
 - Are you okay?
 - I'm not okay.

407
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,750
 He is really heavy.

408
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,250
 He is really very heavy.

409
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,020
 Ah seriously.

410
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,870
Put that down a little bit and look over here.

411
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,770
Excuse me!

412
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:31,440
Well, you confessed as much as you could.

413
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,530
All you need to do is get arrested, right?

414
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,710
Oh! Charges for attempted murder will be added too.

415
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,570
Confession? What's the confession?

416
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,670
Do you have evidence? Do you have evidence, you bastards?!

417
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,980
Evidence? Wait just a minute.

418
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,490
Take a look!

419
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:57,630
 If they find out, what are you going to do? That's right.  I did it!

420
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,580
 I received money and covered up the incidents. So?

421
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:08,580
 So?  Who is going to do what? Look here!  All of the guys listed on here are prosecutors and judges.

422
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:14,730
 All of the guys who entrusted the cases to me were politicians and chairmen!

423
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:19,360
At first, I didn't believe this would work.

424
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,040
But this smart TV recording doesn't get detected by an eavesdropping detection device.

425
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,100
 When the situation got worse before, I showed the recording from a smart TV.

426
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:33,390
 You were so surprised that you asked how such a thing existed.  He looked like a child at that time.

427
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,620
- You saw it, right? I contributed some, right?
 - Stay quiet, please!

428
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,840
- Arrest him.
 - Yes, sir.

429
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,850
Don't come!!

430
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,270
Don't come near me, you punks!

431
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:55,620
- Hey, hey, come over here. Ah really.
 - I'll chase him.

432
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,770
Hey, hey, hey, just leave him.

433
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:02,160
Let them catch up with each other, it's been a long time.

434
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,060
Aish.

435
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,800

436
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,100

437
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,460
Such a long time, fifteen years.

438
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,670
That's why I said you could look forward to it.

439
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,580
Let's go together.

440
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,320
I'll cut nicely

441
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,380
that gold team for you.

442
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,910
It looks like you're on the sh*t team now.

443
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,420
Prosecutor. Nice tackle!

444
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,980
Let's hold him up and make him stand.

445
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,140
Let go you bastards! Let go! Let go, you jerks!

446
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,100
It's not winter but you wear gloves.

447
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,650
Aigoo, that man will have a very hard time from now on.

448
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,540
Was our acting okay this time?

449
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,690
Pretty much.

450
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,590
Hey, that doctor acted naturally and did very well.

451
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,060
Right. He could be an actor.

452
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,440
What do you think about it in your professional view?

453
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,210
I think he was good because even you guys were fooled.

454
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,980
- What do you mean?
 - Fooled? What were we fooled about?

455
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,790
You mean, from the beginning?

456
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,360
Well, let's go wrap things up.

457
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,560
What is this?

458
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,240
I'm not even curious anymore.

459
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,730
I'm especially doing this because it's your request.

460
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,800
Yeah!

461
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,860
By the way, who are they? They don't seem like they're the bad guys.

462
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,560
Not sure.

463
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,680
What can I say about them?

464
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,260
Anyway, thank you, Sunbae.

465
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,550
I'll treat you to a meal.

466
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,570

467
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,790
Are you going to put me in jail just with the name written on a mere piece of paper?

468
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,510
Are you guys crazy?

469
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,680
Don't you know who I am?

470
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,050
Whom are you trying to bully right now?!

471
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,290
There is no way that we don't know you.

472
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:51,550
But... I heard you liked this kind of stuff.

473
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,340
Where is she?

474
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,230
Don't look at me like that.

475
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,640
It's not free.

476
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,780
Ah.

477
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,880
Please have a look.

478
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,680
There.

479
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,670
You... H-H-How?

480
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,590
I know. You're curious, aren't you?

481
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,590
You can hear more details at the trial.

482
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,030
Section Chief.

483
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,910
Ma'am, would you like to wear silver bracelets?

484
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,770
No, I don't want to!

485
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,940
I really hate it.

486
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,250
Section Chief, bring her courteously.

487
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,620
I really hate doing things that way.

488
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,290
- Come with me.
 - Let go!

489
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,520
- Madam, let's go.
 - Let go of me!

490
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,240
- Let's go.
 - Let go of me!

491
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,720
- Hey guys, help me out.
 - Yes.

492
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,390
Let go of me! Let go!

493
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,500
One, two!

494
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:04,620
 Yeah, it's me. I'm sorry but, could you come to where I am.

495
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,830
 Now.

496
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:11,080
 Are you crazy? Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?

497
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,920
 Who on earth is it that you're acting like this?

498
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,940
 Just a victim... like you and me.

499
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,090
 I'm asking for a favor, please.

500
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:31,730
Right. He isn't the bad guy at least.

501
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,290
Hey, no, no.

502
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,560
Hey, I had a situation where I needed to act like that.

503
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,990
It came out okay, didn't it?

504
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,750
Don't you know how much we worried?!

505
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,680
You should've told us. You punk. Your acting was as good as a main character in a movie.

506
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,820
- It's my fate.
 - Fate, my butt!

507
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,610
I'll send you to the morgue.

508
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,880
- Hey, stop it.
 - Ha Ri, you have problems with your mouth.

509
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,870
Well, I can't help it if they're weird.

510
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:02,420

511
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:07,650
 This morning, a prominent presidential candidate, Mi Chang Party Representative Kim Seong Jin's wife Ryu Hyeon Ja

512
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:10,740
 and Attorney Jin Yong Joon were arrested together.

513
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,900
 Jin was the defending attorney of Yang, who sued Party Representative Kim Seong Jin for sexual harassment recently.

514
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,260
 He insisted on Yang's innocence.

515
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:23,410
 But he was charged on manipulating the trials after receiving a great sum of money from Ryu.

516
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,280
 Criminal Profit Recovery Team Prosecutor Jang

517
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,030
 indicted Jin for violation of the attorney law.

518
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:33,790
 And he showed strong will that he would confiscate his illegally earned legal fees.

519
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:38,800
 Additionally, the head prosecutors who received bribes from Jin and helped to cover up the cases

520
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,590
 are also not free from suspicion of receiving bribes.

521
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:46,620
 The case is attracting attention as to how far the prosecution's reach will go.

522
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,700
You're here.

523
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,880
Here are the arrest warrants.

524
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:03,020
This one is for Chief Prosecutor. This one is for Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

525
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,580
They're still warm because they're hot off the press.

526
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,950
Please cooperate without making a fuss.

527
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,270
Jang In Gyu, you bastard.

528
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,660
- Section Chief.
 - Yes.

529
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,690
I'll escort you.

530
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:26,080
Don't think that this is the end.

531
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,020
Someone will always fill an empty seat.

532
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,120
Empty seat?

533
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,080
Yes.

534
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,060
There are so many empty seats in jail as well. Take him courteously.

535
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,520
Let's go.

536
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,550
- Get up, please.
 - Let go. Let go!

537
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:47,120
Easy, easy. He's been exercising lately.

538
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,930
You can't play the golf that you like for a while.

539
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:57,170
You can exercise with the gangsters.

540
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,440

541
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,820
Yes. Please do me this favor.

542
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:39,390
I can give you as much money as you want, so please help me once. Just once, please.

543
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,350
You must be mistaken about something.

544
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:49,820
I can earn as much money as I want.

545
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,350
What?

546
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,520
 I'll take this out.

547
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:14,660
- Wait a moment. Inspector Lee, wait.
 - Yes.

548
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,970
You have Jin Yong Joon's phone, right? Give it to me for a moment.

549
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:19,520
That? It wasn't in the evidence.

550
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,400
Why isn't it there?

551
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:40,490

552
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,980
 Was it you?

553
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,580
 "The Man"?

554
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:54,260
See you soon.

555
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:57,990
Because your turn is next.

556
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:04,140

557
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,550

558
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,860
That's enough for today. You can go.

559
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,360
We have a long fight coming up.

560
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,730
Are you going somewhere, Prosecutor?

561
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:58,390
Yes. There's someone I really want to see.

562
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,310
Really... want to see... Oh!

563
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,920
- It's not like that.
 - Ah!

564
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,450
Good luck, Prosecutor!

565
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,890
- Good luck.
 - Good Luck.

566
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,340

567
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:53,940
♫  It doesn't wither away, the thorn-like memories  ♫

568
00:49:54,910 --> 00:50:01,200
♫  It doesn't heal, the old wounds  ♫

569
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:07,270
♫  Like the wind that stagnates after hitting a wall  ♫

570
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,590
I've only just finished the first step.

571
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:13,330

572
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,860
Though it's only just the beginning now.

573
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:22,790
♫  Run backwards, I've stopped  ♫

574
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:30,970
♫  My time my life lives yesterday again  ♫

575
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:37,950
♫  I'm in the yesterday, still in my yesterday  ♫

576
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:44,810
♫  Shadow-like memories, keep following me  ♫

577
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:52,340
♫  To help me escape from here, to help me open my eyes  ♫

578
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:59,620
♫  To help me from falling further, someone get me out of here  ♫

579
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:20,680
♫  I can't hear the sound of my heart  ♫

580
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:27,900
♫  I live everyday holding my breath  ♫

581
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:34,780
♫  The endless darkness, like the stars that's lost their way  ♫

582
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:41,480
♫  Even if I use my energy, I can't escape from yesterday  ♫

583
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:48,760
♫  When I look, when I call out, it's not there  ♫

584
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,300
♫  The day that will hug me  ♫

585
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,040
There's no one who would come here.

586
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,810
♫  I can't see the light that will embrace me  ♫

587
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:03,940
♫  I'm in the yesterday, still in my yesterday  ♫

588
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,750
♫  Shadow-like memories  ♫

589
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:10,150
Since we did a big thing, we should have a team dinner.

590
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:12,110
Don't worry, it's my treat.

591
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:16,240
We'll go to a nice place, so dress up nicely.

592
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,840
Don't wear whatever you were wearing yesterday.

593
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:25,400
Okay.
 ♫  To help me from falling further  ♫

594
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:40,190
- Yes.
 - Thank you.

595
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,200
- Hi.
 - Hi.

596
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,700
Welcome!

597
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,950
You're here.

598
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,040
Killer, right?

599
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,230
Are you wearing your nephew's clothes? It's about to rip at the seams.

600
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:54,360
What are you talking about? These are custom-made clothes from a tailor. Custom-made.

601
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,460
Why are you wearing clothes like this? I told you to wear nice clothes.

602
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,150
Speaking of you, are you a gigolo?

603
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:04,220
You always wear white suits and shirts. Stop wearing them, please.

604
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,050
He doesn't even know the p in fashion, and he always wears stuff like this.

605
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,490
Fashion starts with an f, you punk.

606
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,020
Is spelling important among friends?

607
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,350
Sorry.

608
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:16,580
Be careful. I was almost upset.

609
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,550
What about Ah Ryeong?

610
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,420
She took too long so we left her.

611
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,390
- Really? How late was she? 
 - Yeah

612
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,050
Three... She was quite late. About five minutes?

613
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:25,830
No, no.

614
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,340
We could wait for five minutes, but about six minutes?

615
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,300
- How could we wait for her for six minutes?
 - Ah, really, you punks.

616
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,770
How can people wait for six minutes? You're talking nonsense.

617
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,760
Let's go in already!

618
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,590
There is no basic concept about it. Ah Ryeong is here.

619
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,520
That's Ah Ryeong's car.

620
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,840
She drives that by herself?

621
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,040
Aigoo. Don't mention it.

622
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,530
Wow.

623
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:23,580
Is it too much?

624
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,530
I can't look.

625
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,410
- Where did you buy that dress?
 - Why do you ask?

626
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,650
Because the shoulder parts look very good.

627
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,620
I want to buy one for myself.

628
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,750
He just said it to tease you because you look pretty.

629
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,460
Pretty! Yup. Let's go!

630
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,460
Let's go in.

631
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,070
It's full at the shoulders.

632
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,160
You looked at Jin Yong Joon's expression when he was shocked, didn't you?

633
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,850
He was stuttering and couldn't do anything.

634
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,530
He had a complete mental breakdown.

635
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,650
That's just how well we do our work.

636
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:54,310
So if someone needs actors next time, just tell us.

637
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:56,190
We'll be there at the right time and the right place.

638
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,560
We can set a trap with a beautiful woman too.

639
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,570
Beauty? Who?

640
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:03,350
Who else?

641
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:06,580
- Who is it?
 - You want to die? Seriously!

642
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,380
I can die but who are you referring to?

643
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,520
- But, really! Who?
 - Hey, hey,

644
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,170
Stop it. Who do you think? But, for real, who is it? Huh?

645
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,070
Really.

646
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,020
Now, now, now. Great work everyone!

647
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,760
- Cheers!
 - Cheers!

648
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,820
For Byeong Min!

649
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,660
Cheers.

650
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:31,330
By the way, how is Yang Hee Joo's trial going?

651
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:35,870
She appealed. A new lawyer's on her case so everything will go well.

652
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:36,920
With your money?

653
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,230
You're spending a lot of money these days.

654
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,610
What is life?  We just live spending what we need without hesitation.

655
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:41,920
Then can I order more?

656
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,900
Of course! You can order anything, for example...

657
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,290
Well like, kimbap, ramen, tteokbokki.

658
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,350
Ah you're so petty.

659
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,220
It's a joke, a joke.

660
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,440
I'm going to the restroom.

661
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,190
Order to your heart's content. We're going to split the bill.

662
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:58,150
Ah really.

663
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:54,530

664
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,560
What in the world are we doing in the middle of a team dinner?

665
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,580
Did anything come up?

666
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,080
We came back all of a sudden in the middle of dinner.

667
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,390
And you asked me to search something but there is nothing between 9 and 3, you punk.

668
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,040
Nothing was recorded during those hours?

669
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,130
Nothing.

670
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:40,800
- Really nothing?
 - No, nothing. Why are you acting like this?

671
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:55,990
I couldn't finish dinner.

672
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,300
It ruined the mood.

673
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,330
It's not something that we can just let slide.

674
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:02,210
Didn't you see his approval ratings drop?

675
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:04,170
Even so, how can we find a substitute?

676
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,260
The presidential election is around the corner.

677
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,460
Then do you want to keep going with Kim Seong Jin?

678
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,500
 Without any plan?

679
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,720
 Then what do we do?

680
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,980

681
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:33,790
No, it's not like that!

682
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:36,660
Then what are we going to do?

683
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,690
Nothing is going to work!

684
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:52,580

685
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,500
What about the appealed trial?

686
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,620
Why do we have to keep him—

687
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,320
We won't change the candidate.

688
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,990

689
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:46,900

690
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:51,150
♫  If you lose your everything  ♫

691
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:55,900
♫  Think you can’t go back to the time  ♫

692
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:00,410
♫  Keep in mind, it’s not your fault  ♫

693
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:04,380
♫  In the end, I am gonna be with you  ♫

694
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,780
♫  Just walk without thinking, when you lose  ♫

695
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,820
♫  Fall, fall as far as you can, when you get further from happiness  ♫

696
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,770

697
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:12,310
 What happened?

698
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:13,040
 He committed suicide.

699
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,910
 We won't change the candidate.

700
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:18,140
 Nothing disappeared, except a key.

701
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,150
 That slush fund is in Korea.

702
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,590
 What happened to Choi Hyeon Gi, or whoever that was?

703
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:24,640
 Start it.

704
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,530
 That's what I mean!

705
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:27,150
 Why are you involved in this case?

706
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:29,890
 You know very well how it feels

707
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:30,880
 when you get betrayed by someone you trust.

708
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,020
 You have to use only this ball because I put GPS in here.

709
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,010
 I'll fix it.

710
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:36,810
 With whose permission are you doing such a thing?

711
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,560
-  It seems Daddy was here. 
 - What?

712
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,220
♫  Until we part, I be riding with you  ♫

713
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,160
♫  If you lose your everything  ♫
