1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,180

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,760

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,100

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,110

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,050

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,740

7
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,950

8
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,890

9
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:58,000

10
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,380
 President Lee will grant his third special pardon this afternoon.

11
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,970
 Contrary to our expectation that individuals granted clemency would be mainly working-class offenders such as commoners or small businessmen,

12
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,590
 the list includes a lot of politicians and a conglomerate tycoon. It is currently wrapped in controversy.

13
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,790
 Particularly, Chairman Cheon Dong Seob, nicknamed King of Moneylenders in Gangnam

14
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,120
 is included on the list of names, drawing even more criticism in the media.

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,510
You've been having a hard time during this time, Chairman.

16
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,700
It's okay. Don't mention it.

17
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,940
Thanks to you, I took a relaxing break here, Warden.

18
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,830
Don't mention it. People have to help each other out, you know.

19
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:22,040
Ah, this... what you mentioned last time.

20
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,590
I'm a bit embarrassed of my hand.

21
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,250

22
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,270
My Warden, you're really...

23
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,060
I like that you're always the same.

24
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,320
Ah, you're on the ball.  You're very solid.

25
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,820
Here.

26
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,000
Let me see.

27
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,120
Chairman, you've got a visitor.

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,330
Who is it?

29
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,400
He's saying he is some kind of prosecutor.

30
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,770
Wow, you look better,  Chairman Cheon.

31
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,240
Beans must really be good for your health.

32
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,990
Yeah, well, I've been living a well-regulated life.

33
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,290
By the way, I've never seen you before.

34
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,970
By any chance, have we met before?  I don't usually remember any stooges.

35
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,170
Stooge.

36
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,030
But It was you who were caught by a nameless stooge and had to stay like this, wasn't it?

37
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,090
Wow, you're better at jeering than you look.

38
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:25,700
People should have some courtesy, even if you wear nice clothes.

39
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,080
Ah. Sorry!

40
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,360
Then I'm inquiring cordially.

41
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,500
Where is the laundromat?

42
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,860
Why are you asking me that?

43
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,550
I should ask you about someone who washed your pockets.

44
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,630
Who else should I ask?

45
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:55,300
Ah, really.   I think you should know better about it because you're the one who lives outside of jail.

46
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,140
If you're that curious, ask Prosecutor Jang.

47
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,490
He's still running around everywhere in order to find my money.

48
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,390
In this way?

49
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,140
What is it?

50
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,320
You look like you still don't get what's going on.

51
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,230
Exercise, foot volleyball, soccer, table tennis, running...  They're doing all sorts of things.

52
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,640
That scammer won't be stopping his scams after you.

53
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,450
He's swindling everybody of your organization, from the legs to the arms to the heart.

54
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,910
Next one is that laundromat.

55
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,820
I don't care at all whether you lend money or sell drugs again.

56
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,470
That punk! All I need to do is to catch that punk.

57
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,420
So if you want to get your money—

58
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,480
Damn!  Hey, Mr. Prosecutor.

59
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,860
I'm Chairman Cheon.

60
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,960
I look like I'm being swindled as I quietly sit here, right?

61
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,500
Even if you go after him, I'm going to find out who he is myself.

62
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,640
And I'll catch him myself.

63
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,950
Here.

64
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,730
Why crumple it, huh?

65
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,030
Ah really. Why do people crumple it?

66
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,640
What is it?

67
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,960
Hello, Gong Myeong Check Cashing that cherishes and loves money.

68
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,750
Yes, Chairman Cheon.

69
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,270
A visitor will be coming. So fold and put away all the unwashed laundry.

70
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,190
What?

71
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,380
All of it?

72
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,220
Yeah. Everything.

73
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,660
- Hey, are you ready?
 -   Yeah.

74
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,150
 Everything's set.

75
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,350
Okay. Let's get on with it then.

76
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,040

77
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,440

78
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,660
Hurry.

79
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,560
Hey, Chairman Cheon ordered it, so hurry and bring the cash!

80
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,780
What do you mean where? Of course, Wonsung Hotel!

81
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,400
I should iron his tongue out.

82
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,730
Go!

83
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,560

84
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,680
How about Jin Woong?

85
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,370
 He is warming up.

86
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,430
Did you get the location?

87
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,120
Yes. Suite room on the 28th floor. It's Chairman Cheon's secret office.

88
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,570
It has its own private elevator.

89
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,480
What?

90
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,590
Private elevator? Why?

91
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,350
 You know that punk pays a lot of money. Anyhow, be careful. It's crawling with security there.

92
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,410
Okay.  Don't worry about that.

93
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,280
Now, the montage begins.

94
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,950

95
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,960
Yes.  I just got here.

96
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,040
Yes.

97
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,500
Yes. Yes.

98
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,850

99
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,040

100
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,480
Wait, wait, just a minute, come on! Found it!

101
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,610
Bingo, I found it!

102
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,390

103
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,730
- Hey, I think I have to leave first.
 - What?

104
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,890
-Then, w-what do you want me to do here?
 - I'm really sorry,

105
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll send someone else soon!

106
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,050

107
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,840
Are you here to replace him?

108
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,620
Nope.

109
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,760
Then who...

110
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,750
I'm a cop.

111
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,340
Don't be nervous, it's all right. You did nothing wrong.

112
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,370
The ones up there are the bad ones.

113
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,290
You must have a hard time taking care of your widowed mother, right?

114
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,280
How did you know about that?

115
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,160
Of course I know! There's nothing the Korean police don't know.

116
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,420
There's someone coming. It's just one person.

117
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,170
Okay! We're good here, go somewhere else.

118
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,260
You saw that, right? Your luck today isn't good. We have officers surrounding the area today.

119
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,310
I-I don't know anything. I swear I just did what the higher-ups told me to and I just—

120
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:45,100
I know, I know, I know everything! That's why I'm here.

121
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,380
- You want some?
 - No, thanks.

122
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,330
You don't like these?

123
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,940
No, I like them, but not right now. Who would be able to eat right now?

124
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,780
You're not feeling it?

125
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,700
What do you want to do?

126
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,270
- If you want to remain loyal to them, it's only 5 years in prison and you're out. 
 - No, no!

127
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,720
What? You don't want to? Then are you going to keep standing here?

128
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,190
Can I just leave right now?

129
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,980
Right now?

130
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,560
I'm letting you off the hook because of your mother.

131
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,990
Yes! T-Thank you!

132
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,710
- Sure.
 - Yes!

133
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,730
Hey, hey, hey!

134
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,940
Eat this on your way. It's good for your brain.

135
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,300
Yes. T-Thank you!

136
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,920
Don't stammer so much.

137
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,640
- Be a good son!
 - Yes!

138
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,010
Goodness, you must be working hard. I have something to report.

139
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,070
- Section Chief Maeng! 
 - Yes?

140
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,680
Everyone, stop! Move out! Quickly!

141
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,200
We're going to get busy soon!

142
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,520
- We don't have time. Pack everything, understand? 
 - Yes, sir!

143
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,000
- Make sure the cash doesn't get wrinkled, alright? 
 - Yes, sir!

144
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,490
What is this? Where is he from?

145
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,910
Sec— Ugh, English! Who the heck are you?

146
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:44,920
You're here? Look at this! No matter how much I take, there's no end! Can you smell the money?

147
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,510
- Hey, did you call him? 
 - No, it's my first time seeing him.

148
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,550
Don't just stand there stupidly and come help me bag this. My shoulder's hurting!

149
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,020
- Are you talking to us right now? 
 - Huh?

150
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,990
No, don't mind me. I wasn't talking to you all. Mind your own business.

151
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,230
Aside from us, who else—

152
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,190
What? First time seeing someone here to take the money?

153
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,220
What the heck? Are you wearing a parka? Hey, rip him apart!

154
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,400
Why are you bastards just being slapped around?

155
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,780
Catch him! Get him!

156
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,290
Hey, hey, hey! Why are you being lifted like a loser?

157
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,130
Hey, be gentle!

158
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,570
Ah, you quick bastard. Now I understand, bastards.

159
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,030
Sir, you can't park here— It's the cops, call for backup!

160
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,750
You're not calling anyone! Section Chief Maeng!

161
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,260
Get through before he calls them!

162
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,140
- Move aside! 
 - You can't do this here!

163
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:20,550
 Move aside! Move!

164
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,230
What's with these jerks?

165
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,130
Please save me.

166
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,490
You won't die.

167
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,790
Get up, come on!

168
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,840
Cuff them and organize what's needed.

169
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,990
It's empty, Prosecutor.

170
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,720
Hey, open the trunk!

171
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,130
- What took you so long? I was scared to death!
 - What about the CCTVs?

172
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,020
- Of course, dead.
 - Did you cut the circuits?

173
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,760
I don't know, I hope I did! Just get in!

174
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,160
Come on, quickly!

175
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,810

176
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,210
Lock-down the parking lot! Now!

177
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,190
Emergency Exit! Come on, run! Run!

178
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,110

179
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,500
Aigoo. Thank you for your work!

180
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,360
- Thank you for your work!
 - Alright, thank you!

181
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,700
My acting was good, wasn't it?

182
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,490
What's good? You were cowering in fear.

183
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,490
Who was cowering in fear? I was a natural.

184
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,930
- Do you salute with your left hand? 
 - My left hand was an ad-lib.

185
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,080
When will Ah Ryeong be here?

186
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,870
Hey, c-catch that bastard!

187
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,500
Hey, they noticed! Step on it!

188
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,200
What?

189
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,390
Step on it, you bastard!

190
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,000
- Let's go, come on! 
 - Step on it!

191
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,390
I have to make them stop chasing me! There are more behind them!

192
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,960
Drive properly, you bastard!

193
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,210
I told you I wouldn't be good at driving.

194
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,190
- Hey, this won't work! Move, I'll do it! 
 - No, don't touch me!

195
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,160
- Hey, hey, hey! 
- Let go, you bastard!

196
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,500
- Move your hand! 
 - You're making me move!

197
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,730
 Hey, watch out for the cars behind!

198
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,030
 Hey, hey, hey, be careful.

199
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,660
 - Should I just drive? 
 - B-Be quiet! Don't talk to me!

200
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,930
- Don't make me talk! 
 - Step on it!

201
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,290
- I am stepping on it, you bastard! You fat pig, we're going slow because of you! 
 - Why are you blaming it on me?

202
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,600
- Hey! 
 - Come on!

203
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,660
 Hurry, hurry, come on!

204
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,460
 - Move! 
 - Hey, watch out!

205
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,380
Fast, fast.

206
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,460
I did it. I did it. I did it!

207
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,660
- We did it! 
 - I did it! We did it!

208
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,660
Sure, we'll think of it like that.

209
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,250
We did a good job, didn't we? We did it!

210
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,990
When I stepped on the pedal, I knew that we would pass!

211
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,570
What's with that bastard on the motorcycle who's not falling off?

212
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,200
Congratulations, CEO.

213
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,750
Go on then.

214
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,630
- Wow, who is this? 
- Where did you hide the cash?

215
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,290
What cash?

216
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,350
Where did you hide your cash?

217
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:05,080
Why do you talk about money whenever you see me?   I'm the one that paid fines even though I was broke.

218
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,290
Wonsung Hotel 28th floor is yours, isn't it?

219
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,070
I have no idea what you're talking about. Of course, it's not mine!

220
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,070
Really? Then I guess this isn't yours either.

221
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,350
What is that?

222
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,970
Yeah, I didn't think it was yours.

223
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,460
Is this...

224
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,270
Come here.

225
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:50,150
Buy some fruit with this on your way home later.

226
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,280
I'm sorry.  I misunderstood you unnecessarily, didn't I?

227
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,260
Oh, yeah!

228
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,950
This...  Someone asked me to deliver this to you.

229
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,530
Congratulations on your being really broke.

230
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,120

231
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,830
Let's go.

232
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,130
It's a proof item.

233
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,170
 Thanks for the allowance. From Stooge

234
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,540
Prosecutor! Prosecutor.

235
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,290
Wait a minute!

236
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,070
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

237
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,330
Hey, wait! Prosecutor, wait! Bastard, wait!

238
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,510
CEO!

239
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,710
- Prosecutor!
 - Chairman!
 - Are you okay?

240
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,500
Let go! Let go, you bastards!

241
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,860
Hey! Hey!

242
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,350
Give it back!

243
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,720
Are you sure that this is Chairman Cheon's criminal earnings?

244
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,120
- How was it found?
 - What is the newly formed team's name?

245
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,080
Our team's name is...

246
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,930
It was really awesome.

247
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,900
Ah, it was good!

248
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:25,450

249
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,340

250
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,630

251
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,260
 Prosecutor, I've obtained the CCTV footage of those bastards.

252
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,060
 Let's go.

253
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,560
 - Team Leader, let's start.
 - Yes.

254
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,850
 We'll start now.

255
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,770
 His name is Do Jin Woong. Until recently,

256
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,130
 he was a nationally-recognized fighter.

257
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,320
 He wasn't affiliated with a particular gang or organization

258
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,160
 but if he was paid, he would use his fists for any side, as long as he was paid. A sort of final solution.

259
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,810
 There's a rumor that he's never lost in a 1:1 fight.

260
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,790
 His arms look like Ma Dong Seok's.

261
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,630
 - Next. 
 - Okay, next.

262
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,750
 Next,  Im Byeong Min.  He won security system hackathons, as a high-schooler.

263
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,970
 He swept the top three renowned international hacking defense competitions, DIXCON CTF,

264
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,720
 WELCON in Taiwan, and  KAPCON in Japan.

265
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,620
 And he became the first Asian winner when he participated in the final attack of the Canada Financial Security Hacking Competition.

266
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,100
 He's earned the highest prize money in competition history.

267
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,210
  There's a rumor that the NIS scouted him when he was 20.

268
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,600
  He's known to have the "hands of God" in this field of work.

269
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,730
  Yes!

270
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,580
 He was most recently a government hunter at an unknown association.

271
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,780
 He disappeared just before we arrested Chairman Cheon.

272
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,870
  Just before?

273
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,770
 Yes. According to the organization members, it seemed he betrayed them and left.

274
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,360
  Next.

275
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,890
  Lastly, this con artist is the most important because he's the center of it all.

276
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,470
  Look here.

277
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,370
 From Mr. Byeon,  Professor Sim, to even Chairman Cheon.

278
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,050
 Whenever these notorious swindlers were caught, he was there at each site.

279
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,320
 Also, the victims always stated that they were cheated by him.

280
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,830
  About his personal information...

281
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,760
 I still don't know yet.

282
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,360
 He just appeared from nowhere.  Our information networking is...

283
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,220
  Move on.

284
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,270
  Stop.

285
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,290
  A fighter, a con artist,

286
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,340
  and a hacker in one place?

287
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,420
  It's an interesting combination.

288
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,760
  It doesn't seem to be a coincidence, does it?

289
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,980
  No, it does not.

290
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,440
  Look into it and find out what they used to do.

291
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,420
  I understand.

292
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,480
  Look at these bastards.

293
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,350
Everyone!

294
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,200
You've waited long enough. Starting now,

295
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,580
we'll reveal our next target.

296
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,340
Those who cause social problems by running all sorts of tricks round the clock.

297
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,910
And those who nicely hide money that won't cause us any trouble even if we steal it,

298
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,830
deep, deep in their hearts.

299
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,530
I chose our target among them.

300
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,670
I ask for your full attention!

301
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,510
Thank you for so many people in attendance at this presentation today also.

302
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,890
Hey, why is he in such a good mood?

303
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,340
I don't know. Maybe it's because we caught Chairman Cheon?

304
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,500
Don't mention him. It's ruining the tension in the room.

305
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:34,210
Whenever that bastard, Chairman Cheon's name, comes up, I even wake up startled in my sleep.

306
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,330
You bastard, I—

307
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,990
I got it now.

308
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,440
Yes, well, we'll start again.

309
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,500
Don't be too shocked.

310
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,160
Now...

311
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,290
Ta-da! Isn't this amazing?

312
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,060
No, not really. There doesn't seem to be much.

313
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,630
How would you know if you just glance over it like that?

314
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,090
No, no. Even if I just glance at it, there are only petty offenders.

315
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,640
Look at it properly, carefully.

316
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,770
They're all A-list con artists!

317
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,970
With things like these, there has to be something that strikes you at first glance,

318
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,100
but there's nothing here. Nope, nope.

319
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,130
- There's no one. 
 - Hey,

320
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,360
Are you doing physiognomy these days as well?  Then you should prepare this. Did you prepare? Is there a target?

321
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,770
Nothing, you have nothing.

322
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,860
I don't know. How about someone like him?

323
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,320

324
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,660
Ji Mok Hyeon. The Hyeongjin Group CEO?

325
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,740
Look at this.

326
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,930
You want to mess with a chaebol?

327
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,630
Recently, he's been investigated for supplying slush funds to politicians.

328
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,830
The secretary responsible for managing those slush funds confessed.

329
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,970
Eight billion won out of 40 billion won that was illegally collected through his affiliated companies,

330
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,270
he stored in a safe in the basement.

331
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,380
- Eight billion? 
 - Yeah.

332
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,240
When the prosecutors arrived, the safe was empty. We can assume that the information was leaked prior to their arrival.

333
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,880
That money should be safely stored away somewhere by now.

334
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,360
I like the grand scale.

335
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,750
I don't think we should mess with a chaebol. What if we get caught—

336
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:19,010
Don't worry about it.  We'll only mess with as much as we can handle. And it perfectly matches our business purpose.

337
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:23,240
I'm saying, let's prey on the money that nobody can report when we prey on it.

338
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,420
Still, even if we do that—

339
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,950
- Who's in? 
 - I don't discriminate against my opponents

340
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,110
and I owe you one too.

341
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,580
Okay. What about you?

342
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,940
This is too dangerous.

343
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,830
- Okay, stay out of this one. Eight to two ratio.
 - Yeah, stay out of this.

344
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,390
- Five to five. 
 - Ha Ri.

345
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,960
- Seven to three. 
 - Ha Ri. Ha Ri.

346
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,280
- Listen to m— Ha Ri.
 - I have to use strength, let's go 5:5.

347
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,740
- Seven to three— 
 - Ha Ri, I'm going to prepare right now. Just give me 30%.

348
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,670
Hey, who's driving?

349
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,700
There's someone I know.

350
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,600

351
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,720
You're nervous, aren't you?

352
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,120
Don't be too nervous.

353
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,390
Just drive comfortably, as you please. Don't be so tense.

354
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,160
Even a horse would pass us.

355
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,170
You see, driving stems from confidence.

356
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:37,800
If you follow the traffic signals and signs, no one can get mad.

357
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,410
 Don't be nervous.

358
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:50,620
Hey, do you rent all the streets? If you were going to crawl like that, you should drive a stroller instead.  You don't know how to drive!

359
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,970
T-That—

360
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,660
What a hot temper.

361
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,080
Supervisor.

362
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,020
Yes?

363
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,430
You said I could drive however I wanted, right?

364
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,170
What? Of course.

365
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,290
W-Why?

366
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,920

367
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,750
My car...

368
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,600
I failed, didn't I?

369
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,810
Pass.

370
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,470
Pass?

371
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:07,270
Pass. Women really aren't for me.

372
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,440
No, you're fine with that.

373
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,360
Enjoy!

374
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,490
Maybe I should've held back a bit?

375
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,670
Ah! You must've lost your mind! Why are you acting like this when you quit?

376
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,150
Get yourself together, Ah Ryeong. Come on!

377
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,010
Wait.

378
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:16,540
Am I going to steal it? No, I'm just going to sit in it.

379
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,070
Wow, this is so nice! What should I do?

380
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,270
Should I make this engine run?

381
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,050
Here.

382
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,060
Thanks—

383
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,230
Who are you?

384
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,970
Tch, isn't that what I should be asking you?

385
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,600
Come on!

386
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,390
If you run away, I'm going to report you.

387
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,160
Everything's being recorded over there.

388
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,410
I think you'll get an additional penalty if you steal something while on probation.

389
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:14,340
- Do you know me? 
 - Of course! There's no way I wouldn't know, since you talked nonstop about freedom on live television.

390
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:20,010
Oh, here it is, "An additional penalty if you steal while you're on probation."

391
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,910
What do you want to do? Should we go to the police station or should we go on a drive and talk?

392
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,930
Talk about what?

393
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:32,200
About work, business.

394
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,200
You pick professionals to pick pocket?

395
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,640
Well, the concept's nice.

396
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,830
All you need to do is to use your specialty, driving us.

397
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,390
Have you ever succeeded?

398
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,130
What? Do I look like an amateur?

399
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,410
No, but it seems a bit unrealistic

400
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,360
and a resume is important in this field of work.

401
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,320
I guess.

402
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,880
We recently made a strong impression on someone named Chairman Cheon.

403
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,390
Ah, so you were the mastermind behind that project? How could I not have recognized such a famous person?

404
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:10,310
You're flattering me. Anything else you're curious about?

405
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,600
Why do you do this type of work when the risk is pretty big?

406
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,750
Ah, good question! Because as dangerous as it is, it pays just as well.

407
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,490
That's it?

408
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,630
I don't know.

409
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,600
Am I allowed to ask what you used to do before?

410
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,430
What do I look like I used to do?

411
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:39,910
I don't think you were an officer, but at the same time, I don't think you were affiliated with a gang or an organization.

412
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,490
You look transparent.

413
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,000
Really?

414
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,200
That's unexpected.

415
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,370
What is?

416
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,860
Most people don't think of me like that.

417
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,120
Then what do they think of you instead?

418
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,700
A con artist.

419
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,530
A good con artist.

420
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,080
Why are those cops lingering around us?

421
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,410
Oh, they're probably here to catch us.

422
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,880
Us? We didn't do anything wrong.

423
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,600
I stole this car.

424
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,180
Wow! Wow, this ahjussi was an actual con artist!

425
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,850
A-Ahjussi?

426
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,290
We'll talk about that later, since we have to survive right now. Let's see your skills.

427
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,710
- Just hold on tight. 
 - Forget it, just go.

428
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,970
Okay, okay! Okay.

429
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,180
Step on it a little more, come on! Straight, just like that!

430
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:59,320
- Harder! Okay! Turn! Turn left! Okay, overtake, okay! 
 - Where am I supposed to turn?

431
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,450
This is nothing.

432
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,670
- Ugh... 
 - Why do you look like that?

433
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,390
Why are you so soulless?

434
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,440
It's nothing.

435
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,630
I can do a good job now! I'm confident in driving!

436
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,910
I'm training him right now!

437
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,250
Hey, shut up with that nonsense and turn that thing off.

438
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,860
It's giving me carsickness.

439
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,110
This looks like a playground, not an office.

440
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,030
What the heck?

441
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,590
- Is she your girlfriend? 
 - What?

442
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,600
Girlfriend? You should've told me earlier, I didn't even wash my hair!

443
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,010
What's the use of washing your hair when you look like a mess anyway?

444
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:43,050
Now, this is Cha Ah Ryeong, who has agreed to work with us from now on.

445
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,650
- And this is— 
 - What? It was a woman?

446
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,910
- That driving star you were talking about? 
 - I don't trust her.

447
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,930
That's good, I feel the same.

448
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,450
You said they were professionals, but all I see are a pair of otakus (obsessed geeks).

449
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,990
- Hey— 
 - If you're going to be like that, then leave!

450
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,120
I should leave? You both look like the textbook version of otakus.

451
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,780
- Ah Ryeong... 
- What in the world? How can someone like her exist?

452
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,220
Come here.

453
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,160
- I don't like her! 
- Me either!

454
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,760
She can hear everything.

455
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,020
Let's talk about work.

456
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,940
You sit next to her! Ugh!

457
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,380
This is the site where Hyeongjin Group's 4th-generation owner Ji Seong Goo's trial is held.

458
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,790
In the suicide note of the late Park Seon Yeong, a former weather caster and beauty pageant contestant,

459
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:38,320
it was written that he sexually assaulted her several times, and distributed clips of the incident. It is causing quite a stir.

460
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,450
Witness.

461
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:45,740
I heard that you were Park Seon Yeong's closest friend since middle school

462
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,400
and were close friends until recently.

463
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,230
You were close enough to

464
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:57,340
share close personal secrets.

465
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,020
Is that correct?

466
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,980
Yes.

467
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,480
Seon Yeong was a friend whom I relied on the most

468
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,890
because no matter how difficult things became, she persisted and that brought me comfort.

469
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,320
But,

470
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,370
after she met him...

471
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,660
  The police and the lawyers are all on his side.

472
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,560
  I really hate how weak and powerless I am.

473
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,970
  I want to stop now.

474
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,390
  I'm home!

475
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:56,600
  Seon Yeong! S-Seon Yeong!

476
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,900
Witness, continue.

477
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,360
From then,

478
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,380
she kept saying that she was sick and tired of living like that,

479
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,810
she would change her life after seducing him.

480
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,150
Witness! Witness?  What are you saying right now?

481
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,700
But it didn't go the way she wanted.

482
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,430
She said she would rather die with him if things were going to be this way.

483
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,730
Stop lying!

484
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,260
Your Honor, the witness is perjuring herself in the sacred court.

485
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,620
The defense attorney will cross-examine.

486
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,540
This is an examination from the prosecution.

487
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,330
I'll allow the cross-examination.

488
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,370
Your Honor!

489
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,560
Be quiet!

490
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,320

491
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,660
The judge has determined that the defendant is unlikely to flee or destroy evidence.

492
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,130
We allow Defendant Ji Seong Goo to be released on bail!

493
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,020
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

494
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,200
Well...

495
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,390
As you said, we did things through the law. And it feels really great.

496
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,450

497
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,810
Yes.

498
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,570
Yes.

499
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:02,210
This incident is easy to handle and finish up, but Prosecutor Jang's character is so straight.

500
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,570
I'll make your son's matter go without a hitch.

501
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,880
Yes, Chairman.

502
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,230
How is it going with Prosecutor Jang?

503
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,710
There is a little trouble with a reason for giving him a punishment, but you don't need to worry about it.

504
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:31,250
I'll take action as soon as possible so he can give up on this matter.

505
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,120
Just leave him alone.  What can he do alone?

506
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,900
He'll need to dig up his own grave sometime soon. At that time, make sure to bury him completely.

507
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,750
Don't make him dig in the past uselessly.

508
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,210
Yes, District Prosecutor.

509
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,030

510
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:56,190

511
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,650
 Prosecutor, I want to stop here.

512
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,380
 Ma'am, the trial is not over yet.

513
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,450
  It was only the first trial.  We should appeal.

514
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,220
 You saw it, Prosecutor.

515
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,420
 The vicious comments on articles about my daughter.

516
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,200
 No one in this world is on our side.

517
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,350
 That's why. You should gather your strength, persistently.

518
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,290
 For that bastard,

519
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:35,010
 he has money and connections too.

520
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,690
 No one can stop

521
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,500
 him anyway.

522
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,440
Hey. Hey!

523
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,470
Ah, yes?

524
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,280
Ah, I'm sorry.

525
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,780

526
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,880
Yeah. Of course, I got out.

527
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,270
I don't know. She died all of a sudden.

528
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,230
By the way, it's been a while since I ate meals in jail.

529
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,430
I felt weird.  Yeah.

530
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,350
I got it.

531
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,980
Why doesn't it die?

532
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,640
I tried to find out about the Hyeongjin Group owner's family.

533
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,400

534
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,760
This family is  much more dysfunctional than I thought.

535
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,130
Of course, you don't even need to mention Chairman Ji, but there is the youngest son.

536
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,390
He was arrested for sexual assault not long ago, and was released on bail right away.

537
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,460
- Hey, "the youngest son." Is he Ji Seong Goo?
 - Bingo!

538
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,760
Why did they free him when the first trial isn't even over yet?

539
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,520
I guess they want to let him destroy the evidence on his own.

540
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,890
I always feel like they are too kind.

541
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:13,420
Our target is Chairman Ji, isn't it?  Why do we try to find out about his family?

542
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,740
The more information we have, the easier it'll be.

543
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,630
Some unexpected weakness like an Achilles' Heel can pop up.

544
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,390
I want to rob them as a package deal if we're going to get them anyway.

545
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,220
I get furious whenever I see people like them.

546
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,320
I'm not getting furious

547
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,310
because I'm not a violent person.

548
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,300
Anyhow, who is taking care of money for him?

549
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,280
Planning and Management Headquarters, Department Head Choi Jeong Min.

550
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,130
Rumors say the chairman trusts him a lot.

551
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,860
This guy is probably the one who hid eight billion won for him.

552
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,310
I got it. Let's start step by step from the bottom.

553
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,640
I'll get Ji Seong Goo's incident materials. Ah Ryeong, follow Department Head Choi.

554
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,240
You try to find out Ji Seong Goo's whereabouts after he was released.

555
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,490
Why do I need to?  His trial is not finished yet.  Do you think he's going to make trouble again?

556
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:56,100
Hey,  water that already boiled once boils faster.

557
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,250
We're lucky if we have something to watch.  Don't you think so?

558
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,970
- Jin Woong, you follow me.
 - See you later.

559
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,140
Is that person the boss here?

560
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,220
No! Not at all!

561
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,780
I'm the boss.

562
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,740
Hey! Are you going to work?  Then hurry and go.

563
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:23,050
Elder, congratulations.

564
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,890
I heard your son also was released.

565
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,520
Thanks to your prayers.

566
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,060
Then bye.

567
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,570
Bye.

568
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,250
We're meticulously conducting the job related to the office.

569
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,240
We also limited the employees' access there.

570
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,190
Pay much attention to it,

571
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,980
so flies won't gather there unnecessarily.

572
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,970
Yes, Chairman.

573
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,580
Where is Seong Goo right now?

574
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,300
 Hey, Ji. When are you going to update?

575
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,470
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

576
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:13,270
- I'm sorry.
 - Ah. It's okay.

577
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,370
I'm really sorry.

578
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,390

579
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,030
 Today.

580
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,130
Yes, Mom.

581
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:56,010
No.  My friend wanted to see me suddenly.

582
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:59,200
Yes.  I'm going to eat now.

583
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,080
Of course, I miss you.

584
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,950
I'll make sure to be there in the evening.

585
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,340
Yes.

586
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,520
I love you too.

587
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,590
Yes. Bye.

588
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:18,200
Bye. Yes.

589
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:42,660
Look here.

590
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,600
Look here.

591
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,320
A little bit.  It's okay.  Get up a little bit.

592
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,400
Put this a little bit like this.

593
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,350
Move a little bit?

594
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,530
Geez, really.

595
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,450
Okay.

596
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,360
Here. Then...

597
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,760
I'll buy you.

598
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:36,140
What?  It's not enough?

599
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,710
Want more?

600
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,460
Is it enough?

601
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:59,280
I'm asking is it enough, huh?

602
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,920
Since I gave you your money...

603
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,490
Listen to me well.

604
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,910
Shit.

605
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,260
Damn.

606
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,580
 It's 911.  Please speak.

607
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,360
Hello, is it the police?

608
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:53,990
Someone is trying to rape me.

609
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:56,110
 Sexual assault?

610
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,800
Please come to save me.

611
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,360
 Where are you?

612
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,540
Here is...?

613
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,020
Probably—

614
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,410
Wow, so hot.

615
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,030
Are you a college student?

616
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,580
Y-Yes.

617
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,770
You're trying to earn your tuition, huh?

618
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,790
Ah, really.  It's okay.

619
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:38,380
Geez, who is ruining the mood?

620
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,450
Who is it?

621
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,210
Team Leader Sim Dal Soo?

622
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,480
Who are...

623
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,410
Oh my, oh my.

624
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:54,360
Pardon?  You're saying to hand over Ji Seong Goo's incident materials?

625
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,920
For that, I really don't think I can—

626
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,010
When I say to hand them over, just hand them over!

627
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:18,000
Thank you.

628
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,770
Work hard.

629
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,150
Take one.

630
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,430
How is it going?

631
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,360
So far, nothing.

632
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:39,540
Yes.

633
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,520
There is no answer with these.

634
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,250
They probably got rid of anything that might be used as evidence.

635
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,090
Can we just reveal the person who got rid of it?

636
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:04,760
If we do, he'll just get censured and freed on a stay of punishment.

637
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,100
There's no law like that.

638
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:10,600
Criminal Act 155-1,  shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 5 years or by a fine not exceeding seven million won.

639
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,980
So even if he gets a red line (criminal record),

640
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,290
he'll probably think he'll be better off to be trusted and recognized by the owner, I think.

641
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:18,080
Wow, how do you know all those?

642
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,830
He probably learned all that to swindle people.

643
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:24,770
Bingo.

644
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,190
Will this project be over after threatening them with things like this?

645
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,960
Oh, what about what I asked for?

646
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,480
That is...  There is something strange but...

647
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,780
I checked all the CCTVs along with his movements.

648
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,630
Look at this.

649
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:43,820
What I'm saying is...

650
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,540
This is from the CCTV of the restaurant that is across from Ji Seong Goo's officetel residence.

651
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,300
The feeling... the feeling by feeling... something forced...

652
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,000
- The feeling... There is some kind of feeling, right? 
- Yeah.

653
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,970
Even though she was not dragged, there is some kind of feeling that she was dragged.

654
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,430
It seems like that.

655
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:01,280
Moreover, it was in the middle of the day.

656
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,690
A chaebol even rode a taxi.  Isn't it strange?

657
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:05,920
Yes, it looks like it's strange somehow.

658
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,510
Try to find this woman's address.

659
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,200
Who are you?

660
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,070
I came from the prosecutor's office.

661
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,560
I would like to see your daughter.

662
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,020
Just leave.  My daughter can't answer your questions.

663
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:30,180
Ma'am.  We're just going to ask a few simple questions.

664
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:34,740
Please go. I told you my daughter can't answer your questions.

665
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:41,600
 They said she got into a hit-and-run accident on the way home after work.

666
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:46,320
According to the police investigators, the accident occurred in a very remote area,

667
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,760
so there is no witness nor CCTV.

668
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,140
If I could have afforded it, I would've let her only study.

669
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:08,850
By any chance, have you seen any strange person recently?

670
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,260
Strange person?

671
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,260
What? Is that all you did to take care of things?

672
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,880
I told you to do it properly!

673
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,700
 Of course, I thought she'd be dead.

674
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,740
But the doc said, she has barely a chance to wake up.

675
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:24,020
So, it's all fine, right?

676
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,630
What kind of shit is that?

677
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,000
If she wakes up by any chance,

678
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,150
you and I will die together, got it?

679
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:36,050
Don't worry.  I've already asked to take care of this matter.

680
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,960
Asked? Who?

681
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,050
I told you before.  That guy.

682
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:45,050
 He...  He is well known as a planner in this field.

683
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,990
 It seems he runs with an organization.

684
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:52,420
 There are a lot of rumors that even the present politicians get nervous in front of him.

685
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:57,460
 And obviously, he's really picky, and he only takes the VIPs.

686
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,920
 When I mentioned your dad's name,

687
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,620
luckily, he accepted you at once.

688
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,540
Did you contact him in person?

689
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,490
No, no, no.

690
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,450
I called a guy who knows him.

691
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,270
and he called another one,

692
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:15,400
and he may have called another one.  Understand?

693
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,400
But for this one, he really killed it.

694
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,250
 This one was handled much better than before.

695
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,370
Hello?

696
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,190
Hello?

697
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,900
It's this person.

698
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:46,330
I can smell something.

699
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,090
Right?

700
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,970
Byeong Min, I think you need to come here.

701
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,360
Right?

702
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:16,420
Still not yet?

703
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,420
He is Mike, right?

704
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,820

705
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,110
He's Mike, right?

706
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:32,230
Oh, it seems it's right.  The guy with the mustache.  Right.

707
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,290
He looks devilish.

708
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,920
Wait a minute.

709
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:41,190
He blocked his information.  Even if you blocked, do you think I can't get in?

710
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,670
Yes.

711
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:53,460
Department Head Choi just joined to Ji Seong Goo.  Should I follow them?

712
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,720
No. Just leave them and come here.  Our location is—

713
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,320
Right!  I got in!

714
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,670
Let me see, let me see.

715
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,430
Withdraw yourself from there. Okay?

716
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:05,230
Got it?

717
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,380
What is it for?

718
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,650
I don't know. You can't even join as a member.

719
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:17,060
Maybe it's invitation only?

720
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,320
Then we can't see it?   We can't see it then.

721
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,330
What is this?  I've trusted you but we can't see it now.

722
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:24,890
- Right now, I'm trying—
 - You can't get in right now.

723
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,930
- Only by invitatio—
 - I'm still...

724
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,230
- I'll let you see—
 - Only by invitatio—

725
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:28,910
No.

726
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:30,500
Hey, stop playing around.

727
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,170
Wait a moment.

728
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,570
Well, here we go. Let me start with the easiest one first.

729
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,050
You never know, so I'll just try it.

730
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,780
- Right.
 - It's probably not right.

731
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:43,770

732
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:45,190
Ho ho ho, we got it!

733
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:49,530
He used such a simple password, like a pig, like you.

734
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,230
Good!

735
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:54,180
Really.  Wait a minute.

736
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,670
There are other simple people like you.

737
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:58,620
What the heck.

738
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,830
Hey, Ha Ri.

739
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,830
Hm?

740
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:10,130
- What?
  - Hey. Okay.

741
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,870
Look at this.

742
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,430
What?

743
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,890
This woman...

744
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:17,140

745
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,640
Isn't she the woman who is in the hospital?

746
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,620
This crazy bastard!

747
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,400

748
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,960
Ah!

749
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:33,340
- What's wrong?
 - I think we were traced.

750
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,870
- What?
 - What are you saying? What trace all of a sudden?

751
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,320
W-What is it?

752
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,560
Quickly start the car! Quickly!

753
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,050
Hurry! Hurry! Turn on!

754
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:47,260
Hurry! Hurry!

755
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:09,030

756
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,290

757
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:30,280
 I think there must be someone backing him or there could be a mole in the hospital.

758
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,090
 I murdered that girl. But look what happened.

759
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:33,790
 I got released.

760
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,660
 Can we trust this? This could be fabricated.

761
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,960
 I'm sure of it. During Chairman Cheon's case, the exact same USB

762
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,730
 was delivered to us.

763
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,510
 You don't seem to care about how your friends are doing.

764
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:49,320
 Now let's head out to get Chairman Ji.

765
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,320
 This is about speed, okay?
