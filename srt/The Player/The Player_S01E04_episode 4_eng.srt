00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,230

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,790

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,200

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,160

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,130

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,840

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:38,740

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,020

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,860
 This drama's content is fictional and resemblance to any places, organizations, religions, or any real persons is purely coincidental.

10
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,840

11
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,200
Ready?

12
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,320
 Ready?

13
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,640
Go!

14
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,970
Yes!

15
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,680
What are you doing, bastard?

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,810
Finish him, bastard.

17
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,390
3rd basement floor...

18
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,710
Go, go, go.

19
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,020
Last room in the corridor.

20
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,780
3rd basement level, last room in the corridor.

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,070
Open sesame!

22
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,340
Ah, makes me shy.

23
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,390
Take it away.

24
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,690
I think we came to the right place.

25
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,870
Referee, that's cheating!

26
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,330
What?

27
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,000
No.

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,140
Damn.

29
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,010
You piece of trash.

30
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,170
Sir, it'll be hard for him to win at this rate.

31
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,060
Ugh!

32
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,970
Do it.

33
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,610
Yes, I understand.

34
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,460
We're ready.

35
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,430
Fine, you want to turn this into a dog fight?

36
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,490
Come on!

37
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,930
- What? 
 - What's going on?

38
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,020
Was this part of the plan?

39
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,620
No way.

40
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,650
Hey, Byeong Min!

41
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,860
Huh? What's happening?

42
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,040
Damn.

43
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,260
Hurry up and take it!

44
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,090
Come on, quickly!

45
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,130
Seriously.

46
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,640
 Hurry! This way!

47
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,770
 This way!

48
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,010
 Come on. Move this way!

49
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,820
 Come on. Go out this way.

50
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,210
Come on, quickly! Hurry up!

51
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,460
Wait! Wait!

52
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,920
Here, this too! Goodness, this is the last one.

53
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,550
Good work, you can leave now.

54
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,580
Hey, hold on.

55
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,120
You can leave now.

56
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,330
Leave!

57
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,220
Come on, go!

58
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,280
Catch them!

59
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,130
This way!

60
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,100
Catch them!

61
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,910
Hey, what happened? The police weren't a part of the plan.

62
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,950
Ha Ri said he didn't call them either.

63
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,480

64
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,740
Yeah, Hyun Woo. I'm busy right now, so I'll call you back later—

65
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,800
Uncle, something bad happened.

66
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,130
Dad...

67
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,710
What?

68
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,380
Alright, I'll be right there. Hyun Woo, wait there.

69
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,500
I'll be right there, okay?

70
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,540
- Where are you going? 
 - Hey,

71
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,640
leave first. Something urgent came up.

72
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,060
- What? What happened? 
 - Leave first.

73
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,970
- What? What? What happened? 
 - Just leave first, you punk!

74
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,990
Hey! You called the police, didn't you?

75
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,020
That pig, I knew he would do this!

76
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,030
Hyun Woo. Hyun Woo!

77
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,870
Hyun Woo,

78
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,140
what happened? What happened to your dad?

79
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,900
While protesting, the gangsters...

80
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,600
While protesting, the gangsters did what? Hyun Woo, tell me what happened.

81
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,000
W-What happened with the gangsters?

82
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,410

83
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,760
What happened? Is he okay?

84
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,960
He has a cerebral hemorrhage. We need to monitor the results of the operation to be certain of—

85
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,610
So are you saying he's okay or not?

86
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,840
Damn.

87
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,500
Yo, my family!

88
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,750
Why are you here alone? Where's Jin Woong?

89
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,400
I don't know. He said he had something urgent and left.

90
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,260
That's his bad luck. I can't believe he would lose out on this moment of happiness! Wow!

91
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,200
It's been so long since I smelled cash!

92
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,700
What's with your expressions? Aren't you happy?

93
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,110
Look at the serial numbers.

94
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,870
Serial numbers?

95
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,370
What's wrong with the numbers?

96
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,980
Why are all the numbers the same?

97
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,970
It seems like we got tricked.

98
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,690
Seriously?

99
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,590
Does that make sense?

100
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,080
Damn... ugh!

101
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,110
What is this?

102
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,050
What is all of this?

103
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,750
This— what is all of this?

104
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,600

105
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,570
The important thing is who took the real cash.

106
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,960
 Thank you.

107
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,780
 Alright, let's go.

108
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,120
Those bastards stole everything?

109
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,510
Yes, sir. We prepared two cars just in case.

110
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,220
Lucky for us, it was handled better this way.

111
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,330
That's what poor and petty people do.

112
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,380
Good work.

113
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,210
Transport the money to the new location.

114
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,840
Yes, sir.

115
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,780
Yes, sir. I'm a dealer of unregistered cars.

116
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,890
Yes. The items are ready,

117
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,270
so as soon as I confirm the deposit, I'll send you the coordinates.

118
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,060
Yes, of course.

119
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,890
Alright then.

120
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,860
Who are you?

121
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,850
Put your leg down, you bastard.

122
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,850
Ugh, do I look like a joke?

123
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,320
Go play baseball now. I have some business to attend to, so I'll leave first.

124
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,410
Ugh, what a headache.

125
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,320
We need some transaction history.

126
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,920
What?

127
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,820

128
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,130
What?

129
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,930
Ah, this bastard.

130
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,010
Why does this bastard have so much suspicion? I'm a cop!

131
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,710
Let's go!

132
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,090
Yes.

133
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,630

134
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,870
I'm really sorry.

135
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,590
You're really going to set me free, right?

136
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,840
Ugh, seriously!

137
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,740
Hey, have you ever seen a detective go back on his word?

138
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,950
Yes, all cops do that.

139
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,550
So you've seen it.

140
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,200
There are some bastards like that, yeah.

141
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,420
Anyway, you didn't see his face?

142
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,030
No, I didn't.

143
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:34,310
To be frank, I don't do business face-to-face.

144
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,670
Leave and get some drinks.

145
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,400
What?

146
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,660
Something to drink.

147
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,980
Hey, Im Yang!

148
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,520
What are you doing? You should get it.

149
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,390
Yes.

150
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,800
Look at his pants, ugh!

151
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,850
Right, aren't his pants pretty?

152
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,310

153
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,010

154
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,280

155
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,870
Lee Hyun?

156
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,380

157
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,070

158
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,580
That name isn't on the invitation list.

159
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,260
Look here.

160
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,090
Lee Hyun, Hyun...

161
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,950

162
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,290
Lee Hyun... I don't see him. Lee Hyun...

163
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,940

164
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,080
Hwa Yang Cooperation?

165
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,910
President Na?

166
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,850
Hey!

167
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,350
Yes, sir?

168
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,540
I'm already busy as it is. Do I really have to do this too?

169
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,790
It's the chairman's order.

170
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,430
Ugh!

171
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,940
For the sake of the chairman's image, I think you'll just have to deliver the consolation money.

172
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,690
Also, because one of the victims is in a comatose state, please—

173
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,200
Seriously! That's not my job!

174
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,670
Yes, I understand.

175
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,580
President Na, is beating someone your form of communication?

176
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,570
Is that communication?

177
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,590
  Do you call that communication?

178
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,210
- What is this? 
- You gangster bastard!

179
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,980
Let's get out of here.

180
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,870
- Move away! 
 - Where do you think you're going?

181
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,830
Let's go this way, sir.

182
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,970
Hey,

183
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,270
You bastard.

184
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,880
Why is that bastard here?

185
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,770
- How... 
  - Over here, sir!

186
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,280
- We have to go! 
 - Get back here!

187
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,390
- This way, hurry.
 - Hey!

188
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,360
He is coming this way.

189
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,760
Come on, let's go.

190
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,360
Open the door!

191
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,930
Damn it. That was close.

192
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,160
Consolation money or whatever, hold off on everything!

193
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,530
- Understand? 
 - Yes, sir!

194
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,820
Ungrateful punk!

195
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,000
Where are you going?

196
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,470
Open the door!

197
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,420

198
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,550

199
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,600
Now, let's write a novel.

200
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,850
Until a few days ago, President Na was investigated for corrupt bidding and illegal gambling.

201
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,360
Although he was released as innocent, we can presume that his father-in-law pulled some strings for his daughter.

202
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,910
Anyway, President Na, who has seen his bids become small due to this incident,

203
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,570
 would probably need to bring notable results as soon as possible.

204
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,040
 Right?

205
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,010
But then,

206
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,260
since Prosecutor Jang appeared and kept investigating,

207
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,770
he must have gone crazy.

208
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,250
Because among the methods he's used so far, there's none to accumulate his slush fund.

209
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,040
 Ah, so that's why he touched the chaebol's money in the gambling field?

210
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,750
Right, because those bastards won't care about losing a few hundred thousand.

211
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,570
Then, how would he use that money?

212
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,440
Come in.

213
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,840
Put it on the table.

214
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,040
Brother, have a drink.

215
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,030
You know,

216
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,450
I'm really curious.

217
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,760
Don't you have to get back to work at the station?

218
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,310
Why are you worried about that? Should we go in together?

219
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,210
Work hard.

220
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,040
That rascal, he's a bit lacking.

221
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,250
Where have I seen his pants before?

222
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,530
Anyway, we have no choice but to charge into headquarters to find the money.

223
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,870
You still can't get in touch with Jin Woong?

224
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,110
He won't pick up.

225
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,620
What happened to him?

226
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,860
We'll just start first.

227
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,960
- Okay? 
 - Yep.

228
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,440
Let's just exclude Jin Woong.

229
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,700
- Come on. 
 - What?

230
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,470
I'm just saying.

231
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,000
Taxi.

232
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,590

233
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,260
Where to?

234
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,060
Hwa Yang Trade.

235
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,640

236
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,110

237
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,640

238
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,310

239
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,670

240
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,330
What?

241
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,700
Ugh, what's wrong with this?

242
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,050
What's wrong?

243
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,520

244
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,990

245
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,010
You called for a service repair, correct?

246
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,870
Yes.

247
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,570
Where is it?

248
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,340
Here.

249
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,530
It's finished.

250
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,750
Really? Thank you so much!

251
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,640
Malware is really scary because

252
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,680
once connected to a network, it transfers to other computers in an instant.

253
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,970
Mal— what?

254
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,540
Computer viruses.

255
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,070
By any chance, is the president's computer connected to this network too?

256
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,030
Yes.

257
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,070

258
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,850

259
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,510
This is a lot more serious than I thought. The computer even lost power.

260
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,860
Really? What should I do? It's almost time for the president to come.

261
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,100
I think we're going to have to take it apart.

262
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,220
It won't take too long, right?

263
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,770
We'll finish it as soon as possible.

264
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,310
Please take care of this. If the president finds out, I'm done for.

265
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,760
I'm sorry but could you please get me a glass of water? I can't concentrate because I'm so thirsty.

266
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,310
Of course, I'll be right back.

267
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,550
You were thirsty? Alright.

268
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,840

269
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,540

270
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,740
Get ready.

271
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,430
Why are you so surprised?

272
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,520

273
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,360
Why is this so slow?

274
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,910
- President Na is here! 
 - What?

275
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,650
Why is he already here?

276
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,370
Just a moment, President. You have to hear today's schedule.

277
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,480
Forget it, I'll listen to it later.

278
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,240
Byeong Min, what was this bastard doing? Hey, Byeong Min!

279
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,040
That's right! One moment, President!

280
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,520
What now?

281
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,810
Is it still not finished?

282
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,690
Because it's your wedding anniversary, I prepared a gift according to the Madame's preferences...

283
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,620
just in case you forgot.

284
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,300
What is that bastard doing?

285
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,830
Today is the 27th...

286
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,920
Ah, that's why she said she was coming today.

287
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,780
Yes, sir.

288
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,400
I would've been in big trouble if it weren't for you.

289
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,190
Come on, come on.

290
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,500
As expected, Secretary Kim. Good job!

291
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,800
No, give me your cheek.

292
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,790
I'll see you later.

293
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,780
Workers from the public storage will come by 9.

294
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,390
- Make sure to relay this to everyone. 
- Yes, sir.

295
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,710
That bastard.

296
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,260
What?

297
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,380

298
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,240
Why is this here?

299
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,320
Honey, did you arrive safely? You're at the airport?

300
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,720
If there's any stewardess that makes you uncomfortable, just tell me. I'll discipline them.

301
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,720
No, no, I can't do that. Do you know how precious you are to me?

302
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,980
It's been a while since we met, right?

303
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,360
You know when you got indigestion from eating udon at Saporro? At the airport,

304
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,410
I hugged you, pricked your fingers, and gave you kisses.

305
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,750
What were you doing, you bastard? Why didn't you tell me that President Na came?

306
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,010
We were almost caught!

307
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,910
I'm sorry, I just came back from the bathroom. I ate a lot of spicy food yesterday so my stomach was hurting. If I'd known, I would've.

308
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,160
If you can't control it— From now on, wear a diaper when we're on a mission.

309
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,630
Wear a diaper? You bastard, are you joking right now?

310
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,020
Anyway, what happened?

311
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,210
This time, that...

312
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,440
There are email conversations between him and the employee responsible for the government project.

313
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,890
And seeing that he received information about how much other companies estimated bidding prices and lottery numbers,

314
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,450
they must be seriously thinking about planning this!

315
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,940
What garbage—

316
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,410
- No, not you. You— why would I call you garbage? I wasn't talking about you. 
 - Really?

317
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,300
Hey, I think they hid the money in the warehouse. We have to take care of it quickly before 9.

318
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,650
Hey, President Na!

319
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,250
I really tried to understand,

320
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,000
but there's no hope for you.

321
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,680
Hey.

322
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,810
What's that?

323
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,950
Isn't that Jin Woong?

324
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,200
- What is he doing? 
 - G-Get in the car first.

325
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,120
Get inside!

326
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,090
It's a good thing that you came. Arrest that bastard immediately!

327
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,120
Why are you arresting me? It's him!

328
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,680
Wait, wait, wait. It's a good thing I hired some people, right?

329
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,600
Wow, you're really... You're such a lone wolf.

330
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,940
But what should we do? You should've taken on an opponent that's on your level.

331
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,050
Fine, fine. What?

332
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,220
What do you find unfair? Tell me.

333
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,610
Do you know that leader bastard?

334
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,750
Bingo.

335
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:21,290
Then you should've told me earlier! Why are you going through all of this trouble?

336
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,300
Hey, were you serious about wearing a diaper?

337
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,890
What are those people doing over there?

338
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,220
Wait, isn't that Jin Woong?

339
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,450
Here, bite. Come on, bite it.

340
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,400
What? Isn't this what you wanted? I'll give you the money so bite it, you son of a b*tch.

341
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,510
What should we do?

342
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,430
What should we do? Aish, seriously!

343
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,880
Ah Ryeong, get ready.

344
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,270
- What are you planning to do? 
 - Quickly.

345
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,140
W-Wait, I...

346
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,710
You're just going to leave your brother to die like that, huh?

347
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,210
Wow, you're getting mad? You're getting mad.

348
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,320
You're a natural.

349
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,950
Then, of course, I should beat you.

350
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,610
Kindly and naturally.

351
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,950
Hey, the drivers who work for me earn 100.000 won after each beating,

352
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,620
but I'll give you 10 times that, just for you.

353
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,520
Clench your teeth if you don't want a broken jaw.

354
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,850
Move!

355
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,040
President Na! President Na!

356
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,660
- No, you can't! 
 - Move aside, President Na!

357
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,570
Jin Woong! Get him in the car!

358
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,570
Hurry up and get in!

359
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,070
- President Na! 
 - Get in!

360
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,930
Hurry, come on!

361
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,420
Step on it!

362
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,250
Go!

363
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,880
What are you doing, bastards? Catch them!

364
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,200
Stop the car right now! Stop it!

365
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,260
- Stop it now, seriously! 
 - How can I stop?

366
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,350
He put someone in a coma, so how can I stop?

367
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,950
Hey, stop the car.

368
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,310
- What? 
 - Stop the car.

369
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,520
Get out. If you want to get out, get out.

370
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,920
Go and beat him up or boil him alive, do whatever you want. Just remember this one thing.

371
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,620
Do you think it's going to end with that?

372
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,090
Do you think everything will be solved if you beat that bastard up just because you can't handle your emotions?

373
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:45,700
Then leave. Go and kill him. Leave, you bastard! Leave!

374
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,880
What do you know? Have you ever experienced something like this?

375
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,840
- All you've ever done is scam people. When have you— 
 - If I have?

376
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,200
If I have, what changes? Huh?

377
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,880
Do you think nothing happened to me?

378
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,330
I'm saying this because I've failed before!

379
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,860
I'm saying this because if we acted on our emotions, we might lose that bastard in front of our eyes!

380
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,780
This isn't how you get revenge.

381
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,650
Right?

382
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,680
Jin Woong,

383
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,030
please just trust me. Just this once.

384
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:42,650
Please. Jin Woong, I'll make sure you can catch him.

385
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,900
♫   In the end,   ♫

386
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,390
Please trust me.

387
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,800
♫  Just walk without thinking, when you lose  ♫

388
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,700
♫  Fall, fall as far as you can, when you get further from happiness  ♫

389
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,380
♫  Without a destination, when you hurriedly run  ♫

390
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,170
♫  I be here with you all time  ♫
 ♫  Everything's alright  ♫

391
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:00,640
♫  There's no wrong no rights  ♫
 ♫  The road I take and the place I want to go  ♫

392
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,190
♫  As I wander between, the ambiguous boundary  ♫

393
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,480
♫   This is one way   ♫

394
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,000
Lastly, from here to over here.

395
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,010
♫  Can't easily look back from my decision  ♫

396
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,460
Game over. What do you think?

397
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,310
It sounds good but will he follow according to our plan?

398
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,490
We'll have to make him follow.

399
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,850
♫  Someday my heart someday the timing will be right, until we part  ♫

400
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,250
I made a promise, didn't I?

401
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,600
♫   If you lose your everything   ♫

402
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,390
♫   Think you can't go back to the time   ♫

403
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,890
♫   Keep in mind, it's not your fault   ♫

404
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:42,660
♫   In the end, I am gonna be with you   ♫

405
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,480
Goodness, you're all working hard this late at night.

406
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,870
Of course. Come inside.

407
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,960
Wait, he's right there!

408
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,680

409
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,510
Wait, there's someone right there!

410
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,470
Duck!

411
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,640
There's someone there so we can't— we're going to get caught.

412
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,980
You know how to say "can't"?

413
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,550
You disregard me sometimes—

414
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,440
Goodness, are you alright?

415
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,960
It's nothing, I just tripped. I'm okay, thank you.

416
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,710
Where—

417
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,430
We've seen each other before, haven't we? In the bathroom?

418
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,000
Thank you so much.

419
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,330
Thank you!

420
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,620

421
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,770
Open the door! Hurry up and open the door!

422
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,310
General Manager Im?

423
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,530
Yes? Oh wow, you're thirty minutes early.

424
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:18,390
I don't make much working overtime anyway. Aren't all civil servants like this?

425
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,270
Is it alright if I make a confirmation call?

426
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,360
Of course, go ahead.

427
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,450
Hello?

428
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,020
Yes, he's our employee.

429
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,580
Thank you, work hard.

430
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,530
Hello, have a seat.

431
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,300
Should I?

432
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,120
May I use the restroom?

433
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,580
If you go out that door— just escort him there.

434
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,540
I'm okay, thank you.

435
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,080
They're headed toward the storage yard.

436
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,340
Where did he go off to?

437
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,510
Hey, bring all of the kids and follow me!

438
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,200
This way!

439
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,720
Something feels strange.

440
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,310
Catch him!

441
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,980
Catch that bastard!

442
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,920
Catch him!

443
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,000

444
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,740
- You little prick! 
 - Get him!

445
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,320
Ugh!

446
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,000
Catch him! Hurry up!

447
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,780
Jin Woong, your face—

448
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,240
Hurry up and load!

449
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,180
- You're okay, right? 
 - Hurry up and load the truck.

450
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,150
If you're okay, help us!

451
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,850
Right there!

452
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,010
Catch him! Hurry up!

453
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,820
Did you finish loading?

454
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,230
- Complete. 
 - They should be coming about now.

455
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:16,300
Th-There! It's him, isn't it? Ha Ri! Ha—

456
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,550
- What the heck? 
 - Go, go!

457
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,770
Should we start running?

458
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,990
Hurry up and get in the car!

459
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,290
Leave first.

460
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,920
Go, go!

461
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,830
Hurry up and leave!

462
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,540
Hey, don't you think you brought too many?

463
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,510
Jin Woong, you're a fighter who's never lost to anyone, right?

464
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,920
- I believe in you. 
 - This bastard, seriously!

465
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,360
That was so close.

466
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,180
- There's a car following us! 
- What?

467
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:00,190
Hurry up, there's a car following us! Can't you see?! Watch out, there's a car in front!

468
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,050
- Let go of me! Just stay still! 
 - There's a car following us!

469
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,750
- Quickly, quickly, quickly! 
 - Don't touch me!

470
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,850
Hey, there's no road here! It's a dead end!

471
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:24,390
What are you trying to do—

472
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,460
Are you a track athlete?

473
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,520
Hey, I can't run anymore. I can't do this anymore.

474
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,380
Let's just fight, okay?

475
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,690
But let's not aim for the face. This face is how I make a living. You know that, right?

476
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:05,740
Better for me. How you make a living, my ass—

477
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,780
You said we weren't going to aim for the face!

478
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,400
I don't think your face is how you make a living. Also, why are you only chasing after me? Huh?

479
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,960
- Don't follow me. 
 - Where do you think you're going?

480
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,660
- You bastard!
 - Aigoo!

481
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,950
Don't follow me!

482
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,930
It hurts.

483
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,720
- Do you like it? 
 - Yes, I love it.

484
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,870
I love you.

485
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:45,970
Noona—no, my honey who's the prettiest and sexiest in the world,

486
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,870
thank you for spending time with me today.

487
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:53,410
I can't even imagine how I would've lived if you weren't with me, sweetie!

488
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,310
Give me your hand.

489
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,780
How are your hands so pretty?

490
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,290

491
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,940
Just a minute.

492
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,630
Yeah, what is it? What?

493
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,130
Is something wrong?

494
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,150
-I-I'm sorry, sweetie. Something urgent just came up. 
 -What?

495
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,260
No, everything will be fine. L-Let's talk later, okay?

496
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,380
W-Wait, sweetie! H-Honey!

497
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,540
What? Have you fallen for me?

498
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:53,010
Come on, run. Hurry up!

499
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,130
I think it's better if I just get caught... There's no road here!

500
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,920
It's a dead end, you crazy girl!

501
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,730
Hey, surround the car.

502
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,730
Catch them! Come on, hurry up!

503
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,350
Goodbye!

504
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,570
Move, move, move! Where is the money?

505
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:18,430

506
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,790
You bastards, seriously!

507
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,800
Is this the best you can do? Huh?

508
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,330
Hey, do you want to lose everything? Do you want to die?

509
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,110
- Do you want to die, you bastard? 
 - No, sir!

510
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:45,670
  Have you received your present?

511
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,970
Do you like your face?

512
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,100
Our President Na, you've committed so many bad deeds until now.

513
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,730
If you wanted bids, you should've collected them fairly. You shouldn't be doing that in a fair and just society.

514
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:01,870
You're sh*tting me right now, aren't you? What are you?! Wh-Who are you, you bastard?!

515
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,960
What?

516
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,770
A con artist.

517
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,070
Anyway, you don't need to know about me.

518
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,470
I'll use this money righteously, alright?

519
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,410
Good work, thank you.

520
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,380
- Let's go. Start! 
 - Start!

521
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,920
Hey, you bastard! That money—

522
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,480
Hello? Hello? Hey, hey!

523
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,760
Hey, find out where these bastards are right now.

524
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,320
Even if you have to track their locations, capture all of them and bring them to me!

525
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,670
- Hey! 
 - Yes, sir? 
 - Get lost!

526
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,110
Move quickly!

527
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,080
Useless!

528
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,960
Hurry up!

529
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,090

530
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:15,920
Aish, these bastards. What are they going around doing that they're not picking up?

531
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:24,600
Prosecutor, wouldn't it be better for us to proceed with the investigation before it's too late?

532
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,710
Let's wait a little longer, just a bit.

533
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:51,910
Let's work faster, come on. Are you bragging about your breaking-in skills to others right now?

534
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,750
Hurry up!

535
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,120
My legs...

536
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:06,150
In Korea, Im Byeong Min is #1 in running away.

537
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,830
I have to be first place in that, you bastard! What happened?

538
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,700
- I riled him up. 
 - What if he doesn't show up?

539
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,680
Don't worry. We're bound to meet at this location anyway.

540
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,260
Here.

541
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,560
- You can leave now. 
 - What?

542
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,370
Go to the hospital before it's too late.

543
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:28,530
Leave this to us and go! And stop getting irritated!

544
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,220
Yeah, you need to take care of your brother first.

545
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,540
What?

546
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,740
Guys, th-thanks...

547
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:44,240
What? Don't thank me or say anything. That'll make me cringe; I hate things like that.

548
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,140
Let's go now.

549
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,630
He pretends he's cool all by himself.

550
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,980
Prosecutor, I'm really sorry for what I'm about to say but

551
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,930
to be honest, it seems like you care more for that bastard than you care for me.

552
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,180
It's Ha Ri this and Ha Ri that. What I'm trying to say is, don't trust those bastards too much.

553
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,190
They're criminals.

554
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:25,700
People don't change that easily.

555
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,110

556
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,230
You bastards, exactly what are you going around doing?!

557
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,800
Ahjussi, you still can't control your temper.

558
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,950
I told you that we were going to do this our way, didn't I?

559
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:46,780
If you have that much energy to be angry, come and wash our dishes or something. We're lacking hands.

560
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,580
Okay?

561
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,950
 The world changes a little bit for the better from your actions.

562
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:05,110
  People do everything their own way.

563
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,830
Yeah.

564
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,620
You were right.

565
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:51,410
These cowardly, useless bastards dare to enter someone else's house?

566
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,920
You guys go through the main door, the rest through the back door.

567
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,560
- Yes, sir! 
 - Yes, sir!

568
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:59,830
You!

569
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:03,420
Catch her!

570
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,990
Stop right there!

571
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,570
You bastards are all dead if you lose her!

572
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,740
Don't lose her!

573
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,840
Stop!

574
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,900
Hurry up!

575
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,870
Catch her! Come on!

576
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,250
Aish, why isn't this opening?!

577
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:05,770
Pretty girl, you're good at running. Kneel and crawl here while I'm still being nice.

578
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,410
I'll give you a good price.

579
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:15,530
Wait, wait, wait, I'll open it for you!

580
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:19,200
What should I do? Where should I start?

581
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,240
This b*tch!

582
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,770
Aish!

583
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:35,160
- Hey, that way! 
 - Move, that way!

584
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,710
Catch her!

585
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,200
I just saved you.

586
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,510
You guys, go that way! The rest, follow her!

587
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,370
Yes, sir! Let's go!

588
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:07,260
Yes, yes, you're doing good right now. You're doing great.

589
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,080
Which way now?

590
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,470
Which way is it? Give me a minute, just a minute.

591
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:23,350
Go straight ahead, turn left, and then right.

592
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,280
Wait, wait, no, nope! That's the way to the office.

593
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,890
Go straight, turn right, and then left.

594
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,080
Right and then—

595
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:57,380
Where did she go? A-Ah Ryeong, where are you? Ah Ryeong—

596
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,750
no, no!

597
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,400
Right and then left! I said, right and then left!

598
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,920
 Hey!

599
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:35,160
He said left and then right.

600
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,320
You're going in the opposite direction!

601
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,200
Turn right! We're going to meet! You can't come this way!

602
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,700
You can't come this way!

603
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,800
You can't! Aish, seriously! Ugh!

604
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,070
- She's over there! Catch her! 
 - Stop right there!

605
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:00,490
Catch her! Hey, stop right there!

606
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,140
Why isn't this working? Huh?

607
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,330
Why isn't she coming?

608
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:14,240
Come on, come on, I'll open it back up when you come.

609
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,280
- Hey! 
 - Huh?

610
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:25,770
Ah Ryeong! Why are you coming from over there?!

611
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,380
Ah Ryeong!

612
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,610
Hey, Ah Ryeong!

613
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,370
Stop!

614
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:50,490
Ah Ryeong!

615
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,900
I can do it!

616
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,910
Stop right there!

617
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,270
- Ugh! 
 - Open the gate!

618
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,200
Open this!

619
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,370
Are you okay? Whoa.

620
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,560
Wow, you're seriously the best!

621
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,580
Well, I'm...

622
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,900
I'm fine. Don't worry about me, I'm okay.

623
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,400
Go back home.

624
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,900
Hey!

625
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,810
- Open this! 
 - Open the gate!

626
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,420
Open this before you leave!

627
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,620
- Hey! 
 - Open this!

628
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,030
These bastards dare to trap me?

629
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:28,750
Fine. Rat-like bastards, today will become your funeral.

630
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:35,570
Open the door! Open it! Open!

631
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:40,390
Come out! Come out!

632
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,680
Your greed was excessive, Sunbaenim.

633
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:47,530
No matter how much you like your position as president,

634
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:50,610
you shouldn't play around with someone's life.

635
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:55,490
You... you're that law school...

636
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,800
Wow, you remember.

637
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,900
Seonbaenim.

638
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:05,680
I'm also someone who commits crimes but you're just too much.

639
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,160
Through illegal bidding, you drove out smaller businesses and forced the low-income out onto the streets.

640
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,010
As if that wasn't enough, you gambled illegally and stole?

641
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:17,260
You talk as if you know everything.

642
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,680
I'm pretty strong on the facts.

643
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,710
Hey,

644
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:31,840
do you know why I gave it my all to get to my position?

645
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:38,830
Because I didn't want to deal with lowly people who aren't on my level, like you.

646
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,060
Whenever I'm with people like you,

647
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,400
I become lowly too.

648
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:52,000
Ah, is that so? But was seducing the chairman's daughter to become president

649
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,440
an effort?

650
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:59,540
- It's hard work playing around with an ugly b*tch. 
 - Ah,

651
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:03,030
I didn't think that far ahead. I guess you're right.

652
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:06,610
Don't talk nonsense if you don't want to die.

653
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:09,830
A very good fortune-teller said I would live a very long life.

654
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,890
Ah, I thought her fee was too cheap.

655
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,270
This bastard, always talking back—

656
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,890
Wait, why are you doing this to me? You're making yourself look lowly.

657
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,860
I'm not the one you need to deal with.

658
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,690
What?

659
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,320
Noona!

660
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,060
For a wedding anniversary event, this is too direct.

661
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,130
W-Wait, sweetie—

662
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:45,370
You must've suffered so much for playing around with this ugly b*tch.

663
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:47,580
Wh-What I mean is...

664
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,480
That's not what I meant—

665
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,590
Shut up! If you have anything left to say, tell it to him,

666
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:55,520
because we're over.

667
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,760
Well, it's not too bad to end it in the ring.

668
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,550
Hey.

669
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,480
Hey.

670
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,820
- Isn't he dead? 
 - He's not dead.

671
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,670
Why would you punch him that hard?

672
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:33,590
You said that you would let me get revenge!

673
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,510
Mister! Mister?

674
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,620
You take care of it.

675
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,740
- Why do I have to take care of him? You take care of him. 
 - Whatever, I don't know.

676
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,970
  - Whatever, come on. 
 - Wait for me!

677
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:50,220
  - Don't we have to wake him up? 
 - You wake him up!

678
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:54,420
  The president of Hwa Yang Trade, Na Won Hak, who was released and declared innocent in the final trial on the 24th

679
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,830
 I'm innocent!

680
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,980
  has been apprehended by the prosecutors again.

681
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,470
  Thanks to the prosecutor's tireless investigation...

682
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:02,480
 They're forcing a confession out of me!

683
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,730
 Through emails with the employee in charge of the government projects, he tried to find out the competitors...

684
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:11,330
South Korea's justice is dead!

685
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:16,090
 ... as it was discovered that he also ran an illegal gambling ring.

686
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,280
You're here?

687
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,160

688
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:28,960
Yes. Good Job!  I'll take care of the evidence so don't worry about that.

689
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,400
These bastards are above my expectations! They're a lot faster than I thought they would be.

690
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,280
I know, right? We should work hard too. Good luck!

691
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,210
Yes, Deputy Chief!

692
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,730
Yes, I'll be right there.

693
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,320
I'm leaving.

694
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,230
Wait.

695
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,350
Prosecutor.

696
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,640
I'm okay, thank you.

697
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,510
Make sure to check your teeth in the mirror!

698
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,910
Here, you worked hard.

699
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:04,560
Thank you.

700
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,880
You saw "The Real-Time Public Opinion," didn't you?

701
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,360
The opinion of majority is that there is something to live for these days

702
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,010
and the media is covering us in a positive light.

703
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,970
So that's why in the upcoming meeting, I was planning on creating a new task team.

704
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:21,270
Yes.

705
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,880
I was hoping that you would be in charge of it.

706
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,250
Me? What kind of team is it?

707
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,770
Well, it doesn't sound so bad

708
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,810
and there's no need to worry about a lack of work.

709
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:41,750
I like the idea.

710
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,480
If we do this, won't our share of money decrease?

711
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,140
No, you don't have to worry about that because you'll continue to operate unofficially.

712
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,560
I agree.

713
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,230
Me too. I feel like I'm doing a good deed.

714
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:55,480
Right? I feel like we've become Robin Hood and the Merry Men.

715
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,620
- How could we be Robin Hood and the Merry Men as long as you're here?
 - You're right.

716
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,730
You get it fast.

717
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:03,590
Now, I think everyone's hungry. We should talk about the details on the way.

718
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:06,150
- We're having a company dinner? 
 - Yes.

719
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:09,490
Wait, wait. I will recommend the next project.

720
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:12,980
There is a person called as Chairman Cheon... Prosecutor Jang, you—

721
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,270
You're still scared of him?

722
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:17,250
No, I'm not.

723
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:24,540

724
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,900
  Yes, of course.

725
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:28,740
Hello, sir.

726
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:32,040
Really? Yes, I understand.

727
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,390
We'll make sure to deliver the message. Of course, good night!

728
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:39,720
Prosecutor, how can you send money without telling us anything?

729
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,810
What money?

730
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:45,160
- You're pretending you don't know because you're embarrassed. What do you call this? 
 - Tsundere.

731
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,680
Right, tsundere! I'm so upset, Prosecutor! You leave me out and do all of the cool things by yourself.

732
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,450
I just received the call!

733
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:54,440
Seriously, what money did I send?

734
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,290
- You're amazing at acting! You should be an actor. 
 - What's wrong with you?

735
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:04,220
You didn't send any? Hong Yu Ri's mother just called to tell me she received the money for the operation.

736
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:08,230
- Park Seon Yeong's family said they received money too, right? 
 - Yes.

737
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,750
- Me? 
 - Yes.

738
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,110
That brat...

739
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:45,120
  I'll take the picture now. One, two...

740
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,930

741
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,430
  Congratulations. Should I call you Prosecutor Jang from now on?

742
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:52,700
 Don't mention it. I've not been appointed yet.

743
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,470
  Congratulations.

744
01:00:54,470 --> 01:01:00,550
  So you're Soo Hyeok. I heard that your dream is to become a prosecutor like your dad.

745
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,550
  Yes, it is.

746
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:05,420
  This brat, you look smart.

747
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:09,650
 You have to work with me later on, okay?

748

773
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,450
 At least, 20 billion won?
