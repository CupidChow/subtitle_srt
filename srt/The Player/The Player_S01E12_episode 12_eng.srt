1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,090

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,750

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,250

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,190

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,100

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,720

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:38,790

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,130

9
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:51,980

10
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,860
Dad, Dad.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,210
 Dad!

12
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,480

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,510

14
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,400

15
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,650

16
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,930
We can't give this to her, right?

17
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,360
No.

18
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,430
Dodam!

19
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,320
Dodam!

20
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,830
Dodam!

21
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,650
You're okay. It's okay, it's okay.

22
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,260
Section Chief Maeng...

23
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,680
Ji Hoon...

24
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,560
I understand how you feel.

25
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,300
I also know that you had no choice.

26
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,310
We found your wife and baby.

27
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,620
They're both safe so don't worry.

28
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,670
Thank you!

29
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,800
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,460
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,140
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,510
Yeon Hee.

33
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,100
Are you okay?

34
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,720
Yes.

35
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,830
Why aren't you having the funeral?

36
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,890
There's no one that would come anyway.

37
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,480
It'll just be filled with reporters.

38
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,130
He asked me whether it would be too shameless.

39
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,160
After paying for his crimes,

40
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,550
he wanted to ask if he could live with you.

41
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,250
He said he didn't have the right to ask you that.

42
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,740
What did you tell him?

43
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,370
I told him to ask you himself, face to face.

44
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,530
I see.

45
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,240
He was wearing this until the end.

46
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,380
I bought this for him.

47
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,420
After I got my first paycheck from working my part-time jobs,

48
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,180
I said I would buy a better one when I became a doctor.

49
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,700
I'm sorry...

50
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,320
that I couldn't keep my promise.

51
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,600
 Turn off the monitor.

52
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,870
Who made you do it?

53
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,880
I don't know.

54
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,580
It's someone I've never seen before.

55
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,870
Did he have any distinguishing traits?

56
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,690
 A tattoo.

57
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,290
He had a tattoo on the back of his neck.

58
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,250
Besides that, I have no idea.

59
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,960
A tattoo?

60
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,980
Okay, I got it.

61
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,560

62
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,290

63
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,410
Prosecutor! I'm sorry.

64
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,340
And thank you.

65
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Thank you.

66
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,750
Thank you. Thank you.

67
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,470
I'm sorry, In Gyu.

68
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,470
I should've blocked the search order any way I could.

69
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:06,160
No, I understand that you had no choice.

70
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,010
I... I'm going to catch that guy no matter what.

71
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,710
The man who's behind all of this.

72
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,130
I will use whatever means necessary.

73
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,860
Alright. This time, you take care of things your way.

74
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,660
I'll support you from behind and take responsibility.

75
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,830
Okay, I got it.

76
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,230
Then, I will put my trust in you.

77
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,530

78
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,620
I wonder why Ha Ri is so obsessed with this case?

79
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,080
 The person who smuggled him out was

80
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,630

81
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,380
 the Special Corruption Investigation Team Head Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi.

82
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,900
Choi Hyeon Gi.

83
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,340
Choi Hyeon Gi, I've heard that name many times before.

84
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,730
Choi Hyeon Gi.

85
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,170

86
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,680
Choi Hyeon Gi... Choi Hyeon Gi.

87
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,400

88
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,820

89
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,350

90
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,580
Cha Dong Soo...

91
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,980
 You're looking for Dong Soo?

92
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,630
 He passed away a long time ago.

93
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:55,610
 It's been already fifteen years since that incident.

94
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,680
- Ah Ryeong, where are you doing?
 - I'll be right back.

95
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,410
Hey! Wh-Where...

96
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,620
It can't be.

97
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,580
Where is everyone else?

98
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,520
Ah Ryeong just went out and Byeong Min is over there.

99
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,370
What are you doing?

100
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,060
Why do you look so shocked?

101
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,540
It's nothing.

102
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,470
Did you speak to Prosecutor Jang?

103
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,720
Yeah.

104
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,610
Why did Section Chief Maeng do that?

105
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,950
He was being threatened.

106
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,510
His wife and baby got kidnapped.

107
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,700
Ah, those crazy bastards.

108
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,730
Why are they dragging innocent people into this?

109
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,700
There must've been something that had to stay hidden.

110
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,350
Still, there are still things people shouldn't do.

111
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,110
So what's Prosecutor Jang doing now?

112
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,030
He is looking for the mastermind who's behind all this

113
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,510
by interrogating the people who he suspects.

114
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,770
But they still don't know for sure.

115
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,170
Huh?

116
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,320
Then who?

117
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,850
Don't you have anyone you're suspicious of?

118
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,890
I do.

119
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,790
Who is it?

120
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,860
That man.

121
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,900
  Oh, no, it was nothing.

122
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,680
 Well, I just did what that man asked me to do.

123
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,970
 Because of that, I can eat with you, sirs.

124
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,580
Ah really.

125
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,690
This is the first video clip I got when we started working on Jin Yong Joon.

126
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:18,450
And this is the voice recording of when he contacted someone before Baek Seon was murdered.

127
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,460
Listen to this.

128
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,630
 So you're telling me you can't do it?

129
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,770
 Okay, bring it on.

130
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:31,790
 I'll spill the beans even about what you're planning with that man.

131
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,290
What is that?

132
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,890
Does this mean that all the guys that we robbed knew each other?

133
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,890
That man, or whoever it is, planned all this?

134
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,240
This isn't everything.

135
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,930
From the presidential election scandal that Choo Won Gi was involved in 15 years ago to something we don't know yet.

136
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,860
There's a high possibility that he has schemed countless other things.

137
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,930
Of course, he may be preparing a big scandal even now.

138
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,380
Then we could find that out by pushing those rascals.

139
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,490
Either way, they're all in jail.

140
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,630
As a matter of fact, Prosecutor Jang is already asking them about it.

141
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,770
But it seems no one is willing to speak.

142
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:14,190
I guess they think they may be killed like Baek Seon if they speak.

143
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,060
Those cowards. How can they be afraid of that bastard?

144
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,960
Anyway, I'm going to make him the next target.

145
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,180
You guys can stay out of this if you don't want to do it.

146
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,470
This time, we won't be making much money and it's also too dangerous.

147
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,460
What are you saying? Of course, we have to do this one.

148
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,300
Look what they did to Section Chief Maeng.

149
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,020
Isn't that so?

150
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,450
Hey!

151
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,710
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

152
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,220
Huh?

153
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,670
I'm not feeling well.

154
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,130
Are you okay? Do you need to go to the hospital?

155
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,250
I'm okay.

156
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,930
I'm going to the pharmacy. I'll be back.

157
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,740
But Ha Ri...

158
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,900
You're going to catch that man, right?

159
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,480
Even if I try to stop you.

160
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,510
Yeah.

161
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,820
I'll be back.

162
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,110
Wait a second, please.

163
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,410
I have a question for you.

164
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,540
For me?

165
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:21,120
The incident that happened 15 years ago, can you tell me about it in detail?

166
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,040
 Lee Jong Heon is famous in this neighborhood.

167
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,360
 He killed Dong Soo and went to prison for about ten years.

168
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,210
 Since then, every time he gets drunk, he says it wasn't he who killed Dong Soo.

169
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,400
 He causes a ruckus, yelling it all around town.

170
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,720
 I really wonder why he did that to his friend of 30 years.

171
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,700
 He wasn't that type of person.

172
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,680

173
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,860
Is anyone home?

174
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,530

175
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,960
Is Lee Jong Heon home?

176
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,390
Excuse me!

177
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,180
I'm looking for Lee Jong Heon.

178
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,730
 The customer is not able to answer the phone at this time.

179
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,460
 If you'd like to leave a voice message—

180
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,630
He's not picking up?

181
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,770
Nope.

182
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,340
Where is that punk?

183
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,120
I'll go out and look for him.

184
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,300

185
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,470

186
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,170
 The customer isn't able answer the phone at this time.

187
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,310
What is going on?

188
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,730
 What are you doing?

189
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,130
 Why are you so shocked?

190
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,710
 It's nothing.

191
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,320

192
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,120

193
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,100

194
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,490
 You're going to catch that man, right? Even if I try to stop you.

195
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,730
 Why did you apply here?

196
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,760

197
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,100

198
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,560
Ah, y-yes, I'm just...

199
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,690
 My mom told me to become a civil servant...

200
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,170
Huh? Hey! That's...

201
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,570
Because it's a secure job.

202
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:46,520
It's not only that.  This job looks cool.  It's like being a secret agent.

203
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,900
Okay, I'm giving you ten minutes.

204
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,520
Take out as much of the information from this campaign site as you can.

205
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,880
Right now?

206
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,700
Start!

207
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,350
Okay. That's it.

208
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,980
Let's have a look.

209
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,370

210
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,390

211
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,560
You did this all just now?

212
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,090
Yes, well, since you told me to.

213
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,820
Oh, you rascal.

214
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,900
Here.

215
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,450
Start working there tomorrow.   Make sure to seal your lips.

216
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,120
Really?

217
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,080
Thank you, thank you.

218
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,540
- Go ahead.
 - Yes, sir.

219
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,230
Thank you, thank you.

220
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,120
Thank you!

221
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:33,160
But, what kind of work will I be doing starting tomorrow?

222
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,480
Good work, for this nation.

223
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,570
- Something like a secret agent?
 - Yes, yes.

224
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,320
The situation is going to be favorable for us now.

225
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,230
If Candidate Kim wins, we'll have a lot of opportunities.

226
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:13,600
Hey... Hey! What are you doing? Hurry up.

227
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,620

228
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,510

229
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,680

230
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,850

231
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,790
Prosecutor, I finished organizing the documents regarding Jin Yong Joon's case.

232
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,720
Yes, prepare the file and upload it.

233
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,130
Okay, I will do it by 3 pm today.

234
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,770
- Prosecutor Jang.
 - Yes?

235
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,550
Looks like you're getting a phone call. Over there.

236
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,700
Thank you.

237
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,130
Oh, yes. What happened?

238
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,380
Find me Byeong Min's location as quickly as possible.

239
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,240
It's an emergency, that's why.

240
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,510
Byeong Min!

241
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,220
You're very good at finding out people's whereabouts.

242
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,470
How did you know I was here?

243
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,440
- You still do that work?
 - Yeah.

244
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,330
I thought maybe I'd stop but there's really nothing as rewarding.

245
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,790
What are you working on now?

246
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,990
It's the presidential election time.

247
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:46,430
Watching the opponent candidate, spreading false information, manipulating comments.

248
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,560
It's similar to what you did when you were there.

249
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,040
We haven't done much because the campaign was just set up after the primary election.

250
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,850
Then, you probably don't know the people involved yet.

251
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,420
It would seem that way.

252
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:06,040
But what's the occasion? You said you'd never step foot here again.

253
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,490
There's someone that I have to find and I was hoping you'd help me.

254
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:17,800
Me? There's no one in this world better at finding people than you.

255
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,800
It can't be... that man?

256
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,420
Why?

257
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:38,410
Because of that person, I did something terrible to a friend.

258
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,630
Yeah, did you find him?

259
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,610
The last confirmed location was Su Eun Apartment in Yiryeon-dong.

260
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,350
He's on the move right now so I'll text you updates on his location.

261
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,010
Okay, please do.

262
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,970
But still, you're crazy to go back there.

263
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,950
Do you know who's in charge of his campaign?

264
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:23,890
It's Chairman Cheon! If you get caught, you could be killed.

265
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:27,080
I know, so just tell me the location.

266
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,050
And give me the pass. Then I'll take care of the rest.

267
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:34,250
No, I don't want to. I'm not going to get involved then.

268
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,840
 What are you working on now?

269
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,400
 It's the presidential election time.

270
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:43,500
 Watching the opponent candidate, spreading false information, manipulating comments.

271
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,930
If you don't want to go to jail, give the pass to me

272
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,480
before I send this over to the police.

273
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,290

274
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,150
Who are you? Huh?

275
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,070
Lee Jong Heon?

276
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,330
Who are you to barge into someone's house like that—

277
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,770
You know Cha Dong Soo, right?

278
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,930
What?

279
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:33,150
I'm asking you if you know him.

280
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,320
You look just like your father.

281
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,530
Ah Ryeong.

282
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,310
They say that's my name.

283
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,230
So what?

284
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,100
Are you here for revenge?

285
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,110
No.

286
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,710
I just want to know what happened.

287
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,990
What kind of person was my father?

288
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:28,260
What happened on the day Choo Won Gi smuggled himself out?

289
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,220
I heard you two were close.

290
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:41,370
From the murderer who killed your father,

291
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,580
to hear the story of that day, you're here.

292
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,600
You're such a funny rascal.

293
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,150
Do that at least.

294
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,420
If you're sorry towards the person you killed,

295
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,150
at least tell me.

296
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,220
Ha Ri!  Byeong Min is not—

297
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,080
What is this?  I've never seen this.

298
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,880
Oh, shit...

299
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,920
What's this?

300
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,420
 Some bastards visited here late one night

301
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,590
 asking for a boat.

302
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,280
 He said he had an emergency so

303
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,220
 if we took him to the trans-boundary sea line,

304
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,840
 he would pay ten times more than a regular fare.

305
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:19,170
 Dong Soo said he didn't want to but I kept telling him we should do it

306
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,410
 because I wanted the money.

307
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,740
 But the person that those bastards brought along

308
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,390
 was Choo Won Gi.

309
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:33,690
 I called the police right away but the cops never showed up

310
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,010
 because all of them were in cahoots.

311
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,310
 Only innocent Dong Soo got killed

312
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,410
 by the men who were with Choo Won Gi.

313
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,940
 Then he switched to a Chinese boat and smuggled himself out.

314
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,530
 They framed me as a murderer.

315
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,250
 I wanted to tell the truth, too.

316
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:11,640
 But my wife and kids had been kidnapped, so I had no choice.

317
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:16,040
 Was prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi behind all of this?

318
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,950
 No.

319
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:21,970
 Prosecutor Choi tried to help us.

320
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:29,790
 But in the end, he ended up getting killed by them and framed.

321
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:35,320
 Then what happened to Choi Hyeon Gi, that punk? Did he get arrested?

322
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,980
 No.

323
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,650
 He committed suicide.

324
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,400
 Who in the hell do you think you are, saying "suicide"?!

325
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:51,450
 You're saying it wasn't a suicide, but a murder?

326
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,590
 You don't have to believe me.

327
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,220
 Not one person in the world believes it either.

328
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,790
 If what you're saying is true, if it really is the truth,

329
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,780
 then who's behind it all?

330
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,240
 The person who kidnapped your family and put all the blame on you, who is that person?

331
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,320
 I don't know either.

332
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,980
 He's just a normal looking man.

333
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,980
 Everyone around him just called him "that man."

334
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,600
 "That man."

335
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,640
 That day, honestly, Dong Soo

336
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,010
 was trying to go to you.

337
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,680
 Your mother was re-marrying with another man,

338
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,850
 only then he found out that she sent you to an orphanage.

339
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,340
 But I'm the one who stopped him.

340
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,020
 I asked him if he could help me once more and then go.

341
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,330
 I was blinded by money.

342
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,910
 I killed Dong Soo.

343
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,220
 I'm sorry, Ah Ryeong.

344
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,440

345
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,690

346
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,890

347
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:52,020

348
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,990

349
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,080
 Did That man send you, too?

350
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,640
 What?

351
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,700
 Let go of me, you bastards!

352
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,600
 You've done a good job.

353
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,640
 But why are you taking that person?

354
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,580
 Why are you asking that?

355
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:52,540
 Because he was asking me if "that man" sent me.

356
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,580
 Who is that?

357
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,890
 I thought you promised not to ask any unnecessary questions.

358
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,900
 Alright, let's do that. I'm just here for the money.

359
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,120
 Call me if you need me for anything.

360
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:24,170

361
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:46,520
So that's why he never came for me.

362
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,290
I thought he abandoned me.

363
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,380

364
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,190
What's wrong with this?

365
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,640
Shit.

366
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,810
 The moment you connect it, a warning signal will be sent to that man right away.

367
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,510
 There's no way you'll be able to run away.

368
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,950

369
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,120

370
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,520
Yes.

371
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,850
No, let him do as much as he can.

372
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:43,260
So when it gets revealed tomorrow, everyone will be more shocked.

373
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,310

374
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,730

375
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,940

376
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,700

377
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,800
These bastards...

378
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,300

379
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:42,390
I caught you, trash-like bastards.

380
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,580

381
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,420

382
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,530
Stop it now, you bastards!

383
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:56,430
Don't move. I'll kill you.

384
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,390

385
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,180
Find him.

386
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,600
Look me in the eye! Huh? I said look me in the eye!

387
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,350
Head up, you bastard! What are you trying to so hard?!

388
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:25,590
Look me in the eye! Find him quick, you bastards!

389
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,060
This bastard...

390
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,710
Shit!

391
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,600

392
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,600
Over there! Get that punk! Go!

393
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,340
Hey! Hey, hey, go out there!

394
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:26,090
Where do you think you're going, you bastard!

395
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,740
Get that bastard no matter what!

396
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,120
You guys go that way! You follow me!

397
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,760
He's over there!

398
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,680
It was you? You bastard.

399
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:06,320
Byeong Min, you know I don't like to repeat myself.

400
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,460
Where did you send the files to?

401
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,370
I don't know  (informal speech).

402
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:19,360
You don't know? Are you speaking casually to me?!

403
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,690
This bastard, do you have a death wish?

404
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:26,600
Should I make you think of the past again?

405
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,820
Kill me.

406
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,790
What?

407
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,640
If you want to kill me, go ahead.

408
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:41,690
I won't do what you ask me to do anymore.

409
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,790
Ah, this crazy bastard.

410
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,380
Okay, I'll do as you wish.

411
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:16,000

412
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,350

413
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,490

414
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,960
 I'm sorry, Soo Hyeok.

415
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,650
This is your final chance. Where did you send the file?

416
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,870
 Boss!

417
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:22,800
Boss, I think he already sent files to someone.

418
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,810
I'll kill you for sure today.

419
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:33,050
Hold him up.

420
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:39,300
You bastard! Just stand by for my beating.

421
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,890
Ha Ri.

422
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,430
You came here with your own two feet.

423
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,920
Ha Ri, don't come here.

424
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,930
Don't come, Ha Ri!

425
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:18,510
Stay away, Ha Ri!

426
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:21,000
Don't come here, Ha Ri!

427
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,340
Get him!

428
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:26,170
Ha Ri!  Don't come here!

429
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:29,890
♫  In the end, I am gonna be with you  ♫

430
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:35,180
♫  Just walk without thinking, when you lose  ♫

 ♫  I don't need anything else, I just wanna fly one day, this is one way  ♫

434
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,780

 ♫  can't easily look back from my decision  ♫

435
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:57,120

 I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

440
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:21,890
 I'm sorry.

441
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:24,740
 It was you that left the help message.

442
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,970
 Who are you?

443
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,000
 I came here to scout a capable man.

444
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,500
 What do you think? I'll get you out of here and you come work with me.

445
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,690
 When I look at you, you look like a genius.

446
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,200
 And don't be nervous.

447
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:09,520
♫  Find the you that's lost your way  ♫

448
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:16,110
 I promised you that I would never let you be caught by Chairman Cheon.

451
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,600
Hey, Ha Ri!

452
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,360
You bastard!

453
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,830
Should I slit your throat first?

454
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:46,390
♫  Think you can’t go back to the time  ♫

455

Byeong Min! You bastard!

456
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,160
Byeong Min!

457
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,330
Are you okay?

458
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:24,650
Why did you come here?

459
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,740
Should I watch instead? While my friend gets beaten.

460
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:44,110
I'm not crying.

461
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:48,300
Who said something? Wipe your blood, you punk.

462
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,710
Ha Ri.

463
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,360
I have something I want to tell you.

464
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,750
Don't tell me.

465
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,190
What?

466
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,400
I said don't tell me.

467
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,220
It's not like you knowingly did it.

468
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,990
So don't tell me.

469
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,420
You don't do things like that between friends.

470
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:56,160
Go on with the next plan.

471
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,890
Yes, sir.

472
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,590
I usually get tired too after bathing at a sauna.

473
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,710
Okay, I got it.

474
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,280
Yes, Chief Prosecutor.

475
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,180
Pardon?

476
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,010
Yes, I understand. I'll head over there right away.

477
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:35,580
Prosecutor Jang, where are you going?

478
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,130
I'm going to the Mooyeong building.

479
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,310
I'll see Chief Prosecutor.

480
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,620
See you later.

481
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,290
 I found the mastermind who pulls strings.

482
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:54,590
 Let's meet in person and talk since we could be wiretapped.

483
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:43,030

484
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,670

485
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,540
What is this?

486
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,290

487
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,100
- Yes? This is prosecutor Jang's—
 - Where's Prosecutor Jang?

488
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:13,250
- He left the office. What—
 - I said where is he?!

489
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,260
What?

490
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,650
To Chief Prosecutor Yoo?

491
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:25,830

492
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,760
Where is that?

493
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:46,030
Ha Ri, why aren't you picking up—

494
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,660
What?

495
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,600
"That man" is trying to kill prosecutor Jang,

496
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,860
so hurry! Go to the Mooyeong building, quickly!

497
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,290
Yes, I understand. I'll be there right away.

498
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:33,260
 No, Prosecutor Choi said he would tell it in person so—

499
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,670

500
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:33,100
What's up with all this...

501
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,990

502
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,530
- Yeah, what? What's the matter?
 - Why don't you pick up your phone?!

503
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,740
What's the matter with you, all of a sudden?

504
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,830
Get out of there as soon as you can.

505
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:45,900
Hurry.

506
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,140
Hello?

507
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,530
I'm in the elevator so my connection is bad.

508
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,250
Tell me what's going on.

509
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,200
This time, it's you.

510
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,240
Like Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi.

511
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,670
This time, that man is going to use you to take the blame for everything.

512
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:02,450
So, quickly, get the hell out of there! Hurry!

513
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,060
Huh?

514
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,610
"That man"?

515
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,390
What does that—

516
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,020
Wait a minute. What's wrong?

517
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,260
Ahjussi, what's the matter?

518
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:31,570
 Tattoo... He had a tattoo on the back of his neck.

519
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,900
Shit.

520
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,050
You bastard!

521
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,930
 Hello?

522
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:51,870
 Hello? What's going on? Hello?

523
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:54,930
 Prosecutor Jang! Prosecutor Jang!

524
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,350
Shit...

525
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,660
What is it? What's going on?

526
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,040
Prosecutor Jang is in danger.

527
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,900
What?

528
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:15,250
You should've been less nosy.

529
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:23,450
Next it's those bastards' turn.

530
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,640
Leave this up to me and go quickly.

531
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,430
Quickly!

532
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,400
Elder!

533
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,810
- Ah, you've suffered a lot.
 - Bastards...

534
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:06,520
How old am I to be an elder? I'm not even married yet.

535
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:11,280
Get him!

536
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,270
Go quickly! Go, go!

537
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,740
Hey! Go to that side, hurry!

538
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,990
Aish!

539
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:08,020
Wait here a minute.

540
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,350
Ah Ryeong!

541
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,500
No!

542
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:25,980
♫  Don't come close  ♫ 
♫  With translucent eyes  ♫

543
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:30,910
♫  Don't try to fool me  ♫

544
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:33,070
No!

545
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:38,320
♫  I don't believe you  ♫

546
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:44,630
♫  I don't believe you  ♫

547
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:52,900
♫  This game where we trick and get tricked  ♫

548
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,920

549
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,000
 I think the incident from 15 years ago is repeating itself.

550
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,750
 This shouldn't happen anymore.  I'll going to end it.

551
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,690
 Distribute those rascals' identities to the police.

552
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,900
 And tell everybody to carry guns.

553
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,650
 The one who is called "that man" manipulates all these things.

554
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,170
 Yoo Gi Hoon is just a spy who works for him.

555
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:11,340
 - There's no corpse. 
 - Then, if there's a corpse, is it okay?

556
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,390
 Let's use this to show him for sure, that he can't do anything without us!

557
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:17,800
 Hey, Chairman Cheon!  Come on, you bastard!

558
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,590
 Do things according to the plan.

559
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,620
 What is this? You're on the same side?

560
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,770
 Why did you do it?
