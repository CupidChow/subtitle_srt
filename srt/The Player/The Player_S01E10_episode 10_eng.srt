1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,250

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,800

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,160

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,280

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,030

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,800

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:38,660

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,040

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,980

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,470

11
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,170
We won't change the candidate.

12
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,710
If we keep supporting Kim Seong Jin—

13
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,980
It isn't as though there are only one or two charges that were revealed through the media.

14
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,220
How will we cover this up?

15
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,730
I agree with that. Approval ratings are plunging.

16
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,340
The truth is the best way of calming doubts.

17
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,330
 The current suspicions surrounding my wife

18
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,440
 were completely my fault and responsibility.

19
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,910
Of course, we may have to add a few lies.

20
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,420
 I didn't pay attention to her behavior carefully because she was my family.

21
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,250
 What do you think about the special prosecution team?

22
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,740
 Are you acknowledging your wife's crimes?

23
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,090
Someone who wouldn't even overlook his wife's corruption in order to keep his principles.

24
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,330
 When it comes to principles, I think everyone must be treated equally.

25
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:08,030
 If my wife has received money illegally; if it's revealed to be true from the trials—

26
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,590
Someone who, in the face of all the suspicions surrounding him, tries to take responsibility until the end.

27
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,640
 She should be justly punished.

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,020
 And I will return every last penny to the national treasury.

29
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,810
If that kind of candidate solely tries to uphold this country's principles,

30
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:29,760
 I will also squarely cooperate with the prosecutors' investigation.

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,350
This kind of story has the power to move people's hearts.

32
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,760
 My calling is to work for this country.

33
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,800
 For the country, for the people!

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,410
Even if that's the case, will the approval ratings recover that easily?

35
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,340
I don't intend for the approval ratings to recover.

36
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,810
Pardon?

37
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,770
 I will do my best until the end.

38
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,450
 Thank you.

39
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,420
 Aren't you taking any questions?

40
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,730
 Wait a moment. We have a few questions.

41
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,670
I'm not saying we should revive Kim Seong Jin.

42
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,450
I'm saying that we should bring the votes to us by making voters turn against the opponent.

43
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,520
"All politicians are the same,"

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,110
So we'll be making them think that it's better to choose second best than to choose the worst.

45
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,230
If this happens, it'll be more than enough, even with the current approval ratings.

46
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,390
Even so, do we have to go this far?

47
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,600
Don't worry too much.

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,350
All you need to do is just to support us with your small share as usual.

49
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,320
I'll do the rest on my own, as I have planned.

50
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,460
If, by chance, we fail...

51
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,780
That's impossible.

52
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,390
Then. I'll take it as you all have agreed to this.

53
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,070
Do you think it'll be okay?

54
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,360
I think he's starting again, like 15 years ago.

55
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,780
Let's trust him. Whatever the case, winning is good for us.

56
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,280
Start it.

57
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,850
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,730

59
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,500

60
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,120

61
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,120

62
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,920

63
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,340

64
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,280

65
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,110

66
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,360
What are you doing so early in the morning?

67
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,850
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

68
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,830
I'm working on something extremely sensitive right now.

69
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,990
What is it?

70
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,570
Cuticles!

71
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,440
Next, nutritional treatment. Shall I do yours too?

72
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,780
No thanks. Have it all to yourself.

73
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,790
You're being shy.

74
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,570
Can you do something that suits you?

75
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,390
It does suit me! It's shiny.

76
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,330
Sure.

77
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,680
Oh! Isn't he that prosecutor ahjussi?

78
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,100
This article came out this morning.

79
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,160
He's getting all the attention.

80
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,150
So what?

81
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,040
It's unfair. We did all the work.

82
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,400
Everything is unfair to you.

83
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
We shouldn't be getting attention anyway.

84
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,830
We're in a situation where if we were revealed, we'd go to prison right away.

85
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,030
Wait and see.

86
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,260
I'll make a big and giant event.

87
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,740
You want to show off that much?

88
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,590
Of course, I should. It was a big event.

89
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,390
If you didn't show off your ignorance, it would be a relief.

90
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,980
Hey, what should we do now? Isn't it time for us to start?

91
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,680
I agree. We've been resting a while.

92
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,200
What do you want to do?

93
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,360
- Executing justice!
 - Executing justice?

94
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,130
Executing justice... How about you, Ah Ryeong?

95
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,960
Shall we go explore the countryside? I'd like to race around in a refreshing way.

96
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,520
Exploring... How about you, Jin Woong?

97
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,140
Whatever we do, scale is what's important for men.

98
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,390
Not cuticles?

99
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,160
That is essential.

100
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,080
Execution of justice, exploring, and scale...

101
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,800
Wow. There is just something that fits all of three.

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,080
- What is it?
 - What is it?

103
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,390
This... This is a marathon.

104
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,530
So, what is it?

105
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,570
Why are you taking so much time to tell us? It doesn't suit you.

106
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,770
It is...

107
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,090
- I guess there are a lot of people who are curious.
 - What the heck?

108
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,860

109
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,490
Just a minute.

110
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,440
Yeah, Yeon Hee?

111
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,850
What?

112
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,520
I got it. I'll leave now. Okay.

113
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,770
Okay.

114
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,070
I'll be back.

115
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,800
- What's going on?
 - We'll talk when I get back.

116
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,230
Ayoo. Look at him.

117
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,910
Is he dating that doctor?

118
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,740
- What?!
 - I don't think so.

119
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,090
How would you know?

120
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,280
I think he likes me.

121
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,630
You're crazy.

122
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,530
No, seriously.

123
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,030
It's true. I drank coffee yesterday.

124
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,120
That's enough.

125
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,680
What do you mean coffee?

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,670
At each other's houses.

127
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,170
Yeon Hee?

128
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,550
Yeon Hee.

129
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,820
What's going on?

130
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,840
I think my dad was here.

131
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,750
What?

132
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,420
What happened?

133
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,960
I'm not sure.

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,900
At first I thought it was a thief,

135
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,610
but nothing was taken.

136
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,540
Except for the key.

137
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,590
Key?

138
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,640
It's the key that he entrusted to me before he left Korea.

139
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,130
He said I should never give it to anybody.

140
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,150
Fifteen years ago?

141
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,040
Yeah.

142
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,320
What is the key for?

143
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,960
That slush fund was in Korea.

144
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,420
But why didn't he say anything to you—

145
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,540
To be honest, he contacted me.

146
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,420
A few days ago.

147
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,370
 Yeon Hee, listen to what I'm saying.

148
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,050
 Everything will be fine as long as we have that money.

149
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,750
 I even made all the arrangements with buyers in Singapore.

150
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,960
 I'm telling you if I just have that money I can get back on my feet.

151
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,530
 Until when are you going to live like that?

152
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,670
 Until when are you going to keep cheating others and be on the run?

153
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,850
 Can't you just stop now? Just turn yourself in—

154
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,380
 I've come this far, how can I stop now?

155
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,590
 Do you know what those bastards did to me?

156
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,270
 You didn't do anything good either, Dad!

157
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,470
 Stop complaining and hand over the key to the safe.

158
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,150
 I'll figure out the rest.

159
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,230
 I don't have it! I threw it away!

160
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,780
 I threw away that useless thing!

161
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,700
 Oh, yeah?

162
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,860
 You think that if you act like this, I won't be able to find it?

163
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,230
 Let's stop now. Please?

164
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,490
 Just get punished and live without shame.

165
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,300
 Dad! Dad!

166
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,100
First, go stay in a safe place for a few days.

167
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,750
Close the clinic.

168
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,420
You could be in danger. Understand?

169
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,820
I'll call you.

170
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,580
Ha Ri.

171
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,820
Come back safely to get me.

172
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,180
I'm also asking a favor from you.

173
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,160
Okay.

174
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,380
Hello, Prosecutor.

175
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,310
Hello, you're on the way to work.

176
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,650

177
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,360
Applause!

178
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,700
Applause for Prosecutor Jang!

179
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,760
Who keeps Korean justice?

180
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,310
 Jang In Gyu! Jang In Gyu!

181
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,830
- Enough, enough, enough!
  - Jang In Gyu!

182
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,540
What are you doing in the morning? It's so embarrassing. What is this?

183
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,910
Congratulations, Prosecutor!

184
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,640
What congratulations? It's not even my birthday.

185
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,180
Prosecutor, you have become a celebrity.

186
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,390
You looked so good on TV, like a movie star.

187
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,840
So embarrassing. Why are you doing this? Enough, enough.

188
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,340
Hurry and blow out the candle.

189
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,020
Fine, fine.

190
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,890
- Clap!
  - Woohoo!

191
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,250
Okay.

192
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,500
Oh, but actually there's someone else who really needs to be congratulated.

193
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,890
Congrats? Who? Did someone show up on TV too?

194
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,580
What?

195
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,150
Congrats on your daughter, Dodam, being born.

196
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,250
Prosecutor! Ah, I'm tearing up.

197
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,060
Could you pass that shopping bag?

198
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,580
- And, this is...
 - Yes?

199
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,330
- This is a present for the baby.
 - Yes.

200
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,750
They said you need to hang this from the ceiling.

201
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,280
Oh, Prosecutor, you didn't have to—

202
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,230
Mobile.

203
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,870
Mobile?

204
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,270
Mobile?

205
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,030
Yes. Oh yes, a mobile.

206
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,840
Prosecutor, this kind of stuff can be used after 3 months.

207
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,050
Prosecutor Jang makes it really obvious he's still unmarried.

208
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,100
- Then I'll return it.
 - No, no.

209
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,170
I'll use it well, three months later.

210
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,230
Dodami will really...  I'll use it well.

211
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,110
- You should use this time to take a vacation.
 - Me?

212
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,400
Because you were working, you didn't get to see Dodami being born.

213
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,140
- Thank you!
 - Yeah, sure.

214
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,320
By the way, Prosecutor. How long can I take a vacation for?

215
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,820
How about a half-day?

216
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,170
What?

217
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,430
If you're going to be like that, I'm just going to go to the sauna for a bit.

218
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,640
- I was just joking. Take about a week.
 - Thank you!

219
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,020
The rest, please get back to work!

220
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,180
Yes.

221
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,080
♪ Where are you going?  Let me know ♪

222
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,530
♪ Am I going?  Where am I going to? ♪

223
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,950
♪ I'm a guy who takes a vacation ♪

224
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,690
Just a minute, phone call, phone call.

225
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,140
Yeah, what? What's up?

226
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,280
Now, now, now, now, now.

227
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,810
Before we start, let's recharge ourselves.

228
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,640
- Oh, thank you! 
 - Here you go.

229
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,330
- Thank you.
 - Yeah. Here.

230
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,630
I like this so much.

231
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,560
You don't like coffee.

232
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,080
Oh, Prosecutor, you're here! Have a seat here. Sit here, Prosecutor.

233
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,320
Oh, thank you.

234
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,660
You came alone today?

235
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,240
How about Section Chief Maeng?

236
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,170
I let him take paternity leave.

237
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,400
Oh, he was married?

238
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,450
He's got skills.

239
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,400
Even though he looks like that, he has a wife.

240
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,690
Stop talking silly stuff.

241
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,130
- Hey, boss.
 - He is not the boss.

242
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,820
Prosecutor, I'm the boss.

243
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,110
- Bring me some coffee.
 - Bring it.

244
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,000
What's this about?

245
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,490
I want to talk about work.

246
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,100
Work?

247
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,890
Korea Investment Corp (KIC) invested 180 billion won into Loyman stock 15 years ago.

248
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,170
This was an unprecedented overseas investment, and there were also rumors that Loyman would be opening a branch office in Korea.

249
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,910
So the stock market was shaken up.

250
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,910
Of course, the stock price of the company that introduced Loyman to KIC and evaluated the company rose as well.

251
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:45,530
But a few months later, the incident that flipped the stock market happened.

252
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,190

253
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,340
As Loyman went bankrupt,

254
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,730
all of that money evaporated!

255
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,940
All of the 180 billion won?

256
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,410
All of it was from our taxes.

257
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,720
Why did they invest in a failing company like that?

258
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,160
We should consider this as a very typical securities fraud scheme.

259
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,180
Securities fraud?

260
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,780

261
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,550
WG International was the company that was in charge of the funds then.

262
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,350
This company also went bankrupt as soon as the incident broke out.

263
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,740
Since WG CEO Choo Won Gi had sold his stocks beforehand,

264
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,710
he made a profit of more than 5 billion won.

265
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,460
So Choo Won Gi introduced a failing company to KIC on purpose?

266
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,610
Yeah. We should consider it that way.

267
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,570
Jeez, they made a pretty big haul and ran away.

268
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,750
There must've been a lot of victims.

269
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,630
But another interesting rumor started spreading then.

270
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,180
That this disappeared 180 billion won floated around overseas

271
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,820
and flew into Mi Chang Party for Kim Gook Jong's political fund.

272
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,110
It was when the presidential election was around the corner so the approval ratings were swaying, and victims filed class action suits as well.

273
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,150
But the funny thing is,

274
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,030
Kim Gook Jong's side forcefully requested a special prosecutors' investigation,

275
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,620
insisting that it was only a rumor that the opposing party had viciously spread.

276
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,930
At that time, the prosecution team in charge of this—

277
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,240
The Special Corruption Investigation Team.

278
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,780
- You know it well.
 - So what happened to Choo Won Gi?

279
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,690
He smuggled himself out to China from Taeseong Port.

280
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:18,130
Does it make sense that they lost him?

281
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,580
Anyhow, our public workers only take our taxes but they can't do anything—

282
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,320
You punk!

283
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,870
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Jang. I thought that prosecutors weren't public servants.

284
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,570
Speaking technically, it was not "lost him"

285
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,770
but "let him go."

286
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,330
Hm?

287
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,000
What do you mean "let him go"?

288
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,120
The person who smuggled him out was

289
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760

290
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,460
the Special Corruption Investigation Department Head Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi.

291
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,560
Really? Wow!

292
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,160
That trash, gangster-like bastard!

293
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,590
Then he let him go on purpose after receiving bribes?

294
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,970
I'm not sure.

295
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,480
Anyhow, Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi was disgraced as a corrupt prosecutor after this case.

296
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,250
The evidence that he had received bribes was pouring out.

297
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,410
Besides that, the opponent's campaign manager

298
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,450
committed suicide with leaving a suicide note

299
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,340
that was written to say that they were the ones who actually investigated themselves for the political fund.

300
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,220
It was a huge reversal in the presidential election.

301
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,980
And as you know, candidate Kim Gook Jong won.

302
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,060
It feels like the situation happened in  strange way.

303
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,080
Then what happened to Choi Hyeon Gi, that punk? Did he get arrested?

304
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,540
No.

305
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,750

306
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,680
He committed suicide.

307
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,350
Who in the hell do you think you are, saying "suicide"?!

308
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,260
Why is he angry?

309
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,620
Why are you saying all this now?

310
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,810
You bastard, why are you bringing up the past—

311
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,470
It's not "the past" anymore.

312
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,560
What?

313
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,450
Choo Won Gi came back.

314
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,090
To Korea.

315
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,030
Come see me for a minute.

316
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,920
How do you know Choo Won Gi?

317
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,000
And why are you poking around in this case again?

318
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,040
Why? This incident has been known to the public.

319
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,310
Is this some sort of secret?

320
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,170
I looked into it, and you were also one of the special prosecution team members.

321
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,890
Looking at you now, it looks like you feel wronged.

322
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,260
That's why I'm asking, why are you getting involved in this case? Why?

323
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,850
You already know. I'll do any work as long as I can get money.

324
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,740
The female doctor who works in the hospital where Hong Yeon Hee was hospitalized.

325
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,890
She is Choo Won Gi's daughter.

326
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,210
- What?
 - He's been on the run for 15 years, and he didn't even see his daughter. He only took the key to a safe.

327
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,100
Why do you think he did that?

328
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,340
Obviously, there must be hidden money somewhere.

329
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,250
I can't miss this opportunity.

330
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,860
Let's think simply.

331
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,580
If you have something to ask, catch him and ask.

332
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,360
For me, all I need is the money.

333
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,560
Okay?

334
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,450
Then I'm going to take this as your approval.

335
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,350
Keep one thing in mind.

336
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,140
Never mention this to anyone except your team members!

337
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,130
I mean, don't ruin this project by talking about it with someone you think you trust.

338
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:14,990
You know very well how you feel when you get betrayed by a person you trust the most.

339
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,520
Choi Hyeon Gi, Choi Hyeon Gi.

340
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,160
I heard Choi Hyeon Gi a lot somewhere.

341
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,600
We talked about him earlier.

342
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,760
So? Did you think about it?

343
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,570
I honestly don't know why we should do this.

344
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,250
Me either. What does him coming to Korea have to do with us?

345
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,520
I don't want to do this case either.

346
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,450
Is it so? You said you wanted to execute justice, didn't you?

347
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,480
I'm not interested in what I said in the past.

348
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,630
Cha Ah Ryeong, you said you want to go explore?

349
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,420
Well, it depends on what kind of exploration it is.

350
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,080
The scale is pretty good, isn't it?

351
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,770
Still, how can we take money from abroad?

352
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,160
And even if there was money, they must've spent it all.

353
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,090
Really?

354
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,150
Then I guess I'll do it alone.

355
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,600
But I heard that the money Choo Won Gi had hidden was still in Korea.

356
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,040
How much is there?

357
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,660
I guess it is about 1 billion or 1.5 billion won.

358
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,920
Well, someone said it's about 44 million dollars.

359
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,980
If I convert dollars to won...

360
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,370
- 50 billion won.
 - 50 billion??

361
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,050
You meant all that money is in Korea?

362
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,060
Yeah. I heard that it's all cash too.

363
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,030
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

364
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,120
Move! Move, Ha Ri.

365
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,210
Hurry, hurry.

366
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,900
Just hold. Hold it.

367
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,360
One, two, three!

368
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,720
Move quickly.

369
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,200
Aigoo, what brings you here?

370
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,860
When I asked for help, you wouldn't even turn your nose in this direction.

371
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,280
It's not manners if you do this whenever you need favors.

372
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,810
As you can see, I became completely broke thanks to you.

373
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,360
I can give you as much money as you want.

374
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,630
And I can refuse as much as I want. Right?

375
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,970
You should decide after reading this.

376
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,190
It's that man's proposal.

377
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,240
That man?

378
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,170

379
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,380

380
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,550

381
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,330
This man has amazing timing, huh?

382
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,980
Everyone must feel troubled.

383
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,150

384
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,730
I really can't reject this proposal.

385
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,800
I'll prepare the money right away.

386
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,670
Hold on.

387
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,180
I can do whatever I want to this bastard, can't I?

388
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Whatever I want!

389
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,340

390
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,490

391
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,810

392
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,630
I did as you ordered.

393
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,540
Proceed

394
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,350
to the next step.

395
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,650
Section Chief Maeng! The con artist who you investigated—

396
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,930

397
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,510
Is it urgent? Should I give him a call?

398
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,230
No, no. My mistake.

399
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,730

400
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,010
Everybody, attention!

401
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,710
From now on, our team is going to pursue just one person.

402
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,340
Never disclose this information outside,

403
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,280
and scrupulously keep this only between us.  Understand?

404
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,750
 Yes, sir!

405
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,900
You're going to pursue only one person?

406
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,600
What do you mean?

407
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,180
Why didn't you report to me first?

408
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,360
I'm sorry, Deputy Manager.

409
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,150
No, Head Prosecutor.

410
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,510
Just call me comfortably.

411
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm not appointed yet.

412
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,980
Where did you get the information?

413
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,580
In Gyu, I know how much you want to catch Choo Won Gi.

414
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,530
I know better than anybody that we have to do so in order to unveil the truth of the incident 15 years ago.

415
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,980
But you and I are in the same boat, aren't we?

416
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,150
Fine. If you don't want to tell me then...

417
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,360
I found the daughter.

418
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,130
Daughter?

419
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,720
Yes. Choo Won Gi's daughter.

420
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,460
I confirmed that he took the key to a safe at dawn and ran away.

421
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,220
I'm sorry, I didn't tell you about this earlier.

422
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,200
I just want to take care of this quietly.

423
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,320
Even though it's said that the head prosecutor's line was cleared out,

424
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,440
I'm not sure if there are any spies left within the prosecution office.

425
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,970
Chief Prosecutor, you know well,

426
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,370
if this information leaked out,  the bastard might take action again.

427
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,220
No, he could've started already.

428
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,000
Then, before we arrest Choo Won Gi,

429
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,990
he would get murdered

430
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,590
or it would be disguised as a suicide.

431
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,600
Of course, we have to catch him before something like that happens.

432
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,580
Right. What you're saying makes sense.

433
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,610
But won't this be too difficult without more manpower?

434
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,810
It's enough.

435
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,840
Our team will do it for sure.

436
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,860
Over there. I think that's the final destination.

437
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,890
Circumstantial estimated time is between at dawn and 7 am today.

438
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,380
Ah Ryeong and Jin Woong, check CCTVs  on the streets.

439
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,160
You try to find out what he used the computer for.

440
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,690
He could have used it before he left.

441
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,470
Ha Ri, by the way, why was the safe key there?

442
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,330
It looks like a regular house.

443
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,360
Because his daughter lives there.

444
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,020
Daughter? You even hit on his daughter too?

445
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,570
Ah really!

446
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,780
Anyhow, let's talk details later and let's start.

447
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,310
Make sure to talk details later.

448
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,900
Ah, really!

449
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,070
Let's get to work, each of our positions.

450
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,530
Okay.

451
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,160
See you later.

452
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,850
Is anyone home? You have a delivery...

453
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:41,340
You have a delivery.

454
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,500
Hey, hello?

455
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,530
Of course, nobody is here.

456
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:56,090
Wow, it is nice.

457
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,490
Oh, this doctor...

458
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,810
Hold on, why is this?

459
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,470
This is Choo Yeon Hee.

460
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,440
Choo Won Gi, Choo Yeon Hee.

461
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:21,180
I never thought about it. What a meticulous guy.

462
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:25,880
This is incredible, wow!

463
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,820
Well, let me see. She paid her utility fee.

464
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,390
Okay, okay, okay.

465
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,720
Hello.

466
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,250
I'm here from the prosecutor's office.

467
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,970
Um, could you give me the footage from the CCTV outside?

468
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,970
I don't want to. I'm busy.

469
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,470
What?

470
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:38,040
Oh. It's an urgent matter, please do me a favor.

471
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,730
There's nothing I can do!

472
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,870
Just kidding, come in.

473
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,840
Huh? Oh.

474
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:00,780
- Excuse me, I'm from the prosec—
 - Oh! You scared me!

475
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,570
I'm not a bad guy, not a bad guy! Prosecutor, Prosecutor.

476
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,380
I'm a nice person.

477
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,880

478
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,830
Hold on.

479
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,810
Yes. Thank you. Good work.

480
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,470
Ah Ryeong, toward your side.

481
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,340
I just confirmed he passed this side at 5:11 am.

482
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,480
- Good. Jin Woong, join with Ah Ryeong.
 -  Okay.

483
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,700
Okay. What was he doing?

484
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,220
It seems he was talking with someone using an unregistered phone.

485
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,340
What? Unregistered phone?

486
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,530
Yes. Did you find it?

487
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,700
Yeah, hang on. Okay.

488
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,740

489
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,460

490
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,420
Is that all?

491
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,520
Okay, I got it.

492
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,670
- Inspector Lee!
 - Yes.

493
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:55,820
Get the incoming call numbers around the area with requests to cellular service providers right away.

494
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,010
- And check all the numbers that matched with the times. Okay?
 - I got it.

495
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,170
- Now, move out!
 - Yes.

496
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,190
Aigoo, he erased it all.

497
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,980
Do you think I can't find it even though you erased it?

498
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,030

499
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,850
Scary.

500
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,880

501
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,770
Okay.

502
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,450
 I'm going to arrange the delivery. Please contact me this afternoon.

503
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,040
Delivery? What is this?

504
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,070
Why isn't Byeong Min coming out?

505
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,740
 This one is the most likely phone number. The phone is off.

506
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,650
What is it?

507
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,200
Did you find something?

508
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,370
- Hurry, hurry! Hurry!
 - What?

509
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,160
- Why are you acting like a goofball?
 - Something happened?

510
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,220
Gangsters are here! Hurry! Go! We're getting into a big trouble if we get caught.

511
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,720
Hurry!

512
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,600
Nobody is here, Hyungnim.

513
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,620
Should we catch his daughter?

514
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,190
No, it's fine.

515
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:52,070
The reason this punk came back to Korea is obvious.

516
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:09,580
Well, this is the list of incoming call numbers that we received from Prosecutor Jang. There is only one number that was used yesterday and this morning.

517
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,570
Who is the owner?

518
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:15,800
Name, Park Choon Jae, age, 43,  Known as the CEO of a real estate consulting company.

519
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,180
But in actuality, while he runs the real estate company, he lives by doing currency swaps.

520
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:25,360
The amount that he can launder in one go is a whole lot more than your average loan shark.

521
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,310
- Currency swap?
 - Then he is going to stash away the slush fund abroad with Choo Won Gi or something like that?

522
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:37,610
Yeah, something like that. So I hacked Choo Won Gi's emails. There was an email from Park Choon Jae.

523
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:45,420
So I think that must be the meeting spot. The time to meet will be decided this afternoon.

524
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,600
Isn't that just parking area marks?

525
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,710
Hey, how can you find where that is when there are so many parking lots, you stupid!

526
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,860
I knew you would say that, you pig.

527
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:02,500
You pig, look at this. Click like this first then it shows, right?

528
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,440
Then you put in the GPS address. Then what'll happen?

529
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,510
Then ta-da!  It shows like this. Understand?

530
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,110
Wow!

531
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,170
It's very simple.

532
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,650
Then we got the location. Does Park Choon Jae have any other special characteristics?

533
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,730
If we really need to select one, I can say that he is an avid golfer.

534
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,650
- Golfer?
 - Yeah.

535
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:29,980
I looked at his social media. There are a lot of golfing pictures like this.  So I searched some more

536
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,710
and found out that he made a reservation under his name at 1 pm today.

537
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,400
Of course, it'll be a betting game.

538
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,030
Most likely.

539
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:41,150
Then we can just wait until he finishes his round and beat the daylights out of him.

540
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,630
No, we could ruin this by doing that.

541
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:48,870
He's been on the run for 15 years. If he catches on to our plan, he'll go back into hiding.

542
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,630
Then what should we do?

543
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,630
We need to find a way to let his guard down

544
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,070
until we find the cash.

545
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,660
That's right, Byeong Min. You know how to do voice changes, right?

546
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,240
I do. Why?

547
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,320
They'll have to talk on the phone to set a time. Let's answer the call first and control things.

548
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,420
But, it's easier said than done.

549
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,690
If we want to do that, I need a lot of samples of his voice.

550
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,170
That's right. It's not like we can follow him all day and talk with him.

551
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,550
Don't worry. There is a way.

552
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,400
A way? What way?

553
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,980
That guy.

554
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,440
We'll have to earn his trust.

555
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,400
Why don't we go and get some fresh air for a change?

556
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,430
 What happened to arrange a matching player?

557
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,940
I received a recommendation for a decent guy.

558
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,840
A recommendation?

559
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,980
- Who is it? 
 -Yang Young Bin, he's been on tour in Europe. He should be arriving soon.

560
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,990

561
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,300

562
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,710
A-player entrance. Next is pig entrance.

563
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,600
Okay.

564
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,860
Enter quickly. Quickly, quickly.

565
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:25,560
- Oh, Pro Yang!
 - We spoke on the phone, I'm Department Head Kim.

566
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,990
- You're very handsome!
 - Thank you.

567
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,730
Let's get this right. It'll be my third time losing to President Han if we lose.

568
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,340
Don't worry about it this time, President.

569
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,920
He should have arrived by now.

570
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,710
Where is he? Where is he?

571
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,050
Are you... President Park?

572
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,470
- Golfer Yang?
 - Ah, yes.

573
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,450
Wow! You're a bright looking fellow.

574
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,960
Oh, you're too kind.

575
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,800
- I've heard a lot about you.
 - Yes, thank you.

576
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,750
- Well, let's go.
 - Yes.
 - This way.

577
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,300
Wow! Good shot, good shot!

578
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,040
- As expected, Golfer Lee! 
 - You play well.

579
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,580
But, who do we have here? It's my first time seeing you.

580
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,280
President Han, let's just play quietly.

581
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,540
I'm just worried that you'll lose money and cry yourself out like last time.

582
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,950
Oh, Golfer Yang! Take this.

583
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,770
Oh, that's fine, I'll use my own ball.

584
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,280
 You never know, so I put a GPS tracker on this ball, use it no matter what.

585
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,230
 Oh, really? How did you do it?

586
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,280
 But, do you actually know how to play?

587
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,570
 What? Is there anything I can't do?

588
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,220
 Okay, good shot!

589
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,910
 I'm going.

590
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,400
 - I think he's bluffing.
 - I'm sure he'll do well.

591
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,860
 - No, whenever he uses that tone, he doesn't do well. 
 - I'm sure he'll be okay.

592
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,560
 - He can't— He can't do it.
 - He can. He'll do well!

593
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,220
That was just practice.

594
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,570
Okay, I'll play for real now.

595
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,750
Good shot!

596
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,760
Nice, nice, nice!

597
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,720
Good shot, my foot. He's sloppy.

598
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,960
You're right, he's way off course.

599
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,620
What are you doing? Aren't you going?

600
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,210
Where?

601
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:09,570
It went off course. Are you going to leave it like that?

602
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,900
Are you telling me to go right now?

603
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,060
Then should I go? Should I leave this and go? I'll go then.

604
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,630
- I'll go then—
 - No, no.

605
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,920
Just go quickly! Roll over there or something.

606
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,180
You only order me around, jerk.

607
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,210
Who else then?

608
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,980
You saw that, right?

609
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,830
- Aigoo, our golfer, you've got a killer swing.
 - Oh, no, it's nothing.

610
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,280
You're pretty good yourself!

611
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,020
Ahh, the weather's great today.

612
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,230
Oh, very good.

613
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,050
He's very clumsy.

614
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,190
Damn, that was accurate.

615
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,820
Ah, good! Very good!

616
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,090
Just hit the ball comfortably.

617
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,190
Just this one?  Even if I swing halfheartedly...

618
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,570
Now then, okay.

619
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,930
Hey, fatso! Get out the way, bastard! Blocking the way...

620
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,890
Sorry!

621
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:24,720
- Oh, excuse me... Your collar...Yes.
  - Oh, this?

622
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,150
I'll do it for you.

623
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:29,760
Oh, young lady, you're very kind.

624
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,890
Now, now, now.

625
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:35,210
I attached the recorder.

626
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:41,720
Okay, okay, okay. That's perfect.

627
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,470
- Here it goes.
 - Relax.

628
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,240
What the—!   I'm screwing up from the first the swing!

629
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,800
I think you let go of the cock a bit fast. Just watch the ball until the end.

630
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,780
Just swing naturally like you're throwing it.

631
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,320
The swing isn't all about strength.

632
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,400
Look at it until the end, swing it fully.

633
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,070
Ah, really. I put too much strength?

634
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,770
Who's teaching who?

635
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:22,000
No, no, no. Not there, to the left you punk. I said left! Left!

636
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,590
Go to the left, yeah, the left!

637
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,410
Yeah, to that side. To the left.

638
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,920
Hey! How long do I have to run around?

639
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,380
Then what should I do when he hits a ball like that?

640
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,360
 The hand you eat with is your right and the opposite one is left!

641
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,000

]Park Choon Jae: Han Jin Yong]

642
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,430
 Yeah!

643
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,320
Quiet, quiet. A good chance.

644
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,790
Jeez!

645
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,860
Yes, ball in!

646
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,190
Thank you.

647
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,340
Aigoo! Aigoo, aigoo, what are you going to do? It just flew right out of the field!

648
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,250
Well, we have to walk over there to see. It may have gone in.

649
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,530
It went all the way out there, how could it?

650
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,560
Hey! This time you go. Quickly go find it!

651
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,530
No, no, no, you're closer. You've got lots of time. Just take your time and bring it slowly.

652
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:17,090
- Hey, I'm serious, they're here already!
 - What?!

653
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:20,660
Aish! Now you tell me? You pig!

654
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,210
- Hey, did you find it? Did you find it?
 - I'm looking!

655
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,970
- They're coming. Hurry.  Find it quickly!
 - Do you think I don't want to find it quickly, you Pig?

656
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,920
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

657
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,350
You look for it too! Quickly!

658
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,930
Found it, found it, found it!

659
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,310
Hold on, hold on. This way!

660
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,600
Not necessarily, why are you trying to look for the ball that went out of bounds?

661
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,700
You can play a ball under penalty of one stroke later.

662
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,000
It's here... Hold on. It is! it's here!

663
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,080
We found it!

664
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,770
It was definitely out! Why is it here?

665
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,000
Aigoo, it seemz wind blew it over later.

666
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,210
You people... This is a golf scam!

667
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,880
Scam? What scam?! We saw it together.

668
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,790
Are you going to play dirty?!

669
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:13,320
Ugh! So frustrating!

670
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,320
- What is the score?
 - So far, five-under-par.

671
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:24,570
You can't see it, right?

672
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:36,530
Oh, nice one! Nice one!

673
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,690
If this one goes well, we win.

674
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:06,720
Do well. We can't help you this time.

675
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,710
He's so clumsy, it worries me.

676
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,560
Let's pray.

677
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,430
Yeah!!

678
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:00,200
Yes!

679
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,730
- Yeah!
 - Yeah! Woo!

680
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,560
Nice shot!

681
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,890
Yeah! Woohoo! Yay!

682
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:09,060
We got it.

683
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:12,300
What's up with them?

684
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,400
- Aigoo, nice work.
 - Good job!

685
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:19,980
Aigoo, good job. Yes, here you go.

686
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,260
- Now, then.
 - Aigoo!

687
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,310
- Good job!
 - Good job.

688
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,010
Our golf player!

689
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,240
How about the voice sample?

690
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,600
It'll be enough.

691
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,610
Okay! And, the cell phone too?

692
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,320
Of course.

693
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,770
Good Job!  Let's go.

694
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,670
You saw the last putting shot, didn't you?

695
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,120
My last putt was killer, huh?

696
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:01,900
Good. Today is a very lucky day.

697
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,660
Wait a minute. Why hasn't Choo Won Gi called me yet?

698
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,610
Wait a minute. My cell— My cell phone's not here?

699
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,160
What?

700
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,660
Hey!

701
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,100
Drive properly!

702
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,170
That's enough.

703
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:51,900
How did you make him like this?

704
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:55,680
Ch-Ch-Chairman Cheon.

705
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,990
Choon Jae, you know I don't like to ask the same question twice, don't you?

706
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:08,680
Where is Choo Won Gi?

707
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,740
Do it this way then...

708
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,160
The voice will change if you do that.

709
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,210
Hey, hey!

710
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:25,490
- Byeong Min, Byeong Min! We got it, we got it!
 - Already?

711
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,400
Is it Choo Won Gi?

712
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,200
Hey, quiet, quiet.

713
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,760
Be quiet, be quiet.

714
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,840
 It's me, Choo Won Gi.

715
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,430
How is the transportation going?

716
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,690
 It's ready.

717
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:52,560
 When do I meet you?

718
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,270
Let's meet 6 pm. The location is that place.

719
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,150
 Got it.

720
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,480
Okay, it's set.

721
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,600
Okay! Good!

722
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,780
Let's go.

723
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,780
Okay, you guys go first.

724
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,510
We will back you up.

725
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,660
Section Chief.

726
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,390
I'm back.

727
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,620
Why? You're on vacation.

728
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,700
When I stayed only at home, I was itching to do something.

729
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,050
Then go to a sauna and get scrubbed.

730
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:33,390
- You want 15 dollars? 
 - Stop it, Prosecutor.

731
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:36,280
The prosecutor's office needs me here so it runs well—

732
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,380
Says who?

733
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,750
- Well...
 - That's what you think.

734
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,200
- Why would you be here on your vacation? Go home.
 - I have nothing to do.

735
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,890
Prosecutor! There's big trouble!

736
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,600
- What? 
 - The investigation headquarters.

737
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,030
What about the investigation headquarters?

738
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,390
I'm sure since I did it.

739
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:55,990
Do it better next time.

740
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:57,860
Over there.

741
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,410
- Drop me off right up there.
 - What?

742
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,160
Hurry.

743
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,160
Why suddenly?

744
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,260
You guys stay here.

745
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,650
What? You're going alone?

746
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,620
Yeah, I think it'll be best so that they're less suspicious.

747
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,530
Will you be okay? We can watch from afar.

748
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:25,160
No, no, I'll go alone. Give me the phone.

749
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,100
Okay.

750
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,530
Be careful because you never know.

751
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,130
- Will he be okay?
 - Of course,

752
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:45,060
He will be okay. He's not your average guy.

753
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,230
 The news of Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi,

754
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,310
 who was responsible for investigating Choo Won Gi,

755
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,660
 that he received bribes and helped him run away has been shocking.

756
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:10,260
 Evidence has been released of him receiving bribes from Choo.

757
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:15,220
 They have been involved in committing crimes for a long time...

758
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,060
 Ha Ri.

759
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:42,130
 Bring him back safely.

760
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,400
 Please, do me this favor.

761
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,150

762
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,710
You bastards, what are you doing?

763
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,830
Who gave you permission to do this?

764
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,550
Excuse me, Sunbaenim.

765
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:15,890
- You bastard!
 - I told them to.

766
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,190
Chief.

767
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,990

768
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,850
Mr. Park Choon Jae?

769
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,810

770
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,720
Still, something seems off.

771
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,020

772
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,410
What the...

773
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,770
This is insane.

774
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,030
What's wrong?

775
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:31,160
What is it?

776
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,770
Look.

777
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:34,820
I can't believe this.

778
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,790
 It's confirmed that Choo Won Gi, who has been accused of

779
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,080
 leading the 180 billion won investment fraud case 15 years ago

780
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,780
 came back to Korea through Inkyeong Harbor yesterday early morning.

781
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,430
 The prosecution started investigating right away.

782
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,960
 They said they would search for him openly.

783
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,300
 Right now, Choo is...

784
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:03,160
Are you not Park Choon Jae?

785
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,700
Oh, it's you?

786
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,060
Yes, I'm Park Choon Jae.

787
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,960
Wow! CEO Choo!

788
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,300
How long has it been?

789
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,260
We meet in a place like this.

790
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:35,120
And you brought someone with you too.

791
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:43,710

792
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,580
Get them!

793
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:52,620
♫  I don't believe you  ♫

794
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:59,380
♫  I don't believe you  ♫

795
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:05,450
♫  This game where we trick and get tricked  ♫

796
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:09,290
♫  The truth is all meaningless  ♫

797
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:13,510
♫  You do you, I believe myself  ♫

798
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,480

799
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,490
 Kang Ha Ri? Research a bit more.

800
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:21,090
 He must've gotten away after assaulting the police who were doing security checks on the street.

801
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,020
 What is this?

802
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:22,930
 Where?

803
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,070
 Let's go to Taeseong Harbor.

804
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:25,260
 - Hurry!
 - Go, go, go!

805
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,850
 I have to find that man. He's the bastard who started all of this.

806
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:31,760
 How could that punk Prosecutor Jang stab us in the back?

807
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,740
 Just do as you're told, okay? Don't try anything else.

808
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,630
 You should know that that man is looking for you, seeing even Chairman Cheon is out.

809
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:40,350
 That man always makes two plans.

810
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:41,630
 You need to stop now.

811
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:43,970
