1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,180

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,810

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,080

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,180

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,000

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,690

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,900

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,040

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,950

10
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,030

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,080
Excuse me, please. Please wake up.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,200
Please come to your senses, please.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,250
Get up! You can survive!

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,940
You can't proceed from here.

15
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,880
This is driving me crazy!

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,650
How did those bastards know to come there?

17
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,670
I know. We were the only ones who knew President Nam's location.

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,640
Yeah, he's right. We were the only ones who knew about President Nam's location—

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,300
Wait, give me a minute to think.

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,660
- How can you think in this situation— 
 - Stop.

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,240

22
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,400
 Captain...

23
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:56,260
Yeah, it's me. I'm sorry but could you come here right now?

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Yeah, right now.

25
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,830

26
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,880
- What happened? 
 - Is she alive?

27
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,800

28
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,510

29
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,500
Yes, the situation has been taken care of.

30
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,550
Yeah.

31
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,040
Okay, thank you. Please do me this favor.

32
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,740
Yeah.

33
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,870
Even if you are a lawyer of the working class,

34
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,850
you shouldn't have ramen this late.

35
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,260
Aigoo, Madame.

36
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,330
You've decided to grace this shabby place with your presence.

37
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,220
Have a seat.

38
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,740
Forget about sitting. Let's talk in a more pleasant setting.

39
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,130
It's too stuffy here.

40
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,420
Shall we?

41
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,370

42
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,410

43
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,280
You knew and you ended up like this in the end.

44
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,620
Hello.

45
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,330
Are you Yang Hye Joo's mother?

46
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,340
Yes.

47
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,560
By any chance, do you recognize this woman?

48
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,080
No, I've never seen her before.

49
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,360
Her last phone call was with you. The last four digits of her phone number are 2230.

50
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,890
2230?

51
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,490
Yes.

52
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,110
Ah! The one who offered to testify.

53
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,280
Testify?

54
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,410
Yes, she agreed to come to next week's trial.

55
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,380
She said she would clear my daughter's name.

56
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,640
I see. You've never met her before though?

57
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,090
I haven't,

58
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,010
but she should've met with the lawyer today. You can look into it.

59
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,180
His name is Jin Yong Joon.

60
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,510
He comes out on television and is quite famous. You know him, don't you?

61
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,250
Of course.

62
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,350
- Yes. 
 - Thank you.

63
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,260
Is this place to your liking?

64
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,840
It's a bit better and the view is nice too.

65
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,780
I guess people are meant to live their lives looking at water.

66
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,270
My stuffy chest feels unclogged now.

67
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,970
Don't you agree?

68
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,300
Bring it here.

69
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,130
Wait a minute.

70
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,120
It's not because I don't trust you, Madame.

71
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,240
What is that?

72
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,130
A wiretap detector.

73
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,550
The world is very rough these days.

74
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,610
You really don't let you guard down.

75
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,790
Isn't that the secret to surviving till the end?

76
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,930
It's done.

77
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,660
As promised, there's 20 bills.

78
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,080
As you're aware, if you succeed, you'll be getting an additional bonus of $3 million.

79
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,230
I'll finish the trial well.

80
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,810
What about using this chance to join the campaign?

81
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,110
You need to reclaim your seat at the table.

82
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,960
Goodness, I'll decline.

83
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,450
As I've aged,

84
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,720
power and fame have all disappeared.

85
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,910
But one thing,

86
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:45,270
this rascal right here. I just can't stop this.

87
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,690
Everyone has their own place in this world.

88
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,720
I'll support you from behind,

89
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,900
so from now on, please take good care of me.

90
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,580
How humble.

91
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,870

92
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,810

93
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,040

94
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,010

95
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,760
 Who said you could request a warrant?

96
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,110
Don't you know how sensitive a time this is? Do you want to screw up all of your superiors?

97
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,030
Why do we have to be cautious?

98
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,480
- Is the presidential candidate some sacred ground? 
 - What did you say, you bastard?!

99
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,490
A secretary who worked under him was murdered.

100
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,300
Baek Seon and President Nam who wrote the slush fund ledger were also murdered.

101
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,510
There is also a woman who was framed and is now sitting in jail.

102
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,580
Yet I still can't touch him? Why?!

103
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,540
Exactly how much more rotten must the situation become

104
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,120
for us to investigate?

105
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,780
Do you have evidence that Kim Seong Jin

106
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,690
is connected to this incident? Do you have a witness or evidence?

107
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,810
That's why I said I'll get to the bottom of this.

108
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,970
This bastard. Who do you think you're talking back to?!

109
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,080
- Sir? 
 - What?!

110
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,530
Prosecutor General is asking for you.

111
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,070
Don't even think about proceeding with the investigation on your own. I won't ever approve.

112
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,490
Move!

113
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,120
Really, that weasel-like bastard!

114
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,320
Goodness, are you hurting somewhere? Huh?

115
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:11,120
You don't look so good. Maybe you didn't get a good night's sleep?

116
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,620
This bastard, how did you get in here?

117
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,000
Ah, well this is nothing.

118
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,570
Goodness, I'm so sorry,

119
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,810
but I heard what you two were talking about.

120
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:30,240
You're going to attack Kim Seong Jin directly? Aren't you going overboard?

121
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,970
Hey, don't rub salt on my wounds. Just leave.

122
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,870
I don't have the leisure to deal with you too.

123
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,420
But there was nothing wrong in what he said.

124
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,890
Give it a rest— Don't sit on the glass, it's going to break!

125
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,320

126
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,990
I'm not putting you down or anything, but I think you're going in the wrong direction.

127
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,150
Why would the prosecutor's office want to downplay this incident? Because Kim Seong Jin is a political figure?

128
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,230
- Jin Yong Joon? 
 - Yeah.

129
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,980
Aren't you glad to see him after such a long time?

130
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,850
 With this, I'll finish reporting the results of the middle investigation

131
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,250
 of Choi Hyeon Gi's corruption case .

132
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,930
  Once again, I apologize in the prosecutor's office stead.

133
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,770
  What? You didn't leave yet?

134
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,850
  Must you really go this far?

135
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,430
  Wow, our Pro Jang must find this really unfair.

136
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,460
  But you shouldn't resent us.

137
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,960
  You should resent yourself for siding with the wrong team.

138
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,850
  Don't you think so?

139
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,350

140
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,360
The incumbent officers' corruption that is greater than the courtesy to the former officer.

141
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,680
That's the center of this case.

142
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,340
So this was all planned from the beginning? Even the trial?

143
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,680
Gaining trust would've been his first priority.

144
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,910
That's how people who want to report Kim Seong Jin come to him, like the deceased female secretary.

145
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,910
Those bastards are doing all sorts of things.

146
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,320
Wow, that bastard is the worst.

147
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,420
He looks innocent, like a next-door ahjussi.

148
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,990
Even in the prosecutor's office, he lived off of media play. Crafting his own image would've been nothing.

149
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,880
You know what kind of show he put on when he quit, don't you?

150
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,950
 Of course, I know. He publicly revealed his intent to quit after stating that he opposed the reform in the prosecutor's office.

151
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,020
 The real reason was to monopolize the special treatment of the retired prosecutor general.

152
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,120
 If he retired at his regular time, there would've been a lot of competition among his colleagues who retired at the same time.

153
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,110
 But it's quite strange. A retired lawyer who used to make millions every year

154
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,120
 suddenly has earned much less in the last three years. Why?

155
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,200
 Because of no more special treatment for him?  Or maybe he started earning money he can't report?

156
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,120
- Secret defenses? 
 - Yeah.

157
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,980
Using his connections, he buys a prosecutor or a judge in charge of a case.

158
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,750
Of course, for clients, they would be so happy because they wouldn't be indicted or even go to trial.

159
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,210
Naturally, sensitive cases would've gravitated towards him.

160
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,080
The amount he's made through this for the past three years is about...

161
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,900
- Fifty million (dollars)?! 
 - Fifty million?

162
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,600
 Fi-Fifty million?!

163
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,890
 With legal fees of $2 million and success bonuses of $3 million per case,

164
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,220
 he would've garnered at least $5 million per case, of course, all in cash.

165
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,520
W-Wait a minute! He makes $5 million per case without a single trial? Does that even make sense?

166
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,320
Don't you think you're wrong this time?

167
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,210
You think so, right?

168
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,320
By spending $5 million, if you can bring $50 million or $500 million, who would benefit?

169
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,350
 Sixty studio apartments under borrowed-names, 1300 acres of land that will soon become populated areas.

170
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,990
 Eight million dollar building in Handam-dong.

171
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,120
 A seven million dollar building in Mundang, and even stocks that he received as a success bonus fee.

172
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,470
 - Do the calculations work out? They don't.
 - Wait, you're too fast!

173
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,970
 Can an ordinary lawyer who makes money in a normal way accumulate this many assets?

174
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,120
 And do you think Jin Yong Joon was the only one who accepted the cash?

175
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,790
 Whenever he accepted important cases, he called and received calls from upper-level prosecutors several dozen times a day.

176
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,170
  That means there are at least a truckload of men who accepted the bribes.

177
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,050
  Is it possible to conduct a proper investigation among these men?

178
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,680
 This isn't a case that began over a politician's greed.

179
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,160
 It's a fight against the law, one in where the entire prosecutor's office accepted bribes.

180
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,730
 Unless we end this evil cycle, we'll never be able to catch the mastermind.

181
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,740
So it's rotten to the core.

182
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,110
How will we start?

183
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,250
Since everything began with money, it needs to end with money,

184
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,800
so they can't come back to life anymore.

185
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,210
But if it's like you said, his stocks and real estate are tied down. How are we going to take that?

186
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,610
 Receiving or promising to receive money, valuables or other benefits under the pretext of providing them to or associating them with judges, prosecutors or other public officials of trial and investigative agencies;

187
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,280
 Violation of Attorney-at-law act article 110 (1)!

188
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,910
 Expressly including in attorney fees and fees contingent on success, the expenses under the pretext of offering them to or associating with the public officials.  Violation of Attorney-at-law act article 110 (2)!

189
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,820
 If we can just find that evidence, we can seize all of the assets he obtained illegally.

190
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,880
 And as for the rest, we can request an additional fine.

191
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,500
Such a nice law existed?

192
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,690
We can just use this chance to raid them all.

193
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,480
Throw away those cheap thoughts.

194
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,580
At the very least, he would've accepted $2 million for a fee from Yoo Yeon Ja over the recent case.

195
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,340
Looking at the time frame, there would also be cash that he didn't launder yet.

196
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,090
That cash,

197
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,910
let's take it.

198
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,850
 You just have to follow this.

199
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,600
 We'll take care of the rest.

200
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,810
 Now, I'll take it that you understand. I'll leave now.

201
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,440
 Wait, wait, wait a minute! Wait.

202
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,250
 Why did you prepare this?

203
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,030
 Why is it Jin Yong Joon out of all people?

204
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,410
 Because it makes good money.

205
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,160
- Okay, understood! 
 - Will you be okay?

206
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,410
- Yeah, of course. 
 - What about you?

207
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,390
Of course, I'm in.

208
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,090
- What about you? 
 - Easy as pie, I'm in!

209
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,650
Okay! Byeong Min, move with me. You two, as planned. Okay?

210
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,510
- Okay! 
 - Then let's start! Move out!

211
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,670
Okay! Okay! Okay, okay...

212
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:03,200
♫   Choose something, make sure that's your choice   ♫

213
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,540
♫   I'm the one who gave you the key   ♫

214
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,600
Good luck!

215
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,820
♫   Turn all the tables. You're getting sucked in   ♫

216
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,220
♫   You keep getting tricked over and over again   ♫

217
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:26,400
♫   The perfect moment when betting's over, you're done for, game's over   ♫

218
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,910
♫   Try finding the real reason   ♫

219
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,950
- Where are you going?
 - Covering some of the opposition party primary election campaign.

220
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,260
- Forget it. Why would you go to such a place? 
 - I feel as if we've only interviewed the ruling party—

221
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,570
You're talking nonsense again.

222
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,500
Hey, the Mi Chang Party will win this time again, anyway.

223
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,610
We just have to say that we support Kim Seong Jin. That's how

224
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:59,120
we'll at least get some of this. This rascal, you don't know anything about the world.

225
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,780
Ugh, you rascal!

226
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,010
I understand, sir.

227
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,080
Yes, this is Reporter Shin Yong Gyun.

228
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,520
- A report? 
 - Yes.

229
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,400
There are some people gathering illegal campaign funds.

230
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,190
Yes, the recipient is Kim Seong Jin but the one dealing the funds is Yoo Yeon Ja.

231
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,640
Yes, the people we know.

232
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,340
By the way, add in that he covered up the incident and sexually assaulted a woman.

233
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,030
Look here. Is the presidential candidate some neighborhood drum?

234
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,850
If you keep spreading lies and defamation, you'll spend some time in prison.

235
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,020
Get a grip, alright?

236
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,200
Everyone's trying to drag him down.

237
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,100
  If you don't publish the story, it'll become difficult for you.

238
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,070
What is this bastard saying?

239
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,120
This isn't working. What should we do? Should we make him nervous?

240
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,150
- I'd love that. 
 - Okay.

241
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,830
Oh, a tip, a tip!

242
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,650
What is this?

243
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,720
  You have a nice behind.

244
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,320
  Aren't you curious about what the front looks like?

245
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,350
  We should all look at nice things together.

246
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,160
Stop, don't...

247
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,750
Don't take it, don't look at it. No one look at it!

248
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,040

249
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,820
- It's delicious!
 - Yeah.

250
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,550
Why are you doing this to me?

251
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,330
Did my wife order you to do this?

252
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,940
Are you private detectives? You are, aren't you?

253
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,400
You're viewing us too indecently.

254
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,820
We're informants, pure—

255
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,970
Why would informants—

256
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,280
take other people's pictures? For what reason?

257
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,910
I just took the pictures as I was passing because you two looked like such a nice couple!

258
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,150
So why did you meet her one-on-one?

259
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,080
Eat up before it cools.

260
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,600
Have some, it's delicious.

261
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,160
I like your hair. Did you get it done in Gangnam?

262
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,220
It's not bad.

263
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,020
Are you joking with me right now?

264
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,910
Are you joking?

265
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,940
Joking?

266
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,380
Seriously. Did you just say we were joking around?

267
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,020
Let's go, come on. We can just go to his wife.

268
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,830
Ah, why? Sit down, sit down.

269
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,370
Eat your meal, sit down.

270
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,420
- Should we? 
 - Yeah.

271
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,000
Come on, sit down.

272
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,960
Then...

273
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,660
What is it you want?

274
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,870
You should've been like this sooner.

275
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,770
Release an article. I'll provide the narrative.

276
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,740
On the front page of the newspaper, a special is better than an infidelity article.

277
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,000
With beautiful sentences.

278
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,490
Let's keep in touch. Let's go.

279
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,510
I'll take this.

280
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,600
- My ID— 
 - Ahjumma, can I have the leftovers to-go?

281
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,920
- Ahjussi, take care of the bill. We'll provide the narrative, alright? 
 - The bill?

282
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,310
Are you sure this is the place?

283
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,690
Yes, I'm sure he said it was somewhere near here.

284
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,340
No matter how much we wander around, I don't think there's a place that sells drugs here. What did Byeong Min say?

285
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:23,080
He said Internet phone calls are made through a disposable phone so their location can't be tracked.

286
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,970
And their IP address is set in the Philippines.

287
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,930
Then, what should we do?

288
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,330

289
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,130
Hey, Ah Ryeong? Where are you going?

290
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,090
Hmm, not sure...

291
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,470
Someplace suspicious?

292
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,980
You know, places that are strangely strict on security,

293
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,050
or places unknown people keep entering and leaving,

294
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,620
or places where residents changed the door locks as soon as they moved in.

295
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:55,980
Ah, I think there are some people like that who recently came into our neighborhood.

296
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,800
You are detectives, right?

297
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,070
What? Uh... Um.

298
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,450
Of course. Do you know how many years of experience I have as a homicide detective?

299
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,750
Don't I just look like a detective?

300
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,750
Hey, I think we have a delivery.

301
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,770
Just a minute!

302
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,620
What's with you two?

303
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,090
Are you the police?

304
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,800
I guess you do look like a detective.

305
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,340
Really?

306
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,030
Aish.

307
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,540
Kneel, Curly-Hair.

308
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,830
Is that natural?

309
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,370
Yes.

310
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,780

311
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,980
Your ledger is quite full.

312
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,780
You must've become quite rich after selling these.

313
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,080
We're only mediators.

314
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,550
Still, we should be the fastest on circulation.

315
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,170
Is that something to brag about?

316
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,580
No, I'm sorry.

317
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,130
I've seen you somewhere before.

318
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,430
No, no, no.

319
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,730
This isn't our first time meeting, is it?

320
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,050
No.

321
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,320
Aish.

322
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,820
Let's live modestly.

323
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,940
I don't like beating people up.

324
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,330
Have you seen this woman recently?

325
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,580
I don't think she's one of our customers.

326
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,520
Ah! It is this woman. She came here recently.

327
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,090
- Who? 
 - You know, the woman who was in the parking lot before.

328
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,410
- The one who ordered the men in suits! 
 - Ah!

329
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,010
- That rude b*tch with the sunglasses? 
 - Yes!

330
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,510
- Are you sure about that?
 - Aigoo, of course!

331
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,490
I have a knack for memorizing people's faces.

332
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,440
Then I guess she would've been caught on the parking lot's CCTV.

333
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,680
There's a high possibility.

334
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,960
- Then let's tell the prosecutors exactly what you just told me. 
 - What?!

335
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
- Let's go, come on! 
 - What are you talking about?

336
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,610
- You said that you would let us go! 
 - A promise is a promise!

337
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,060
Man, your hair is nice to grip! Let's go!

338
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,660
Come on!

339
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:18,580
The narrative is nice but because the target is Kim Seong Jin.

340
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,940
Right?

341
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,250
Even if it is just a rumor, this is perfect to end up sued for defamation.

342
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,930
On top of that, the source is a rookie.

343
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,530
It depends on what kind of rookie he is, right?

344
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,330
If you don't trust me, just forget it.

345
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,820
- How did it go? 
 - There's no way I would fail.

346
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,740
Ugh, this lie has become way too big now.

347
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,680
This is the office for circulation. As soon as the original article is published, circulate it everywhere.

348
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,210
Don't worry, I've manipulated the media countless times before—

349
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,500
I mean,

350
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,110
I've manipulated girl group song rankings and such before. In the past, I was...

351
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:24,050
It's real. I raised all girl groups who ranked first or second.

352
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,290
Okay. I believe you.

353
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,600
Okay... Ha Ri, be careful!

354
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,760
Hurry up, Ha Ri.

355
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,780

356
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,600

357
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,740

358
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,980

359
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,750
Well, sending them all over.

360
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,290

361
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,420
  I really liked him...

362
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,800

363
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,090

364
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,970
Our Madame Yoo, you're making your own coffee.

365
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,690
I just can't stop you.

366
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,700
You're just so humble and hardworking.

367
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,120
It's nothing difficult.

368
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,720
We're going to eat. Come join us!

369
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,760
Where?

370
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,190
At the cafeteria nearby.

371
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,680
Oh, but I'm not feeling too well, next time.

372
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,060
Okay then.

373
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,500
- Let's go.
 - Yeah, let's go.

374
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,400
Did you take the pictures?

375
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,860
Yes.

376
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,900
Upload the nice ones and manage the comments.

377
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,370
Bring my lunch to the car.

378
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,660

379
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,580
M-Madam!

380
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,010
What is it now that you're making a fuss?!

381
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,030
I think you need to see this.

382
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,300

383
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,040
Welcome, Reporter Shin!

384
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,510
Wow, you look amazing!

385
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,820
Goodness, it's nothing.

386
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,070
- Come sit down. 
 - Thank you.

387
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,180
Goodness,

388
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,340
you're in such a rundown place.

389
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,120
This is why it's not good to become a civil rights lawyer.

390
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,650
You used to be a top prosecutor at the prosecutor's office, but what is this?!

391
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,980
As long as your heart is big, you're considered rich in everything.

392
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,790
- Have a seat. 
 - Okay, thank you.

393
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,080
Goodness, ugh.

394
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,520
Ugh...

395
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,930
My skin is very dry.

396
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:41,570
I should've invited you sooner but I was only able to speak with you on the phone with the excuse that I was busy.

397
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,450
No, don't mention it. Everyone in the country knows you're busy.

398
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,300
I enjoy your show whenever I have time.

399
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:52,080
You're embarrassing me.

400
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,960
By the way, what brings you all the way here?

401
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,240
Um, I just wanted to ask you something.

402
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,940
Did you see the article I uploaded?

403
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,210
I didn't have a chance to look at it yet.

404
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:12,520
Ah, it's possible since you're just so busy.

405
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,410
It's nothing else, it's just

406
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:20,460
that as a special, I investigated Kim Seong Jin for gathering illegal campaign funds.

407
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,840
What? I mean, i-illegal funds?

408
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,910
Yes, but why do you look so surprised? This isn't the first time politicians have been investigated for corruption.

409
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,770
Because this is such a sensitive time period for him...

410
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,840
He's trending right now, isn't he—

411
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,310
Aigoo. Trending or whatever, the tables are about to be turned.

412
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,710
I looked into it and discovered that his wife

413
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,740
accepted a truckload of money from various sources.

414
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,590
Is that true?

415
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:52,140
Of course, my source was from the prosecutor's office.

416
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,270
They've probably begun investigating by now.

417
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,120
But

418
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,020
why are you telling me that?

419
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,750
I know this sounds ridiculous,

420
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,170
but the prosecutors keep tying your name to this case.

421
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:19,050
- Me? 
 - They said that you took on secret cases. Does that even make sense?!

422
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:23,590
Who would say such a thing?

423
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:28,490
He's a prosecutor in Seoul Central's Prosecutor's Office. There's a prosecutor with a terrible temper, Prosecutor Jang In Gyu.

424
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,240
Whenever I think about him, I just— Wait a minute.

425
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,120
You probably know him well, don't you? Didn't you two work together when you were a prosecutor?

426
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,620
I wonder why he would have said such a thing?

427
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:48,180
That's what I'm saying! To someone who's living such a difficult life, how could he have dared to accuse you of such a thing?!

428
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,410
Frankly speaking, if you had accepted tens of millions of dollars in fees,

429
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,430
you wouldn't be living in such a rundown place. You'd be living in a penthouse suite that overlooks the Han River, right?

430
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,910
I came because I was so frustrated!

431
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:01,220
Ugh! Ugh.

432
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:07,000
Goodness, it's just so groundless that I don't know how to respond.

433
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,380
I know, right?

434
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,840
I don't know which bastard, but they should catch him—

435
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,270
Take the call, it seems urgent.

436
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,670
Please excuse me for a moment.

437
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,320
Of course.

438
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,290
Yes, Madame.

439
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:34,320
What are you doing right now? Exactly how did you do things that such articles are circulating?!

440
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,790
If the approval ratings fall, are you going to take responsibility?!

441
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,140
I think there's been a misunderstanding. Yes.

442
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,160
I'll call you again soon.

443
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,500
I think I came at the wrong time. I should leave first, it seems I've taken up your busy time.

444
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,460
No, no, no! You traveled such a long way for me.

445
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,350
We can talk more. I have time, have a seat.

446
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,060
I didn't travel that far...

447
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:03,790
What did Prosecutor Jang say about me?

448
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,700
Where is Jang In Gyu? Where is he?

449
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,280
- First, take care of Cho's case.  Don't mix with the other case.
 - Yes.

450
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,410
Oh? You didn't go golfing? What are you doing in the office at this hour?

451
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:24,130
You bastard! I told you not to mess with Kim Seong Jin, didn't I? Are you ignoring me right now?

452
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:28,690
Me? No, I was just investigating some drug dealers.

453
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,180
Sit straight!

454
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,990
Then why did I hear that you messed with Kim Seong Jin's wife, huh?!

455
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,840
I did? I messed with Kim Seong Jin's wife?

456
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,480
Goodness. If someone heard, they'd think that I sexually assaulted her or something.

457
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,350
You told me not to mess with Kim Seong Jin.

458
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,740
- You didn't say anything about investigating his wife. 
 - What?

459
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:52,590
It's quite strange. I just heard this from those two bastards over there,

460
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,840
so how could you have already known about that?

461
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,890
By any chance, do you receive calls from someone?

462
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,030
Hey, Prosecutor Kang!

463
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,950
Sunbaenim!

464
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,220
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes, sir.

465
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:23,180
Wow, nothing has changed about this place since I was here.

466
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,390
Pro Jang, it's been a while.

467
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,020
I know.

468
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,810
It's been a while.

469
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:43,620
There are rumors that you're targeting Assemblyman Kim Seong Jin for your next case.

470
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,390
Wow, rumors travel fast

471
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,180
seeing that someone outside of the prosecutor's office knows about it too.

472
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,470
Is it the suggestion of the opposing party?

473
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:54,070
Why are you curious about that?

474
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,920
I'm just worried, as your senior.

475
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,150
Come on, I'm sure you're just looking out for you.

476
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,870
You're not someone who would worry about your junior.

477
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,490
Look here, Pro Jang. Everything's great about you. It's just

478
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:15,010
that since long ago, you've had a habit of spending your energy on useless things.

479
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,390
Since you're in the special investigation department, you should look forward to entering in the head prosecution office.

480
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,600
Until when will you crawl around in a place like this?

481
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,260
Ah, does that mean

482
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,820
that I should get on the winning team?

483
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,100
Since we're at it, it would be best if it was the gold team.

484
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,960
A gold team would be nice. The words you told me 15 years ago,

485
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,460
I've thought about those words countless times.

486
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,020
Why am I the only one that has to crawl?

487
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,780
When all of my comrades are rising in rank and being promoted, why do I have to stay in the countryside and work my ass off?

488
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:56,950
But no matter how much I thought about it, I didn't resent myself.

489
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:02,750
The more I thought, those bastards who get on that damned team to push and pull for each other,

490
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,990
those bastards who look after each other's backs while giving and receiving bribes,

491
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,370
I would only feel refreshed after throwing all of those damned bastards in jail.

492
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,540
- Only those thoughts came to mind. 
 - Wow,

493
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,750
you're still the same. You're still so stuffy.

494
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,120
Didn't you know? People don't change easily.

495
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:30,540
So while you're targeting Kim Seong Jin, you'll drag me along too?

496
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,820
While spreading lies to the media?

497
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:38,380
What's wrong with you? Spreading lies is your specialty, senior.

498
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,820

499
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,780
It's a copy. You can take a look, rip it up or steam it to eat, it's up to you.

500
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,070
The tens of millions dollars of legal fees you've collected through secret trials,

501
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:56,160
the real estates that you contracted under borrowed names,

502
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,720
the phone call histories between you and upper prosecution officers whenever the investigation starts.

503
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,190
With that much, don't you think it's too much to be called "lies"?

504
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,260
Wow, you did a lot of digging.

505
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,970
But you know,

506
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,270
do you think any of this can be passed as evidence?

507
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:20,780
Whether it will or won't, I'm sure it'll be decided in court.

508
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:26,080
I think you've mistaken something.

509
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,470
The court

510
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,610
can only debate the truth based on the charges brought forth.

511
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:39,090
Do you think you'll be able to indict me?

512
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,180
Senior, you've brought many people in front of the court, right?

513
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,090
Just watch who'll be in front this time.

514
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,960
You can look forward to it.

515
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,520
Wow, he must be really angry.

516
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,210
His face looks fierce, doesn't it?

517
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,150
That bastard should have a couple of foreign cars too.

518
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,510
Damn it.

519
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,770
Let's go. He's quick to catch on so be careful.

520
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,870
Hey, how long are you planning to wear that wig? It suits you though.

521
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,080
Wow! Jang In Gyu!

522
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,630
How long has it been?

523
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,270
You never once visited our reunions!

524
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:46,090
Please understand. If a prosecutor and a lawyer were to be seen together, it would cause misunderstandings.

525
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:50,850
Goodness, you were always a stickler for the rules. I know, I know.

526
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,030
Let's order something.

527
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,990
Excuse me, we're ready to order.

528
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,270
It's self-order, please come to the counter.

529
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,850
- Ah, this was self-order? I'll be back. 
 - Wait a minute, later.

530
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:03,320
- Sit down. 
 - Have you been well?

531
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,950
Don't even talk about it. I may be freer but the prosecutor's office is 100x better.

532
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,190
At least you're not looked down upon everywhere you go.

533
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,530
It's the same for us too, we're always being broken.

534
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:16,290
I guess. What is it that you wanted to talk about?

535
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,460
I have a favor to ask you.

536
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,550
A favor? You?!

537
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,600
I need to get Jin Yong Joon.

538
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,890
Byeong Min, is the wiretapping device ready?

539
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,490
- You used the bathroom before, right? 
 - Aish! 
 - You always leave at a critical time.

540
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,710
Let's go.

541
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,310
Hey, hey, hey! If something happens, send us the sign immediately.

542
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,400
Okay.

543
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,660
I wore a diaper!

544
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,920
I think long hair will suit you.

545
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,080
You look a lot gentler.

546
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,300
Aigoo, so cute.

547
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,720
Okay! In the end, this turned out well.

548
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,500
Because of him, lawyers who were once prosecutors are all out of a job.

549
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,460
You might not know this but there'll be plenty of people willing to help you out.

550
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,490
Thank you, please take care of this for me.

551
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,050
I'm sure the investigation has already begun. What are you most curious about?

552
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:48,590
Look into some brokers for me. Search for the people who give him the cases.

553
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:52,150
If we ask around, it'll be possible.

554
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,090
But can you really indict him?

555
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,530
There's no way the bastards who accepted Jin Yong Joon's bribes will keep quiet.

556
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:03,900
The trial department,  judges department, special investigation department, and general prosecutor are all going to stick to their positions.

557
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,040
Don't you think it's too much to do on your own?

558
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,200
That's why I'm going to borrow some of it.

559
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,270
That power.

560
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,870
Aigoo! Who do we have here?

561
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,040
Isn't this the soon-to-be prosecutor general?

562
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,610
I'm still just a chief prosecutor.

563
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,510
Now, relay your greetings. This is our team's most prominent senior.

564
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,980
Hello! Sunbaenim!

565
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,280
It's an honor to meet you.

566
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,400
What honor? I'm just a toothless lawyer.

567
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,230
Goodness, you're still going strong. How could you say such a thing?

568
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,760
I should've contacted you first.

569
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,540
I'm always indebted towards you.

570
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,720
Hold on.

571
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,870
You. It's the first time I'm seeing you.

572
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,450
Pardon?

573
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,390
What's wrong, Sunbaenim?

574
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,280
Take off the glasses.

575
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,590
The glasses? Why?

576
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,290
You won't take them off?

577
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,940
President Kim! President Kim!

578
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,790
Yes, you called?

579
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:30,500
Who is she? I told you not to let newbies into my room, didn't I?

580
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,710
Ah, she used to work here before.

581
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,840
She took a break for a while to attend school so I guess there was a misunderstanding.

582
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,130
Really?

583
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:48,550
What to do? Student, I'm sorry.

584
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,530
No problem.

585
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,660
As I age, my suspicions grow.

586
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,200
Aigoo, Seonbae...

587
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,010
Watch and learn.

588
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,020
He's so meticulous.

589
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,870
Let's have a drink.

590
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,770
 Good work.

591
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:13,280
I thought I was going to have a heart attack.

592
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,730
- You'll be blessed. 
 - Thank you.

593
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,660
She's coming.

594
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,000
Good job.

595
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,480
Hey, Ah Ryeong, how did it go?

596
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,010
It was so tense! If we hadn't bought the president, we would've been caught.

597
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,750
I told you, didn't I? He's quick.

598
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,230
He's so sly.

599
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:52,200
His expression changed in an instant and it gave me chills!

600
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,790
Hey, how did you know Jin Yong Joon would be suspicious?

601
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,350
We have some history together.

602
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:00,440
Did you hit on him?

603
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:03,200
- I don't know. 
 - You hit on men too?

604
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,150
Are you having fun?

605
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,000
Is that why you keep holding hands with me and trying to touch me?

606
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,450
You're not my style.

607
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:10,720
- I don't like you either! 
 - You're not his style.

608
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,170
Let's go.

609
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,780
Right, right.

610
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,420
Yes?

611
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,140
I'm eating with a senior of mine.

612
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,750
What?

613
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,900
A warrant was issued?

614
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,950
What are you talking about? A warrant?

615
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:41,190
A warrant has been issued for the madame.

616
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,680
What?

617
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:46,090
And one's been issued for you too, Sunbae.

618
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:00,570
Hey, Jang In Gyu!

619
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,930
What do you think you're doing?

620
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:06,210
Who do you think you are to humiliate someone and create this mess?!

621
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,350
I gave him the order.

622
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,950
Is there a problem?

623
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,650
Did you two plan this?

624
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,610
  This is all because of your support, Sunbae.

625
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:29,040
  Assemblyman Kim is also thankful for many reasons.

626
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,700
 Thanks to you, the prosecutor general also supports me well.

627
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:39,900
I too know that illegally obtained evidence cannot be used in court,

628
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,440
but if I were to release this to the reporters,

629
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,560
what would happen?

630
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,660
I think becoming prosecutor general would become difficult.

631
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,180
What's the reason you're getting involved?

632
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,140
I'll delete this recording.

633
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,440
In return, the investigation

634
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,640
will be led by him.

635
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,890
Ah!

636
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,290
It seems you've forgotten.

637
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,950
I was also a member of Choi Hyeon Gi's team.

638
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,500

639
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,980

640
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,480
  The person you are trying to reach is not available right now—

641
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,440
Yeah, Sister-in-law.

642
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,090
What happened to the money? Did you finish moving it?

643
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,280
Search thoroughly!

644
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:22,480
Aish! This bastard already caught on.

645
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,030
Search inside of there too.

646
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,190
Yes, Prosecutor.

647
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,990
Yes. The security cameras?

648
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,030
You want me to hand those over to them?

649
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,160
Hand them over?

650
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,480
They'll probably be faster than we are.

651
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,050
For now, let's leave it to them.

652
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:50,800
Yes and Section Chief, you should eat first. You can't be investigating while skipping meals.

653
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,110
Yes, and start searching other places first.

654
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,140
Yes. I understand.

655
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,130
Yes, take care. Yes.

656
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,940
Move out! Let's go.

657
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,840
Investigator Park, go get security footage from the security office.

658
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,430
Hurry up! Come on, move! Move out!

659
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,080
How's it going? Did you unlock it?

660
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,910
Yeah, I got it but this man has so many followers. He's like a celebrity.

661
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,730
Look at his follower count.

662
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:16,560
You jealous?

663
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,410
- No.
 - I think you are.

664
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:20,790
I'm not jealous, you pig.

665
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:22,550
It's okay. They'll write bad comments later.

666
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,700
I'll be the first one to write a bad comment.

667
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,050
But do you think it'll be okay if we just leave Jin Yong Joon alone?

668
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:30,090
He should be hiding right now because of his alibi.

669
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:33,610
He would've moved the money to a location that wouldn't bring suspicion.

670
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,740
Hold on. Byeong Min, hold on!

671
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,110
- Did you find something? 
 - What's with this woman?

672
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:50,560
She came in with a bag at 3:38 pm and left at 4:13 pm.

673
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,440
Because Chief Maeng barged in with a warrant at 4:30 pm...

674
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,790
You're right. It matches the time too.

675
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,980
- Hm... 
 - You're right. She's being cautious too.

676
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,660
Byeong Min, stop if for a moment. Let me see her face.

677
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,870
It's her, isn't it?

678
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:10,660
It's the same woman, right?

679
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,650
- Yeah, it is. 
 - What does she do?

680
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,650
Wait a minute.

681
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,910

682
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,880
- She's a professor. 
 - A professor?

683
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,620
A professor?

684
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,240

685
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,140
Yes, Brother-in-law.

686
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,660
I arrived.

687
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,400
Yes. Until things become quiet,

688
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,360
I'll keep it safe.

689
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,000
Yes.

690
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,420

691
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,300
Yes, is that so?

692
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,300
No, it's fine. Of course.

693
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,520
Alright, thank you.

694
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:08,380
What did they say?

695
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,700
According to a TA (teaching assistant), she came in at 5 pm but left right away saying her plane was at 7 pm.

696
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,520
Then she wouldn't have had time to visit other places.

697
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,440
Yeah, I guess so.

698
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,830
Then let's go find the money.

699
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,820
Let's go!

700
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:36,790
You want me to go to the prosecutor's office?

701
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,420
Are you being serious right now?

702
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,920
This is just to prepare for the worst.

703
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,230
If you just cooperate with the media, nothing will happen.

704
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:47,120
Why do I have to do that? Why should I?!

705
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,720
I shouldn't have trusted someone like you from the beginning.

706
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,100
You're not even worth the money I paid you! All you have is your damned mouth—

707
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,640
Hey!

708
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:08,510
Madame, just because I use honorifics and act subservient,

709
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:12,290
have you forgotten what I, I!

710
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:16,550
I used to do?

711
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,000
Should I use this chance

712
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,430
to turn the tables in the election? Huh?!

713
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:30,910
Since we've gotten on the same boat, let's not turn against each other

714
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:34,860
and go nicely. Alright, Madame?

715
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:55,030
Yes, why are you calling?

716
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,640
What?

717
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,170
Yeah, I understand.

718
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,200
Pro Jung, did you find it?

719
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:15,120
Yeah, his name is Uh Yong Seong. He's a broker that suddenly appeared a few years ago.

720
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,420
Yeah, I'll send you his picture and address through text.

721
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:23,420
He could catch on and run off so it'll be best to move with as few men as possible.

722
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,240
Thank you so much! Yeah,

723
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,240
I'll buy you a meal sometime. Thanks!

724
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:33,350
Excuse me, Paralegal Cheon, call Section Chief Maeng

725
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,420
- and tell him to come straight there. 
 - Yes, sir.

726
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,870
Do I look okay?

727
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,510
Just a moment, turn around.

728
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,470
- You don't have to be so meticulous— 
 - Where are you going in such a rush?

729
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,310
It's rude to call a busy person over and act like this.

730
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,050
  This is the broker.

731
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:07,050
  I'll send Section Chief Maeng soon, so get there first.

732
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,290
Stop the car for a minute.

733
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,500
What? Is something wrong?

734
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,600
I think he found the broker. You three take care of the money, I'll catch this bastard.

735
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,610
- What? 
 - Will you be okay?

736
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,010
Don't worry, Section Chief Maeng is coming too.

737
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,780
I'll see you all later.

738
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,530
Don't you think Oppa Ha Ri is acting strange?

739
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:34,470
Yeah, why would he decline money?

740
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,640
Is the broker a woman?

741
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,700
What the heck?

742
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,300
I'm just saying, that's a possibility—

743
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,520
- Okay, okay, that's possible. 
 - The way you think is seriously...

744
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,420
It's okay, that's possible.

745
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,480
Wow, how did my hoobae

746
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,680
think of such an admirable idea?

747
00:54:55,020 --> 00:55:00,500
It's nothing. Squandering bastards have to be kicked out.

748
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,450
We're all one family, aren't we?

749
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,120

750
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,030
Then I'll leave first.

751
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:13,440
Yeah, take care.

752
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,820
- I'll see you next time. 
 - Goodbye.

753
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,820
Instead of Prosecutor Jang, some strange man is here.

754
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,470
Yes, I'll send you a picture of him now.

755
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,990
Reporter Shin?

756
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,230
Why would this bastard...

757
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,260
Wow!

758
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:29,240
  Goodness, you look as if you've had no troubles.

759
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:35,560
  Every time I see our Lawyer Jin, he seems to have gotten younger.

760
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:40,100
 You look exactly the same as 15 years ago.

761
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,760
  - It's true that he looks young for his age. 
 - Come on!

762
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,220
  You flatter me!

763
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:57,070
  Well, I didn't suffer much.

764
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:01,030
  Our Chairman Cheon here did all of the work.

765
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:02,210
  Of course.

766
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:06,610
  Chairman Cheon here is the only one who spent time in jail.

767
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:08,000
  It was nothing.

768
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,790
  I just did whatever that person told me to do.

769
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:16,990
  Thanks to that, I'm able to have a meal here with you elders.

770
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,090
  That man...

771
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,330
 That man?

772
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,080
  Yes, I reported it. Please come inside.

773
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,160
  Get him!

774
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:45,150
  Catch that bastard! Catch him!

775
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,760
Wow, this bastard... It's you again?

776
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:01,970
This relentless bastard.

777
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,500
You have guts.  I thought you would run away.

778
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:45,600
I guess you came for this, huh?

779
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,890
Goodness, you're quick too.

780
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,360
This is fun.

781
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,910
Catch him so he can't leave!

782
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,140
♫ If you lose your everything  ♫

783
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:38,770
♫   Think you can't go back to the time   ♫

784
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:43,350
No, I'm not the one that's trapped.

785
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:47,200
♫   In the end, I'm gonna be with you   ♫

786

♫   When you just walk without thinking   ♫

787
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,540

788
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,230

01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,200
♫   There's no wrong no right   ♫

792
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,300
♫   The road I take and the place I want to go   ♫

793
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,550
♫   as I wander between the ambiguous boundary   ♫

794
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:06,080
♫   I don't need anything else, I just wanna fly one day. This is one way   ♫

795
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,470
 Can you take responsibility for this?

796
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:09,500
  I found it!

797
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,540
  You really stuffed yourself! I hope your stomach bursts, you greedy bastard!

798
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:17,300
 Search, seize, and investigate that bastard Prosecutor Jang's office too.

799
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:21,000
 Let's finish it in one go. All of them, even the ones that were hidden all this time.

800
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,440
  You bastard, where are you right now?!

801
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,810
  Where are you, you bastard?!

802
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,970
  Was it you? "The Man"?

803
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,400
 See you soon.

804
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,300
 I knew this kind of thing would happen to him someday.

805
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,310
 Everyone will soon find out

806
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:34,630
 what kind of jerk you are.
