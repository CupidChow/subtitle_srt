1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,220

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,790

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,240

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,270

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,090

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,850

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,790

8
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,120

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,870

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,600
Wow! CEO Choo!

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,100
How long has it been?

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,620
We meet in a place like this.

13
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,420
And you brought someone with you too.

14
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,830
Get them!

15
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,050
Choo has currently not used any phones or credit cards

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,060
that are registered under his name

17
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,560
which will make it difficult to track him down.

18
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,580
Wh-What? Where are you going?

19
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,730
We have to save Ha Ri.

20
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,020
Hey, hey, hey! Get him! Get that bastard!

21
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,710
Stop right there!

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
Hey! Stop there!

23
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,390
- Stay there!
 - Aish!

24
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,470
Hey!

25
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,400
Get Choo Won Gi!

26
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,870
Hurry!

27
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,590
What? Damn it.

28
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,510
Who is this bastard?

29
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,280
Chairman Cheon.

30
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,060
You bastard!

31
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,410
How dare you...

32
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,160
Get in, hurry.

33
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,960
Ugh, snap out of it! Get in, hurry!

34
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,880
- Hey you!
 - Hey, stop there!

35
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,330
- Stop there! 
 - Stop!

36
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,170
Stop!

37
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,420
- Hey!
 - Stop!

38
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,610
Hey jerk, come here.

39
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,530
Aish! You!

40
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,640
Get up!

41
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,990
Stop!

42
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,220
- What the...
 - Come here!

43
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,150
Who sent you guys?!

44
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,020
Who?

45
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,980
Who sent you guys?!

46
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,800
Run!

47
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,930
Wait!

48
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,930
That way!

49
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,800
Look for him over there!

50
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,550
Who are you?

51
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,970
Are you working with Chairman Cheon?

52
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,500
What?

53
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,930
Your words are too cruel!

54
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,980
If I were working with him, would I go through all this trouble?

55
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,590
Then how did those bastards know to follow me?

56
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,810
How should I know? They must've tailed you.

57
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,230
Ugh, seriously!

58
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,290
You're...

59
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,790
not Park Choon Jae, are you?

60
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,310
Ah, this man, I've been patient enough.

61
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,270
If it hadn't been for me, you would've been taken by them. Do you know that?

62
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,860
Forget it. Just forget it.

63
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,280
I should've known from the rumors.

64
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,980
What? Rumors?

65
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,080
Everyone says so, that there are countless people who are looking to catch you.

66
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,280
If I knew you were involved with Chairman Cheon, I wouldn't have gotten myself into this mess.

67
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,580
Look for someone else, okay?

68
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,720
Although there won't be anyone who'd listen to your request.

69
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
No, wait!

70
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,150
Okay. I'll take back what I just said.

71
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,210
I'll do as I promised.

72
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,470
I'll trust you and go with you.

73
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,670
Really?

74
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,500
Let's do it that way.

75
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,050
I really don't like this at all.

76
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,260
I don't like myself. I'm too kind-hearted.

77
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,490
Just sit there quietly until my guys come.

78
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,060
I think the opposition members directly spoke to the public prosecutor general.

79
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,240
They want to expose the corruption scandals, incriminating the Mi Chang Party before the elections.

80
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,650
He's the one who ran away with 180 million dollars of the citizesns' tax money.

81
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,470
It will attract public attention.

82
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,120
Still, if you ordered an open search like this—

83
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,550
Someone will probably move, aiming for Choo Won Gi.

84
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,060
But there was no way for me to stop it.

85
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,380
I don't even know who the informant is.

86
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,350
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,420

88
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,430
Answer it if it's an urgent call.

89
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,360
No, it's not. I'll listen to you.

90
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,910
Ah, this guy, what's he doing?

91
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,120
Yeah, Ah Ryeong.

92
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,670
Yeah.

93
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,410
Yes, we're here together.

94
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,510
Yeah.

95
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,350
Yes.

96
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,830
Yes, if you tell me the location, I'll head right—

97
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,370

98
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,290
Oppa...

99
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,630

100
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,140
What?

101
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,100
Are you sure?

102
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,600
Okay, I got it.

103
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,980
 In order to arrest investment scammer Choo Won Gi who entered the country early yesterday morning,

104
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,030
 the prosecution established a joint investigation team with the police.

105
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,600
 This shows their strong will that they'll catch Choo who has been on the run for 15 years...

106
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,140
 Keep one thing in mind.

107
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,960
 Never mention this to anyone except your team members!

108
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,070
 I mean, don't ruin this project by talking about it with someone you think you trust.

109
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,310
 You know very well how you feel when you get betrayed by a person you trust the most.

110
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,420
Since things happened this way, it'll be alright if we catch him first.

111
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,740
Even if it means putting out all the manpower we have, we have to be first.

112
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,310
Anyway, all we need to do is to find out who killed Choi Hyeon Gi, isn't it?

113
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,620
That's why, In Gyu, you should also...

114
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,660
Choo Won Gi's location has been found.

115
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,360
Okay.

116
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,290
I'll get going first.

117
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,570
The police are outside.

118
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,390
- Turn your phone off quickly. I said turn your phone off.
 - Huh?

119
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,380
I think they tracked our location.

120
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,060
Aish.

121
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,720
The people who were with Choo Won Gi, find out who they are. Quickly!

122
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,160
Yes.

123
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,100

124
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,390
Aish...

125
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,650
- What is going on?
 - They're not here.

126
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,030
Chief, it looks like these guys turned their phones off

127
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,420
You guys go to the roof.

128
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,880
And you guys search around the building thoroughly.

129
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,760
- Yes! 
 - Ah. Aish.

130
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,010
Hey!

131
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,120
They're over there!

132
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,110
Ah.

133
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,120
Quickly!

134
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,920
Hurry up and get in!

135
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,340
- Catch them quickly!
 - Ah, really!

136
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,050
Deputy Chief, I got something on the CCTV.

137
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,660
Good. When the license plate number is confirmed, give out the search order and send out for help from the police.

138
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,350
Enforce the search and inspection around that area to the fullest! Understand?

139
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,030
- Yes
 - Yes

140
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,890
 The number you have dialed is currently turned off.

141
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,240
 Please leave a message after the beep...

142
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,630
 The number you have dialed is currently turned off.

143
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,380
How could that punk Prosecutor Jang stab us in the back?

144
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,420
There must have been some kind of situation.

145
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,890
What do you mean some kind of situation?!

146
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,790
That bastard is the one who tracked Choo Won Gi's burner phone location—

147
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,630
Be quiet! What if he can hear you?

148
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,580
You really can't trust anyone in this world.

149
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,360
We're going to leave when the sun comes up, so get some rest now.

150
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,040
You look like you haven't slept at all.

151
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,280
Why are you not asking?

152
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,160
What?

153
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,500
Why am I'm being chased?

154
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,260
Doesn't everyone have their own reasons?

155
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,490
I do too.

156
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,960
See you tomorrow.

157
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,290
Where is Byeong Min?

158
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,060
Over there.

159
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,750

160
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,960

161
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,820
 - I'm sorry.
 - Huh?

162
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,380
 Say it one more time. Huh? Illegal?

163
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,460
 I'm sorry.

164
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,520
 Why the hell does it matter to you whether it's illegal or not, you bastard!

165
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,480
 You.

166
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,610
 Just do as you're told, okay?

167
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,210
 Alright, I apologize.

168
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,880
 I will do well.

169
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,910
 I apologize. I have made a mistake.

170
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,050
 I'm sorry, Chairman.

171
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,390
 I am sorry.

172
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,700
Byeong Min.

173
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,350
Yes, Ha Ri?

174
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,120
Are you alright?

175
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,620
Huh?

176
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,440
Is something going on?

177
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:45,240
Do you... Do you remember what I told you when we first met?

178
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:55,010
I promised you that I would never let you be caught by Chairman Cheon.

179
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,250
Hey, what are you saying?

180
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,020
I'm not worried about that guy.

181
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,940
Jeez, really.

182
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,410
Sure.

183
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,780
Rest up.

184
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,920
Ha Ri?

185
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,590
Hm?

186
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,980
I should be fine, right?

187
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,150
You aren't that weak.

188
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,910
Yes, what's going on?

189
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,850
Things are going according to plan.

190
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,180
Yes.

191
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,790
Watch him carefully.

192
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,320
Yes, sir.

193
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,020
Are you ready?

194
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,700
- Almost ready. 
 - Okay.

195
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,550
What are you wearing this early in the morning?

196
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,450
I should take care of myself, even if we're busy. This is good for your scalp.

197
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,350
Aigoo. It's nice that you're so bright.

198
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,510
Where is Byeong Min?

199
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,790
Not sure. He's not up yet?

200
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,440
Yo my friends, good morning!

201
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,020
Whoa, look at the morning sunshine. It's so amazing.

202
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,250
Or maybe you had good dreams last night.

203
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,990
Your face looks so good.

204
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,610
You're dressed nicely like a smurf even though you're busy.

205
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,900
Looks good. Let me wear it too.

206
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,750
- You can't.
 - Why not?

207
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,510
You can't because you stink.

208
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,420
I just washed my hair though.

209
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,940
Even if you wash with bleach, you can't.

210
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,730
And you call yourself a friend? Looking like a potato pig.

211
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,980
It's all done.

212
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,710
Really? You guys get ready to go.

213
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,800
Do you think my hair would grow sprouts or something?

214
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,500
What in the world is that?

215
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,590
- These are all lasers—
 - Let me try it on.

216
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,800
No, you can't. Your scalp...

217
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,790
Excuse me.

218
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,240
You really live quite difficult life, don't you?

219
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,500
We're late. Let's go now.

220
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,170
Come on.

221
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,190
Let's leave now.

222
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,030
Well, hair would fall out.

223
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,190
Aigoo. You woke up.

224
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,530
It was so hectic yesterday, I wasn't able to introduce myself.

225
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,630
Welcome! I am Im Byeong Min.

226
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,950
You're hungry, right? Would you like something to eat?

227
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,290
It's late. Let's go

228
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,080
You bastard, why are you so cold? We have a VIP customer right now.

229
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,680
Bastard?

230
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,420
Bastard.

231
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,360
Choon Jae, didn't you say these were your employees?

232
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,390
So why does he curse you...?

233
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:22,110
Ah, you must've heard incorrectly. They're such sweet-mannered kids! Did you...?

234
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,690
Yes, that's true.

235
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,080
It's okay.

236
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,210
Of course, B-Boss.

237
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,280
Boss? What boss? I told you, just call me "Hyeong."

238
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,900
That's how sweet these kids are.

239
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,390
Okay, let's go.

240
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,390
Let's talk while we go.

241
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,910
We have a separate day just for cursing.

242
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,270
Right, punk?

243
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,720
This way.

244
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,630
What is it? It was this kind of set up?

245
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,860
Yeah, that's what I mean.

246
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,450
But why does Ha Ri get to be the boss? Ah Ryeong, did you know about this?

247
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,250
Ah Ryeong?  You're short in talking.

248
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,020
Why? What's the matter with you?

249
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,310
Call me "Noona" from now on.

250
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,100
- What the... Was it on a "first come, first served" basis?
 -  First come, first served?

251
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,920
- Then, I'm the hyeong!
 - No.

252
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,480
- I'm... I'm the hyeong!
 - No, why do you—

253
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,740
I look older so I should be Hyeong.

254
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,540
Hey, hey, hey! Stop it and get in the car now.

255
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,140
Why are you fighting each other when you're colleagues? You guys should be getting along,  huh?

256
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,050
So, where do you need to go?

257
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,500
Let's go to Taeseong Harbor since we have to go to Haseong Island.

258
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,130
Okay, let's go.

259
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,230
Deputy Chief. His identity was confirmed.

260
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,060

261
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,390
- Kang Ha Ri?
 - Yes.

262
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,550
He is from Albuquerque, USA and is a second-generation immigrant.

263
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,150
His criminal record is clean.

264
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,430
When did he come to Korea?

265
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,750
Two years ago in February.

266
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,680
Research a bit more and hand his photo over to the police.

267
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,150
Yes.

268
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,770
Ah, what happened to the boarding?

269
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,060
I made an appointment for an hour later.

270
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,890
Okay, good job. Just keep it up like that.

271
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,040
Yes, Hyeong.

272
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,400
The police are doing a stop and search over there.

273
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,520
What now?

274
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,500
Should I turn back?

275
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,460
Wait, if you turn back now, it's more suspicious.

276
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,420
You hide!

277
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,290
Get down, hurry up!

278
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,960
Cover him.

279
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,820
Don't be nervous, act naturally.

280
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,600
Aigoo, good morning!

281
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,420
There is a mandatory search, may I see your ID please?

282
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,890
Yes.

283
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,990
Here.

284
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,860

285
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,680
Oh, yes? Good work.

286
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,020
Can you show me your ID.

287
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,570
Oh. Me too?

288
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,320
Yes. Excuse me, but was there some sort of incident?

289
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,560
No, it's just routine protocol.

290
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,040
Oh. But, what can I do? I only have my foreign ID.

291
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,760
That's fine.

292
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,140

293
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,980
Yes.

294
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,240
- Thank you.
 - Yes, thank you.

295
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,120
Good work.

296
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,220

297
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,320
W-Wait a minute! Wait, please.

298
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,560
What's the matter?

299
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,420
Uh, could you please step out so we can talk?

300
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,800
What...? I mean...

301
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,870
I have to catch a plane soon.

302
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,540
- Just a moment, step outside so we can talk.
 - I just—

303
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,470
Uh, yes. Just a moment.

304
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,940
I don't have time.

305
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,650
It took only a moment to be taken care of.

306
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,700
If I had gotten off, it could've been taken care of faster.

307
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,240
Said, get off?

308
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,520
What is this? Aish!

309
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,440
Hey! The walkie-talkies!

310
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,900
Collect them quickly!

311
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,540
Go.

312
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,250
Hurry up.

313
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,900
Prosecutor...

314
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,190
The investigation headquarters just received a report.

315
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,180
- Report?
 - Yes.

316
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,270
Yes, they seem to have beat up the police who were conducting the search and run away.

317
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,160
- To where?
 - To Taeseong Harbor.

318
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,330
- Let's get ready.
 - No, Prosecutor.

319
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,450
Just stay here. I will take responsibility and go.

320
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,160
No, it's fine.

321
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,650
- Let's go
 - Wait, Prosecutor.

322
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,680
I don't want you to have a hard time.

323
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,000
I said it's fine.

324
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,330
- Let's go.
 - Yes.

325
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,050
Wow, even here, there are cops everywhere.

326
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,520
Hey, Ha—  Hey, B-Boss. Boss.

327
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,260
It's almost time for the boat to leave. What do we do?

328
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,570
Aish, our destination is right in front of us.

329
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,010
What if we won't be able to get on?

330
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,830
Will we?

331
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:26,180
No. We're not out of options.

332
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,030
Is it possible?

333
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,600
It'll be interesting.

334
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,850
Wh-What will?

335
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,080
Wh-Where... Where are you going?

336
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,500
They only talk amongst themselves.

337
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,470
L-Let's go together.

338
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,310
Yes, I just got here.

339
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,640
Hello, sir!

340
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,110
Hello! How have you been?

341
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,680
- Oh, hold on... Who are you?
 - Yes.

342
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,270
Oh, you don't remember me?

343
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,610
Remember at the sushi restaurant, with President Park?

344
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,580
- Sushi restaurant?
 -Yes, yes.

345
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,050
Oh, that time. How can you not remember? That time.

346
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,000
You said you liked flatfish.

347
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,280
So you told the restaurant owner to go into the water to catch it.

348
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,330
Oh my, are you not President Kim?

349
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,550
You mistook me for someone else. I'm Choi.

350
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,620
Oh, I see. I'm sorry!

351
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,830
- You look so alike!
 - Oh, yes, yes.

352
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,710
- I'm sorry!
 - Yes... No, it's nothing.

353
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,740
Yeah, yeah.

354
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,260
Hey, you! Stop right there! Hey!

355
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,300
- Hurry, quickly!
 - Go, go, go!

356
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,500
Hey! Stop!

357
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,200
Good job! As expected, Cha Ah Ryeong!

358
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,660
This is nothing.

359
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,160
Alright, let's go!

360
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,590
President, you look like a striped marlin today.

361
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,570
You look like a swellfish.

362
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,870

363
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,490
Yes, this is Haseong Police Station.

364
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,300
Yes, yes. Who?

365
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,010
Choo Won... Choo Won Gi?

366
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,300
Hey, did you pack the walkie-talkies? Did you pack everything?

367
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,820
- Taser gun?
 - Yeah, yeah. Where is my tactical expandable baton?

368
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,130
- It's on you right now.
 - Oh, it was right here.

369
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,630
Should I ask for back-up?

370
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,390
Are you crazy? Are you in your right mind??

371
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,770
What kind of opportunity is this!

372
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,400
Are we going to do all the work and someone else to get the credit?

373
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,730
Still, there are four or five people in the other group.

374
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,700
So frustrating.

375
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,600
Hey, I hold a black belt. Cut the chatter and trust me.

376
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,990
We're special police now.

377
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,110
Let's go!

378
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,680
Hey, hurry and change. Hurry.

379
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
What is this?

380
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,410
Do we have to go this far?

381
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,810
Then, what else can we do?

382
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,940
There are more posted photos of your face than presidential candidate posters.

383
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,920
Hey, I also have something called style... This is a bit...

384
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,280
Hey, this is pretty. It's a sports brand.

385
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,520
Hey, isn't this pretty? Sports brand, wow!

386
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,500
We're going to be suspected more if we look like outsiders so hurry and change your clothes.

387
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,170
I'll find a car.

388
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,270
Should I come with you?

389
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:04,180
No, just stay. I'll be right back.

390
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,100
- Byeong Min. Give me your phone.
 - Why?

391
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,930
I have to use it for something so give it to me. Hurry.  Mine is traced.

392
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,670
Don't make me waste my energy, just give it to me.

393
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,670
Password?

394
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,510
1004. 
  (Cheonsa, sounds like angel)

395
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,380
- It sounds like you.
 - I'll be back.

396
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,280
Hey! Call me, if something happens.

397
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,220
What are you looking at?

398
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,590
It's just, somehow there's a house that looks familiar.

399
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,060
Have you been here before?

400
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,840
No, it's not that. Hold on, I'll be right back.

401
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,360
Noona? Noona, Noona!

402
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,640
I think this one is nice.

403
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,030
- No, I like this one!
 - How about this hat? It's yellow.

404
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,720
No, I don't want it!

405
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,280
Don't you know style? Style, damn it.

406
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,400
Sure, if you need it then you can borrow it.

407
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,010
Aigoo! Thank you!

408
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:15,850
I will use it right away then return it. I'll even fill it up with gas after.

409
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,390
Thank you! Yes.

410
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,970
Oh my, he's so handsome!

411
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,890
Yes, Yeon Hee.

412
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,760
Yeah, I'm with him now.

413
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,050
Yes.

414
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:50,290
Well, as you say, I think the prosecution office is going to be difficult.

415
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,230
I'll try to persuade him after I find it.

416
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,080
Okay.

417
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:01,000
Okay. Don't worry too much. I'll bring him back safely.

418
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,910
Okay, I'll see you there.

419
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,550
Yes.

420
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,050

421
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,460
Cha Dong Soo?

422
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,800
Who are you?

423
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,980
Do you perhaps live here?

424
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,230
There? No one lives there.

425
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,490
That nameplate was there so I just assumed.

426
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,430
Ah.

427
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:53,810
You're looking for Dong Soo? He passed away a long time ago.

428
00:32:53,810 --> 00:33:00,160
It's been already fifteen years since that incident.

429
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,190
Incident?

430
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,380
But, why?

431
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,150
Cha Ah Ryeong! Noona!

432
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,480
It doesn't matter, excuse me.

433
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,250
Ah, young lady, wait!

434
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,240
Let's go!

435
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,000
I could've sworn he called her Ah Ryeong.

436
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,750
Yes, we have arrived.

437
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,630
Yes, I understand.

438
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,830
I will take care of it.

439
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,450
Yes.

440
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,070
Just wait until you bastards get caught.

441
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,830
Get going!

442
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,520
Hello, elders. Have you been resting?

443
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,410
Have you seen this man?

444
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,830
Hm?

445
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,930
No, I haven't.

446
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,660
It's my first time seeing him.

447
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,160
Please look carefully.

448
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,120
This man is really bad so we need to find him right away.

449
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,860
I said I've never seen him before.

450
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,540
Hm.

451
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,980
Let's go.

452
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,720
Wait, then, elders.

453
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,480
Have you ever seen this man before?

454
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,640
Yes.

455
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,730
Yes, I've seen this young man!

456
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,420
Where?

457
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,690
He borrowed our youngest's truck.

458
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,130
Where did they go?

459
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,990
In this direction.

460
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,590
Hey, turn on the engine.

461
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,620
- Lets go!
 - Thank you.

462
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,320
Thank you.

463
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,350
Right?

464
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,810
What is it? Is it here again?

465
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:39,220
Do you know how many times we've circled this area?

466
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,970
Dear customer, you are too much!

467
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,930
You called us all the way here, what is all this?

468
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,920
Are you doing this on purpose?

469
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,270
You can't trust me?

470
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,180
Let's have a talk.

471
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,320
You guys wait here.

472
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,910
Detective, Detective!

473
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,410
Look at that truck!

474
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,720
What?

475
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,230
There are two people.

476
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,620
Isn't that Choo Won Gi? It is.

477
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,970
It's Choo Won Gi. Wow, I don't feel tired anymore.

478
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,070
This is definitely a promotion.

479
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:37,230
Really, I'm not the same anymore.

480
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,250
I was really known as a trustworthy guy.

481
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,120
So, what are you trying to do here, huh?

482
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,960
You want us to stay here all night?

483
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,740
If you were in my position, would you be able to trust someone so easily?

484
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,870
What if you backstab me as soon as we find the money?

485
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:57,160
Then you could've ended this before! Why did you come this far?

486
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,800
Do you think we have nothing better to do than just drive you around?!

487
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,560
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for yelling.

488
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,290
But just trust me and let's go.

489
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,220
I've gotten this far with only my reputation.

490
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,530
And what are you going to do if you don't believe me now?

491
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:25,260
You think you can leave this island with the money by yourself? And how are you going to launder it?

492
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:33,070
Let's go. I'll show you.

493
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,500
You should've just been like this from the beginning.

494
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,550
Let's go. I'm not angry.

495
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,760
Hurry!

496
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,400
I got you bastards.

497
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,590
See that?

498
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,640
Why aren't they coming?

499
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,690
What the heck.

500
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,310
Jin Woong's here.

501
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,700
Jin Woong! Hurry up!

502
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,860
What happened?

503
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,480
Ha Ri isn't there.

504
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,570
He's not?

505
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,540
- He left already?
 - Yeah.

506
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,230
Where did he go without us?

507
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,210
I gave my phone to him.

508
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,850
I'll call him.

509
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,010
He's not there.

510
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,760
But don't you think we should make sure?

511
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,420
Why?

512
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,330
This is Choo Won Gi and

513
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,040
this one is Kang Ha Ri.

514
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,240
It is, you punk!

515
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,610
What? He's not Park Choon Jae?

516
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,760
What's he saying?

517
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,160
Not sure. He's asking if it's Park Choon Jae.

518
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,820
Punks, these conmen are even fooling each other.

519
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,460
They're really the worst.

520
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,360
Seriously.

521
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,660
Why isn't he picking up?

522
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,000
He's not picking up?

523
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,700
Do you think he wanted all the money to himself so he ran away?

524
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,170
No way!

525
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,030
Can you track Ha Ri's cellphone location?

526
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,680
No, I can't.

527
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,500
Then what do we do?

528
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,410
The golf ball! He has the golf ball, right?

529
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,820
So, can you track his location then?

530
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,050
I don't know, I have to try.

531
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,630
Come on.

532
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,360
I found it!

533
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,210
This punk...

534
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,610
Okay, let's go now.

535
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,750
Let's go.

536
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,900
Come on.

537
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,370
Are we really going?

538
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,400
Team Leader,

539
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,290
if we hand them over, we're getting a special promotion, right?

540
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,690
You think it'll only be a special promotion?

541
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,660
We got a wanted criminal, and another one to boot.

542
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,430
We'll probably be promoted twice.

543
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,460
- Twice? 
 - Yeah.

544
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,760
Then, I'll have to call you Lieutenant.

545
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,190
That's right.

546
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,590
Sergeant Kim!

547
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,450
That's right!

548
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,470
Hey look at that.

549
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,360
Ahjussi!

550
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,360
Move your car, your car!

551
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,970
I said move your car! Reverse it!

552
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,090
Come on, man.

553
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,600
Isn't that Chairman Cheon?

554
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,290
What?

555
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,600
Why is that bastard here?

556
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,440
Go get them!

557
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,250
Radio for help!

558
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,790
They're coming, they're coming!

559
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,720
They're coming!

560
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,790
They're coming.

561
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,260
Give me the key!

562
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,610
-The key? 
 - Hurry!

563
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,170
Give him the key! Hurry up!

564
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,140
Quickly give me the key!

565
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,540
Here!

566
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,370
Get out, you punk!

567
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,830
You too, get the hell out!

568
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,130
You little piece of sh*t!

569
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,510
Give that to me.

570
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,580
I'm going to kill you myself, you bastard.

571
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,130
What is that?

572
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,310
Why is Chairman Cheon here?

573
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,470
You stay here.

574
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,260
What are you punks doing?!

575
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,370
Hey, Ha Ri! That bastard is running away!

576
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,940
Get Choo Won Gi!

577
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,840
Quickly!

578
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,850
Ack.

579
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,700
Jin Woong, I'll leave them to you.

580
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,420
Chairman Cheon, this bastard.

581
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,640
Just let him go. We have to get Ha Ri Oppa.

582
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,650
 Dad!

583
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:10,700
Oh, my daughter! You've been having a hard time, right?

584
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,130
No, Dad, you've been having an even harder time.

585
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,560
 Dad!

586
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,060

587
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,210
Dad!

588
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,910
Don't run, you'll fall!

589
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,260
My busy father came to visit me at school, how can I not run?

590
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,960
- Have you been doing well?
 -Yeah.

591
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,190
Give this to your mother.

592
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,450
But, Yeon Hee, is medical school supposed to be like this? You can't even go home.

593
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,350
Yeah, everyone's like that.

594
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:01,670
And also, you know I'm pretty determined.

595
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,680
Oh, yeah! Here, your birthday gift.

596
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,500
Gift?

597
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,760
You don't even have spending money! Why did you get this?

598
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,920
I bought it to celebrate my first paycheck from tutoring.

599
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,990
Here you go. Wow, my dad looks so cool!

600
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,500
Thank you.

601
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,450
Dad, after I become a doctor, I'll get you an even better one.

602
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,200
So don't wear anything else besides this until then.

603
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,080
Okay, I'll wear it for a long time.

604
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:07,660
According to the GPS, it's definitely around here.

605
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,170
Are you sure it's here?

606
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,980
Hey.

607
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,670
What is it?

608
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,510
Wow, they're really not stopping.

609
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,810
Wait here. Wait, what's that?

610
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:04,120
Wow, you've hid it really well.

611
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,860
It was here?

612
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,230
Aish, how did you know where?

613
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,830
That.

614
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,420
It's the first time you've seen this right?

615
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,400
Shit. Who the hell are you?

616
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,820
Should I say I'm someone who knows a lot about your past?

617
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,060
Don't come near me.

618
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,090
You still don't seem to understand the situation.

619
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,460
You can't collect that money.

620
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,380
Don't come near me, you bastard!

621
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:38,930
Why? You can't give up the money since it's right in front of your eyes?

622
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:43,160
Is it that important? Should I give you one word of advice?

623
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,830
If you don't give up that money, that man will kill you.

624
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,420
How do you know that man?

625
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,580
I have a history, too.

626
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,900
Oh, so you're the second plan, aren't you?

627
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,490
What? Second?

628
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,600
You think I don't know?

629
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,440
That man always makes two plans.

630
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,140
Chairman Cheon is the first and you are the second.

631
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:22,640
You're planning to get rid of me and also cover up what happened 15 years ago, right?

632
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,520
Wow, they say when you get tunnel vision there's no way around it.

633
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:32,360
Yeah, you're right, I was bluffing but let me make one thing clear.

634
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:37,540
I want to catch that man, too. I want to catch him more than anyone!

635
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,490
If it were up to me, I would just kill you too!

636
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:45,120
The only person who can testify about what happened that day is you.

637
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:51,380
That money, too! That's evidence of what happened that day.

638
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:00,370
That's why, if you want to live, turn yourself in.

639
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,710
I'll help you.

640
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,630
You expect me to believe that?

641
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,740
The words of a con artist?

642
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:23,400
Then, would you believe it if it was Yeon Hee's request?

643
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,230
What?

644
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,690
Your daughter Choo Yeon Hee.

645
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,670
Would you believe it if it was her request?

646
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,970
What. What are you saying? How do you know Yeon Hee?

647
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,930
You bastard! You conned my daughter?!

648
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,150
Yeah. I used her, too.

649
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,980
Why? Because I wanted to catch you so badly.

650
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,160
Did you approach my daughter because of me?

651
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,250
Why? What does any of this have to do with you?!

652
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,660
My father died...

653
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:07,060
because you guys framed him.

654
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,320
That isn't all.

655
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,740
That day, my mother also died from the shock,

656
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,220
because she couldn't deal with reality.

657
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:22,320
Within a day, her righteous husband became a corrupt prosecutor who accepted bribes.

658
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,610
How could she handle that?

659
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,380
Even I couldn't believe it.

660
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,040
But Yeon Hee is not like that.

661
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,440
All the people who hate you and hold grudges against you,

662
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,290
even though they pointed fingers at her and tried to hurt her, she stayed strong.

663
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,100
You know that?

664
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:51,290
There's only one thing that Yeon Hee wanted.

665
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,950
 Bring him back safely.

666
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,320
 I'm asking you a favor.

667
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,970
That was her one and only request.

668
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:17,290
For me, thinking about my father was too difficult.

669
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:21,100
So I just believed what everyone said about him,

670
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,820
that my father was that kind of person.

671
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:30,220
That he lied to our family, I believed that.

672
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:35,210
That was the easier thing to do.

673
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,140
But Yeon Hee isn't like that.

674
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:45,690
She never forgot you and always waited.

675
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,630
So, just stop now.

676
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,960
Pay the price for your crimes and live peacefully.

677
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,840
Stretch your feet out and live comfortably.

678
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,990
With Yeon Hee.

679
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,180
Close the windows, close the windows.

680
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,630
Lock it! Lock the door.

681
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:49,620
Who's that? Is it Prosecutor Jang?

682
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,000
Get out, get out.

683
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,760
No, no, don't get out. Lock the door.

684
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,470
- That's prosecutor Jang!
 - Wait, just wait!

685
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,930
Why are you guys coming out of there?

686
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,570
Can you guys get out of the car first?

687
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,210
I will explain it to you.

688
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:15,090
You bastards.

689
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,000
Don't be like that, huh?

690
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,510
- Ah! Oww! 
 - His hand, his hand!

691
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,890
Prosecutor Jang, are you okay, sir?

692
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:24,790
Ah, really.

693
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:38,380
What? With Prosecutor Jang?

694
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:44,120
Yeah. Okay, I got it.

695
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,210
Let's go now.

696
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:59,050
After I pay for my crimes, can I live with her?

697
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,910
With my daughter?

698
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,160
Go see her and ask her in person.

699
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,750
I don't have any right.

700
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,180
I'm the one who ran away when she needed me.

701
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,730
What are you going to do now?

702
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:27,920
I have to find that man. He's the bastard who started all of this.

703
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,350
Just go testify about what you know. I'm going to catch him no matter what.

704
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:37,790
Okay.

705
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,480
Like you said, I will stretch my legs out,

706
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,630
so I can sleep peacefully.

707
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,390
They're coming now.

708
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,660
Here.

709
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,930
Clean up quickly.

710
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:51,910
That...

711
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,590
For making you misunderstand—

712
00:55:55,590 --> 00:56:00,270
Forget about it. You're such a blabbermouth.

713
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:01,680
I'm going!

714
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,210
You are a bit of a big mouth.

715
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,620
You're so carefree.

716
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,970
How can you say that?

717
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,930
I don't think you're like that, Prosecutor.

718
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,490
Those punks.

719
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,030
You guys did a good job!

720
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,880
Let's get going.

721
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,620
Dad!

722
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,490
Dad.

723
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,360
Yeon Hee.

724
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,350
Dad...

725
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,530
Section Chief Maeng!

726
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,270
Section Chief Maeng!

727
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,380
 You think I don't know?

728
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:07,070
 That man always makes two plans.

729
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:55,550

730
01:00:55,550 --> 01:01:00,140
♫  I don't believe you  ♫

731
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:05,980
♫  I don't believe you  ♫

732
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:15,940
♫  This game where we trick and get tricked  ♫
 ♫  The truth is all meaningless  ♫

733
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:18,190

734
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:21,170
 I'm sorry... that I couldn't keep my promise.

735
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:23,700
 You're saying it wasn't a suicide, but a murder?

736
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,250
 Then who's behind it all?

737
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,560
 You're going to catch that man, right? Even if I try to stop you.

738
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,820
 Because of that person, I did something terrible to a friend.

739
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,090
 Who made you do it?

740
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:33,690
 I don't know.

741
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,760
 This time, you take care of things your way. I'll support you from behind and take responsibility.

742
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,520
 Go on with the next plan.

743
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,820
 This time, it's you.

744
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,320
 This time, that man is going to use you to take the blame for everything.

745
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,540
 So, quickly, get the hell out of there!

746
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,460
 Hurry!

747
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:52,120
♫  You really  ♫
 ♫  Shouldn't trust me  ♫
