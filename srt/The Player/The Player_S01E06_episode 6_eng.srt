1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,190

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,780

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,210

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,240

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,150

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,840

7
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:39,920

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,070

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,200

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,860

11
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,630

12
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,160

13
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,410
Prosecutor, what do we do if this bastard ratted us all out so he could survive?

14
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,110
He's someone who's more than capable of doing that!

15
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,520
Section Chief, please be quiet.

16
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,170
Excuse me.

17
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,010
Oh, this is refreshing.

18
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,760
Hello.

19
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,600
I feel like I can live now.

20
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,580
You're here.

21
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,250
You're Prosecutor Jang?

23
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,050
Yes, I am.

24
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,900
I see. By any chance, is he an investigator?

25
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,110
What?

26
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,380
Ah ah, forget it. I'll explain.

27
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,930
Prosecutor, it's just that

28
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,290
a misunderstanding occurred while I was performing my duties.

29
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,730
No matter how much I tried to explain to these people, no one would believe me because I didn't have a domestic ID.

30
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,700
Of course, they wouldn't know because they've never done a secret investigation before. They've only ever seen it in movies.

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,420
Secret? What secret?

32
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,880
You know, the investigation we're conducting right now?

33
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,200
Anyway. Ah, why are you people so stiff?

34
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,780
Calling our busy prosecutor over here and everything.

35
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,160
Sorry, Prosecutor.

36
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,640
No, it's fine. It's nice to hear you speaking to me with honorifics.

37
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,840
When did I not?

38
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,700
Um. Ah let's go, you must be busy.

39
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,070
Let's go.

40
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,510
Okay, let's go, you punk.

41
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,710
Thanks for the meal, the soup was delicious.

42
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,700
Oh, sorry.

43
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,990
Good work!

44
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,920
- I'll reimburse for the food. How much— 
 - No, forget it.

45
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,700
- I can expense it with a receipt.
 - Forget it. 
 - I'm so sorry.

46
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Good work. Good work.

47
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,750
- Clean this up. 
 - Yes, sir.

48
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,690
Look at you. You were talking big before.

49
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,950
She is driving well.

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,470
What about the other guys?

51
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,730
There's no way those guys would come save me.

52
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,590
Anyway, thanks for your cooperation.

53
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,860
You should leave now.

54
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,580
That rude bastard has no manners! How dare he put his hands on your shoulders?

55
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,580
What are you going to do from now on?

56
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,990
That's a business secret.

57
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,100
Ah... and watch what you say.

58
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,640
Watching the news, I think there's a mole among the prosecutors.

59
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,830
Just leave the rest to us.

60
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,530
Goodness, his mouth is the only thing alive about him.

61
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Don't impersonate a prosecutor, rascal!

62
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,990
You received his personal information?

63
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,240
Yes, would you like to take a look?

64
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,600

65
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,200

66
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,300
Steve Ha Ri Kang.

67
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,640
Run a background check on him. See what he used to do.

68
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,490
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,990
Let's go.

70
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,620

71
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,990
Trunk open!

72
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,490
Okay.

73
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,230
Now, load the car.

74
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,870
 Yes, sir.

75
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,230
I guess your skills aren't dead yet.

76
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,920
Where are you going to bring it?

77
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,430
We have to launder it.

78
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,180
You're even doing money laundering now?

79
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,020
There's nothing that makes better money. That's why I agreed.

80
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,900
Agreed? You mean there is a mastermind behind it?

81
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,420
Forget it.

82
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,790
- We're finished, sir. 
 - Okay.

83
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,630
Good work. After delivering it, get off work.

84
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,200
 Yes, sir!

85
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,400
Let's go to get that b*tch.

86
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,200
The world has gotten so nice.

87
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,670
Who knew that laundering money would become so easy?

88
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,320
It's all in the past now.

89
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,870
It seemed as if just yesterday, we were carrying multiple shopping bags, waiting for cars,

90
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,440
and delivering boxes of apples as gifts.

91
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,370
We're going the safe route because of you, Bank Chief.

92
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,530
You flatter me.

93
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,130
I'm doing this because of the commission I receive from Baek Seon.

94
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,960
How much profit are you getting when you complete one transaction?

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,860
For this case, it should be about five big ones?

96
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,060
This man is even better than me!

97
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,450
You're going to be rich very soon.

98
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,930
But... What's the relationship between Baek Seon and CEO Park?

99
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,210
I heard that the two were trading partners since long ago.

100
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,520
To be honest,

101
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,880
if it wasn't for CEO Park, how would I meet you elders like this?

102
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,990
You're so humble.

103
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,920
Do you also manage the campaign funds?

104
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,900
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

105
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,760
Of course.

106
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,790
Now! To celebrate becoming a family, let's all take a shot!

107
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,730
Yes, let's!

108
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,720
Now, cheers!

109
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,250
Moving on, are we going to continue like this?

110
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,400
I have no energy these days.

111
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,720
Nonetheless, the preparations are all done.

112
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,400
Isn't he nice?

113
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,570
Look at you!

114
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,360
As expected. Here, have a drink.

115
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,510
Thank you.

116
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,090
Look at you.

117
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,330
You all live a nice life. You're even doing face masks.

118
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,910
Oh, you came.

119
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,700
I bought tofu, it's in the fridge.

120
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,640
Did I just come back from jail? Why would I eat tofu?

121
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,710
You two have no sense of loyalty, ugh!

122
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,660
Why are you complaining about loyalty now? It's old-fashioned.

123
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,790
Everyone's doing their best to survive on their own.

124
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,020
Was this your first time being arrested?

125
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,520
You always come out just fine.

126
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,260
Jeez, what can I expect from you two?

127
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,310
- What about Managing Director Cho? 
 - We caught him.

128
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,220
- We're different from you. 
 - Yeah.

129
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,010
- We're pros.
 - Okay, whatever. Prepare to leave soon.

130
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,900
Where would we go in the middle of the night?

131
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,230
We have to find the person who took the money.

132
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,280
Hey, can't we just hand them over to Prosecutor Jang and close this case?

133
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,960
We already made a ton after catching Choi Yong Gyu

134
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,530
and arresting CEO Park.

135
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,320
Yeah, let's not get involved with gangs. Let's just—

136
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,040
No way.

137
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,640
This time we definitely have to. Come quickly.

138
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,880
There's nothing that "has" to be done! Definitely—

139
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,420
Am I his subordinate or something?

140
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,070
What does he mean we "have" to?

141
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,190
He's seriously so irritating. Did he take out a private loan?

142
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,720
He can't because of his bad credit.

143
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,110
- Hurry up and go! 
 - You go! I have five minutes left on this mask.

144
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,500
Ah, go!

145
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,660
You go first.

146
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,140
Just let him go alone.

147
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,360
Everyone, please stop what you're doing. Can I have your attention for a moment, please?

148
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,380
Attention.

149
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,660
We'll have our lips sealed about CEO Park's case from now on.

150
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,780
Make sure that no one else knows except us—

151
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,810
Jang In Gyu. What did I tell you? I said don't mess with me!

152
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,730
What's the matter?

153
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,320
Who said that you're allowed to carry out an extra investigation? Who said?!

154
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,580
We're finished though.

155
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,750
We finished the case involving CEO Park.

156
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,150
Is there a problem, honorable Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kang?

157
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,940
Everyone, you can go home.

158
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,230
Let's get off work.

159
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,850
Good work.

160
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,940
Then, I'll also get off work.

161
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,490
Oh, aren't you leaving, Deputy Chief Kang?

162
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,700
I'm sorry. You won't leave, Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kang Seong Woo, who has a good voice.

163
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,310
Let's go. Lock the door.

164
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,720
What's wrong with that bastard? I can't get used to him.

165
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,350
What?

166
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,930
Ah, really. Really, hey.

167
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,060
Hey, enough already! Seriously, don't! Let's not do it this way, okay?

168
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,290
- No, I'm going to kill him, move! 
- Hey, hey.

169
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,100
No, really—no, how many have you done this year, you bastard?

170
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,300
You're going to get executed, you hear me?

171
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,440
Would anything change just because I killed one more man?

172
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,240
- I'm going to kill this bastard. I'll kill you!
 - You guys!

173
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,690

174
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,060
You're making a mistake.

175
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,970
Do you think you're going to be okay after this? Can you take full responsibility?

176
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,750
No!

177
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,390
Ah, this is crazy, seriously!

178
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,870
These guys are always talking about taking responsibility, ugh.

179
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,790
Hey, you saw that, right? That guy's not human.

180
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,450
I can't handle him either.

181
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,420
He's coming, he's coming. Let's make this easy.

182
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,450
I don't know, I really don't know.

183
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,710
Let's see how long you'll keep saying that.

184
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,290
I can't, I don't know!

185
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,190
Hey, hey, hey! I said I don't know you bastard!

186
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,310
Ah, Ah! I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

187
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,720
You took it all!

188
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,460
I-I gave it to Baek Seon.

189
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,790
Baek Seon took it all!

190
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,920
Baek Seon, are you sure?

191
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,970
Y-Yes. I'm sure. He laundered the money.

192
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,150
- And then after laundering?
 - The borrowed-name bank accounts.

193
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,880
Borrowed-name bank accounts?

194
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,820
Hey, hey!

195
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,070
- How can you kick him right now? He's talking! 
 - He talks too much!

196
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,150
- Why are you so hot-tempered?
 - You said to kick— earlier...

197
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,920
How are they?

198
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,850
Ouch!

199
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,960
Okay.

200
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,500
Stop playing hard to get and come back to work.

201
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,400
You probably know too, since you've been living in the real world for some time, that money is more important than humans.

202
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,060
Instead of touching meager pennies by going around with weird guys,

203
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,100
it's better to get a hold of real load, isn't it?

204
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,560
Aren't you guys in a position where you're getting leftover crumbs anyway?

205
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,880
Do you think I would've joined them if that was the case?

206
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,840
This is all being controlled by the president.

207
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,900
Baek Seon? He doesn't even do anything.

208
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,670
Baek Seon?

209
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,670
Anyway, stop the car over there.

210
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,810
What are you going to do?

211
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,750
What? I told you that I would free that wench.

212
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,360
I never said that I would free her of work.

213
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,460
Aigoo, I got an ace.

214
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:55,120
Judge Kim, you're really lucky today.

215
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,320
I don't have any luck today.

216
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,620
I'm sorry, what can I do?

217
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:09,370
Then, I'll be going first.

218
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,550
Who should I choose?

219
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,780
You look so pretty.

220
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,870
She's been blessed.

221
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,520
Unless they're like you and actually have skills,

222
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,940
all they can do is start off at bars and pubs, but this girl gets to go straight to the elders.

223
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,170
If she's going to live like a dog because she has no skill,

224
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,030
it's better to live like a dog belonging to a wealthy home. Isn't that so?

225
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,150
Hey, you're going too fast. Slow down.

226
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,040
Hey, I said slow down!

227
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,100
I already warned you it was the last time for me to use words.

228
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,870
What are you doing?

229
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,090
How old are you again?

230
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,670
You could be a friend of my daughter.

231
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:48,450
Right. A good friend should whet one's appetite.

232
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,960
Unnie!

233
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,950
Let's go for now!

234
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,950
Hey! Catch them!

235
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,100
Catch them!

236
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,090
Did you see them?  Catch them quickly!

237
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,730
Run, quick!

238
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,950
- Unni, I'm sorry. Actually— 
- Forget it, later.

239
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,940

240
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,130
Move!

241
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,760
I said move!

242
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,510
Ah Ryeong.

243
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,080
Unnie, what do we do? Another car is here!

244
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,480
Stay here.

245
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,560
- What happened?
 - Yeong Ji is in the car. Take Yeong Ji and run away quickly, please.

246
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,470
Yeong Ji?

247
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,770
Unnie... Let go! Ah, Unnie!

248
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,290
Let go of me!

249
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,530
I looked into Baek Seon.

250
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,750
It's been about eight years since he became known in this field.

251
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,560
I heard that he was a skilled shiv artist among the gangs' fighters.

252
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,580
He started a private loan business

253
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,540
after he met CEO Park and now, he's expanding his organization to take over Chairman Cheon's position.

254
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,420
What's his specialty?

255
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,210
Well, he does everything — drugs, laundering, underground private loans, murder.

256
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,020
You can think of him as a mutt that does everything for money.

257
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,880
He orders his minions to ruthlessly destroy everything if his debtors don't pay on time, like you.

258
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,080
Once Chairman Cheon's gone, worse trash will be here.

259
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,980
If that's the information you found through a background check, the reality must be worse. What about a montage?

260
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,750
But the thing is, I can't find that.

261
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,390
It seems that he barely shows up at the front.

262
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,560
There are no clues either?

263
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,260
This is just a rumor, but I heard that in a salon fire incident, he severely burned one of his arms.

264
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,210
You know,

265
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,890
why isn't Ah Ryeong picking up? Did she just leave like that? Poof, gone?

266
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,470
Aigoo, is she not answering the phone?

267
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,450
She's not.

268
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,960
Byeong Min, pull up the CCTV and call records for the hidden tracker.

269
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,120
Okay, okay. Here.

270
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,830
Your accident happened right there. She passed here

271
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,810
and then left this way. Her whereabouts after that haven't been confirmed.

272
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,790
If her last location was here.

273
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,740
Huh? Then that means she's in between?

274
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,150
Hold on. Oh, it's here!

275
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,530
What? Do you know that place?

276
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:29,240
Ah Ryeong called me yesterday and asked me to find some information on some girl she knows.

277
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,970
Her name was Yeong Ji or Yeong Ja or whatever.

278
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,680
I looked into it and she was raised there.

279
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,470
Really?

280
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,940
I guess there's a reason to look into it.

281
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,870
- Hey, wait for me.
 - I caught you!

282
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,760

283
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,970

284
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,190
When the seasons change, we hold a field day.

285
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,700
It's the children's favorite day because they can eat as much pizza and chicken as they want.

286
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,080
Sit down, Detective.

287
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,540
Do you remember each and every one of the children that was here?

288
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,650
Of course. They're all like my own children.

289
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,980
Then perhaps, do you remember this person?

290
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,720
She seems to be associated with gangs and organizations.

291
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,390
We're searching for her because she's related to one of our ongoing cases.

292
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,860
It's hard to say.

293
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,650
It's my first time seeing this person.

294
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,970
Ah, really?

295
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,920
I heard from one of the other teachers on duty that she was here yesterday.

296
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,550
Ah, she must've been mistaken.

297
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,680
Ah, yes, one moment.

298
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,400
Ah, now I remember,

299
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,000
she looks different in this picture.

300
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,570
I know her, Cha Ah Ryeong. Well, she just stopped by to say hello to us but we didn't talk much.

301
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,340
Is that so.

302
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,780
Perhaps, have you noticed anything strange?

303
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:45,060
For example, signs of an accident or perhaps someone else in her car?

304
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,190
I saw her coming in a car.

305
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,580
- Up to then nothing— 
- She came in a car?

306
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,900
That's strange. According to our information, she rides a motorbike.

307
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,430
Ah, yes, I understand for now. Thank you.

308
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,380
Thanks for your help.

309
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,510
Yes, goodbye.

310
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,270
Eat well.

311
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,740
Here, eat.

312
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,390
Here.

313
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,500
Hey kids, have some ice cream.

314
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,950
- Let's eat ice cream! 
 - Come on, eat up!

315
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,920
- Thank you! 
 - Of course!

316
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,170
Eat well.

317
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,270
What flavor do you want?

318
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,580
- Kiwi. 
 - You want kiwi?

319
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,440
- He knows what's good! 
- Here.

320
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,480
- Kiwi for you! 
 - Eat up!

321
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,740
 Wow, thank you.

322
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,690
Yeah, yeah, eat well.

323
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,980
Thanks for the ice cream.

324
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,860
All of them greet so well. They're all so nice!

325
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,270
But Ahjussis, what do you two do?

326
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,150
- Us? Uh... 
 - So, we...

327
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,730
- So we're like secret agents, something like that. 
 - Right, secret agents.

328
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,330
Like the Avengers?

329
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,110
Like heroes?

330
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,890
Yeah, that. Just that!

331
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,310
Kids are smart these days!

332
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,100
Wow, amazing!

333
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,060
Really?

334
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,010
- Of course, really! When we appear, the bad guys—
 - Liars.

335
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,790
This little rascal is rude! Look at how you're talking to your elders!

336
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,370
Hey, he's really good at fighting and I'm really good with computers.

337
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,970
But why are you ugly?

338
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,210
Who? Him?

339
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,060
You're uglier!

340
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,730
- No, I'm not!
 - Yes, you are!

341
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,840
Hey, you're an adult. What are you doing to a child right now?

342
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,570
Hey, look at how he's talking! It's because he's lying!

343
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,970
I think this ahjussi is even uglier.

344
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,930
Come here, give me that.

345
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,440
Let's go now. If you're ugly, you have to make it up with your personality.

346
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,240
- That— 
 - That ahjussi is good looking!

347
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,080
- What the heck? 
 - He got plastic surgery.

348
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,900
- Let go of me! 
 - Come on!

349
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,040
Those kids are a bunch of liars.

350
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,050
It's the power of medicine. Without it, he'll age immediately.

351
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,070
- Hey, come on, hurry up.
 - Yeah, eat up, eat. You, don't eat!

352
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,960
- A detective? 
 - I've met him once before.

353
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,970
He was looking for Ah Ryeong back then too.

354
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,940
Order some men to monitor him.

355
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,410
Yes, sir.

356
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,170
Find the CCTV in this area. There's got to be something.

357
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,620
Will there be CCTVs in such a remote place?

358
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,890
I know. If there was even a parked car, we could check the black-box recording.

359
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,340
We still have to look around.

360
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,090
- Hey, pull over for a minute. 
 - Okay.

361
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,450
Why? Huh? Is something there?

362
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,100
What? What is it? What? Is it a squirrel? Is it?

363
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,200
- What squirrel? 
 - A squirrel? Is it a rabbit?

364
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,310
 I told you that it's impossible without a warrant.

365
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,810
It's because this case is serious! Let us check just once.

366
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,630
Are you guys really from the Prosecutor's Office?

367
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:32,810
You have lots of suspicions. If you don't trust me, you can always give the prosecutors a call.

368
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,050

369
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,120
This is what I've discovered on that con artist.

370
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,010
I've also asked them, so I'll report the details as they're added.

371
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,830
I see. Was there nothing particular or special?

372
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,240
Yes, sir. There has been nothing special so far.

373
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,570
- Alright, good job. 
 - Thank you.

374
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,880
  Be careful, he's quick.

375
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,240
Where is this bastard watching from?

376
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,690
- Is there someone peering in from outside the windows? 
 - Pardon?

377
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,670
Prosecutor, you have a call on line three.

378
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,080
You're wrong. I didn't see anything—

379
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:42,370
Ah, ah, yes, yes, I'm Prosecutor Jang In Gyu. Yes?

380
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,570
Who? Section Chief Maeng?

381
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,960
Why would that man—

382
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,320
Yes, I sent him over there. Of course.

383
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,580
Of course, I ask for your cooperation. Thank you.

384
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,570
This bastard, I told him not to impersonate others. Seriously...

385
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,750
I thought I was going to have a heart attack.

386
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,660
Prosecutor, are you okay?

387
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,540
Yes. It's nothing, I'm fine. Thank you for asking.

388
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,350
Isn't this the car from yesterday?

389
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,340
I think it is.

390
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,130
Why are these people putting on a show?

391
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,710
I think I've seen her somewhere before.

392
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,140
Hey!

393
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,130
Ah Ryeong? She looks like Ah Ryeong, doesn't she?

394
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,060
Really? Is it?

395
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,750
- Ay, that doesn't make sense, no way.
 - But...

396
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,410
It could be her, and it might also not be.

397
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,340
Can't you move it around and zoom in a little?

398
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,640
- I can't.
 - Why not?

399
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:22,540
Is this possible, can you? Does this look like a phone to you?

400
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,470
Excuse me, if you take this road, what will be there?

401
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,100
Even the villagers don't take this road often.

402
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:35,080
There's a personal villa here and if you continue down this path,

403
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,210
there's an orphanage.

404
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,910
Yeong Seong?

405
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,790
How did you know?

406
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,550
Hey, look into who was shown on the CCTV.

407
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:54,090
There's a high possibility that it was Baek Seon's minion.

408
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,570
Where are you going?

409
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,090
I'm going to check something. I'll catch up with you later.

410
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,700
Look into it. I said look into it.

411
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,140
Ah.

412
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,490
Hey.

413
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,260
What do you guys think of Ah Ryeong?

414
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,350

415
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:33,300
Hey! You think you're special because the president adores you, huh?

416
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,120
Don't be mistaken, b*tch.

417
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,120
If you couldn't drive, you would've ended up like her long ago. You know that?

418
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,600
I know so don't pretend to be worried about me, you thug bastard.

419
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,310
Ah, this crazy b*tch.

420
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,290
Hey, this is why I don't like you! You act as if you're the only clean one, the only loyal one.

421
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,070
Whenever I'm with you,

422
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,340
I feel like crap.

423
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,310
It's not that you feel like crap, you are crap.

424
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:12,740
A man your age has nothing to do that he's going around bothering young kids?

425
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,560
Is that bad? Huh?

426
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:25,530
And... Did you think that I called her here?

427
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,770
What?

428
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,270
  You're looking for Ah Ryeong, aren't you? If you include me, I can bring her to you.

429
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,360
 Unnie! Save me! Please save me!

430
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,450
 I'm so scared, Unnie. Please help me!

431
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,270
 What are you scared of? What's going on?

432
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,100
 The person from yesterday chased me...

433
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,110
 Yeah.

434
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,490
  Between you and me we don't need to talk much.

435
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,560
 You decide if your'e going to save this b**** or not.

436
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,830
 You, don't you touch her! That girl has nothing to do with me—

437
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,040
  You're going to give me work now, right?

438
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,720
  Of course.

439
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,060
  I'll give you something good.

440
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,490
Ugh, you should have straightened up and come to your senses long ago. Loyalty, my ass.

441
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,190
- Boss. 
 - What?

442
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,960
Ah, yes Boss?

443
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,890
There are guys who keep snooping around us.

444
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,890
Get rid of them quietly.

445
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,890
Yes, I got it.

446
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,900
Hey.

447
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,490
See you later.

448
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,850
Let's go.

449
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,650

450
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,060

451
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,470
I know her, Cha Ah Ryeong.

452
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,550
I'm sorry, Unnie.

453
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,510
It's fine, don't apologize.

454
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,760
The reason you left the orphanage,

455
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,330
was it because of the director?

456
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,060
It's the same everywhere.

457
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,830
I'm so sick of it.

458
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:25,660
This is going to CEO Kim so take special care in delivering.

459
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,600
Of course, he's someone who works for this country.

460
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,720
Will it really be fine if we just leave them like this?

461
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,520
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kang should've planned something and acted already.

462
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,290
For now, let's have a bit of faith and wait a little longer.

463
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,800
I'm just uneasy about all of this. Shouldn't we prepare something beforehand?

464
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,360

465
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,730
Did he contact you?

466
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,960
Let's move out.

467
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,520
Didn't it seem like that girl was Ah Ryeong?

468
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,710
I think so too.

469
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,480
Why was she driving that car?

470
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,930
What if she was threatened by those bastards or something?

471
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,780
Ah, is that even possible?

472
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,960
Then what? Why else would she have been driving that car?

473
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,070
- Whoa! 
 - Whoa.

474
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,920
Ah, what's this?

475
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,740
Hey, let us pass!

476
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,450
Ahjussi.

477
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,770
B-Behind us.

478
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,250
Who are those bastards?

479
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,950
The C-CCTV...

480
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,330
Aren't those people the ones caught on the CCTV?

481
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,080
I think your prediction was right.

482
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,410
Hey, hey, hey. Why, why, why?

483
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:50,410
Ah, seriously! You should've told me before if you were planning on getting out!

484
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:02,770
♪ Mid pleasures and palaces through we may roam ♪

485
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:07,800
♪ Be it so ever humble there's no place like home ♪

486
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,420
Aren't you going to greet your dad?

487
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,200
Don't come any closer.

488
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,370
If you even lay a finger on her, I'll—

489
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,450
You don't even know your place.

490
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,050
You've grown up a lot since the last time I saw you.

491
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,830
Young Ji, will you spend time with dad today?

492
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,720
Let's go.

493
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,620
Come.

494
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,220
Unnie! Unnie!

495
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,850
Director, you were here! I searched for you for so long.

496
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,590
What brings you here at this time, Detective?

497
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,670
Ah, something urgent came up.

498
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,800
- Ah, first let's go in and talk—
 - No.

499
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,200
Now is not a good time.

500
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,420
I came a long way for this. Why are being so merciless?

501
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,940
It'll be quick so don't worry too much. I'm not that rude.

502
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,410
Let's go in, yes, come in.

503
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,490
Come on.

504
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,890
This place is nice.

505
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,960
Director, I didn't know you were rich.

506
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,690
I guess the orphanage is doing a lot better than I expected.

507
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,090
What's the matter? Why are you here?

508
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:27,360
Ah, that, uh, it's nothing much.

509
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,710
I looked into it again, and Ah Ryeong wasn't from Yeong Seong.

510
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,680
Ah, really?

511
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,290
Since you're in charge of so many children, it's possible that you could've gotten confused.

512
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,310
I'm just letting you know that she wasn't from there.

513
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:45,850
Um, but my throat is a bit dry. Is there anything to drink?

514
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,900
Well, would you like a warm cup of tea?

515
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,500
That sounds great! Yes.

516
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:58,970
Since we're at it, could I get some expensive— I mean, something good for the body, like herbal tea.

517
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,230
This is nice.

518
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,740
  Come...

519
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,080
Yeah!

520
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,110
  Come to the villa. There's another rat.

521
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:39,360
Let's end it now. Another guest has come to look for that b*tch, Ah Ryeong.

522
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,490
She's seriously so cumbersome.

523
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,050
Hey!

524
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,920
What did you just say?

525
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,310
What about it?

526
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:07,970
What about Ah Ryeong?!

527
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:10,570
What about her?!

528
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,030
Hey, come here you bastard!

529
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,120
What are you doing, Director?

530
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:34,520
Wait. Should I call you Baek Seon now?

531
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,490
Isn't this too honest of an answer?

532
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,260
You even know how to wield a knife?

533
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:34,090

534
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,730
I'll ask you just once.

535
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,900
Where's Ah Ryeong?

536
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,830
Where is she?

537
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,950
Ah Ryeong!

538
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:26,630
How are you here?

539
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,630
What do you mean?

540
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,410
I came to catch my runaway little sister.

541
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,490
You're Young Ji?

542
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,780
Who are you?

543
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:49,990
Me?

544
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,650
Her brother.

545
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:33,650
This ahjussi, he's doing all sorts of things. Seriously.

546
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,330
You don't even know how to shoot. Stop playing around and put that down.

547
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,840
You know...

548
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,550
What are you doing? Put your hands up.

549
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:57,020
If you were planning on saving those b*tches, you shouldn't have come alone.

550
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,970
I didn't want to come alone

551
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:04,750
but those bastards just have no loyalty.

552
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,810
You can't search for loyalty in this field.

553
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:13,390
Especially for people like you, there's no one to come searching for you even if you die now.

554
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,530
I guess that's true.

555
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:19,630
No one's going to blink an eye just because someone like me dies.

556
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,620
But what to do? She's quite different.

557
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:28,490
What?

558
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,300
  What do you think of Ah Ryeong?

559
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,310
  Why are you asking such an obvious question? Of course, she's our sister.

560
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:37,020
  Yeah, our younger sister.

561
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,370
  Though she's quite rude.

562
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,980
 Okay.

563
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,530
Who messed with our youngest?

564
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,560
Was it you?

565
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:06,200
Hey, Ah Ryeong, are you okay?

566
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,120
Oh, you got injured! Who did this? Was it you? Was it you guys?

567
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,000
- Look at her face! Who did that?
 - Hey, are you okay?

568
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,920
- You're hurt! 
 - Who said you could leave like that?!

569
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,500
- I told you not to go around doing strange things! 
 - That's why you got injured!

570
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,880
What should we do with this wound?

571
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,560
Ugh, seriously!

572
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,580
She's hurt, seriously! Where is that bastard running off to?

573
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,480
Stop right there!

574
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,170
Oh no!

575
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,800
Those bastards are endless.

576
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,970
What?

577
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,750
What should we do? Huh?

578
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,500
What else?

579
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,430
We should go out.

580
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,630
Do you have a plan?

581
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:43,130
Yeah, all together.

582
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,530
We'll leave first so come out a bit later.

583
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,760
- Go, go.
 - You go first.

584
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,060
Let's go, together.

585
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,730
Yeah?

586
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,060
Let's go.

587
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:20,950
Stop!

588
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,970
Prosecutor Jang.

589
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,490
Arrest them all!

590
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:26,460
Yes!

591
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,030
Go!

592
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:36,290
Let him go.

593
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,510
But what if we lose him─

594
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,810
He's done for.

595
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,450
Alright, then shall we start heading out?

596
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:59,120
Prosecutor, I'll leave it to you

597
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,290
to wrap it all up. Thanks.

598
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,400
Those bastards.

599
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:10,950
Stay still!

600
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:14,550
Lower your gaze, bastard. I'm a national prosecutor.

601
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,390
Let's get going.

602
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:17,960
Wrap it up.

603
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,870
Please go easy on me.

604
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,990
I'm going to go crazy.

605
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:29,370
What the!

606
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:21,100
This man went to straight to hell.

607
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,580
It's all his fate.

608
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,540
Where did Ah Ryeong go?

609
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,640
- What are you doing?
 - What are you up to?

610
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,150
We said that we would spend it all over there.

611
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,160
I need to take money for our labors.

612
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,670
It's not even going to be that much.

613
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,230
Okay, not bad!

614
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:40,660
Split it! Split it, split it, split it.

615
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,520
Hey, this isn't that much money. I'm not going to split it with you!

616
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,400
Give me 30,000 won (~$30) so that I can buy chicken breast. C'mon.

617
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,940
- No, no. 
 - You said that there's a lot!

618
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,260
Stop using strength!

619
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,080
Stop!

620
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,180
Hurry up!

621
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,420
Why, why, why?

622
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,550
Give some.

623
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:22,210
 The prosecutor of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, Jang In Gyu,

624
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:26,460
 has added the arrest of a loan shark that is affiliated with CEO Park Hyeon Jong.

625
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,600
 Loan Shark Lee has led a criminal organization by dealing drugs, loan business,

626
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,240
 laundering money, and human trafficking.

627
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,880
 He disguised himself as the director of Yeong Seong Orphanage located in the Namhan Reservoir area, Kyeongji-do,

628
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,840
 causing even more shock.

629
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,790
  Are you guilty of taking bribes?

630
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,990
 I apologize.

631
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,190
  Is it true?

632
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,900
  Prosecutor!

633
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,560
 General Prosecutor! Reflect on yourself.

634
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,610
  Is it true that you gave a favorable sentence after receiving a bribe?

635
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,840
  Have you received the detective's report?

636
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,190
 The city of Namhan expressed that they would close down the orphanage immediately

637
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:02,330
 and separate the children and send them to

638
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:05,000
 eight different orphanages.

639
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,230

640
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:27,010

641
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,950

642
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,120
  Your vacation is until today.

643
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,740
  Come to work tomorrow!

644
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:05,800
So, you can't take me out of here?

645
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,460
Then let's do it.

646
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:20,190
I'm going to reveal all your plans with "that man".

647
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:40,440
Wouldn't a tree grow better if we tear off dead leaves?

648
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,920
If it is an obstacle, it would be better to remove it

649
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,100
for the sake of everyone else.

650
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,590

651
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:03,100

652
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:23,570
 If I interrogate Baek Seon, I might be able to track "the man".

653
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,200
 Baek Seon.

654
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,410
 Let's take the easy route.

655
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:18,130

656
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:30,250
♫  I invite you to this ground, where your ambition will be satisfied  ♫

657
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,390

658
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:38,650
 After investigating the source of the money, something interesting showed up.

659
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,630
 I will definitely return as president!

660
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:44,630
 The person your daughter claims who sexually assaulted her is Assemblyman Kim Seong Jin?

661
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,630
 People come first.

662
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:47,440
 His wife?

663
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,100
 We'll take care of President Nam.

664
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,290
 We need more concrete evidence,

665
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,310
 evidence that no one can deny.

666
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:56,550
 But this is the result of your choice.

667
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:59,810
 Ignoring and degrading those below him, playing around with the world as he wishes,

668
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,310
 we have to stop him from doing that any longer.

669
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,020
 No!

670
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,590
 I'll reveal the truth no matter what.

671
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,690
♫  You keep getting sucked in, you keep getting tricked again and again  ♫
