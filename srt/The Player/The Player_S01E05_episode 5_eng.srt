1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,100

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,790

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,300

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,290

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,070

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,840

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,010

8
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,060

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,120

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,540
 Let's finish up now.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,740
 Do you have proof?

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,580
 I do have it.

13
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,240
 We secured security footage of them.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,350
 His name is Do Jin Woong. Until recently, he was a nationally-recognized fighter.

15
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,380
 Next, Im Byeong Min. He won security system hackathons, as a high-schooler.

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,850
  There's a rumor that the NIS scouted him.

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,490
 He's known to have the "hands of God" in this field of work.  Lastly, this con artist is the most important.

18
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,440
  About his personal information...I still don't know yet.

19
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,040
 A fighter, a con artist, and a hacker in one place?

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,750
 It's an interesting combination.

21
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,110
 - How about someone like him?
 -You want to mess with a chaebol?

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,340
 Hey, who's driving?

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,510
 There's someone I know.

24
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,150
 - Talk about what?
 - About work, business.

25
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,030
 - Why do you do this type of work?
 - I don't know.

26
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,910
 We allow Defendant Ji Seong Goo to be released on bail!

27
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,390
 As you said, we did things through the law.

28
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,720
 And it feels really great.

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,050
 Search up the Daechi-dong high school girl murder case.

30
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,290
 I murdered that girl.

31
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,970
 But look what happened. I got released.

32
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,850
 The guy, the man...

33
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,650

34
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,630
 I think we were traced.

35
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,950
 Hurry get on!

36
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,990
 By the way, how do you know Ha Ri?  I've never seen you before.

37
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,420
 Ah that...

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,350
 We're friends who work together.

39
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,530
 Friends?  He has friends?

40
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,720
 Oh, by the way, don't trust Ha Ri too much.

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,340
 He's someone who can stab you in the back when it comes to money.

42
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,630
 What do you mean?

43
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,950
 Don't you know? Whatever he says is all lies.

44
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,430
 I have narcolepsy.

45
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,960
 How could I not know a person as important as you?

46
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,560
 Seong Goo, since we took care of it according to the law, it feels great, doesn't it?

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,130
 Wow.

48
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,390
 You're the one who sees me like that.

49
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,100
 You let your subordinates kidnap us and threaten us with violence.

50
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,430
 Do you want us to bring you evidence to convict bastards like Chairman Ji and Ji Seong Goo?

51
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,890
 Then I'll bring it to you. No matter what.

52
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,490
 But in exchange, all the cash we find while exposing their dirty secrets is ours to keep, okay?

53
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,320
 - C'mon. We have work to do. 
- Ugh, why can't I reject him?

54
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,780
 Wow, long time no see!

55
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,230
 The guy who passed the bar in his freshman year and quit.

56
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,030
 Ah, Choi Soo Hyeok!

57
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,390
 Want me to tell you one thing?

58
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,030
 Why you guys can't do it?

59
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,920
 It's because you guys can't abandon your petty ethics and moral obligations.

60
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,470
 Those guys don't bleed the weak till they're dry because they have stuff like that.

61
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,010
 How would you know?

62
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,260
   Have you ever experienced something like this? All you've ever done is scam people. When have you—

63
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,950
 If I have?  If I have, what changes? Huh?

64
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,590
 Do you think nothing happened to me?

65
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,590
 I'm saying this because I've failed before!

66
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,650
 I'm saying this because if we acted on our emotions, we might lose that bastard in front of our eyes!

67
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,790
 Have you fallen for me?

68
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,340
 I'm also someone who commits crimes but you're just too much.

69
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,550
 I'm planning on creating a new task team.

70
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,580
 I'll recommend the next project. There is a person called as Chairman Cheon...

71
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,850
 Prosecutor Jang, you should put him in jail—

72
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,700
  So you're Soo Hyeok.

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,740
  I heard that your dream is to become a prosecutor like your dad.

74
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,490

75
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,800
 Congratulations on your being really broke.

76
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,980
 You have to work with me later on, okay?

77
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,580
 Watch over me...  Because this is just the start.

78
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,060
 This is interesting.

79
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,710

80
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,110
 Wanted for suspicion of pocketing about 180 billion won of the national budget funds,

81
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,650
 the former WG CEO Choo Won Gi is brought up

82
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,320
 regarding his crimes again.

83
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,860
 According to an informant, a part of that money

84
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,960
 might be brought into Candidate Kim Kook Jong's presidential election camp.

85
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,890
 The campaign director from Candidate Kim's insisted that it was just a false accusation

86
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,230
  that was maliciously fabricated and strongly expressed that they would counteract it with law.

87
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,670
I just sent video clips through email so if you check it, you'll know.

88
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,040
Yes. What those bastards are up to now.

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,000
You don't need to worry, Candidate.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,190
Everything will go as we planned.

91
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,510
I'll just trust you, Captain.

92
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,370
Hey, you bastard! Check the damn signal!

93
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,680
I found him!

94
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,100
- Come here!
 - What is this?

95
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,790
But save my daughter, please.

96
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,290
Take him away!

97
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,530
Please save me! Save me, please!

98
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,860
Don't come near me!

99
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,400
If you come near me, I'll kill all of you!

100
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,260
There was someone behind it all.

101
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,060
They got someone from our side as well.

102
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,270
Okay. Let's talk more details later.

103
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,720
They might tap in to our conversation.

104
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,880
Keep in mind.

105
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,420
Don't trust anyone from now on.

106
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,600

107
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,250
Yes, Team Leader.

108
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,090
I heard we had a mole on our side, too.

109
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,120
No, Captain said he would speak to me in person.

110
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Captain.

111
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,600
Captain.

112
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,490
Captain! Captain!

113
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,820
Captain! Captain! Captain!

114
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,310
Please help!

115
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,040
Captain.

116
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,670
Someone, please help!

117
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,360
Help!

118
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,320
 Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi who was in charge of investigating CEO Choo Won Gi

119
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,800
 was shockingly revealed to have received bribes to help him.

120
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,810
 Prosecutor Choi previously arrested highly-ranked government officers and received wholehearted support.

121
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,540
 But the evidence that he continuously received bribery personally from Choo Won Gi appears one after another.

122
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,760
 As it was revealed in the will of an officer who worked at Candidate Hong Jong Hyeon's presidential election camp,

123
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,120
 it's assumed that they had been involved in committing the crime together for a very long time.

124
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,070
 New suspicions have been raised over whether even other ruling party assemblymen received bribery as well.

125
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,630
 It has become a very big issue now.

126
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,330

127
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,960
Things are becoming more favorable for us.

128
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,320
If Candidate Kim is selected, a lot of opportunities will open up to us.

129
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,470

130
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,000

131
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,730

132
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,220

133
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,610

134
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,030

135
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,110
What?  Hey, Deputy Chief Kang!

136
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,430
You're really going to be like this?

137
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,520
You said Prosecutor Jang worked under you, didn't you?

138
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,060
That idiotic moron, really!

139
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,200
Why on earth are you being like this?

140
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,560
We're also taking care of things internally.

141
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,080
Chief Prosecutor is paying special attention to this matter.

142
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,620
If you stay away for a short time—

143
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,660
What?!

144
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,290
F**k, really!

145
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,130

146
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,370
Let's start... the next project.

147
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,600
Anyhow, these government bastards only gulp our money but can't do anything.

148
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,020
- You have a car waiting outside, right?
 - Yes.

149
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,640
Hey, what are you doing?

150
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,570
- It's under construction.
 - Get out of the way!

151
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,170
You think I'm doing this because I want to?

152
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,900
Get out of the way, you bastard!

153
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,550
Why does this mister keep speaking to me informally when I'm all hot and bothered?

154
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,160
Hey, turn around the car. Turn around the car.

155
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,370
Mister! Do you have a trouble at home? Need to destress?

156
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,370
CEO Park is coming down.

157
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,390
You guard your tongue! You never saw me, okay?

158
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,190
We got it.

159
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,220
How can you say that now, you punk?

160
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,990
Haven't you seen Prosecutor Jang, that bastard arresting CEO Na?

161
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:01,010
Ah, seriously! That's why I said to exchange all that to cash before it's tied up!

162
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,670
Yeah! Tell Kim and Choi as well to bring it after taking care of it.

163
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,880
Collect cash as much as you can and give it to Baek—

164
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,020
Wait a minute! Who are you?

165
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,570
Me?

166
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,150
Aren't you a woman?

167
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,080
N-no, I'm not.

168
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,880
What do you mean you're not?!

169
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,440
Hey! You're—  No way!

170
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,130
Ah, seriously! I told you to be careful about eye contact!

171
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,080
I didn't look at him!

172
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,890
What do you mean you didn't look at him? I saw you glance at him through this mirror!

173
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,270
I looked at a car behind us.

174
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,270
Hey, there are side mirrors. What's the point of them if you don't look?

175
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,010
Geez!  Would you stop nagging me?

176
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,180
- I'm nagging because it's necessary!
 - That's how I do things, what am I supposed to do?

177
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,710
Hey, then your way is to look at another man like this, huh?  Like this?

178
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,970
- Why would I look at a horrible one like him?
 - What?

179
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,610
Then when you were caught, you should've acted naturally!

180
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,670
"N-no, I'm not."  Is this your first time acting? What sloppy acting!

181
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,400
That's why I told you I didn't want to! Or you should've given a script in the beginning!

182
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Hey!  Because you don't have a script, you can't act?!

183
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,270
Then what am I supposed to do?  Do you think everyone is a con-artist like you?

184
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,370
What? Con-artist?!

185
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,300
- By the way, you bastards!!
 - We're in the middle of talking!
 - We're in the middle of talking!

186
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,970
Ah! Annoying!

187
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,960
Con-artist?! Geez!

188
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,160
Y-you're getting road rage right now?

189
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,010
Hey! Don't do that!

190
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,880
- He is trying to get off right now.
 - You stay still, punk!

191
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,850
If you get off, you'll regret it so sit quietly and be still!

192
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,100
Stop the car! Stop the car!

193
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,800
Hey! Hey! Pull over there! Stop, stop the car!

194
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,300
Ouch! Come over here! Hey! You! You!

195
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,850
I saw and remember your faces perfectly! Watch and wait!

196
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,050
What do you mean "watch and wait"? Look behind you.

197
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,630
- What is this? 
- Oh, CEO Park?

198
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,620
- How did I get here?
 - We're on our way to see you.  Are you here to meet us?

199
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,460
See?  I told you that you would regret it if you got off the car. Please take good care of him.

200
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,300
- I was on the way to business.
 - Thank you for coming here.

201
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,660
Yes. Good job.

202
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,770
Let's go.

203
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,890

204
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,820
Just pretend doing it! Just pretend!

205
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,330
All of you got bribes from CEO Park. Why are you actually trying to look for them?

206
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,610

207
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,320
 Is there anyone else who is related to Eun Hyeong Construction's corruption? Do you plan on any additional summons?

208
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,590
It's hard to tell right now.

209
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,010
First, we have to investigate the seizures. Then we'll find the related personnel—

210
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,390
Aigoo.

211
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,830
What are you doing right now?!

212
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,390
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,390
I'm sorry.  Aren't you hurt? I'm sorry.

214
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,980
Sit up straight.

215
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,000
You inflated the construction rates, received rebates and embezzled.

216
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,870
And I see that you sent the money from the inflated rates to a paper company, and took up to 30% in toll fees.

217
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,660
Why is that a paper company? Who decides that?

218
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,330
Is there a company that has only two employees with a tiny unit as an office?

219
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,640
And those two employees are President and Vice-president?

220
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,420
And the company paid each of them a monthly salary of 30 million won.

221
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:45,350
Moreover, made-up accounting, real estate investments...

222
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,460
Where did such a large amount of money disappear to?

223
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,480
Do you think I did this to make only me rich?

224
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,430
Speaking bluntly,  it's not like I did it to eat only my fill, is it?

225
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,190
That's what I'm saying... That's what I'm curious about.

226
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,130
Who is it? Who did you make full?

227
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,720
Don't do anything that you'll regret later. Let's finish up here.

228
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,600
In my opinion, you can't take responsibility for this.

229
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,600
It's okay. I don't really have a sense of responsibility anyway.

230
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,470
Ah, really. You're someone who doesn't get it. Why don't you try looking for it?

231
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,850
Where that money went.

232
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,980
Let's do that.

233
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:50,620
I understand what you mean. Don't worry. We'll figure it out. Okay.

234
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,070
What did he say?

235
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,660
Just an old man's solicitude. Let's finish up summarizing the main points.

236
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,950
Okay. Let's look at it.

237
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,530
Kim and Choi that President Park mentioned are these guys.

238
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,860
Cho here, is the person-in-charge.

239
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,770
It's a very high possibility that he has the slush fund account books.

240
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,890
How did they launder the money?

241
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,350
It looks like they've made several dozens of borrowed-name bank accounts and have been transferring money among them.

242
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:22,650
They use a method where they take out and deposit checks of what seem like business transactions among them.

243
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,660
- They avoid lump sums of money.
 - Exactly.

244
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,110
How much do you think it is?

245
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,640
About 6 billion won.

246
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,800
Probably more than that.

247
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,030
They would exchange their accounts to cash before asset forfeiture.

248
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,700
"Asset forfeiture"?  What is that?

249
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,190
If they didn't seize something at the crime scene, they could expropriate it upon conviction.

250
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,240
So they freeze the assets in advance so that criminals can't hide their money beforehand.

251
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,430
Then they must be very busy now.

252
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,720
How much do you think it is then?

253
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,360
At least, 20 billion won?

254
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,490
- 20 billion?
 - 20 billion won?

255
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,650
How can you launder that much money in this situation?

256
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,830
You said they're experts on exchanging cash. They probably use private moneylenders.

257
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,820
Chairman Cheon used to do that too.

258
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,550
 Yeah! Tell Kim and Choi as well to bring it after taking care of it.

259
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,550
 Collect cash as much as you can and give it  to Baek Seon—

260
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:19,110
Right! On the phone earlier, he said something like "collect cash as much as you can and give it to Baek Seon."   Is he the guy?

261
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,540
Baek Seon? Do you know him?

262
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,420
No, not at all. First time hearing it.

263
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,220
Don't mind. We'll intercept it before it's delivered anyway.

264
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,560
The important thing is that the cash will be brought to one place.

265
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,840
Byeong Min, try to find out the real estates owned by people close to CEO Park.

266
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,600
Including the house maid and driver. And find out if it's moving properly.

267
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,050
Even driver?  How can I do it all by myself? I can't do it even if I stay up all night.

268
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,830
After climbing mountains, you can see the flatland.

269
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,070
Why do I climb mountains all by myself?

270
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,900
Then who would climb mountains? You're the only person on hacking here.

271
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,180
You're using "only one" only at times like this. If you didn't use it much, I wouldn't hear it—

272
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,160
Why did you let the sparks fly in my face when I'm just sitting still here? That man's just saying it.

273
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,400
Look, look. She is so cheeky!

274
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,340
You, until when are you going to call him as this man or that man, huh?

275
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,000
-Then what can I call him?
 - Hmm.  Oppa?

276
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,670
Ah, what did I just hear just now?

277
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,860
I don't like it either.

278
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,160
What to call each other isn't that important. Just call each other whatever you feel comfortable with.

279
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,830
- Then what do you want to call him?
 - I've not thought about it.

280
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,330
Then call him comfortably, whatever you like.

281
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,770
Con artist?

282
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,170
She is doing it again.

283
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,670
Ah Ryeong, what about me?

284
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,360
Ahjussi.

285
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,410
- This is what you're in the present—
 - Hey, you Talkative.

286
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,230
You said to call you comfortably.

287
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,690
That's it for today. Let's end things.

288
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,520
Already done for today? Where are you going?

289
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,240
On a date.

290
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,290
-Then I'll leave too.
 -  Do you have plans?

291
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,140
My brother is going to be discharged from hospital.

292
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,030
- Hey, hey.  I'm leaving too. Give me a ride on your way.
 - What is this? You're very different from what I expected.

293
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,360
Only I am different? You're very narrow-minded.

294
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,990
Don't do that. Let's play just one game. I'm bored.

295
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,210
Am I kid? To play games?

296
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,370
- You always play games.
 - I won't play games with you.  Never.

297
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,360
How childish!

298
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,020
If you're bored, call your friend and play. Or play games.

299
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,320
- Just wear it.
 - I feel stuffy when I wear it.

300
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,130
Do you want to eat pork belly?

301
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:40,490
Ah, she drinks well.

302
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,230

303
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,900

304
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,650
Pickpocket!

305
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,250
Halt over there!

306
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,810
Halt over there!

307
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,980
Come on! Come on! Stop there.

308
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,100
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

309
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,250
- Ma'am.
 -Where is my purse?

310
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,310
Where is my purse?

311
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,250
Ah, she picked a lot.

312
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,170
You're the one, Unnie.

313
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,230
Wow, I was shocked. I didn't even notice. How did you do it all of a sudden?

314
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,050
What do you do? A player? When did you learn?

315
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,480
- Can you teach me?
 - Don't follow me.

316
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,880
Don't act like that. I really want to be like you.

317
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,530
Give me a break. Look for someone else. I'm done with that kind of work.

318
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,070
You should carry on a tradition then.

319
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,410
I'm Byeon Yeong Ji. What is your name, Unnie?

320
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,580
Okay. I got it. But if you show it once—

321
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,560
That's enough, right?

322
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,090
Wow, Unnie, you're really—

323
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,400
Unnie!

324
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,110
How amazing! He can still eat even after he betrayed his family.

325
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,070
He's probably comfortable with that.

326
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,310
Ah, you guys are too much. We're all family in prosecution.

327
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,290
Ah, really.

328
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,940
Just eat, please. Don't mind them.

329
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,240
I still get indigestion.

330
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,030
- Prosecutor, are you sure you're okay?
 - Yeah.
 -  You're really great at times like this.

331
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:23,530
How can you not be concerned? There are so many enemies all over.

332
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,040
I just live the way it is.

333
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,230
Learned from Captain Choi Hyeon Gi?

334
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,490
Yes.  He said it when I was a rookie prosecutor.

335
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:33,390
"Endure not trusting people but thinking about the organization,  then good days will come someday."

336
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,070
Do you think good days will come?

337
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,000
 You're here! Welcome!

338
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,400
You're here, Prosecutor.

339
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,020
Have you eaten, sir?

340
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,420
Yes.

341
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,770
Those days are on the way.

342
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,610
You've been working hard. Let's gather our strength and run once more!

343
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,760
- Good Luck!
 - Good Luck!

344
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,390
For our Prosecutor Jang!

345
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,600
 Yes!

346
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,860
How is that for me? It's for justice.

347
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,860
Are you able to pick up, Prosecutor?

348
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,710
Yes, Deputy Chief?

349
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,740
Right. You're doing well. Keep doing like this.

350
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,720
Yes. I'll do my best.

351
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,350
Here.

352
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,630
Share this with your staff in the office.

353
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,930
Thank you.

354
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,190
Our section chief likes snacks very much.

355
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,120
Do you have any other problems?

356
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,110
No, I don't yet.

357
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,860
Good. If you have any, tell me right away.

358
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,790
Yes. I understand.

359
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,580
I love you, Deputy Chief.

360
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:52,540
By the way, about Choi Hyeon Gi's son...

361
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,250
- You mean Soo Hyeok?
 - Right, Soo Hyeok.

362
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:06,210
How is he doing? I heard that he went to America.

363
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,830
He died a long time ago.

364
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,760
What? What happened?

365
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,410
I heard he committed suicide.

366
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:24,350
After Captain died like that, even his wife passed away.  So it must've been hard for him to endure by himself.

367
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,360

368
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,310

369
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,960
I'm always indebted to you.

370
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,520
You still don't say, "thank you."

371
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,980
You're cool. I'm getting recharged too.

372
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,310
You made a team. You look like you're stuck together.

373
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,630
Stuck, my butt. We're not glue.

374
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,960
Did you start again?

375
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,500
I should.

376
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,080
Take care of yourself. Don't get hurt again.

377
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,640
I have you, my main doctor.

378
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,520
You bad punk.

379
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,100
You haven't been contacted?

380
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,570
I guess nothing happened, right?

381
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,520
Probably.

382
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,440
If you hear news, let me know.

383
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,330
I've not decided yet whether I'll let you know or not.

384
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,890
I'll wait.

385
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,540
I'm leaving.

386
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,280
Thank you.

387
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,100
I barely found you.

388
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,220
I told you not to follow me—

389
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,240
Hey!  Cha Ah Ryeong!

390
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,200
Smile a bit, don't have so much attitude.

391
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,940
Who are you? You're good looking.

392
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,870
Get inside.

393
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,020
Hurry!

394
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,750
Didn't we already finish talking?

395
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,530
That's what you think.

396
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:17,480
CEO Nam said to bring you, no matter how.

397
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,980
Is that a threat?

398
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,680
No, no. I'm suggesting. Suggestion!

399
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,240
Then I'll suggest one thing too.

400
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,370
Get lost. If you don't want to die.

401
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,070
You bitch, I took it easy on you.

402
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,380
If you don't take it easy, what will you do?

403
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,370
Ah, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

404
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,940
Hey, hey, Ah Ryeong.

405
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,190
Ah Ryeong.

406
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,870
I got it. I told you I got it.

407
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,800
This is the last time I'll use words.

408
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,810
Yes, Boss.

409
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:25,320
No. I'll make sure to bring her by tomorrow.

410
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,900
Yes.

411
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,040
If it's CEO Nam, isn't he the boss of the Jeong Soo gang?

412
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,900
That gang is known for making a strong punch, isn't it?

413
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,200
What should I do?  I really want to see them.

414
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,240
Get real. It's not like what you imagine.

415
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,760
If you become a member, it'll be nice.

416
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,180
It may be like a family. They have loyalty and you don't feel lonely either.

417
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,220
Why are you looking for family over there when you have a mom and a dad?

418
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,620
I don't have mom and dad.

419
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,830
What do you mean?

420
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,890
I came from an orphanage. I've never seen my parents.

421
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,080
Why did you run away from an orphanage?

422
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,370
Just... because.

423
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:22,550
Unni, should we do this? I'll clean, cook, and do laundry.  You just teach me skills.

424
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,040
I'm good at housekeeping.

425
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,240
Or I can pay you tuition. I have money.

426
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,480
- Whose is that now?
 - This?

427
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,220
Kim Geun Woo's?

428
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,200
I usually don't give advice to anyone, but I will this once.

429
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,800
Go back to your orphanage.

430
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,820
You'll get abandoned as soon as you're not useful here.

431
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,490
So don't have fantasies about things and don't snoop around, okay?

432
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,260
Yeah. I understand.

433
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,890
Unnie, you seem like a good person.

434
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,470
Otherwise, you wouldn't have saved me.

435
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,390

436
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,730
You're doing it again!

437
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,760
I told you to call me first before coming here.

438
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,930
Ha Ri.

439
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,670
Kang Ha Ri!  What's wrong with you?  Kang Ha Ri!

440
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,450
Ha Ri?   What's wrong?

441
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,730
Ha Ri, are you okay?

442
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,130

443
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,090

I got it. I'll go.

Keep your promise that you'll go back.

00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,140
 Mom.

477
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,650
How annoying.

478
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,620

479
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,980
What?

480
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,360
I've stayed up all night because of whom?

481
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,090
Did my voice just crack? The office is very dry.

482
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:27,080
So?  Who?  Byeon Yeong Ji?

483
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,140
If I find out about her and send the information to you, what will you do for me—

484
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,200
Such a rude punk. She's getting ruder.

485
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,830
Ai-Ai-Aigoo.

486
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,210

487
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,640
Well... I've not seen her in about 2 years.

488
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,260
She told you that she would come back here, didn't she?

489
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,090
Yes.

490
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:27,490
By the way, what relation do you have with Yeong Ji?

491
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,190
Just an acquaintance.

492
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:40,880
Anyhow, I looked for her here and there after she disappeared. I also filed a missing person report with the police.

493
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,590
She didn't make trouble when she was a kid, and she always followed me around, calling me dad.

494
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,390
Other kids also call you dad, Director.

495
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:54,670
Most of them do that. It's the same at any other orphanage.

496
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,690
We didn't do that.

497
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,520
We?

498
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,220
Never mind.

499
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,830
By any chance, were you raised in an orphanage?

500
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,950
That's why you paid more attention to Yeong Ji.

501
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:20,750
I also ran away from there at the age of 9, without knowing anything. I thought the outside world might be different.

502
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,240
Don't worry.

503
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,190
I believe Yeong Ji will come back.

504
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,840
Ha Ri, look at me. Ha Ri.

505
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:17,210
Ha Ri. Please look at me.

506
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:22,340
- Is it unbelievably amazing?
 - Yes. it's unbelievable.  Are you going to a cabaret to dance?

507
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,870
What do you know?

508
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,830
Speaking of, are you a dove or what?

509
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,170
You always wear white.

510
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:35,570
What do you know about fashion? It's all your negligence.

511
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:43,220
- Wow, it's ready.  Let's eat. Clean up.
 - Hey!

512
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:48,780
What is this? Chicken again? I've eaten so much chicken because of you, I think I'm going to lay eggs.

513
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,730
I specially put some oil on it today.

514
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,670
- Excuse me, I'll send a text to Ah Ryeong.
 - Go ahead.

515
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,840
- Ah Ryeong, buy a dish of pork cutlet on your way here—
 - Hey!

516
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,830
When a person cooks with sincerity, you should at least have a bite out of courtesy. Eat some.

517
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,020
How can you tell a human to eat that?

518
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,340
Ah Ryeong, you're here?

519
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,350
- Ah Ryeong, what do you think about me?
 - What about?

520
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,880
- I look different somehow, don't I?
 - Maybe.

521
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:19,550
Look at me from top to bottom and specifically.

522
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,020
You got uglier.

523
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,480
How is she getting cheekier every day?

524
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,480
Why do you look like that? Did something happen to you?

525
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,370
No.

526
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,010
- Is that something to throw away?
 - What do you mean "throwing away"?!

527
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:44,020
I've been cooking this since this morning. Try this, Ah Ryeong.

528
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,690
Here. I tried to dig out information of people nearby CEO Park.

529
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,950
The real estate is divided up into three big lots.

530
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:57,710
The first one in Nojin in his nephew's name.

531
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,830
Second one in Inkyung in his sister-in-law's name.

532
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:05,980
And the third one is in Namanju under his housemaid's name.

533
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:13,360
Who's this. You're good looking.

534
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,350
- The distance between them is pretty ambiguous. 
- Right.

535
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:27,150
It'll be hard to target one particular place.

536
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:30,690
Then the only way is to catch them and get the info out of them. Where are their whereabouts?

537
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,410
I don't know Managing Director Cho and Kim Ji Hoon's whereabouts right now.

538
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:38,070
I know only  Choi Yong Gyu's whereabouts.

539
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:43,540
While digging up their past, I found out that their organization has an autonomous and complex structure.

540
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:47,820
They work only when an order is given. They've never even met each other.

541
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,790
- They've never seen their faces?
 - You mean they don't know each other?

542
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,030
That's right.

543
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:57,160
Even if we disguise ourselves, Choi Yong Gyu won't recogniz—

544
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,570
Cha Ah Ryeong.

545
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,340
Are you listening?

546
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,500
Yes.

547
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,880
- You're acting strange today.
 -What do you mean?

548
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,690
Look, look, look at her attitude of talking!

549
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,170
We have a huge cash project in front of us, what are you doing?

550
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,790
Ah, he's whining about money again, seriously.

551
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:23,570
Then I'm whining on money because I'm here to make money. Do you know how hard I've worked on this briefing?

552
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:26,100
Hey, hey. Let's take a break.

553
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,610
You, seriously!

554
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,050
Hey! Let go of me!

555
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:37,010
Hey you pig, enough let go of me! Ah—

556
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,680
What's wrong? Did something happen?

557
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,330
Don't want to tell me?

558
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,660
If I do what will change?

559
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,640
Oh yeah?

560
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,430
Forget it. Let's just work.

561
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,220
Cha Ah Ryeong.

562
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:22,950
- I don't know why you're being like this—
 - Is money that important?

563
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,790
What do you mean?

564
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,960
I'll go get some fresh air.

565
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,560
 Hey, take it!

566
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,350
 Hey, get going. Go!

567
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:33,190
 Cha Ah Ryeong! Cha Ah Reyong, hurry! Hurry!

568
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,690
 Go quickly!

569
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,550
- Yes—
  - Unnie!

570
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,550
  Save me! Please save me!

571
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:41,800
Hello?

572
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,930
Yeong Ji, is this Yeong Ji?

573
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:46,450
  I'm so scared, Unnie. Please help me!

574
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:49,200
Y-Yeong Ji, what's wrong? What happened, what's going on?

575
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,700
 The person from yesterday chased me...

576
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,840
Yesterday?

577
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,860
- Yeong Ji, tell me properly, okay?
  - Ah! Aah...

578
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,300
Yeong Ji! Yeong Ji, what's wrong?

579
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,860
  Between you and me we don't need to talk much.

580
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,870
You decide if your'e going to save this b**** or not.

581
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:08,360
You, don't you touch her!

582
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,970
That girl has nothing to do with me—

583
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:12,710
Hey. Hey!

584
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:47,440

585
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:07,330
Yo! You came. How is it? It's been a while since you came home.

586
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,530
Where's Yeong Ji?

587
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,630
Ah why are you in such a hurry?  What a hot temper.

588
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,490
Where is she?

589
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:16,250
Don't worry. I sent her to a good place.

590
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,230
What do you want?

591
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:20,820
Oh.... I have a job for you.

592
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:28,880
President Nam has such an important job, that he wants you to be the one to do it.

593
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,060
There are already so many people who want you.

594
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,510
He'll do odd jobs.

595
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:43,530
Bring a few more guys and come back.

596
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:47,150
Don't even think about doing useless things.

597
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,180
Cha Ah Ryeong.

598
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,490
You should leave your cell phone.

599
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,050
- Not answering?
 - Yeah.

600
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,710
Ah, forget it, don't! Tell her not to come.

601
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,150
Why are you acting like that? She's just a kid.

602
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,930
What do you mean "kid"? She's already all grown up.

603
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:25,580
Are you mad?

604
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,230
I-I mean, why would I be mad?

605
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,700
Just... So just what?

606
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,830
Ah, things are just like that.

607
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,200
Hey, there's no time, let's start without her first.

608
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,840
- How about driving?
 - I'll do it.

609
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,010
Let's go.

610
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:57,020

611
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:06,410
Yes.  I'm done taking out the money.

612
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,890
Yeah.

613
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,280
Have you been well?

614
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,650
You look good.

615
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:23,790
Who are you?

616
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:26,330
What do you mean who am I?  I'm here to claim my money.

617
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:30,390

618
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:37,120
Ah, jeez.

619
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,630
Get in!

620
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,890
Yes boss... I prepared everything like you said.

621
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:01,780
Take care of it with no mistakes. This is important.

622
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,950
Proceed, please.

623
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:14,980
Are you sure?

624
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:18,230
She's the best driver I know.

625
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,890
Is anything showing up?

626
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:31,460
No, it's so clean.

627
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:37,360
Ah really. That punk doesn't open his mouth no matter what I do.

628
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,380
I guess he really doesn't know.

629
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,790
It seems so.

630
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:44,320
Did we approach it the wrong way?

631
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:49,380
Huh? Hey, this is odd. This is from unknown caller ID.

632
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,950
Look at this.

633
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,210

634
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,220
What is this?

635
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,850
These must be famous restaurants.

636
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,750
Do I look pathetic to you?

637
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,490
Spicy Beef Soup in Inkyeon is famously delicious. Don't you know?

638
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:08,340
Hey, hold on. Search the news.

639
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,320
Hurry, hurry! Get it, hurry!

640
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,940
Which one?

641
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,590
Hurry up.

642
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,770
Oh, hold on.

643
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:22,610
President Park Hyeon Jong... Beef bone soup.

644
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:25,250
Beef bone soup... Hey where was that beef bone soup place earlier?

645
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,570

646
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:29,300
Everybody says that Nojin's is delicous...

647
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,770
Nojin?

648
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:33,400
Hey, it's Nojin!  Let's go!  Hurry, hurry!

649
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,800
Hey, follow me!

650
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,230
Hey, hey, close the door!

651
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,360
Hey,  what, what? Are we going to eat Beef bone soup?

652
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,690
Ah, really. Look at how they use their brains...

653
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,740
Beef bone soup?

654
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,420
You said they were famous restaurants locations.

655
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,880
When did I?

656
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,120
Earlier.

657
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,650
When did I say that? You're saying nonsense.

658
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:59,100
Hey, that's the place! It's the same.

659
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:06,330
Jin Woong,  you can see the hanging road sign straight? Turn right there—

660
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,330
Wait. Hey.

661
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,460
Isn't that Managing Director Cho?

662
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,520

663
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:19,190
I can't really see him clearly, but I think it's him.

664
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:20,150
 Ha Ri, should I catch him?

665
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:23,090
No, let's follow him first.

666
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:46,660
Ah, why are there so many?

667
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,770
It's 20 billion won.

668
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,530
- Are you scared?
 - It's not scary.

669
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:50,750
- Yes. You're scared.
 - I just asked why so many.

670
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,110
Hey, stop.

671
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:54,210
If we unnecessarily do anything now, we could ruin everything.

672
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,150
What should we do?

673
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:57,890
We should call the police.

674
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:58,860
Police?

675
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,870
When can we use our tax money if we don't use it at a time like this?

676
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,400
But would the police come quickly?

677
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,560
I think they'll run away before the police arrives.

678
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,270
We can make them come quickly.

679
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,450
Ah there're really so many.

680
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:14,280
I think we need to make it an urgent situation.

681
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,880
Hey, you try doing a woman's voice.

682
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,890
Why should I?

683
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:21,160
Should he do it?

684
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,260
Don't smile you pig, you do it!

685
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,070
Then you do it!

686
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,630
Aish!

687
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,720
Hey, hey, practice first.

688
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,400
- Hurry practice.
 - Ah, ah.

689
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,260
Ah gross, hurry up.

690
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,160
- I should do it right.
 - I got it.

691
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,650
- I'll do it.
 - Okay, okay.

692
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,570
- This is the police, please go ahead and speak.
  - Hello, is this the police—

693
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:43,200
Please speak slowly, what's the problem?

694
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,580
Yes, hello.

695
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:48,210
Gangsters are fighting, beating, hitting—

696
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:50,510
Ow!

697
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:53,130
Quietly! Shh.

698
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,260
Yes— Ow!

699
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,630
Ah! Hurry and come please!

700
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:01,710
Is it enough? You punk!

701
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,890
Ah those bastards, what are they holding?

702
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:10,480
That's why I said let's go ahead first.

703
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,420
Korean police are like this.

704
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,220
Police are coming fast.

705
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,290
They're here, they're here!

706
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:19,410
Hey, get in the car quickly! Move!

707
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,630
They're running away! You guys follow Cho, all right?

708
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:22,990
Which one are you following?

709
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,110
Of course, the money.

710
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:26,690
Sounds like Ha Ri.

711
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,700
Good, what are you going to do when we're following you?

712
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,230
What the!

713
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:28,990

714
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:34,590
♫  If you lose your everything  ♫

715
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:39,310
♫  Think you can’t go back to the time  ♫

716
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:43,890
♫  Keep in mind, it’s not your fault  ♫

717
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,750
♫  In the end, I am gonna be with you  ♫

718
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,280
♫  Just walk without thinking, when you lose  ♫

719
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,070
♫  Fall, fall as far as you can, when you get further from happiness  ♫

720
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,720
♫  Without a destination, when you hurriedly run  ♫

721
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,420
♫  I be here with you all time  ♫

722
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,450
♫  Everything's alright  ♫

723
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:58,720
♫  There's no wrong no rights  ♫

724
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,900
♫  The road I take and the place I want to go  ♫

725
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,130
♫  As I wander between, the ambiguous boundary  ♫

726
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,790
♫  I don't need anything else, I just wanna fly one day  ♫

727
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,310
 What do you guys think of Ah Ryeong?

728
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:10,210
 You mean there is a mastermind behind it?

729
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:12,690
 It seems that he barely shows up at the front.

730
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:13,650
 What's his specialty?

731
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:16,760
 You can think of him as a mutt that does everything for money.

732
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,520
 Ah Ryeong? She looks like Ah Ryeong, doesn't she?

733
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,780
 If I interrogate Baek Seon, I might be able to track "the man".

734
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,920
 There are guys who keep snooping around us. Get rid of them quietly.

735
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,680
 If you even lay a finger on her, I'll—

736
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,100
 Should I call you Baek Seon now?

737
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,840
 Baek Seon. Let's take the easy route.

738
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,070
♫  Keep in mind, it’s not your fault  ♫
