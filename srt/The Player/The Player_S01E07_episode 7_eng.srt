1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,250

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,850

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,140

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,170

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,120

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,840

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,620

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,020

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,990

10
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:55,610
Dear honorable citizens and party members,

11
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,890
I'm Kim Seong Jin, Mi Chan Party's presidential candidate.

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,110
If you vote for me in the upcoming primaries,

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,580
I will definitely return as president!

14
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,350
For the people who are neglected, for the youths who cannot dream of their future,

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,660
I will become a president who will wipe away their tears!

16
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,350
I will always lower myself below the people,

17
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,030
serve the people diligently,

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,610
and most importantly, I will create a world where women will feel safe!

19
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,670
Kim Seong Jin for President!

20
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,260
 Kim Seong Jin! Kim Seong Jin! Kim Seong Jin!

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,950
Hey, come here!

22
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,340
Do you think you'll be able to survive in this country after doing this to me?!

23
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,890
Aish!

24
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,350
Who is this?

25
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,250
I don't want anything,

26
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,030
I went there to assist him, not to sell my body!

27
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,190
What?

28
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,940
How can you say that?

29
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,010
Look Ma'am, the things you all are doing are disgusting.

30
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,290
Do you think money can solve everything?

31
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,190
I'm going to sue, just know that!

32
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,350
Ms. Yang Hye Joo.

33
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,440
Who are you?

34
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,530
We're the police. We received a report.

35
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,070
What? Report?

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,980
Excuse me.

37
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,390
Why are you doing this?

38
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,950
Stay still.

39
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,900
Look. This is yours, right? Huh?

40
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,450
Yes.

41
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,740
I found it!

42
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,370
You're being arrested for possession of drugs.

43
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,290
What?

44
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,860
You have the right to a lawyer.

45
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,190
You have the right against self-incrimination.

46
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,360
You have the right to remain silent, alright?

47
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,160
Let's go.

48
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,010
Why suddenly drugs? Why are you doing this?

49
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,280
By any chance, did Assemblyman Kim Seong Jin order you to do this?

50
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,770
Is the Assemblyman your friend?

51
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,080
Escort her.

52
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,270
Let go! Let go of me!

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,150
 Ahh!

54
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,790
What?

55
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,400
What is it?

56
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,130
I thought I was going to have a heart attack.

57
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,730
A ghost suddenly popped up! I got it now, I got it.

58
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,620
- I got it— 
 - I was shocked, you otaku!

59
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,850
Why did you hit me?

60
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,250
If you were shocked, then you're just shocked! Why hit me?!

61
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,600
How's unpacking?

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,400
Yes. The boiler for the shower is broken though.

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,980
Men use cold water.

64
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,620
What are you doing? That's baby oil?

65
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,180
I'm more sensitive than I look because I have baby skin.

66
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,050
How peculiar.

67
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,910
- Byeong Min, put this on for me.
 - I'm busy.

68
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,620
- I can't reach there. 
 - I said I'm busy.

69
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,470
- Just here—
 - Just lose some weight then!

70
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,050
Maybe I'll just slather you up in oil and roast you.

71
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,840
What are you doing?

72
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,900
Lecture on law? I guess you're different.

73
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,560
Knowledge is power.

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,130
Isn't this really expensive?! Can I try some?

75
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,750
What is this? It's so bland.

76
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,590
Yeah, it's barley tea.

77
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,640
Why would you drink barley tea out of this?

78
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,630
It's got romance.

79
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,600
You're all so strange. How is no one here normal?

80
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,940
Did you just realize that?

81
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,330
The strangest person is here.

82
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,730
Two briefcases containing money were discovered in lockers at Hannam station.

83
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,740
One million each, $2 million total.

84
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,160
What a waste! I was there a few days ago!

85
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,540
- You should've gone yesterday. 
 - I was busy.

86
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,160
- Playing games?
 - Yes.

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,610
What about that money?

88
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,210
After searching through the security cameras to look for its owner,

89
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,260
a familiar face appeared.

90
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,320
- Section Chief. 
 - Yes, sir.

91
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,520
Isn't that President Nam?

92
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,810
Yeah, he's the guy who was under Baek Seon.

93
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,980
This was recorded more than a week ago.

94
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,800
He didn't have a car and moved hurriedly using the subway.

95
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,260
According to his transportation card's history, we've confirmed that he got off two stops over at Yongin.

96
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,020
Wait a minute, it's not even that far.

97
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,070
Why didn't he come back for the money?

98
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,920
When I was there a few days ago, I should've just...

99
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,260
It's not because I find it a waste...

100
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,270
It's not that he didn't come, he couldn't come

101
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,950
because he was afraid he would be murdered like Baek Seon.

102
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,130
Murdered?

103
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,590
Isn't the story obvious?

104
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,810
Although Baek Seon asked or threatened so much to get released, they even didn't think releasing him.  So he took action

105
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,090
and the men who accepted the money murdered Baek Seon before he opened his mouth.

106
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,780
President Nam, who knows all of this,

107
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,080
has also become a target.

108
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,230
After investigating the source of the money,

109
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,670
something interesting showed up.

110
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,210
Now, this is the secret ledger that was discovered in Baek Seon's safe.

111
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,400
The expected withdrawal amount located at the bottom of the ledger

112
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,850
and the money in the bag match up perfectly.

113
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,170
The recipient is Kim Seong Jin.

114
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,570
Kim Seong Jin, Kim Seong Jin, I've heard that name somewhere.

115
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,610
In the ground battle! The one ranked first in nation! A new face, Kim Seong Jin!

116
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,020
Mi Chang Party's Kim Seong Jin!  You idiot!

117
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,390
Really? Isn't he a presidential candidate?

118
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,520
Not yet, he's in the middle of running in the primary election.

119
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,300
He does have a good advantage, though.

120
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,890
Anyway, there's a high chance this money is a part of his illegal campaign funds.

121
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,750
On top of that, Baek Seon wouldn't have been the only one to offer him funds.

122
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,640
The total amount would be more than we could imagine.

123
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,440
This is a jackpot.

124
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,520
I didn't like that bastard to start with.

125
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,570
- You feeling it? 
 - Of course, we'll take this.

126
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,990
I'm not doing it.

127
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,080
What?

128
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,810
I said I'm not going to do it.

129
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,950
He came to us with all of this prepared. Why wouldn't you do it?

130
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,760
Isn't it enough that we caught President Park and Baek Seon for you?

131
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,050
You should do the dishes yourself.

132
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,280
Still, you're a stand-out con artist. Shouldn't you accept a project of this scale?

133
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,920
No, no, no. It's big, too big.

134
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,820
Why would we mess with a presidential candidate? That should be decided with votes in a democratic country.

135
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,380
He can look for President Nam.

136
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,620
Do things by the book.

137
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,110
What, you jerk?! I should jus—

138
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,990
Section Chief.

139
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,990
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,900
If you keep being difficult, it'll get tiring.

141
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,000
This life is already tiring as it is. Nothing will change just because it gets a little more tiring.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,050
- That mouth, I should just— 
 - Section Chief.

143
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,020
- How dare you act so impudent in front of the prosecutor— 
 - Section Chief.

144
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,390
- I should just rip out your tongue— 
 - Section Chief!

145
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,980
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,400
Really?

147
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,350
- Then we have no choice. 
 - Huh?

148
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,720
- Section Chief.
 - I'm sorry.

149
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,880
- Ah, come here! You're being arrested on charges of—
 - Ah, ah, S-Section Chief!

150
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,700
- Let go, you bastard! Let go!
 - Calm down, calm down.

151
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,440
- Okay, okay, okay. 
- Let go, let go.

152
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,650
I get it. So for now, you two can leave. Okay?

153
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,720
Don't worry. He acts like this now but he'll do it in the end.

154
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,650
Yeah, he'll do it. This is just his habit.

155
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,100
He thinks he's cool if he does this.

156
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,450
You heard that, right? You're not cool at all!

157
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,720
All of them are on my side right now!

158
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,460
Fix the way you talk, alright?!

159
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,960
Sure, sure, take care.

160
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,060
Take care.

161
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,370
Let's go.

162
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,640
Go ahead. Goodbye.

163
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,810
- Goodbye.
 - Goodbye.

164
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,610
Hey! Seriously, why are you doing this? Huh?

165
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,770
You like big projects. Can't you just do it?

166
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,210
Work hard.

167
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,690
You're really not doing it?

168
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,500
No, I'll cheer you all on. Good luck!

169
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:03,390

170
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,350
Thank you for the lecture, Lawyer.

171
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,010
It was nothing.

172
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,930
We can start filming next week, right?

173
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,040
Yes, well, that would be fine.

174
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,470
It's my first time being a fixed cast member so I'm worried I won't be of much help.

175
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,460
Of course not, you're such a fluent speaker.

176
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,050
You can just act comfortably, as you always do.

177
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,710
What did I do wrong?! The media exists to make stories like this known! I won't leave!

178
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,410
- Still, let's talk outside. You can't do this here! 
 - No! No, I can't go, I won't.

179
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,280
Excuse me! What exactly are you people doing?

180
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,980
Don't you know one-person protests are legal?

181
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,370
Why are you taking pictures?

182
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,640
She's being peaceful. Is there anything wrong with it?

183
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,800
Please let me be. You guys, give me your names.

184
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,280
These people, seriously! Do you know what year it is?

185
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,650
Excuse me! Where are you running off to? Excuse me!

186
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,290
Hey, excuse me!

187
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,760
Thank you! Thank you so much!

188
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,680
Ah yes, yes. Aigoo... Ah.

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:13,020
Excuse me, I don't know what's going on, but if you need help, please contact me.

190
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,950
Ah, yes.

191
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,060
I'm a lawyer. I'm very good in this line of work.

192
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,210
- Yes. 
- Yes.

193
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,050
Well then, see you next week.

194
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,860
- Yes, see you next week! 
- Yes.

195
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,110
Excuse me, Lawyer, sir.

196
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,400
I... If you don't mind, would you listen to my story...

197
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,530
- Come in, yes, yes.
 - Yes.

198
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,970
Aigoo...

199
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,400
- Sit down, make yourself comfortable. 
 - Thank you.

200
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:05,050
So, your daughter, unfairly,

201
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,380
was swept up in a drug case, right?

202
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,190
She is also suspected of having used the drug?

203
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,600
Yes, my daughter is definitely not that kind of person.

204
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,230
She had a weak heart since she was young so she was careful about the medicine she took.

205
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,530
How could someone like her do drugs?

206
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,250
And the person your daughter claims who sexually assaulted her

207
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,860
is Assemblyman Kim Seong Jin?

208
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,390
Yes.

209
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,610
Then I guess he was the one who framed her.

210
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,650
Have you spread this on the Internet?

211
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,810
I'm not good with computers

212
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,920
so I did ask my niece to upload it for me.

213
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,330
Then you must cancel that first.

214
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,160
If this goes wrong, then we can get in trouble for spreading false truths and defamation.

215
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,130
- Then, what can we do?
 - Ahh... for this,

216
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,700
we have to look for another way.

217
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,790
By any chance, was there a witness

218
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,820
or someone who can testify in court?

219
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,710
Someone called me yesterday.

220
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,010
It was some woman and she said she would testify if needed.

221
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,530
Um, Lawyer.

222
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,820
Would it be expensive if we sue? Our financial situation is a bit...

223
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,970
Don't worry. We need to clear your daughter's charges first.

224
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,910
But still...

225
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:02,840
Mother, people come first. Money comes after that.

226
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:14,120
May I know the contact information of the woman who agreed to testify?

227
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,690
Of course. She called me yesterday so her number should be saved.

228
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,830
President Nam hid himself well. His phone is off, and he's not even checking his emails.

229
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,580
Is there no way to track him down?

230
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,550
- I don't know. How do we approach this? 
 - Hey,

231
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,760
should I just let some guys I know loose to search around for him?

232
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,790
It'll take too long. He could've gone somewhere else by now.

233
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,280
Isn't there anything strange on Kim Seong Jin's side?

234
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,500
Well, there's no special movement aside from his schedules in Gyeongsang Province.

235
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,650
Someone filed a complaint against him recently but it has nothing to do with President Nam.

236
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,810
- Complaint? 
 - Yeah.

237
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,910
There's a woman who's being investigated on possession of drugs. She's claiming that Kim Seong Jin sexually assaulted her.

238
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,500
She said that he framed her to keep her quiet about that incident or whatever.

239
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,320
I know that those bastards are all the same

240
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,000
but at a sensitive time like this, wouldn't he know to be careful?

241
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,080
Why would he sexually assault someone before an election campaign?

242
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,360
Right? If the reporters knew, they would've ripped it apart like dogs.

243
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,090
They probably know he's the next big shot so they're staying quiet.

244
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,230
Then should we start moving first, on an exploratory level?

245
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,370
Exploratory?

246
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,330
Even if we stay here like this, we're not going to find the answer.

247
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,820
I don't even know where to start!

248
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,280
Are you really not going to cooperate?

249
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,920
- I said that I would cheer you on. 
 - Is this something that can be accomplished with your cheers?!

250
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,260
I'll encourage you as well.

251
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,900
Ah, this bastard. Seriously, aish.

252
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,950
Thinking about it now,

253
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,450
I think the risks are too big. Do we have to do it? Can't we just not do it?

254
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,820
Why are you like this all of a sudden? Because you're Kang Ha Ri's subordinate, you can't act on your own without his order?

255
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:03,000
Subordinate? I'm his subordinate? He can't do anything without me.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,570
That's such a fresh thought.

257
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,820
Frankly speaking, I hack into encrypted systems and get him the files he needs.

258
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,330
I track locations, unlock phone passwords, unlock other passwords.

259
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:19,190
Last time when our entire plan was almost ruined, I turned on the smart TV to show you!

260
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,000
You were shocked, asking how such a thing exists. You were like a child back then.

261
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,950
Who was the one who saved you from Chairman Cheon's grasp?

262
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,460
Hey, you didn't get me out. You scouted me. Why?

263
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,360
Because my skills are unique, incredibly special.

264
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,190
Now that we're talking about it, I think I'm above him.

265
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,060
That's what you think? Hm...

266
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,260
Fine.

267
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:52,810
Im Byeong Min, fine. Should we make a bet on who unlocks this phone first?

268
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,380
Will you be okay? That's my specialty.

269
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,550
- You two think he's going to win too, right? 
 - Of course!

270
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,180
- He's our hacking master!
 - Aigoo, master?

271
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,060
Fine, I'll admit that I'm below you. Instead,

272
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,730
if I win, you keep me out of this. Okay?

273
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,820
Oh, of course. I would thank you for that.

274
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,090
Okay.

275
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,320
Deal!

276
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,800
So this is how our hierarchy gets organized.

277
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,580
- Let's see, give me a minute. 
 - Byeong Min, just prepare lightly.

278
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,320
- If I win, you use honorifics with me.
 - Okay.  I'll do it.

279
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,840
How did you take so many pictures of K-rock?

280
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,730
- What the heck? 
 - What's with your expression? Are you acting cute?

281
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,250
Huh? I just—

282
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,380
- Give it to me.
 - Whoa...

283
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,790
How did you do it?

284
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,930
Now, work hard. Good luck!

285
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,770
You told him the password, didn't you?

286
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,960
This really won't do.

287
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,620
Hey, Ha Ri! Come here for a minute.

288
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,700
What is this? Hey, hey!

289
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:02,530
Hey, pig! Don't use your strength on me! Ow!

290
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,730
H-How did he do this? Huh?

291
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,070
Silence!

292
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,660
Defense, I'm warning you once again.

293
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,830
Witness, you'll be punished for perjury if you make a false statement.

294
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,160
Yes.

295
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,230
Continue.

296
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,260
Was it three months ago? She asked me to lend her money.

297
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:29,750
When I asked her what she was planning to use it on, she wouldn't tell me. She acted as if she was being chased.

298
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,000
Since then, she continuously called me to borrow money

299
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,480
and asked me to introduce her to rich men.

300
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,750
She wasn't like this before. I didn't think that it would be because of drugs—

301
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,720
- Don't lie! When did I ever do that?! 
 - Defense!

302
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,450
Are you going to keep making a disturbance?! This is your last warning.

303
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,130
Fine, I said I got it!

304
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,510
I'd rather trust cults over you.

305
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,290
- How is it going?
 - It definitely smells a bit fishy.

306
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,510
But the lawyer is defending her in his own way.

307
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,240
Really?

308
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,590
Okay.

309
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,570
Lawyer for the defendant, state your defense.

310
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:31,330
Since the defendant was a child, she's had a weak heart as a result of a cardiac disease.

311
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,980
This is a note from a professional.

312
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:41,040
Different from the plaintiff's assertion, it states that had the defendant used drugs,

313
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,630
there would've been a high chance of it being fatal.

314
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,460
So there is little chance of her actually using it.

315
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,920
Also, no traces of drugs were found in her blood.

316
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,950
And because there are no accounts found with drug transactions,

317
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,340
we argue that the defendant is innocent.

318
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:11,440
Continuing on, we request a witness who will testify that she has been framed.

319
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,550
Yes, I accept your request.

320
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,420
The witness trial will be held next Monday.

321
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,020

322
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,180
Good work.

323
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:34,200
Hye Joo. Eat your meals, stay strong.

324
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,710
Aigoo, ma'am, you came.

325
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,700
My daughter will be released, right?

326
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,830
Of course, I'll make sure she's released. Don't worry.

327
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,620
Thank you so much!

328
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,940
- Thank you so much!
 - Go ahead.

329
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,660
Yes, yes.

330
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,650
After hearing his story, I can understand why Baek Seon was murdered.

331
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,510
Does that mean anyone who becomes a bother will be buried?

332
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,940
- Yeah, let's just drop this project now. 
 - Aish!

333
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,880
Why are you only acting like that to me? He said the same.

334
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,550
Let's do it!

335
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,300
- Aish!
 - Really?

336
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,450
Yeah, let's do this project.

337
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,800
Why all of a sudden? Didn't you say it was too big?

338
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,090
If you think about it, he's just a civil servant.

339
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,730
Right. You find out about the ones who were involved in arresting her.

340
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,310
Kim Seong Jin's side might have pressured them into doing it.

341
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,370
And Byeong Min, stake out President Nam's house.

342
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,600
If you do open hacking, you'll be able to catch phone calls from his family members, right?

343
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,570
Hey, why do you keep changing your mind?

344
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,550
Why do you always make me stake out?!

345
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,250
Because you're special.

346
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,650
Okay, I'll do it.

347
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,720
Hold on, what are you going to do?

348
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,870
- I'm going to talk with the defendant. 
 - Why that woman?

349
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,440
Don't we just need to check the campaign funds?

350
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,430
Because she's pretty!

351
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,000
- Let's go together.
 - Me too. 
 - Sit down!

352
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,680
I don't know what goes on in his mind.

353
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,240
You guys suck.

354
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,670
Where are you going? You suck.

355
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,350
Ms. Yang Hye Joo?

356
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,670
Who are you?

357
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,890
I'm here from the prosecution office.

358
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,030
You seem to have a complicated relationship with Assemblyman Kim Seong Jin.

359
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,780
You've been through a lot.

360
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,990
What do you want?

361
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,710
We're investigating him for gathering illegal campaign funds.

362
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,350
He has to pay for his crimes.

363
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,270
You all only look for me when you need me.

364
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,220
Just a moment.

365
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,290
Nothing changes if you just leave it like this!

366
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,420
It'll become harder for everyone, not just you.

367
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,060
Ignoring and degrading those below him, playing around with the world as he wishes,

368
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,420
we have to stop him from doing that any longer.

369
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,850
Um... Although it may be very uncomfortable,

370
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:36,580
what happened that day, please tell me about it.

371
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,820
  Assemblyman!

372
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,910
  Assemblyman? I brought the files you requested.

373
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,990
  Oh, come in.

374
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,450
  Assemblyman!

375
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,500
  Assemblyman?

376
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,840
  Assemblyman?

377
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,170
  Oh, you're here.

378
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,080
  Why? Are you surprised?

379
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,750
  What are you doing?

380
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,480
  What do you mean? I washed up first.

381
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,910
  You too, wash up, now.

382
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,890
  What?

383
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,400
  You didn't hear from the general manager?

384
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,920
  Am I moving too fast?

385
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,830
 I'm leaving.

386
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,290
  - Where are you going?
 - Why are you doing this?!

387
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,980
  You're acting expensive for an intern.

388
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,050
  Don't you know who I am?

389
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,450
  If you keep acting like this—

390
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,730
  Let go of me!

391
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,720
  That—

392
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,990
 Hey, come here!

393
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,820
 Do you think you'll be able to survive in this country after doing this to me?!

394
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,660
After that, Assemblyman Kim Seong Jin's wife called me.

395
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,460
His wife?

396
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,900

397
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,990
  Ms. Yang Hye Joo?

398
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,280
  Who is this?

399
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,920

400
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,410
  I'm Assemblyman Kim Seong Jin's wife.

401
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,790
  I heard something unpleasant happened.

402
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,210
  Let's not blow this up and solve it nicely.

403
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,910
  I'll give you as much money as you want.

404
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,530
  I don't want anything.

405
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,410
  I went there to assist him, not to sell my body!

406
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,010
  You slept with him, didn't you?

407
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,580
  What?

408
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,870
 Did you like it? Sharing a bed with the future president?

409
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,810
  How can you say that?

410
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:15,450
  You must think that you're worth something just because he paid some attention to you.

411
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,410
  Just bow your head and take the money while I'm being nice.

412
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,920
  If you want to live in Korea, that is.

413
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,280
  Do you understand, Ms. Yang Hye Joo?

414
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,830
Still, you insisted on reporting it

415
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,470
and as a result, he framed you to keep you quiet.

416
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,900
Do you have a recording of the phone call with his wife?

417
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,130
No, I didn't have a chance to.

418
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,950
Prosecutor.

419
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,530
What?

420
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,380
Have I done something useless?

421
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,340
Even after experiencing something like this, should I have just kept quiet?

422
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,650
Like that woman said,

423
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,620
have I become like this because of my useless pride?

424
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,690
No. You did well.

425
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,500
But why?

426
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,100
Why did it end up like this?

427
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,260
Don't worry.

428
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,180
I'll reveal the truth no matter what.

429
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,550
General Manager, sir! This has something to do with one of your subordinates.

430
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,110
We'll protect your identity,

431
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:59,610
so if you just tell us the truth—

432
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,540
You're from Myeongsung Daily?

433
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,130
Yes, I'm Kim Kwan.

434
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,350
Reporters, I'm not sure what you heard to come here,

435
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,200
but if you're a reporter, write articles like a reporter

436
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,720
instead of writing novels.

437
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,080
And while you're at it, stop building your body.

438
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,710
What?

439
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,880
- General Manager! 
 - General Manager!

440
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,250
- General Manager! 
 - General Manager! Sir!

441
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,790
- We're... 
 - Excuse me!

442
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,220
General Manager, we're—

443
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,470
You, aish!

444
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,580
Lose some weight! Try this, raise the camera like this.

445
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,780
I can take the picture!

446
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,920
Raise it to your face!

447
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,910
- I can just lower my head. 
 - Why would you lower your head?

448
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,770
It's muscle.

449
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,000
Byeong Min, you look cool today.

450
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,480
Hey!

451
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,300
Again, again, right there! Good!

452
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,780
Look here. One, two...

453
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,040
Okay! Yes.

454
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,280
Let me see, I want to see.

455
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,490
Okay, one, two, three.

456
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,990
Excuse me, we're not even asking you to attend. We're just asking you to testify as to what really happened.

457
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,880
I have nothing to say!

458
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,580
Still, the person you interned with is in jail right now.

459
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,690
You two should be helping each other out during hard times—

460
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,910
Are you really from the prosecution department?

461
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:26,390
What? Yes! My ID is...

462
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,890
Excuse me! Wait a minute, excuse me!

463
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,100
Wait a minute!

464
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,540
How are people so merciless?

465
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,680
I don't know if they're acting like this because they're afraid they'll get hurt or if it's because they accepted a bribe.

466
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,430
You don't think I look like a reporter either?

467
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,340
For a reporter, you're quite tough-looking.

468
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,620
Maybe I should've worn a wig?

469
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,360
Whatever you wear, you're going to look like a gangster.

470
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,430
Go stake out!

471
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,400
Are you crazy? You want me to do that alone?

472
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,420
What about me? Don't I look like an investigator for the prosecution?

473
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,320
- You just look young. 
- And rude.

474
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
Ugh, seriously!

475
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,750
He should do some of this himself. What are we doing right now?

476
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,580
I know. When is Ha Ri oppa coming?

477
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,470
I don't know.

478
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,420
He told us to go in first. He said he was going to meet some girl you met.

479
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,200
That woman was completely walled off though.

480
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,080
Don't you think he'll be completely rejected this time?

481
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,080
- If so, I'd like that!
 - Me too!
 - Me too.

482
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,780
- Me too.
 - You too? 
 - Me too.

483
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,000
- Me too!
 - Me too.

484
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,530
Me too?

485
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,480
- Ugh, you look gross. 
 - How childish, seriously!

486
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,540
Pig, you too.

487
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,870
I almost had it!

488
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,280
Here, now it's your turn.

489
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,080
Okay.

490
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,360
So I just have to move it over here and drink it?

491
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,880
Instead, you can't use your hands.

492
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,720
Of course!

493
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,950
Here I go.

494
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,360
- Ugh!
 - Now,

495
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,150
one shot!

496
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,930
There you go.

497
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,410
Again, again! A different game.

498
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,550
Now, this time...

499
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,860
The arrow of love is going!

500
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,210
Looks like you wanted to drink.

501
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:05,110
Was I mean? I keep feeling guilty.

502
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,320
Hye Joo was a nice girl.

503
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,950
No, no.

504
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,990
He said he would give you a permanent job. Who would've rejected that? I would've done the same.

505
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,590
You understand me, don't you?

506
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,590
Of course!

507
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,120
It's strange. I'm usually pretty shy.

508
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,660
I don't talk about my feelings often either.

509
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,630
But I'm comfortable with you.

510
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,910
I must be drunk.

511
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,770
Are you okay?

512
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:53,100
♫  All you are is fine caviar  ♫

513
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:59,470
♫  And every sweet word I can see  ♫

514
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,100
I'm going to the restroom.

515
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:27,940

516
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,620
Okay.

517
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,790
Excuse me.

518
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,490
I think that woman dropped her phone.

519
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,710
- Could you give it to her? 
 - Of course.

520
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:15,120
  Study the provided content well. I'll meet you in court.

521
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,460
  The promised amount and recruitment offer will proceed as planned.

522
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,540
These bastards are too much!

523
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,820
It wouldn't be enough if they apologized but they invited a witness and paid her to perjure herself?!

524
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,950
And that wife of his. Exactly what does she do that she keeps butting in?!

525
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,540
There are rumors that she's the one who manages his slush funds.

526
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,920
Since she can't trust anyone in this field,

527
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,450
she's taking care of it on her own.

528
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,030
What a great wife he has.

529
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:43,090
I don't understand those bastards who perjure even more. How could they sell out their colleagues over money?

530
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,470
Those trash bastards.

531
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,960
Who would decline the cash dancing right in front of their eyes?

532
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,120
It's human nature to keep quiet in front of injustice but not in front of disadvantages.

533
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,650
Still, how could they do that?

534
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,640
Should we just blow it up?

535
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,400
If we hand this information over to that lawyer, he can reveal everything in the trial.

536
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,020
Or we can threaten him a bit and lure him with cash.

537
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,420
They can just disassociate themselves from the slush fund and it'll be over.

538
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,590
We need more concrete evidence, evidence that no one can deny.

539
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,390
  Ask him for one more thing.

540
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,650
  What?

541
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:18,850
 We should let them know who this country belongs to.

542
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:23,100
I secretly recorded this when she made the phone call in the car.

543
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,450
And this.

544
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:34,060
This is a record of the slush funds the Madam has received until now.

545
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:39,290
I don't know the details of the person she threatened over the phone.

546
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:44,760
But every time something like this happens, she always cleans up after him.

547
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,540
That person?

548
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,750
I understand.

549
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,940
This will be of great help in the trial.

550
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:11,600
But... Will I be okay?

551
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,370
Don't worry.

552
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:19,460
A lawyer's ability to keep secrets is his life.

553
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,910
But Ms. Soo Ha Na,

554
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:29,640
may I ask you one thing?

555
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:36,230
Why did you decide to expose the person you serve?

556
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,730
Because they killed a person.

557
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,690
Those people did.

558
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,320
 Who are you bastard?

559
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,650
 Move your hand!

560
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,530
  Good work.

561
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,150
  We'll take care of President Nam.

562
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,710
  Take care of?

563
00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:01,060
  We have to cut the root. After all, he dared to open his mouth.

564
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,350
  Madam!

565
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:14,460
  Finish things up here. I despise cruel things.

566
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,820

567
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,250
  Run away, hurry.

568
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,080
  Catch him!

569
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,880
She'll do anything to become the First Lady.

570
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,410
We have to stop her here,

571
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,000
so there will be no more victims.

572
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,880
You prepared all this? You could've asked the ahjumma to do it.

573
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,910
It's been a while since you ate at home. Of course, I should be the one to prepare the food.

574
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:46,440
Goodness, my wrist is aching after shaking the hands of voters all day long.

575
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,300
Politicians should claim work compensation too.

576
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,110
About that girl,

577
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,890
I called her up purely for work.

578
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,690
I didn't know she would put on such a show.

579
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,540
You don't have to explain things to me.

580
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,350
You're not someone who would do something like that.

581
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:14,970
The funds are circulating without a problem and everyone is supporting you to the best of their abilities.

582
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,780
President Nam will be taken care of soon too.

583
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,960
I feel as if I've asked you to do something rough, I'm sorry.

584
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,410
If it's something that you need, of course, I should do it.

585
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:33,420
Especially because this is something others can't know about.

586
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:38,360
After all, isn't it for the country?

587
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:46,260
You seem more and more like a First Lady.

588
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,960
Really?

589
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,380
  I found President Nam.

590
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,870
How should I catch and kill these bastards?

591
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,910
Oppa, how is finding President Nam going so far?

592
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,630
I gained access to their phones and computers. I hacked into the public database too.

593
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,730
If someone contacts him, it'll pop up.

594
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,840
Really?

595
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,310
You don't believe me?

596
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,150
- Let's see.
 - What?

597
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,870
Ah, these guys, seriously.

598
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:30,890
- Do you know how diligently I've worked? I've even hacked into President Nam's wife's PC! 
 - Let's see it.

599
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,820
It's not that. Something has to come for me to show you. I did it, I swear I did—

600
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,930
It came! It's here!

601
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:42,100
I'm not lying, it's here! It's really here! I told you that it would come—

602
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,140

603
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,620
Why are you pushing me?

604
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,510
How rude.

605
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,660

606
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,460
  Just wait. I'll tell you everything when we meet.

607
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,680

608
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:11,160
  I'm sorry. Take good care of Seung Min. Erase the messages now.

609
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,800
  I'll see you soon.

610
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,730

611
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,710
Ok, I got his IP address.

612
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,450
- What about his location? 
 - Past Yangwon, near Yeonpo.

613
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,650
Good, let's go.

614
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,910
Alright, you can leave now.

615
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,150
Prosecutor Jang, you shouldn't be doing this.

616
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:11,290
Just because my name was written in a private loan business's ledger, you tell a busy person to come and go?

617
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,150
You're busy?

618
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,530
What?

619
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,820
Sit back down.

620
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,720
I said sit down.

621
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,160
I decide whether you're guilty or innocent.

622
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,000
Whether it's the truth or not,

623
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,210
I, a prosecutor of the Republic of South Korea, will decide in court.

624
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,580
So when the charges are revealed as the truth,

625
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:48,090
you'll become even busier because you'll have to shut down your business.

626
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,590
Leave.

627
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:02,070
Prosecutor, the con artist is calling.

628
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,510
What?

629
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,540
Yes, what? What's going on?

630
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,520
What?!

631
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,550
We're tracked down President Nam's whereabouts.

632
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,070
Yeah, I'll send the GPS coordinates. Okay.

633
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:21,230
- Byeong Min, send the address to Prosecutor Jang. 
 - I already did.

634
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,710
Ah Ryeong, how much longer?

635
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,040
If I step on it, fifteen minutes?

636
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,830
Okay! Step on it!

637
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:42,230
Section Chief Maeng, prepare the equipment. As soon as the location is confirmed, request back up.

638
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:43,910
We'll move out for now.

639
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:46,640
- Turn your walkie-talkies to channel 21! 
 - Channel 21!

640
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,330
Let's go!

641
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,570

642
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:59,080

643
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,450

644
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,900
Long time, no see, President Nam.

645
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,620
This bastard—

646
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,160
Clean it up.

647
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,340
Not here!

648
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,320
Not here either.

649
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,050
Where did this bastard go?

650
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,560
Excuse me,

651
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,950
Have you seen this person?

652
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,720
Oh, he left a little while ago?

653
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,600
- What?
 - Hey, let's go.

654
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,590
- We don't even know where he went off to! 
 - Come on, go!

655
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:32,520
In my opinion, he left in his car. He's gone now, not here.

656
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:37,240
- He couldn't have gone far. Byeong Min, follow me. You two, search over there. 
 - Okay!

657
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,630
Hey, wh-why would I follow you?

658
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,220
There!

659
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,080
What's that?

660
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,920

661
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,470

662
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,070
I think he's already been caught.

663
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,010
We were one step too late.

664
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,020
Ah, this is driving me crazy!

665
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,250
Are you the police?

666
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,450
Ah, are you the one who made the report?

667
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,410
I made the report long ago! Why are you only here now?

668
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:24,390
They dragged him away a long time ago.

669
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:25,420
They dragged him away?

670
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,610
Yes, some big men came in a group

671
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,810
and beat a man to a pulp.

672
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,960
Did you happen to see where he was dragged off to?

673
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,870
They went that way.

674
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,750
Thank you.

675
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,340
Let's go.

676
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:08,230
I'm disappointed, President Nam. I thought we were on the same boat.

677
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:17,240
I understand. After all, the man you served was murdered.

678
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,050
But what to do?

679
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:28,200
There are always consequences to your choices.

680
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,610
Do you think this situation will be resolved just because you do this?

681
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,120
The things you people have done—

682
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,320
What are you doing right now?

683
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,350
You might find this unfair

684
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,400
but this is the result of your choice.

685
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,970
How could you?

686
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,680
You can't do this to me!

687
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,450
Are you crazy? That shot will kill him.

688
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,400
Leave him alone.

689
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,400
Madam, still this is—

690
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,670
I said, leave him alone!

691
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,500
Seriously,

692
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,000
there's nothing in sight here.

693
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,390
Ah Ryeong, Ah Ryeong!

694
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,320
Over there, there! There, there, there!

695
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,910
Look over there. Isn't it that?

696
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,980
Turn the car around.

697
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,720
Okay.

698
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,880
Should we finish up?

699
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,810
No, I have to confirm something.

700
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,950
There's a traitor among us.

701
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:47,960
Have you been well?

702
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,580
Do you remember that rat bastard we talked about before? I'll show you all of my men,

703
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,940
so please pick him out.

704
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,550
Is it this guy?

705
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,290
This guy?

706
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,880
If not then...

707
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,580
This guy?

708
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,940
Then if it wasn't a guy...

709
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,560
Was it a girl?

710
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,690
 Ms. Soo Han Na, we meet again!

711
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:48,910
No... No, Madam it's not me, really!

712
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,370
Thank you, Lawyer.

713
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:52,990
How should I repay this gratitude?

714
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,420
 Ah, don't mention it.

715
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:59,720
 We're on the same boat after all, aren't we?

716
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,650
Madam, it really wasn't me!

717
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:06,190
It wasn't me. It wasn't me! Ah!

718
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:11,660
I don't know why b*tches these days are so rude.

719
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,730
They act as if they're the only clean ones.

720
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,420
Madam.

721
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,660
Finish things up here.

722
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,330
I despise things like this.

723
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:26,210
Madam!

724
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,970
Madam—

725
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:37,430

726
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,620
Stop the car here.

727
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:45,400
You go up first.

728
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,440
Yeah, where are you?

729
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,300
Warrant?

730
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:53,490
What warrant?! Ugh, seriously?!

731
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,290
- Where is he? 
 - Over there!

732
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:48,350
Wait.

733
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,620
No!

734
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,700
Come on, this way!

735
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,060
Hurry up!

736
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,450
- No! 
 - No!

737
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:12,970
In the end, everything happens the way you say it will.

738
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:20,900
Because I told her I'm a lawyer, she approached me first and told me everything.

739
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,480
She even delivered the evidence to me.

740
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:30,000
Now, we'll

741
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,380
wrap things up cleanly.

742
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:45,800
After all, you must be busy doing grand things.

743
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:52,240
Yes. I understand.

744
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:59,780

745
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,470
Call 911!

746
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:50,060

747
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:19,370
♫  If you lose your everything, think you can’t go back to the time  ♫

748
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:27,810
♫  Keep in mind, it’s not your fault ♫
 ♫ In the end, I am gonna be with you  ♫

749
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,280
♫  Just walk without thinking, when you lose  ♫

750
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,150
♫  Fall, fall as far as you can, when you get further from happiness  ♫

751
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:36,070
♫  Without a destination, when you hurriedly run, I be here with you all time  ♫

752
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:39,100

753
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,400
 Fi-Fifty million?!

754
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,080
 The entire prosecutor's office accepted bribes.

755
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,230
  Exactly how much more rotten must the situation become

756
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,330
  for us to investigate?

757
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,360
 Should we make him nervous?

758
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,600
  I'd love that.

759
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,190
 As a special, I investigated Kim Seong Jin

760
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,650
 for gathering illegal campaign funds.

761
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:53,500
 Hold on.

762
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,600
  - You. 
 - Pardon?

763
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,970
 If you don't trust me, just forget it.

764
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,730
  Must you really go this far?

765
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:00,980
  Will you be okay?

766
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:01,900
  Don't worry.

767
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:07,270
 Unless we end this evil cycle, we'll never be able to catch the mastermind.

768
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,930
♫  Think you can’t go back to the time  ♫
