1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,230

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,810

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,190

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,280

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,100

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,930

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:39,050

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,880

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,850

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,900
Why was Chairman Ji's list removed?

11
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,910
I don't know what you are talking about.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,560
I will say it again, so you understand what I am saying.

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,570
Why was the lobbying record found in the church's safe removed from the list of evidence?

14
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,470
Why are you bringing that up with me?

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,610
You said you were going to review it and took it, Deputy Chief.

16
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,400
What are you trying to do?

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,700
Aren't you embarrassed, Deputy Chief?

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,380
How dare you raise your voice when you've done no good, you bastard?

19
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,200
I didn't reprimand you for your unauthorized target investigation, and now you have no respect for your higher-ups?

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,930
- You gave the order, right?
 - What?

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,830
Ji Seong Goo and Chairman Ji were arrested with crucial proof, so nothing could be done about them.

22
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,970
So we should at least take good care of the politicians they have been supporting,

23
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,320
so that you can become Prosecutor General without concern, right?

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,500
You people are really something! Why don't you go amend the Constitution?

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,160
All sovereignty of Korea belongs to those in power, and all power comes from the chaebols.

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,050
You must be crazy. Do you want to be fired?

27
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,680
Yes!

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,160
I don't have any regrets as a prosecutor.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,530
But I can't leave like this.

30
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,430
If I go, when I go, I'll reveal and clean those dirty connections before I leave.

31
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,040
Just watch.

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,780
You! You bastard!

33
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,510

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,820
He didn't have to go to this extent.

35
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,090
He sometimes goes too overboard.

36
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,760
Is this Al Queda?

37
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,190
Where is it?

38
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,370

39
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,600
 Since you also illegally locked someone up,

40
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,370
 let's just call it even.

41
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,650
 Don't get too upset... ^^

42
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,160

43
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,560
Where is the key? What?

44
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,340
The key!

45
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,220
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,630
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,070
I really have nothing to say.

48
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,560
We tied them up for sure

49
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,150
and I double-checked.

50
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,810
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,430
You should just erase that.

52
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,860
What?

53
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,440
Oh.

54
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,530
What happened?

55
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,950
 Let me go.

56
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,120
 - Go in. 
- This is clearly an illegal arrest.

57
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,900
 An illegal arrest.

58
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,440
 It is up to ten years in jail, don't you know that?

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,890
 I don't know. I don't. Sit down.

60
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,160
 Tie them up. Tie them.

61
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,000
 - I warned you. 
- Be quiet. Be quiet.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,550
 What are you doing?

63
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,160
 Why are you touching my younger sister?

64
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,380
 Is this sexual assault?

65
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,800
 If you continue to not cooperate with us, we will send you to jail.

66
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,470
 Jail? What did we do wrong?

67
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,010
 Identity theft, fraud, robbery, document theft.

68
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,650
 Use of physical violence, and illegal computer use! Need me to say more?

69
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,880
 I did not use violence.

70
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,910
 If you don't want to go to jail, sit down quietly.

71
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,710
 I have not assaulted anyone!

72
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,760
 All I said was I didn't do any violence. You did, you pig.

73
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,820
 Stop wiggling!

74
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,040
 What is this bastard?

75
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,650
 Yes, Prosecutor, everything ended well.

76
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,720
 Problems? No way, sir.

77
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,150
 I am Section Chief Maeng, Prosecutor.

78
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,650
 You know how well I do my job.

79
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,500
 Yes, I'll keep an eye on them, so take your time.

80
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,610
 Sure, I will see you soon.

81
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,850
It just

82
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,360
all happened within a blink of eye.

83
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,900
There was no way we could prevail against them.

84
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,310
I understand what you mean, so first find out what they're up to.

85
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,740
Yes.

86
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,780
I will wash this and return it to you.

87
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,570
Move now.

88
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,440
Things are not easy.

89
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,610
Little sister.

90
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,310
Oh, Uncle!

91
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,290
Don't wake Uncle up.

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,280
That guy. He looks more relaxed than before.

93
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,010
So, have you found them?

94
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,120
I found one of them. What should I do?

95
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,230
Should I arrest him right away?

96
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,580
Yes, yes, yes.

97
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,150
No, just tail them for now.

98
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,950
 Your delivery is here.

99
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,820
The door is open, so please come in.

100
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,000
That bastards will be in touch sooner or later.

101
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,310
You should catch them all at once then.

102
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,840
Especially the scammer who looks like a slacker.

103
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,960
Yeah. We really can't let him go.

104
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,190
Why can't we just get along?

105
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,500
You should have formally invited me then.

106
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,480
Isn't that polite for both of us?

107
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,380
- You bastard. 
 - Hey.

108
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,910
Will it be faster for you to catch me or for my people to come up upstairs?

109
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,340
Let's not make a ruckus for the neighborhood in the morning.

110
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,360
Is there nothing to drink?

111
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,820
You should take a sip too.

112
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,610
You're tidier than you look.

113
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,990
You really did the work that all the prosecutors in Korea are supposed to do, huh?

114
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,830
You're the one who sees me like that.

115
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,620
By kidnapping us, threatening to arrest us,

116
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,110
and even offering reduced sentences if we did your work for you.

117
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,230
Your way of negotiation is just way too old-fashioned.

118
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,590
You all are smart people. Why do you have such poor imagination?

119
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,880
Who said so?

120
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,730
Your subordinate.

121
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,620
Maeng... What was it again? Maeng...

122
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,990
That damn Section Chief Maeng.

123
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,350
Yes, yes, it was Section Chief Maeng.

124
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,040
Anyway, you guys seem pretty cornered.

125
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,740
So let's stop wasting time and cut to the chase. What do you want?

126
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,360
Do you want us to bring you evidence to convict bastards like Chairman Ji and Ji Seong Goo?

127
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,470
So the USB was you?

128
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,180
Was it useful?

129
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,300
Why did you send it to me?

130
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,840
We needed someone to do the dirty work, and you just happened to be the assigned prosecutor.

131
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,780
Chairman Cheon's case too?

132
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,570
Oh, you're pretty quick on stuff like this.

133
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,360
You guys are really fearless.

134
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,040
Well, what more is there to life. We're just doing what we please.

135
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,990
Anyway, if that's what it is, then I can consider your offer.

136
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,160
All these secret and foreign bank accounts are useless to us, you know that. But in exchange,

137
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,700
all the cash we find while exposing their dirty secrets is ours to keep, okay?

138
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,600
What did you say?

139
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,540
We can't work without cash. We're not amateurs. Did you think we were volunteers?

140
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,160
There's no meaning in airing their dirty laundry if there's no cash involved. We want to empty their pockets.

141
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,690
In the end, they'll just get arrested and stay in jail for a few months before getting released in a wheelchair again. Isn't that the routine?

142
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,440
But you think you guys taking the cash is acceptable?

143
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,470
But we're pure... relatively speaking.

144
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,300
Get out if you're going to keep talking nonsense.

145
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,970
I don't intend to use these kinds of methods. Here's the delivery fee.

146
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,690
Alright.

147
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,580
You play fair, as expected. Korean prosecutors are great.

148
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,410
If you don't want to then there's nothing I can do about it. Have a nice day.

149
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,700
Hey, take your boxes with you.

150
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,720
They're empty.

151
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,350
Want me to tell you one thing? Why you guys can't do it.

152
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,190
It's because you guys can't abandon your petty ethics and moral obligations.

153
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,820
Those guys don't bleed the weak till they're dry because they have stuff like that.

154
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,980
Remember that.

155
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,750
So...

156
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,090
You're telling me to be like them and disobey the law?

157
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,670
What? What can you do with that oh-so-great law?

158
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,290
Who do those laws exist for?

159
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,910
Aren't laws supposed to punish the guilty and protect the innocent?

160
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,510
Then why is it that the guilty ones escape and always walk free?

161
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,210
They make it so that they can use the law to their advantage and judge themselves. Why do we have to...?

162
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,740
Then, keep a hold on your ethics.

163
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,030
Contact me if you change your mind.

164
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,780
 The former Attorney General, Kim Jin Wook, who was imprisoned on charges of bribery worth billions,

165
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,930
 has been released on probation.

166
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,920
 The court revealed they adjudicated on the former Attorney General Kim's charge in such a way

167
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,390
 because he was exculpated from receiving a part of bribery.

168
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,130
 As a result, the fines that the former Attorney General Kim received were

169
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,540
 only 15 million won and 9,890,000 won.

170
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,340
 Assemblyman Kwon Tae Jin was sentenced  to

171
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,660
 3 years of imprisonment, 500 million won of fine, and 300 million won of additional penalty

172
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,430
 on the charge of receiving stocks from CEO Jo Yeong Kwon as bribery.

173
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,480
 He admitted his guilt for receiving some stocks,

174
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,620
 but he was acquitted on the charge of obtaining the stocks that in a way that netted an 18-billion won financial gain.

175
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:14,860

176
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,030

177
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:52,840
Alright, a handful of potatoes. A handful of onions.

178
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,750
A handful of everything.

179
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,190
And as much meat as I want.

180
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,410
Hey, hey, hey! You're back?

181
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,850
Did you see the list of swindlers? How was it? Did you like it?

182
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,070
Good work.

183
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,070
What's wrong? You don't like it?

184
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,110
Are you making curry? It smells good.

185
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,020
Don't change the subject. I haven't even started it yet, so how would you know?

186
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,250
At this rate, we'll starve to death.

187
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,280
They say, "The longest way round is the shortest way home."

188
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,050
I'm here after turning around the longest way. Now, what should I do?

189
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,450
Wait and see. Something interesting will happen soon.

190
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,410
 Hwa Yang Trade President Na Won Hwak was charged on suspicion of bribery during bidding on governmental projects

191
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:40,880
 and hosting illegal gambling but it was decided not to bring charges against him.

192
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,970
 The prosecution claims that there is not enough evidence to convict President Na

193
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,070
and therefore have dropped all suspicions and charges against him.

194
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,400
We couldn't find any evidence that he embezzled slush funds

195
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,520
or used funds as bribes for lobbying.

196
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,620
The prosecution will not bring charges against him.

197
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,740
We're closing this case. This is all.

198
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,980
Are you just wrapping up this case like this?

199
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,610
How do you say there isn't enough evidence?

200
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,040
President Na, give us just a word!

201
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,860
President Na!  President Na!

202
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,890
Please look to this side!

203
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,230
- You've had a hard time, President.
 - How about Father-in-law?

204
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,650
He's on a business trip in LA and will be returning tomorrow.

205
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,200
Is my wife at home?

206
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,050
She's in Sapporo.

207
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,640
What a great father and daughter!

208
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,850
Hey, stop the car for a bit.

209
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,250
Yes, sir.

210
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,180
Are you uncomfortable by any chance?

211
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,780
Why is this here?

212
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,450
I thought it smelled nice, so I prepared it specially—

213
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,960
- Haven't you read the performance manual?
 - I'm sorry.

214
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,040
- Did you read it or not? 
 - I read it.

215
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,120
- And? 
 - I'll get rid of it immediately. 
 - No, no.

216
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,880
There's no need for that.

217
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,350
- You drink it.  I said drink it. You said it smells nice. 
 - What?

218
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,400
- You don't want to? 
 - No, sir.

219
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,740
Stop dawdling and drink it already.

220
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,650
Drink all of it, you bastard.

221
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,170
Barbarous bastard.

222
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,090
You bastard! Bastard! I should kill you.

223
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,890
Drive the damn car!

224
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,170
Yes, sir!

225
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,630
Are you really going to be like this?

226
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,810
Go on ahead.

227
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,980
Why are you ending an investigation that has clear grounds to investigate?

228
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,840
You know very well what that scumbag will do when he's free.

229
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,670
I know, right? You should have prosecuted with proper evidence.

230
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,290
Why are you so bothered by not being able to catch an innocent person?

231
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,830
Innocent? Do you know how much that scumbag has embezzled so far?

232
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,140
There's no evidence. Evidence. Did you forget, "innocent until proven guilty"?

233
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,620
- You said all the evidence I brought to you was inadmissible! 
 - Proper evidence.

234
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,550
Besides, you never reported this case to me in the first place.

235
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,090
This isn't the time for you to nitpick, when you deserve to be punished.

236
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,840
This is my last warning to you.

237
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,420
Try to see reason, unless you want to be demoted.

238
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,220
Anyhow, who wouldn't know that you're a part of Choi Hyeon Gi's line? Just look at the way you work.

239
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,950
What did you just say?

240
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,450
What?

241
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,890
I'm asking what you just said.

242
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,230
Don't mention Director Choi's name with that filthy mouth.

243
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,370
You bastard!

244
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,380
Why? Did I say something wrong?

245
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,000
It was your superior who made our prosecutors embarrassed by hiding money abroad after taking it from Choo Won Gi.

246
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,480
Ah, he was not taking money only from Choo Won Gi, was he?

247
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,420
Deputy Chief!

248
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,910
You punk, how dare you!

249
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,590
 Jang In Gyu!

250
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,240
That's enough, I'll be sure to teach him a lesson.

251
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,250
Follow me.

252
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,060
So you moved without reporting to me?

253
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:19,220
I thought that if I reported it, they wouldn't have permitted me to do it.

254
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,760
I thought that if I pushed the investigation to a certain point,

255
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,150
it would reveal that Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kang or the Attorney General might be related to  President Na.

256
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,870
How about your personal feelings?

257
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,460
Pardon?

258
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,900
You didn't have any personal motives in doing that?

259
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,680
Are you still suspicious of Choi Yeong Gi's case?

260
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,840
You think they framed him?

261
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:42,220
I don't know who was the mastermind behind it all, but I'm sure there was someone helping the prosecution.

262
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,350
After that incident, they were the ones that benefited.

263
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,080
You also know that he's not that kind of person.

264
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,640
So if you would give me another chance—

265
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,320
In Gyu.

266
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,430
Prosecutors look for evidence.

267
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:04,170
Suspicion, doubt, or circumstantial evidence is all meaningless.

268
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,700
If you can't be specific about it, don't even try to start.

269
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,270
You don't deserve to be a prosecutor.

270
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,410
Then do I just need evidence?

271
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,400
Then I'll bring it to you.

272
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,530
No matter what.

273
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,600
Hurry up so we can play one round.

274
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,420
I don't want to play.

275
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,310
Come here, let's play just once.

276
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,050
I told you that I don't want to.

277
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,230
I told you I don't want to.  Why do you keep asking and making me annoyed?

278
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,260
What. Are you upset?

279
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,940
Fine then. Let's do it.

280
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,050
Let's see it. Give it to me.

281
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,030
- Are you actually going to do it? 
 - I really am.

282
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,930
Pick one, pick one!
  Swindlers List

283
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,220
They present themselves falsely to be a team who launders the Blue House slush fund.

284
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,410
They're saying they will give 10% of the former presidents' slush fund to someone who would give them operating funds.

285
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,950
You don't like it?  How about this person?

286
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,080
You like women. A swindler!

287
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,880
You bring out your fake government ID.

288
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,140
You use your way with words and get the swindler and score on her!

289
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,350
- How's she look?
 - Well, she looks like this.

290
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,490
It's just eh.

291
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,610
Yes. Hello?

292
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,700
 Okay,  you can swindle and rob them as much as you want.

293
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,660
I'll let it slide even if you empty out them completely,

294
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,820
but make sure you sweep them completely!

295
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,450
So they can't deny it at all.

296
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,070
Who is that?

297
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,580
What?

298
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,210
You could call it something like a broker.

299
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,840
What are you going to do?

300
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,680
We have to start our job.

301
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,700
Then to whom? The female swindler team?

302
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,370
Withdraw the embellishing words!

303
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,940
Withdraw!  Withdraw!  Withdraw!

304
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,340
Stop your tricks!  Reflect our opinions!

305
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,760
Reflect!  Reflect! Reflect!

306
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,100
Stop immediately the unsafe measures on the site!

307
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,920
Stop immediately!  Stop immediately!  Stop immediately!

308
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,580
Withdraw the haphazard development!

309
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,310
Withdraw!  Withdraw!  Withdraw!

310
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,230
Mom, why are those men doing that?

311
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,520
That's because they're poor.

312
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,910
If you don't study hard, then you're going to be like them.

313
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,460
 Withdraw!  Withdraw!  Withdraw!

314
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,660
Ma'am,  what did you just say?

315
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,300
Hey! Do Jin Woong!

316
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,280
 Stop!  Stop!  Stop!

317
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,460
 Haphazard Development with no safety measures endangers the lives of citizens.

318
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,970
What do you mean I would fight?  I just tried to talk.

319
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,100
I saw you raise your eyebrows like you do when you're angry.

320
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,100
Please don't guess.

321
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,120
Here. I ordered two fried eggs just for you.

322
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,750
I really just wanted to talk. Do I look like a thug?

323
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,660
Hyung, don't worry about me but you stop doing this.

324
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,110
Your late wife would roll over in her grave.

325
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,770
I need to protect the gym first so I can manage the  athletes.

326
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,540
You could just move to another place.

327
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,240
That's why you're not fit for this.

328
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,970
If I sign the contract just to save myself,

329
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,420
what are these people going to do?

330
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,740
The world changes a little bit for the better from your actions.

331
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,770
People do everything their own way.

332
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,890
Okay. I get it. Eat your food. It's going to get cold.

333
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,830
Stop doing this and start exercising again.

334
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,480
Too much time has passed. The incident before—

335
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,030
Forget it. Don't bring it up.

336
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,620
Why are you getting mad all of a sudden.

337
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,980
 Don't enter.

338
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,540
"Let's start our next round."

339
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,830
Ugh, I have to get going.

340
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,650
Next time we'll get a drink.

341
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,160
Ji Woong

342
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,200
What.

343
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,890
Nothing. We'll talk next time.

344
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,980
So bland. I'll call you.

345
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,730
Don't waste food. Eat mine too.

346
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,140
- Don't get into trouble. 
 - Worry about yourself.

347
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,900
Hey!  Long time, no see, Cha Ah Ryeong!

348
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,640
You see, I have a new project.

349
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,520
Join us again.

350
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,310
It's a great opportunity.

351
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,640
I washed my hands already.

352
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,040
If it's about that other time then—

353
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,310
That's okay. There are so many drivers in this world, why would you come to me?  You look pathetic.

354
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,730
Don't disrespect your elders.

355
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,380
Crazy bastard.

356
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,080
Hey, you wanna die?

357
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,730
You're still the lowest of the low.

358
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,170
What?

359
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,060
You bit—

360
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,340
I knew you'd be like this.

361
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,920
Why are you getting into trouble when you just got out of jail?

362
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,480
Follow me.

363
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,440
What the hell are you?

364
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,580
Me?

365
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,980
Why? Are you thugs?

366
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,040
Who are they?

367
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,590
Wait.

368
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,640
Wow, they were like photocopies.

369
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,000
I can't remember the wanted posters well because I'm outside and don't have them on me.

370
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,170
Let's go together and check on you?

371
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,850
Follow me.

372
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,590
Let's go.  I'll show you what police station looks like.

373
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,160
Let's go.

374
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,000
Why?

375
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,230
You don't want to go? You don't like the police station?

376
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,850
Then you should leave now.

377
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,280
Okay, okay.  See you next time.

378
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,370
What do you mean "next time"? Bastard.

379
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,440
Look away.

380
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,170
Leave.

381
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,080
Yo!

382
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,310
Are you kidding me?

383
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,720
Ah, they looked terrible.

384
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,060
Ah we almost got into trouble this morning.

385
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,260
Where did you find that?

386
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,180
What brings you here?

387
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,990
I came to pick up my best accomplice,

388
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,050
so you can't be taken by anyone else.

389
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,240
C'mon. We have work to do.

390
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,680
Ugh, why can't I reject him.

391
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,400
Hurry up.

392
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,980
Been playing games all day?

393
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,720
What do you mean games? You guys came early.

394
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,410
Ah, we just happened to meet each other on our way.

395
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,110
What happened to Jin Woong?

396
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,310
Jin Woong?

397
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,730
He probably got on the wrong bus again.

398
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,950
Usually, people who use their bodies aren't so smart.

399
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,600
His brain may be as small as a black bean.

400
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,840
Black bean?

401
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,510
- I'm saying it's good for your health. 
- Right!

402
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,830
You're all still the same.

403
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,700
Ah Ryeong, have you been good?

404
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,060
I've been a bit bored but how about you?

405
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,060
I've been good. Bored.

406
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,220
Now, since it looks like we're all here, let's start.

407
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,800
Come here. There's going to be a person to brief us.

408
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Another person is coming?

409
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,150
What?

410
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,010
Who's going to come, idiot?

411
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,030
What if the police come in? And a prosecutor comes to investigate?

412
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,850
Are you going to take responsibility?

413
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,390
Huh, are you?

414
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,150
Did you do research on this?

415
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,570
How can you—

416
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,120
He did come! A prosecutor!

417
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,990
You crazy bastard!

418
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,170
- Why do you turn on a green light—
 - That's what I'm saying, the green light—

419
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,800
Go, go, go.

420
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,580
Kill them.

421
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,150
What's with all the noise?

422
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,990
Didn't you tell them?

423
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,010
Work is dramatic isn't it?

424
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,540
Dramatic? Ugh.

425
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,760
Everyone sit. We're not here to arrest you.

426
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,230
What?

427
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,530
Now, we will formally introduce ourselves.

428
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:00,380
I'm Prosecutor Jang In Gyu from Seo Won District Prosecution.

429
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,570
You guys met him before once.

430
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,840
He is Section Chief Maeng who works with me.

431
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,650
Nice to meet you everyone.

432
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,180
Very nice.

433
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,660
Now let's...

434
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,740
Let's start by discussing work.

435
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,180
Wait, what? What is he talking about?

436
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,720
Wait just a sec.

437
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,280
Come here. Let's talk.

438
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,850
What are you doing?

439
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,870
What do you want us to do with a prosecutor?

440
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,020
He kept sticking to us. And he already knew where you all were.

441
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,500
Then you should've told us to run away!

442
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,160
Do you think just running away will resolve this problem?

443
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,400
But how can we work with a prosecutor?

444
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,900
It's alright.

445
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,500
Everything in this country is about connections, don't you think?

446
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,500
It's alright. It's alright.

447
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,030
What is this?

448
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,080
The people you have to capture.

449
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:57,510
Corrupt chaebols, politicians, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, ministers, vice-ministers, organization bosses.

450
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,840
Despite their crimes, they got all kinds of special treatment in prison.

451
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,750
No matter how heavy their crimes were, they were sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and probation for 5 years.

452
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:10,400
Amidst all that, they used all kinds of tricks like reprieves or special audiences with lawyers.

453
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,460
Even though they took tens or hundreds of billions illegally,

454
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,070
they still got freed with special pardons or bailed out and have lived happily afterward.

455
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,190
Catching those heinous criminals and putting them into jail.

456
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,340
It's your job.

457
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,060
It's not bad.

458
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,380
Why are we supposed to capture these scary guys?

459
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,990
So, who's the first target?

460
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,330
Na Won Hak.

461
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,800
Na Won Hak? The Hwa Yang Trade President?

462
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,440
What did he do?

463
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,760
The rest of the information will be given by Section Chief Maeng. All I need from you is definitive evidence.

464
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,460
Concrete evidence they can't worm their way out of.

465
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,790
Well, the money that you guys collect from the case will be...

466
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,070
split?

467
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,290
What?

468
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,290
I was kidding. Keep all yourselves.

469
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,040
I'll promise this.

470
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,370
So it's like this? So I thought it was like community service or something.

471
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:23,080
Okay, stop the lecture right there. If we listen to more, we'll get bored and not want to do it.

472
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,880
They're not such easy targets.

473
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,770
We're not that easy either.

474
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,360
You have confidence.

475
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,840
But how can we trust you?

476
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,360
Everything that we discussed until now,

477
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,730
is recorded on this phone.

478
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,120
From now on, the only point of contact is that phone.

479
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,370
Any questions?

480
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,930
Let's go.

481
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,530
- Goodbye.
 - You should drink this.

482
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,770
It was not because I was scared.

483
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,560
No, no. Still, we're not doing this with a prosecutor.

484
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:20,300
What do you mean, not with a prosecutor? We're focusing only on business. The prosecutor is in the same boat with us.

485
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,620
Is this really okay?

486
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,960
If we want to drag guys like them in, I need to at least give them my arms.

487
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,160
Should we investigate them separately?

488
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,980
No.

489
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,680
We'll take this opportunity to see their abilities.

490
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,400
Will he go back on his word later?

491
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,490
Right? Somehow, it's hard to trust someone who is employed by the government.

492
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,500
Don't worry.

493
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,560
He's not lying.

494
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,200
How would you know?

495
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,280
Lying is my specialty.

496
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,950
You are persuasive.

497
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,830
Who wants to do it? I won't force you.

498
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,570
We should do it. We were going to do it anyway.

499
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,610
It's not bad for me either.

500
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,840
Then, is it just me to decide now?

501
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,430
Let's start this in a few.

502
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,540
Hey hey. I still haven't decided yet.

503
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,480
Don't you know 'majority rules'?

504
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,850
'Majority rules'? We're not voting for our class council in elementary school.

505
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,680
Why do you play hard to get? You'd do it in the end.

506
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,230
Sometimes he seems like a girl.

507
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,160
Hold me.

508
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,010
Let's do it together.

509
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,010
I'll hold you.

510
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:38,950
Who should I blame? I should blame my innocence.

511
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,210
Let's get working.

512
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,550
Hey, you bastard!

513
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,290
Hit him, you punk, hit him!

514
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,240
Ugh, you imbecile.

515
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,120
Our President Na, nothing goes well for you nowadays.

516
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,690
You must be upset.

517
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,570
Bring the broker.

518
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,750
Yes.

519
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:34,320
You said he was a martial artist. You said he would fight well because of that, you bastard!

520
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,430
But he got knocked out so easily?

521
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,720
Do you know how much I've lost because of you, bastard?

522
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,760
What did you say? What did you say until the next fight—

523
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,810
I'll find someone again.

524
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,950
Bring me a better player.

525
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,680
I'm sorry.

526
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,810
You know what I'm saying?

527
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,610
 What does President Na look like?

528
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,770
He entered in Hwa Yang Trade as a regular employee in 2002 and was promoted all the way to a director position in five years.

529
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,790
He even became a president the year before last.

530
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,280
He is legendary in this field.

531
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,060
Basically, he got promoted super fast.

532
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,120
He is like that on his resume but he is actually very messy.

533
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:39,030
He is very famous for beating his subordinates to achieve results and bribing here and there to win bids.

534
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:44,770
Moreover, he even changed related regulations to win bids.

535
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:48,500
He's also had experience being a player at host bars in college.

536
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,330
He did?

537
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:55,700
Then he must've used his talent to flirt with a chairman's daughter, so he would be set for life.

538
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,820
He's very ambitious.

539
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,990
Do you have any other information about him?

540
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,250
There is an illegal fighting ring that only VIP's can get into and gamble.

541
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:11,140
Its security is so heavy that I don't have much information, but I heard there is a lot of cash flow.

542
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,640
Sounds like there'll be a lot of money.

543
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,420
Do you want to work on this place first?

544
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,150
There is no reason that we shouldn't since they're doing half the work themselves.

545
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,650
How are we going to handle this?

546
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,480
We're going to have to hire a player.

547
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,930
A player? Who?

548
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,290
Who? What player?

549
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,150
Who you say?

550
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,290
- Who? 
- Look at these hard muscles.

551
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,880
Why are you guys like this?

552
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,300
I'm not doing this.

553
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,530
Touch him.

554
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,320
- I'm not doing this.
 - Stone. It's solid rock.
 - Don't touch me.

555
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,250
Honey. Please speak to Father-in-law, honey.

556
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,340
If a board meeting is held, I really—

557
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,660
I'll trust you with this. Okay?

558
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,040
Of course, I love you.

559
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,110
Okay. I'll see you later. I love you.

560
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,350
Why isn't there any progress on the apartment bid?

561
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,880
Because of protesters, it's delayed a little.

562
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,980
You don't have to worry. It will be handled in no time.

563
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,050
How about bidding on the governmental project?

564
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:41,260
That is... the requirements the government suggests are very stringent.

565
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,130
We received "not qualified."

566
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,050
Not qualified?

567
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,490
The administrative scope of construction sites is problematic,

568
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,060
but our company received the rating of "not qualified" last time because of the arrogant and bossy attitude of the large company.

569
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,860
I think it's a little hard this time.

570
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,880
Ah seriously. You can bribe the government officials a bit.

571
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,380
We've always done this. It's nothing new to say that.

572
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:09,650
We don't receive any support from the upper ranks so we need to do it on our own.

573
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,230
President, the lobbying problem as well...

574
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,080
Prosecutor Jang is fishing around, so we should restrain ourselves for a while.

575
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,590
I'll be over if I don't get any profit results this time.

576
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,400
My father-in-law is trying to drag me down by holding a board meeting.

577
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,860
In this situation, I should be bothered by that bastard Prosecutor Jang?

578
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,600
Look at those pathetic people.

579
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,080
They don't have much money but to celebrate some kind of anniversary, they have to be at an expensive place like this.

580
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,940
They always search the internet to find coupons, wondering when deals will come out and take pictures after being here happily.

581
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,380
They put those pictures on social media, being proud of being here.

582
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,760
Then people click "like." Those people are all morons!

583
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,720
What are you looking at?

584
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,170
Hey,  I...

585
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:14,000
Na Won Hak, should live like that again, like a barbarian, huh?!

586
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,760
Figure out the apartment issue today.

587
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,620
Yes, sir.

588
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,000
Meet the people who are related to bidding as well.

589
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,420
Yes.

590
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,810
Of course. I'm always ready.

591
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:45,310
I'll send the player's profile first, so let's have a meeting next week.

592
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,390
Goodbye.

593
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,530
Please give me a double espresso.

594
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,740
No, please give her a single espresso.

595
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,710
Coffee just looks black but actually, it has multiple layers.

596
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:02,990
The top layer consists of oil and the bottom layer consists of micro-fine soluble substances.

597
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,950
For me, Mandheling Ice Tea, please.

598
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:08,870
What is funny is that each layer has its own different flavor.

599
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:14,290
If you order a double espresso, each layer gets thick, so you can't taste both flavors at once.

600
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,750
If you need caffeine, and that's why you're ordering a double, better order a single twice.

601
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,120
That will be better.

602
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,070
You must work in this field.

603
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,580
No, I just like it because I have a lot of time.

604
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,860
Do you like "Na Hong"?

605
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:52,090
Yes, well... sometimes I'm attracted to luxury things. If it's sexy, it's even better.

606
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,880
Excuse me, but what is it that you do?

607
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,820
I am an agent. I manage mostly martial artists.

608
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,280
Why? Do I not look the type?

609
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,390
No, but, really?

610
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,880
We must be meant to be.

611
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:23,270

612
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,990

613
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:28,010

614
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,970
I think so.

615
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,010
Yes.

616
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,820
You look prettier every time I see you.

617
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,400
It must be because you're about to get married.

618
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,370
Is this your soon-to-be husband?

619
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,980
No. What are you talking about? You're so playful.

620
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,110
Byeong Joon, say hello. This is—

621
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,120
Long time, no see.

622
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,090
President Na.

623
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,180
Who is this? First time seeing him.

624
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:19,140
Hello, I am Oh Byeong Joon. I run a small business in Japan.

625
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,050
You look good.

626
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:24,070
You guys are from the same university. Korea University.

627
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:28,540
Really? What major?

628
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,780
I majored in law. You're my senior.

629
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,690
Law?

630
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,990
So you're from law?

631
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,930
Yeo Hoon, come here for a bit.

632
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,720
You came, Seonbaenim?

633
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,490
You must know each other, you both graduated from the law school there.

634
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:59,020

635
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,270
Oh. How? Wow, long time no see!

636
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:09,460
What happened to you? You haven't been to any reunions.

637
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,920
I know it's been a while. I'll show my face now and then.

638
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,940
You really know each other?

639
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:19,140
Of course. If anyone doesn't know him in our department, they must be an alien because he passed the bar exam in his freshman year.

640
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,850
How have you been? I heard that you didn't go to the Judicial Research and Training Institute.

641
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,870
I left it because it didn't fit my aptitude.

642
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,970
Yeo Hoon, Vice-Minister Kim is here!

643
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,880
I have to go.

644
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,650
Contact me.

645
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,160
Yes, see you another time.

646
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,200
I will meet you later, sir.

647
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:45,240
I understand you. I don't like judges and prosecutors at all.

648
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,930
If they accepted any kind of rabble, this kind of position wouldn't exist.

649
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,510
You are correct.

650
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:55,280
Next time, I will bring my student ID card.

651
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,220
You're funny.

652
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,720
Yoo Ri, let's talk.

653
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,730
Rude ass bastard.

654
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,180
You know I just met Soo Hyeok?

655
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,070
Who?

656
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,280
You know, the guy who passed the bar in his freshman year and quit.

657
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,920
Ah, Choi Soo Hyeok!  I know him.

658
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,580
Don't you have a person that I could use?

659
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,750
Why?

660
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,120
Oh nothing. I just wanted to get them a part-time job.

661
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,290
That gambling place again?

662
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,000
You know I don't like stuff like that at all.

663
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,820
Kids who can't compete because they're caught doing drugs. It's good for them to make some money while they're resting.

664
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,300
We don't have any.

665
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,440
Why don't you ask Byeong Joon?

666
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,750
He said that he manages players too.

667
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,510
Really?

668
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,340
You came?

669
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,370
It's them?

670
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,860
I brought him here.

671
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,860
His frame is good.

672
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,470
But, aren't you a little too fat?

673
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,280
He's the ace in our team but is resting a while.

674
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,760
Why? Did you use drugs?

675
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,930
It's nothing like that.

676
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:54,520
He has some women problems.

677
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,390
Don't women look at appearances anymore?

678
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,440
Never mind.

679
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,650
But I only need one.

680
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,790
Put him in. You won't regret it.

681
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:13,990
Hey fun junior, how can you put him in when he is not even verified?

682
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,460
Here you go.

683
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,780
Winner gets it.

684
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,290
You don't need to do this here. Just trust me—

685
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,950
Now this is fun.

686
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,960
He's really something, isn't he?

687
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,020
You've done a big deed.

688
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,440
- Look.
 - I'm sorry.

689
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,460
I told you we have to verify like this.

690
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,340
What if I picked this punk?

691
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,080
What if? I'm asking what would have happened, huh?

692
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,950
You damn bastard.

693
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,300
He's funny.

694
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,300
What an idiot, hm?

695
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,350
Let's sign a contract right now.

696
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,230
Okay?

697
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,090
We'll prepare it right away.

698
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:01,290
I'm really sorry. Use this for the hospital bill.

699
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,460
Let's get that bastard, no matter what.

700
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:33,650

701
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,830
I wonder what that bastard President Choi's face will look like already.

702
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:50,720
What happened to what I told you to do?

703
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,870
Oh yes. I finished talking with the people who are related to bidding.

704
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,180
Regarding the apartment issue, the contractors already started their move.

705
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,580
- So it'll be settled soon.
 - All right.

706
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,710
Make the project go without a hitch!

707
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:05,760
President, why don't we think about setting up insurance, just in case?

708
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,990
Insurance?

709
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:10,450
In case, even in the slightest chance, if we lose the match, we won't have enough cash.

710
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:12,980
So, I planned something.

711
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,180
Excuse me.

712
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,350
Doesn't sound like a bad idea.

713
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:31,170
I understand.

714
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,510
Drive quickly!

715
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:40,810

716
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,080

717
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,880
What are you?

718
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,040
I'm looking forward to today.

719
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,840
Right?

720
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,230
It'll be a killer night.

721
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,060
Don't get too excited.

722
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:46,130
- Do it calmly.
 - Yeah.

723
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,290
You don't trust me?

724
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:51,290
I do, bud, I do!

725
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,490
Are you ready?

726
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,520
Yeah. The setting (setup) is done.

727
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,310
Okay.

728
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,320
Let's go.

729
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,500
Good luck.

730
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,320
What do you think? Wil I do better or the other side will do better?

731
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,680
- Definitely you!
 - Right?

732
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,420
Get ready today.

733
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,220
Cheers!

734
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,190
Cheers!

735
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:36,880
Wait a sec. What's this?

736
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,380
Who is that?

737
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,420
Oh, nothing. It's the Yang Pyeong house, the housekeeper.

738
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:51,020
Then, you must've picked them without looking at their appearance.

739
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,790
But she cooks very well.

740
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,240
Okay, for victory!

741
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,120
Cheers!

742
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,720

743
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:11,060
 You brought a novice today. I'm not sure he'll be okay.

744
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,890
Worry about yourself.

745
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,770
Let's play.

746
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:29,070
Let's play.

747
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,490

748
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,920
Which player would you like to bet on?

749
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,650

750
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:41,780
 You should stop, and start exercising again.

751
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,650
 A lot of time has passed.

752
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,220
 - That incident then—
 - Stop.

753
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,940
 Drop it.

754
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,240
The match is starting soon.

755
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:14,110
Okay, let's get it.

756
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:24,260

757
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:29,150
The main event will start.

758
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,580
 Everybody, have a seat.

759
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:34,600
Okay. Yes.

760
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,950
 Start attack!

761
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,130
The preparation is finished.

762
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,960
Let's watch the match first. We're not in a hurry.

763
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,530
Okay.

764
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:52,200
Go!

765
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:57,320
The main event starts now!

766
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,950
Go!

 This isn't how you get revenge.

785

 I'll make sure you can catch him.

786
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,860
 Wow!

787
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,020
 What's with your expressions?

788
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,050
  Look at the serial numbers.

789
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:54,120
 Why are all the numbers the same?

790
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,350
 It seems like we got tricked.

791
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:58,930
 The important thing is who took the real cash.

792
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,120
 Hwa Yang Trade President Na?

793
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,090
 I think they hid the money in the warehouse.

794
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:04,730
 Will he follow according to our plan?

795
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,220
 We'll have to make him follow.

796
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,280
 You punks, what are you doing?
