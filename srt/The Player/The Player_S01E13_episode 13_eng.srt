1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,060

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,720

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,180

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,180

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,030

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,850

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:38,840

8
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:45,070

9
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:51,930

10
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,340
No!

11
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,030
Shit.

12
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,550
Who the fuck are you, bastard? Come out.

13
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,640

14
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,690
Take him away.

15
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,260
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,490
You bastard!

17
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,310
Prosecutor Jang! Please wake up.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,380
Which bastard sent you, huh?!

19
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,500
Tell me, bastard!

20
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,280
- Stop it. 
 - Let me go.

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,930
- Let me go
 - Stop it.

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,230
What do I do? Prosecutor Jang!

23
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,800
Prosecutor Jang.

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,470
Prosecutor Jang.

25
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,110
Prosecutor Jang, open your eyes.

26
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,430
- Prosecutor Jang!
 - Wake up!

27
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,080
Prosecutor Jang!

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,290
My leg.

29
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,520
Are you okay?

30
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,050
Open it!

31
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,580
Ha Ri, take Prosecutor Jang first.

32
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,300
Please go. We'll take care of things here.

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,160
Prosecutor Jang.

34
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,000
Hold on.

35
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,450
Open the door!

36
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,170
Get in, hurry!

37
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,800
Leaving.

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,720
Chase them!

39
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,990
This is your final chance.

40
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,150
Find him, no matter what.

41
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,260
You, too.

42
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,120
Yes, sir. I will keep that in mind.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,040

44
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,550
You're here.

45
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,690
Get rid of him.

46
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,310
Spare me!

47
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,320
Spare me, please!

48
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,730
I think we gave them the slip.

49
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,230
Ah, these punks are no joke.

50
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,520
Should we go back to the hideout?

51
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,350
No, no. If we get tailed and get caught,

52
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,560
Ha Ri and Prosecutor Jang could be in danger too.

53
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,690
Then what should we do?

54
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,990
Let's wait here for a bit until things quiet down.

55
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,100
But what kind of mess did you get into to look like that?

56
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,870
Did something happen with Ha Ri again?

57
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,050
And why is everyone after prosecutor Jang?

58
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,190
I think the incident from 15 years ago is repeating itself.

59
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,360
What?

60
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,870
Are you talking about that presidential election scandal?

61
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,380
Yeah.

62
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,310
I think they tried to frame and kill Prosecutor Jang and the opposing party candidate this time

63
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,120
for illegal campaign funds.

64
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,050
Just like Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi.

65
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,670
These crazy bastards.

66
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,510
Why do they keep using innocent people?

67
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,240
It was "that man" again.

68
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,450
How do you know him?

69
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,790
How could I not know about that bastard?

70
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,180
I also know "that man."

71
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,760
Fifteen years ago, I got paid to catch someone for him.

72
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,460
Someone I caught back then asked me,

73
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,750
If "that man" ordered me to do this too.

74
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,080
I didn't know what that meant until now.

75
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,480
But when I went into Ha Ri's room earlier I understood.

76
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,990
The person I caught back then was framed, and it was made to look like he committed suicide, but he was killed by them.

77
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,530
What was in Ha Ri's room?

78
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,070
All the documents related to that incident.

79
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,960
 It seemed like he'd been investigating it for a while.

80
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,640

81
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,660
Alone.

82
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,830
Why does he keep getting involved in this case?

83
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,060
Ha Ri has a good reason.

84
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,310
What are you saying?

85
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,300
What do you mean?

86
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,790
The deceased Choi Hyeon Gi's son is...

87
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,580
Ha Ri.

88
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,160
What!?

89
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,050

90
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,610
 I also found out today, while I was investigating prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi.

91
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,230
 Ha Ri already knew everything about us,

92
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,730
 and about prosecutor Jang, as well.

93
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,130
No way.

94
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,840
Are you sure this is right?

95
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,940
But Ha Ri said he came from America, then whyâ€”

96
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,390
Ha Ri got a new identity.

97
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,680
His real name is Choi Soo Hyeok.

98
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,130
I mean... How could this be?

99
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,300
No, no, no, no, whatever. No way. This doesn't make sense.

100
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,340
Jin Woong,

101
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,750
you saw all those documents so you should know.

102
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,600
All the guys we've chased up till now

103
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,930
are related to that case.

104
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,720
I'm certain that he did everything on purpose.

105
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,660
Targeting each man, one by one.

106
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,390
And approaching that man.

107
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,170
 Do you think nothing happened to me?

108
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,550
 I'm saying this because I've failed before!

109
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,010
 I'm saying this because if we act on our emotions, we might lose that bastard in front of our eyes!

110
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,320
 Why do you do this type of work when the risk is pretty big?

111
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,370
 Ah, good question! Because as dangerous as it is, it pays just as well.

112
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,330
 That's it?

113
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,210
 I don't know.

114
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,600
So that's why he said that.

115
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,410
So he must've known everything I did.

116
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,770
Since he knew what I did, too.

117
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,200
Why, Oppa?

118
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,820
What did you do?

119
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,380
I...

120
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,190
I worked under "that man."

121
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,790
What?

122
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,440
I deleted it.

123
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,160
Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi's evidence.

124
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,050
What, punk?

125
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,410
It's all my fault.

126
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,060
I...

127
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,150
If only I hadn't done that.

128
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,770
Are you awake now?

129
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,150
Relax. It's safe here.

130
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,720
How did you know... to come to me?

131
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:03,410
Byeong Min went into "that man's" private headquarters and stole the files.

132
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,820
That's why he got beat up.

133
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,100
What files?

134
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,690
Everything.

135
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,540
About Choo Won Gi's murder and even the plans to fake your suicide.

136
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,250
Hand them all over to me. I'll take care of it.

137
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,930
What are you going to do? Ask Yoo Gi Hoon for help again?

138
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,350
What?

139
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,070

140
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,870

141
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,690
He probably told you that he found the mastermind pulling the strings.

142
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,070
That's why they told you to go to the Mooyeong building. It's all written there.

143
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,260

144
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,880
There's no way. Why would Chief Prosecutor Yoo...?

145
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,080
Anyway, you should stay out of it now.

146
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,160
If you keep getting involved, you could end up dead, like Choo Won Gi.

147
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,420
 This time, you take care of things your way.

148
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,560
 I'll support you from behind and take responsibility.

149
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,740
There must be a mistake!

150
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,180
- Chief Yoo would neverâ€”
 - Pull yourself together, please!

151
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,090
Until when are you going to keep getting tricked?

152
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,280
The one who is called "that man" manipulates all these things.  Yoo Gi Hoon is just a spy who works for him.

153
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,240
I'm not sure he became a spy after Jin Yong Joon left or if he had been even before,

154
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,560
but it's true he helped try to kill you.

155
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,280
So stop with your naive thoughts and stop getting involved. I'll figure out the rest.

156
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,940
The others will be in here soon to treat you. Take care of yourself.

157
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,880
Wait. Wait a minute.

158
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,690
Let's think about this, just one minute.

159
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,930
Okay, let's say you're right. Let's just say you're right.

160
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,220
But, what can you possibly do about it?

161
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,600
Too many people died because of that guy.

162
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,890
No more.

163
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,380
I will end it myself.

164
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,760
So you're going to go up against them?

165
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,460
All on your own? What are you going to do? Huh?

166
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:25,750
Either way, you need the help of the authorities. Isn't that why you approached me?

167
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,360
So what do you think you're going to do by yourself now?

168
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,760
I didn't approach you just because you're a prosecutor.

169
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,550
I specifically chose you.

What?

171
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,170
Why?

172
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,200
Out of all the prosecutors, why me?

173
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,920
You told me that we should work together.

174
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,670
What are you talking about?

175
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,390
- You're the one who sent me the USB and started it.
 - No.

176
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,000
Before that.

177
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,900
You're the one who first said you wanted to work together.

178
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,520
  I'll take the picture now. One, two...

179
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,790
  Congratulations. Should I call you Prosecutor Jang from now on?

180
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,020
 Don't mention it. I've not been appointed yet.

181
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,070
 Congratulations!

182
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,330
  So you're Soo Hyeok.

183
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:46,600
  I heard that your dream is to become a prosecutor like your dad.

184
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,460
  Yes, it is.

185
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,460
  This brat, you look smart.

186
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,940
 You have to work with me later on, okay?

187
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,580
No way, you're...

188
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,740

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,660
Prosecutor Jang In Gyu of the Seoul Prosecutors Office, who was the team leader of the Criminal Profit Recovery Team,

206
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,600
from the senior aide to Bright Innovation Party Presidential Candidate Seok Hui Seok,

207
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,490
we've discovered that he was accepting bribes.

208
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:51,110
In the suicide note of Aide Ahn Heung Mok who committed suicide at Galseong Reservoir around 2 am this morning,

209
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:56,790
it was written that he contacted Prosecutor Jang and gave bribes several times.

210
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:02,900
Therefore, we prosecutors searched his property promptly in order to find his whereabouts.

211
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:08,880
At his house, we even found Choo Won Gi's slush fund that was supposed to be returned to the national treasury.

212
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,360
We are conducting further investigation into how he got the fund in his house.

213
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,140
 I found it! I found it!

214
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:24,670
For disappointing the citizens, I sincerely apologize on behalf of the prosecutors' office.

215
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:31,210
That is why we will make the utmost effort to reveal the truth behind this incident.

216
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,660
Also, the Criminal Profit Recovery Team,

217
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,090
as of today, will be dissolved.

218
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,140
How are you going to proceed with the investigation?

219
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,510
Who will do the investigation?

220
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,860

221
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,020
Chief Prosecutor!

222
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,560
Hello.

223
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,160
Did he call the reporters here before properly investigating? What's the point?

224
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,320
Although Prosecutor Jang is really uptight, he's not the type of person who'd do that.

225
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,410
Yeah. Nothing makes any sense.

226
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,610
Really...

227
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,650
Did you ask for me?

228
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,310
Find Prosecutor Jang using all means necessary.

229
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,300
Yes, I understand.

230
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,590
 I heard you're too valuable to be staying in the prosecution service.

231
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,220
 If you participate with us until this incident is over,

232
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,810
 we will get you the position that you desire.

233
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,920
 You should consider your future in the long term.

234
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:33,350
 If I refuse here, I'll become like Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Gi.

235
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,880
 There's no way that would happen now, is there?

236
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,650
 Who am I making this deal with?

237
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,580
 VIP?

238
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,580
 No. He's above that.

239
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:21,490

240
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,460

241
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,250
Move out of the way, please!

242
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,900

243
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,130
His phone is still off?

244
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,600
Yes.

245
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,110
What happened to Prosecutor Jang?

246
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,510
Ha Ri?

247
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,700
Is he in there?

248
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,630
He's not here either?

249
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,850
- He's not home yet?
 - Shhh! Be quiet.

250
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,890

251
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,180
 [Ilegal Deals Between Aide Ahn and Prosecutor Jang.
 Then is Candidate Seok Hui Seok innocent in this?

252
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,280

253
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,260
It's so obvious that they planned it ahead of time.

254
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,040
Right. It looks like they had been waiting to do this. They must've been dying to do this.

255
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,350
But where did Ha Ri go?

256
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,030
Where else? He probably went to catch "that man."

257
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,650
What can he possibly do alone?

258
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,780
It's because he's worried that we might get hurt.

259
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,690
- Ridiculous!
 - Me?

260
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,890
No, that con artist.

261
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,420
Hey, still, how could you call him that?

262
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,220
The more I think about it, the more angry I get.

263
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,280
Why is he worrying about us?  Does he think he's our boss?

264
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,520
He can't even drive without me.

265
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,580
You're right. He can't do anything on the computer, either.

266
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,740
Yeah. It's a miracle he doesn't get beaten up wherever he goes.

267
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,230
He doesn't even know what kind of situation he's in. Who's he to be looking after us?

268
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,200
Let's use this to show him for sure, that he can't do anything without us!

269
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,560
Right, we really need to show him! Let's go!

270
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,030
Yeah. Let's go show him who's boss!

271
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,690
Let's go!

272
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,640
I said let's go.

273
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,550
Let's go.

274
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,430
L-Let's go.

275
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,610
Why aren't you going?

276
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,900
Yes, we should go, but...

277
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,480
Where are we going? I don't know.

278
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,640
We're not going?

279
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,070
- Aish.
 - Aish!

280
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,860
Come in.

281
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,350
What is it?

282
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,250
No matter how we think of it, it's strange.

283
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,760
There's no doubt that Prosecutor Jang has been framed.

284
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,690
Didn't you hear the results of the investigation?

285
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,950
The evidence was found at his house.

286
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,600
That's the strange thing.

287
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,990
If Prosecutor Jang had really received that bribe,

288
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,510
there is no way he would have left it at home and disappeared.

289
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,840
It's true, Chief Prosecutor.

290
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,090
Also, it's so strange that the CCTV wasn't working at that moment.

291
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,640
- So?
 - Please rescind the arrest warrant for Prosecutor Jang.

292
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,530
We will find him, no matter what.

293
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,430
Who do you think you are?

294
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,020
What?

295
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,510
Since you've been hanging out with Prosecutor Jang,

296
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,560
do you think you're prosecutors? Huh?

297
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,070
Where do you think this is that you dare to come in here like this?!

298
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,960
Get out immediately if you don't want to get fired.

299
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,520
Aren't you leaving?

300
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,710
How dare such trivial rascals!

301
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,760
I mean, how can a person change so much in one morning?

302
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,010
Yeah, seriously. Who knew that even the chief prosecutor would be like that?

303
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,490
When we searched Prosecutor Jang's house, we found this.

304
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,700
I found it inside Prosecutor Jang's drawer.

305
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,080
After we checked, besides CCTVs nearby streets of Mooyeong Building,

306
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,590
we found their images caught on the CCTV at every incident site.

307
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,420
Dputy Head Prosecutor, Prosecutor Jang's cell phone location has been tracked.

308
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,310
Move out right now. Distribute those rascals' identities to the police.

309
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,790
And tell everybody to carry guns.

310
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,500
What? Guns?

311
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,590
Chief Prosecutor! You're personally going to go?

312
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,230
I have to confirm it myself.

313
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:55,220

314
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,270
Ah, I just can't figure it out.

315
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,060
I can't think of anything, either.

316
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,170
What the hell is this guy thinking?

317
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,940
Do you think he went to that "secret camp"?

318
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,070
- Camp?
 - No, no, no.

319
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,760
That place was probably closed down a long time ago.

320
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,560
Hey, Byeong Min!

321
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:29,470
The files that you stole from the camp. Can't you just post them on the internet?

322
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,510
Those? The source of those is not clear.

323
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,870
Even if it goes through the investigation, just a few of subordinates will get caught.

324
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,710
If they say they made false files, they will be released during the investigation.

325
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,610
Ugh, then what do we do, really?

326
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:48,640
- What is this? 
 - The prosecutors' office has revealed the three men are suspected as accomplices of Prosecutor Jang In Gyu.

327
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,890
- What is it?
 - What?

328
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,590
Ah, seriously!

329
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,160
- We're in big trouble now. Shit.

330
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,880
 ... Prosecutors who began further investigation into the men said they took Choo Won Gi's slush fund,

331
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,920
 and they are also suspected of illegal dealings with Bright Innovation Party Candidate Seok Hui Seok's senior aide.

332
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,320
How did these assholes know?

333
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,380
Aigoo, forget about us but something bad might happen to Ha Ri.

334
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,500
Ah, this is driving me nuts, really.

335
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,840
It seems our thinking is all wrong.

336
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,730
What are you saying?

337
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,120
What wrong thinking?

338
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,230
Until now we've only been thinking, "What would Ha Ri do?"

339
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:29,140
But of course, that wouldn't give us the answer, because we're not Ha Ri.

340
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,110
So? Do you want to give up?

341
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,070
No, we have to think differently.

342
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:43,340
We should be thinking, "What would we have done if Ha Ri were here with us right now?"

343
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,990
That does make sense.

344
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:54,140
Ha Ri is targeting "that man." And we are?

345
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,700
We would get rid of each person that gets in the way, to make things run smoothly.

346
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,900
Right.

347
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,970
Finally, our brains seem to be working.

348
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,870
Let's get them all together like a package.

349
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,320
Okay! Shall we go?

350
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,930
- Okay!
 - Now.

351
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,050
- Let's do it.
 - Okay!

352
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,180
Then, I'll clean up the mess.

353
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,680
Prosecutor Jang!

354
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,670
If we're doing things your way,

355
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:37,260
you need someone to clean up the mess.

356
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,980
That's usually my job.

357
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,020
Did he die?

358
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,630
Die?

359
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,100
Prosecutor Jang.

360
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,740
Nobody has died in our hiding place yet.

361
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,160
We will assign men at all points.

362
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Prosecutor Jang's location is in this area.

363
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,460
Look thoroughly. Shoot if anything happens.

364
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes.

365
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,220
You guys enter the building from the right. Team 2 from the back and the rest with me through the front!

366
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,910
Yes, sir.

367
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,780
You guys go that way. We'll go this way.

368
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,620
Search nearby.

369
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,000
Quickly!

370
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,360

371
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,450
This is an emergency situation. There has been a shooting.

372
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,480
I'll go check it out.

373
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,770
Get out.

374
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,210
Shit.

375
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,240
The chief prosecutor has been kidnapped.

376
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,690
Go spread out and find him!

377
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,970
You think you're going to be fine after this?

378
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,560
Don't do anything you'll regret. If the gun goes off, youâ€”

379
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,650
Why did you do it?

380
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,170
What?

381
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,300
You were on the special investigation team 15 years ago.

382
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,580
But why now? Why are you doing his dirty work?

383
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,940
Aren't you embarrassed in front of Choi Hyeon Gi and Prosecutor Jang?

384
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,920
What's it to youâ€”

385
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,270
Just answer my questions.

386
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,350
Why did you do it?

387
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,640
I did it because I didn't want to die. So what?

388
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:14,330
Even if you lived believing in such a thing like justice, trust,

389
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,780
you would end up dying like Choi Hyeon Gi anyway.

390
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,400
Or working around the countryside and working like a dog as  Prosecutor Jang did.

391
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,200
What could you expect, other than being framed?

392
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,100
The ones who stuck by him in the beginning prance around all high and mightâ€”

393
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:31,780
Fucking bastard.

394
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,710
Yeah, the way you live your life is up to you,

395
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:39,880
but you can't do that to Prosecutor Jang.

396
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:55,350
I recorded everything.

397
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,280
Just wait and see what happens from now on.

398
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,370
N-No, no!

399
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,180
Are you okay?

400
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,700
Water...

401
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,980
Thank you.

402
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,050
Thank you so much.

403
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:40,440
But, how did you get here, Doctor?

404
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,240
I came after getting a phone call from Ah Ryeong.

405
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,570
I see.

406
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,130
That...

407
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,850
About your father...

408
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:01,750
It's okay. There's no need for you to be sorry, Prosecutor.

409
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,020
Did everyone leave already?

410
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,630
Yes.

411
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,820
Punks, without even telling me.

412
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,920
Please take this.

413
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,460
What is this?

414
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,800
They told me to give this to you when you wake up.

415
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,590
They said you just have to do what's written there.

416
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:45,780
Now that the con artist has left, these trivial rascals are bossing me around.

417
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,170
What are you going to do?

418
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,150
I should do this, exactly as it's written.

419
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,900

420
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,620
- Chairman!
 - What?

421
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,550
Someone's infiltrated our database!

422
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,940
What?

423
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,280

424
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,730
Nothing has been leaked yet.

425
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,570
Copy the IP address and text it.

426
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,120
Where have you been all this time?

427
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,840
I've been waiting for a while. Can government officials be like this?

428
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,880
Th-That punk. That... With Prosecutor Jang, right?

429
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,530
It's nice that you recognize me.

430
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,600
Catch that punk!

431
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,420
- Are you sure this is the place? Go in.
 - Yes, sir.

432
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,100
Follow me.

433
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,980
What's going on here?

434
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,520
Who is this bastard?

435
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,560
Chairman Cheon!

436
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,800
Come on, you bastard!

437
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,990
Catch that bastard!

438
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,500
You lost him, again.

439
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,480
Ah, what a disappointment.

440
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,470
I thought you'd be of more use.

441
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:55,260
But, this isn't all my fault.

442
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,380
It happened because you guys lost him first.

443
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,650
You told me to point all the blame to Prosecutor Jang, so I carried out your plan.

444
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:07,260
And you told me to make it look like he committed suicide, so I called him out alone.

445
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,150
But isn't it that guy who lost him?

446
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,700
- So?
 - I'm saying don't put all the blame on me.

447
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:22,290
Honestly, even everyone's reaction

448
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,320
isn't going according to your plan.

449
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,430
"Prosecutor Jang wouldn't do such a thing."

450
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:32,020
"Unless I hear it from him directly, I can't believe it!" That's what everyone's saying.

451
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,330
So, I told you to make an announcement that he admitted his wrongdoings while on the run and committed suicide.

452
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,380
That makes no sense!

453
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,750
There's no corpse! How can we release that?

454
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,850
There's no corpse.

455
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,590
Then,

456
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,670
if there's a corpse, is it okay?

457
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,390
What?

458
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,260
No, that's not what I'm saying.

459
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,160
No, wait! That's not what I meant.

460
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,190
Look here!

461
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,920
Make the announcement, a suicide.

462
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,060
I think you should take a look at this.

463
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,450
You...

464
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,740
 You think you're going to be safe after this?

465
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:09,290
I didn't do it! It wasn't me, I swear!

466
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,990
You, really...

467
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,680

468
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,670
 Was it you?

469
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,550
 "The man."

470
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:38,400
We have a lot to talk about. Come out.

471
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
You'd better come alone unless you want to reveal yourself to everyone.

472
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,290
Do things according to the plan,

473
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,270
if you don't want to die.

474
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,420
Yes, I understand.

475
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,970
Track his location.

476
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:24,700
Yes, sir.

477
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,170
I can't hold back anymore.

478
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:46,960
Even if I get fired, I have to find Prosecutor Jang.

479
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,720
Me, too.

480
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,220
Yes, okay. Let's go out together and find out who framedâ€”

481
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,860

482
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:00,530
Yes? Prosecutor!

483
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,230
Prosecutor?

484
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:18,060
Step on it, you punk! Step on it!

485
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,020
Ah, really these...

486
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,030
What will we do?

487
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:45,220
Ah Ryeong, what do we do now?

488
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,900
I've finally caught you!

489
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,470
Do something, would you?

490
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,410
Shit. How? We're blocked off.

491
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:59,200
You're all dead meat!

492
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,650
- Jin Woong Oppa.
 - Jin Woong's here!

493
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:08,960
Ah, that stupid, seriously.

494
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,900
Where are you going? Where you going?!

495
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,320
Hey!

496
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,620
How have you been?

497
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,680
We meet here again, Prosecutor.

498
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,400
What is this? You're on the same side?

499
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,710
So what if we are?

500
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:49,760
Prosecutor, you handle this piggy here.

501
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,660
I have something to say in private to that punk in the back.

502
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,790
Okay, so shall we wrap things up together?

503
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,660
I'd like that.

504
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,260
Come here, you bastards.

505
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,600
Are you laughing?

506
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,160
What's with these punks?

507
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,100
See? I told you, they're working together.

508
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,170
- The truth came out faster than expected.
 - Yeah, it did.

509
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,200
What? What are you saying?

510
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,860
Oh, over there! Behind you.

511
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:26,100
Look behind you, over there. They're here.

512
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,090
Oh?

513
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,260
What's going on?

514
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,600
What's going on here?

515
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:42,930
Wow, a lot of them came.

516
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,550
What?

517
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:47,500
What's with you guys? Get out of the way!

518
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,360
No, we can't, you asshole!

519
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,230
What?

520
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,960
You good-for-nothing, how dare you speak that way to a prosecutor?!

521
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,410
Then, I guess we should step in.

522
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:00,030
Oh, wait. Whyâ€”

523
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:03,550
Between us prosecutors, we could do this, right?

524
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,750
 What? Prosecutor Jang? Really?

525
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:13,080
 Yes, I just received a call from him.

526
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,990
 You also know that he wouldn't do such a thing.

527
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:20,450
 - Well, that's true butâ€”
 - Please, we beg of you.

528
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,530
 We ask for your help.

529
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,970
 Please.

530
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:31,460
 Alright, we'll help you.

531
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,250
Stop it now, such embarrassing things.

532
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,820
Now, now, arrest everybody here! Come on everybody!

533
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:43,470
What is this? Let go of me!

534
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,910
What the...

535
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,430
What?

536
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,360
Ok, now it's your turn, Oppa.

537
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,880
Chairman Cheon.

538
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,460
- Let go!
 - Get him!

539
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,720
You bastard!

540
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,280
Ah really.

541
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,850
Why is it so slow?

542
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:51,870
Thanks to you, I may get disciplined.

543
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,000
What are you going to do now?

544
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,390
- We'll find our poor Ha Ri.
 - He can't do anything without us.

545
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:06,810
As soon as Prosecutor Jang comes back, I'll back you up along with him.

546
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:10,090
Be careful. Don't get caught.

547
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,800
Don't worry about those things since I'm here.

548
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,840
- What is he saying now?
 - That's what I mean.

549
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,940
The kids are nicer than they look.

550
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,640
- They talk to me a lot. 
- Hurry up.

551
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,690
Tomorrow, if you have time, please give me a call.

552
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,530
- Let's have a cup of tea
 - Hey!

553
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,790
Jasmine Tea.

554
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:28,350
We'll just go without you.

555
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,470
Give me a call.

556
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,140
Call the reporters right away.

557
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,960
Prosecutor Jang's corpse was found.

558
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,880
What's that?

559
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,210
Why does it look like this?

560
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:09,500
You Me?

561
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,540
What bastard dares toâ€”

562
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,000
That's me.

563
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,290
Chief Prosecutor You Me.

564
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,030
But whose corpse did you find?

565
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,610
You?

566
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,870
Me?

567
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,770
What are you doing? Arrest this bastard right now!

568
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:35,480
What? Are you rebelling now?

569
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:46,320
Do you remember...

570
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,530
something you said to me a long time ago?

571
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:53,310
 In Gyu. Prosecutors look for evidence.

572
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:56,640
 Suspicion, doubt, or circumstantial evidence

573
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,740
 is all meaningless.

574
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,630
Evidence?

575
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:03,600
Yes, I have.

576
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,630
I am the evidence.

577
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,670
Arrest him.

578
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:20,040
Let me go. Let me go you bastards!

579
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,980
Don't you? Let go.

580
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,850
 Won't you let me go?

581
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,140
 Let go of me, you bastards!

582
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,300
We've met before, right?

583
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,290
Right?

584
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:09,960
I don't think this kind of conversation is good.

585
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,970
Don't expect such a thing.

586
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:21,630
From the beginning, I didn't think that I would speak in a normal way with a bastard like you.

587
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,570
Why did you do it?

588
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,580
You're that curious?

589
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,470
Just give me an answer.

590
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,570
Why?

591
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,000
Answer me.

592
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,830
Answer me, you bastard!

593
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:43,150
- Answer! 
 - Because I can do it.

594
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,290
What?

595
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:48,600
Here.

596
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,570
If this is enough, let's be honest with each other.

597
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,280
In this country, anyway,

598
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,120
do you know anyone who doesn't use others?

599
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,470
Everyone scams someone else as much as they can while living, doesn't they?

600
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:07,630
They deceive each other, get deceived, and take something away from each other.

601
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,820
But they blame someone else.

602
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:16,530
They don't have power in the first place so that's how they live.

603
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,740
Because they don't have anything.

604
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,400
Only,

605
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,570
they'd be satisfied cheating the people around them.

606
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:30,790
In the meantime, I have power so I scam the country.

607
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,520
You're smart.

608
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,760
Think about it.

609
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:44,890
As I think or plan, this world moves one by one.

610
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,200
How do you think you'd feel?

611
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,340
Only by killing a few people,

612
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,540
and framing someone to change the situation,

613
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,160
this whole world moves as I please.

614
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,050
The chaebols or the power authorities,

615
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:03,390
everybody comes in front of me and licks my feet to survive.

616
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:06,260
Is there anyone that doesn't want it?

617
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,060
Don't you think?

618
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,100
You're killing people only for such a reason?

619
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,740
Only for such a reason?

620
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,530
What?

621
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,280
Is there any reason not to?

622
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:24,160
Crazy bastard!

623
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,120
A bastard like you should be gone.

624
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:37,100
Bastards who can't handle someone else's thoughts or ideas always say things like this.

625
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,460
Like a petty man, emotionally.

626
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:43,570
I thought you were a little different.

627
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,190
Go ahead!  Try to shoot me.

628
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,170
Shut up!

629
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:54,620
You should do it if you want to.

630
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:57,070
You want to get revenge, right?

631
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,950
Shut up!

632
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,200
But

633
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,060
will this be revenge even if you kill me?

634
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,520
I'm the means to this, not the cause.

635
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,460
Several dozensâ€” No.

636
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:19,170
Several hundred people who did something dishonest in the background wanted this.

637
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,620
That's why your father died.

638
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:29,400
You crazy bastard.

639
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:35,250
Talk out of your ass!  Keep talking you bastard!

640
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:39,430
Do you think I wouldn't shoot you?

641
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:42,990
Ah... You can't.

642
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:48,020
Do you know why?

643
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:50,860
Because of your petty conscience.

644
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,510
That's the difference between you and me.

645
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:56,900
That's also the reason you can never win against me.

646
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,600
Oh, and another thing!

647
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,600
That petty heart for revenge.

648
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,570
If a person is obsessed with that,

649
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:09,300
his vision will get very narrow.

650
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,630
So narrow that he doesn't even know who's next to him.

651
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,250
What?

652
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:24,950
Shâ€”

653
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:29,860
Now, when you kill people, you do it like this, without hesitation.

654
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:34,390
Halt,  you bastard!

655
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,040
No!

656
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:56,610
You bastard!

657
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:58,560
Just die!

658
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,140
- Hey!
 - Hey, you bastard!

659
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:08,420
Die!

660
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:41,960

661
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:52,090
â™«  I invite you to this ground, where your ambition will be satisfied  â™«

662
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:59,180
â™«  Try controlling me however you want   â™«

663
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:03,040
â™«  there's no reality  â™«

664
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,920

665
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,490
 Don't you know you guys are wanted criminals? If you get caught doingâ€”

666
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:12,220
 Hey, are you... Ah Ryeong...? On purpose?

667
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,820
 Answer me, Oppa!

668
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,390
 - Three minutes.
 - Okay.

669
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:18,990
 You're much better than I expected.

670
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:20,480
 We should finish our conversation.

671
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,590
 Where is Jin Woong?

672
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,380
 Huh? Those punks?

673
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,990
 - You guys won't regret this?
 - I know, you punk.

674
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:27,550
 Did we do everything we were supposed to?

675
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:34,420
 But remember one thing. If a guy like you comes back, a guy like me will show up for sure.
