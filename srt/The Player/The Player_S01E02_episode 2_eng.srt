1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,220

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,880

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,190

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,280

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,060

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,740

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:38,510

8
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,960

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,040

10
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,690
Get out, you punk!

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,360
Let go of me.  I said, let go of me.

12
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,510
Ha Ri, Ha Ri!

13
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,930
Ha Ri!

14
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,480
Byeong Min!

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,700
Come quickly! Quickly!  Quickly!

16
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,560
Come here quickly!  Come here quickly!

17
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,830
Jin Woong!

18
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,740
Ah, wait, wait!

19
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,420
Do it with words.  Words! Please.

20
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,830

21
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,640
Greet me.

22
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,860
Hey Ahjussi, I think you are misunderstanding something,

23
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,660
but we didn't see anything.

24
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,370
Hey, did you see something?

25
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,350
See what? I didn't see anything.

26
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,700
Wow, you cute bastards.

27
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,960
- Hey, Tae Woo!
 - Yes!

28
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,280
I told you that we didn't see anything.

29
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,910
What is Tae Woo going to do?

30
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,840
I told you we didn't see anything!

31
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,300
How do you pretend nothingâ€”

32
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,310
Let's go! Come on!

33
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,690
Hurry!

34
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,460
Ha Ri!

35
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,890
Fast!

36
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,940
Get in quickly!

37
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,730
Aish! Go fast!

38
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,640
Come on! Hurry up, Jin Woong!

39
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,170
Catch them!

40
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,040
Grab on tight!

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,400
Go get them!

42
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,010
Are they gone?

43
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,060
I think so.

44
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,530
Huh?

45
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,070
Oh my goodness, I thought I was going to die.

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,350
Thank you. Let's get along well.

47
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,410
That's fine. How is your body?

48
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,680
I'm in pain even more because you shocked me.

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,480
What a crybaby.

50
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,180

51
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,320
Byeong Min, the site's down.

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,760
Huh? Let me see!

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,990
Oh. He's right!

54
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,420
I should've at least screenshot a bit earlier.

55
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,300
Then we can't get the video clips?

56
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,960
Right.

57
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,530
Ah, I lost my laptop, too. I'm going to go crazy!

58
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,240
I think there must be someone backing him or there could be a mole in the hospital.

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,710
- Mole?
 - It doesn't make sense that they showed up so fast, even though our location was traced.

60
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,540
Right.  They were on the spot.

61
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,410
What should we do? We don't even know where the evidence is now.

62
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,010
The concerned party would know.

63
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,040
- What about this one?
 - Yeah

64
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Wow, this place is cool.

65
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,280
Yeah, I'm almost here, dude.

66
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,440
Don't worry! The planner will do something.

67
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,510
He'll clean it all up well.

68
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,480
Yeah! See you there, man!

69
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,420
Ah! Shit!

70
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,600
Three Points.

71
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,830
Oppa!

72
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,880
It's okay! We should litter so that they have a job.

73
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,420
Then you should die soon.

74
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,260
So a mortician will have a job too.

75
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,800
Who the fuck are you?

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,990
The one who's come to get you.

77
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,420
I think you will come to this side.

78
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,400
Hey.

79
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,950
- Hey, hey, you, be gentle. 
- I just gave one punch.

80
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,780
Are you okay?

81
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,540
- I told you that my side was better.
 - Are you okay?

82
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,270
Hey, answer me!

83
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,420
Wow, what a crybaby!

84
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,840
The security cameras are off, right?

85
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,410
Are the security cameras off?

86
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,590
Of course, they are off. Who do you think I am?

87
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,540
Hey, where did you learn that?

88
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,180
I've lived on the street since I was young.

89
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,150
When everybody else was learning the time tables, I learned this.

90
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,100
Do you know how to do anything else?

91
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,510
Pick-pocketing?

92
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:10,010
Really! It's true that early education is important.

93
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,500
Wow, the location is really impressive.

94
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,290
There is no CCTV, and no one is passing.

95
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,590
This place is perfect for disguising a hit-and-run accident after killing a woman, right?

96
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,530
How many times do I have to tell you? I never did anything like that!

97
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,730
Yeah, alright, Mister.

98
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,360
Did you really not do it, huh?

99
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,380
Ah, we completely made a wrong guess!

100
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,370
Hey, he says it's not it!

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,860
Maybe you don't know who I am,

102
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,120
but you will rot in jail forever if you don't release me.

103
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,610
Jail? Aish. I don't want to go to jail, though.

104
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,710
Are you going to report me? Ah, I don't know.

105
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,100
Hello, this is 911? Yes, I am reporting a hit-and-run victim.

106
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,680
Yes, his condition?

107
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,380
Ah, I guess he is not completely dead, but almost dying.

108
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,350
- Look at the bleeding. 
- What are you doing?

109
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,040
No. It hit at full speed and then ran!

110
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,720
Oh my god!  How can I tell you the plate numbers when it's this dark?

111
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,450
Just come! So annoying.

112
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,610
Come quickly.

113
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,260
You're ready, right?

114
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,600
Yes.

115
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,710
If I untie you, you're going to report it, aren't you?

116
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,140
You guys are all dead!

117
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,760
Ah, I don't care. So annoying. I'll just let it run over you.

118
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,970
Hey, start!

119
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,030
Start.

120
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,710
Just quiet your mind. Everything is okay.

121
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,230
I'm sorry. Sorry.

122
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,060
It's coming. Coming.

123
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,920
I'll tell you! I'll tell you! Stop quickly!

124
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,620
Are you okay? Huh?

125
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,890
You're alive!

126
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,360
You should've told me earlier!

127
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,440
Let's live a long time. Long time. Okay?

128
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,530
You rascal.

129
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,120

130
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,090
 Here.

131
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,460
 Oh, that.

132
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,340
 You sell all of these for only a thousand?

133
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,450
 These are luxuries.

134
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,800
 Then tell me. I could just use my mom's credit card.

135
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,780
 Ah, if they sent me cash, I could have drinks.

136
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,290
 All that cash is driving me crazy.

137
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,750
 Here, catch it.

138
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,810
 Ain't you all the same, man, huh? All people?

139
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,010
 You get allowance though.

140
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,680
 Me? That's impossible. I also use credit cards.

141
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,230
 What? Then where did you get this?

142
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,040
 You want to know?

143
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,550
 Come here.

144
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,320

145
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,880
 My dad is the CEO of an entertainment company.

146
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,680
 A manager who works there is a broker.

147
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,370
 He connects Korean chaebols

148
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,840
 to girls who will sleep with them.

149
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,180
 He gets paid a lot of commissions.

150
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,650
 I'm running this site as a part-time worker.

151
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,410
 Get money!

152
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,200
 Do you want to join?

153
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,600
 If I join, I'd rather do it myself.

154
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,310
 Here?

155
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,770
 No.  In Korea.

156
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,060
According to him, everything would work out well because Korea is that kind of country.

157
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,180
Where you can do whatever you want.

158
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,810
 I'm telling you that it's true. Search up the Daechi-dong high school girl murder case.

159
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,910
 I murdered that girl.

160
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,810
 But look what happened. I got released.

161
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,060
 It's just how it is. With one phone call, my dad can make all the police and prosecutors

162
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,550
 crawl on their knees.

163
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,560
 Yeah, I understand!

164
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,790
 Chairman.

165
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,980
 You've worked hard, go and rest.

166
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,590
 You're someone who's going to do great things. Don't take these things seriously.

167
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,690
 Hey, you punk! Stand up straight, you didn't commit the crime.

168
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,810
 Honey, you don't think that it was Seong Goo who did it, do you?

169
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,840
 Poor people are always like that.

170
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,120
 In order to take money away from us, they manipulate naive and innocent kids like Seong Goo

171
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,700
 and frame them for something they didn't do.

172
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,060
 Look into places to send the child to study abroad in America.

173
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,410
Still, he is better.

174
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,200
You bastards are really malicious.

175
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,370
Those bitches asked for it first.

176
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,300
They should've just taken the money and finished up.  I don't understand!

177
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,400
Bitches who don't have anything don't know their positionâ€”

178
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,270
You bastard! Follow me.

179
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,340
I can't take this anymore.

180
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,140
Stop hitting me!

181
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,660
You make me furious!

182
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,840
Hey, I heard you were going to establish a foundation.

183
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,270
Foundation?

184
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,350
What kind of foundation?

185
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:28,630
Ah, nothing special. It's something like helping kids achieve their dreams of becoming classical musicians.

186
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,010
That's classy.

187
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,840
I should contribute something to society now.

188
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,270
Cheers.

189
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,490
I can't find it.

190
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,000
It's true. There's really nothing here. We went through everything.

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,710
There is really nothing. Not even stuff we can change into money.

192
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,120
Ah, really. I got it. I told you I got it.

193
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,880
What did he say?

194
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,570
What do you mean, what he said?  He said to search more.

195
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,190
Because he doesn't do it himself, he makes us search very hard!

196
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,210
Let me see.

197
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,640
He said we should take something of value since we're already here.

198
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,870
Should we at least take some books?

199
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,310
No, I don't really like words.

200
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,060
Ah Ryeong, I'm saying this because I feel like you're my sister.

201
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,320
People should read,

202
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,520
so your vocabulary improves and your imagination becomes enriched.

203
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,590
When you stab someone else in the back, your creativityâ€”

204
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,130
I checked. The video clips aren't here.

205
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,490
But this is enough.

206
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,480
Then let's meet at the hideout.  We're heading there now.

207
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,970
Yeah.

208
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,400
- Ha Ri.
 - Yes?

209
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,750
You're right.

210
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,410
 She woke up. I'll take care of her.

211
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,990
Byeong Min, not to our place but to the hospital!  Come as soon as possible.

212
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,520
- Hey, take him out.
 - What?

213
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,850
- Hurry! 
- Damn.

214
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,190
Come out. Out.

215
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,130
Out. Get out of here.

216
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,280
- Should I ride in the back seat?
 - No, don't.

217
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,060
Hey!

218
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,210
Hey! Hey!

219
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,730
You just need to put this in her IV. She will go into cardiac arrest soon after that.

220
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,640
- He said it's the sixth floor, right?
 - He said it's the sixth floor.

221
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,550
Why are we using the stairs? Let's use an elevator.

222
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,190
How can we go all the way up to the sixth floor?

223
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,520
Ah, really.

224
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,410

225
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,470

226
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,690

227
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,650
Come on.

228
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,690
Oppa, don't you even know Debussy?

229
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,490
Are you sure you're going to be in charge of a foundation?

230
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,350
Then do you know Bach?

231
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,060
You think he's way too ignorant.

232
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,240
Yeah.

233
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,820
What?

234
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,860
What?

235
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,080
How on earth did you handle it?

236
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,310
Find her right now!

237
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,950
Understand?

238
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,620
You look good.

239
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,070
You look the same too.

240
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,160
Acting out of the blue is the same as well.

241
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,570
Oh my.

242
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,790
Department Head Choi, you're going to help me, right?

243
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,520
Please let me get released by the police.

244
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,830
As for Dad...

245
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,100
don't tell him.

246
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,110
Clean your blood.

247
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,800
If it had been just a little bit later, it would have been dangerous for her.

248
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,860
I think it would be better to bring her to a big hospital because she has so many injuries.

249
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,590
It's a relief.

250
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,290
By the way, how do you know Ha Ri?

251
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,930
I've never seen you before.

252
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,920
Ah, that...

253
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,100
We're friends who work together.

254
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,090
Friends?

255
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,610
He has friends?

256
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,630
I need to go.

257
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,120
Ah.

258
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh, by the way, don't trust Ha Ri too much.

259
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,810
He's someone who can stab you in the back when it comes to money.

260
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,560
What do you mean?

261
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,920
Don't you know? Whatever he says is all lies.

262
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,180
Wait.

263
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,780
Why are you helping him?

264
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,180
Did you come back to your senses?

265
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,100
Who?

266
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,760
We were sent by the prosecution. We are not suspicious people, so relax.

267
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,700
Please lie still. Do not move.

268
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,000
Do you happen to remember the events from that day?

269
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,700
That bastard, Ji Seong Goo did this, right?

270
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,970
Cell phone. Where is my cell phone?

271
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:44,990
Please use this.

272
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,650
No, I want my cell phone. I recorded it there.

273
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,260
Recorded?

274
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,180
When it happened,

275
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,550
 I'll come and get you!

276
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,450
That bastard.

277
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,980
Don't get mad. There must be some other way.

278
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,580
In which district did the incident happen?

279
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,240
Ah, at the Seoyeon police station, Team Leader Sim, the dog you met before.

280
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,460
That bastard did it again?

281
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,780
Since it was a hit-and-run, there's a high possibility that it was handed over to him.

282
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,680
Regardless of money or whatever, can't we just reveal all this?

283
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,850
You said there are video clips for foreign transactions. That'll be enough, right?

284
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,870
But there aren't Hong Hwan Hui's and Park Seon Yeong's videos.

285
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,820
For others, if he buys them with money and says he took them with mutual consent, it's so obvious that a trial will come to nothing.

286
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,590
Then we just stay still and watch the bastard who put a person in that condition?

287
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,230
We have to find it, no matter what.

288
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,080
You don't mean to infiltrate the police station, do you?

289
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,570
I'm allergic to police stations.

290
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,760

291
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,140
What's this? Hold on.

292
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,630
Wait a second. Guys, come take a look at this.

293
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,010
 As Chairman Ji appointed him as director of Hyung Jin Culture Foundation, a foundation with a strong amount of influence,

294
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,210
 it seems he intends to personally train his successor.

295
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,690
 Many believe that he is officially beginning his training in management.

296
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,030
 Father is still healthy.

297
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,760
 I don't think it's time to discuss succession yet.

298
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,120
 I want to focus on learning right now.

299
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,780
 Ji Seong Goo who publicly showed up for the first time to the official event...

300
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,970
I take back what I just said.

301
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,820
 He will continue participating in official events.

302
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,180
Ah, you're taking me again?

303
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,340
You're really being too much!

304
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,810
He is here again, really.

305
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,550
Who did? Tell me quickly!

306
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,190
Detective Woo, make that thing be quiet.

307
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,030
So noisy. Hey!

308
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,520
You check every nook and cranny of that hospital, okay?

309
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,300
You get CCTV clips by today and report back to me, okay?

310
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,210
Hang on.

311
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,700
Hello?

312
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,220
Really!  How did you driveâ€”

313
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,490
Understood.

314
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,150
Where are you going again?

315
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,080
Someone scratched my car!

316
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,200
Wait for me.

317
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,950
Who scratched my car?

318
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,040
Geez!

319
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,960
I'm sorry.

320
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,230
Look in front of you when you walk.

321
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,540
You have a pretty face butâ€”

322
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,700
I really...

323
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,230
When you're hot, have some cold noodles.

324
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,810
Your order is here!

325
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,890
Hello, your delivery is here.

326
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,880
Who ordered? I didn't order.

327
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,040
Team Leader Sim paid on his way out.

328
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,720
But why did he order without even mentioning it to us?

329
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,790
It's okay. Just have some.

330
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,850
Where is the team leader's desk, so I can leave his serving there?

331
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,540
Over there.

332
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,320
Wait a minute.

333
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,910
Don't you have fried dumplings?

334
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,270
Oh, I didn't give them to you!

335
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,480
I totally forgot!

336
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,560
Here they are!

337
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,320
This is good business. I was almost upset.

338
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,590
Of course, I brought it.

339
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,640
Enjoy your meal.

340
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,700
Let's eat.

341
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,280
Fried dumplings always go well with black bean noodles.

342
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:32,910

343
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,450
Oh my, oh my, to my love.

344
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,300
Which punk did this? He's dead!

345
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,550
I really...

346
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,500
Be prepared.

347
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,100

348
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,030
Is it done?

349
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,370
These bastards!  We're right. They're following the one calling the shots.

350
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,290
 There are a truckload of emails between Department Head Choi and him.

351
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,480
Is that so?  Then make a copy of all of them. I'll be there soon.

352
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,860
 - We can't carry them in our truck.
 - Hey, really.

353
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,620
What's wrong?

354
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,650
- A really big truckâ€”
 - Look ahead! I'm crazy busy!

355
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,660
What?

356
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,360

357
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,260
I found it!

358
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,660
Why didn't he pick up the phone?

359
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,150
Oh my!

360
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:02,520
You bastards, what are you eating at this time?

361
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,420
Team Leader you ordered thisâ€”

362
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,690
Go to hell!

363
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,960
Inspector Choi, did you touch my computer?

364
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,650
What is this?

365
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,590
Let's look this way!  You that way!

366
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,420
Search and find them!

367
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,410
Yes! Let's go!

368
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,360
Rat-like bastards. Where are they hiding?

369
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,660
- There they are! 
- Catch them!

370
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Over there! Catch them!

371
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,220
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

372
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,320
Get in, get in, get in!

373
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,020
Quickly! Quickly, quickly!

374
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,280
Get in!

375
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,010
Quickly Quickly!

376
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,430
Quick!

377
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,680
We should catch all of them!

378
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,670
Is it broken?

379
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,900
Yeah, it froze up.

380
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,790
You can't restore it?

381
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,460
I told you it froze up. I can restore it once it turns on!

382
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,330
It works! Works! I can restore it!

383
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,590
How long will it take?

384
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,800
Ten minutes! Ten!

385
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,610
Quickly, quickly!

386
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,260
 A car was stolen!

387
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,530
Requesting support. 71R-0661.

388
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,330
Stop 71R-0661!

389
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,870
Is there a lot left?

390
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm doing it! I just turned it on!

391
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,930
Stop the car over there!

392
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,650
No, no, don't stop the car!

393
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,020
No, no, you can't stop now.

394
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,500
Over there, turn at the Sae Ahn Crossroad!

395
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,830
Turn over!

396
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,280
- At the Sae Ahn Crossroad! Quickly! Quickly!
 - I got it!

397
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,230
Don't stop!

398
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,190
Don't!

399
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,890
Ah Ryeong, we're going to go ahead. Take the car and meet us there.

400
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,660
This way.

401
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,520
Search thoroughly! They've got to be here!

402
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,330
 Yes!

403
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,290
Come quickly!

404
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,290
Ah really!  Friend, really!

405
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,260
Come quickly!

406
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,210
Quickly!  Quickly!

407
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,600
I can't go!

408
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,690
We go this way, you go that way!

409
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,890
You go this way!

410
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,880
These bastards!

411
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,260
Quickly come.

412
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,940
Be careful!  Gangsters are following you too.

413
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,560
What?

414
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,220
Okay!

415
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,630
Quickly.

416
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,470
Come this way!

417
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,530
Oh!

418
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,430
Where are you going in such a hurry?

419
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,430
Should I show you?

420
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,790
Don't say anything that's not really in your heart.

421
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,030
You're quick to catch onto things.

422
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,660
Attack.

423
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,100
Don't follow me! If you follow me, then they will follow us!

424
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,900
I said not to follow me!

425
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,260
Byeong Min, I'll be with you.

426
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,690
Please don't follow me!

427
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,060
I told you not to follow me!

428
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,260
Go quickly!

429
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,020
Damn!

430
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,900
Damn!

431
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,150
Close the door!

432
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,720
Get out of here, quick!

433
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,760
I understand!

434
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,690
Block that!

435
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,530
- Hurry!
 - Just block the door!

436
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,590
You bastard!

437
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,050
Hey, hey!

438
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,560
Ah, it hurts.

439
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,250
Don't! Don't come here, you punk!

440
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,260
He is calling you. Calling you.

441
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,610
When you push a person, you should apologize, shouldn't you?

442
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,170
You're out of your mind, aren't you?

443
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,960
Huh? How did you know that? That's a secret.

444
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,450
Ah, you bastard. Are you crazy?

445
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,980
- Is it done yet? 
- A little more! Drag it out a little longer.

446
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,570

447
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,210
You bastard!

448
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,880

449
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,500
It's done!

450
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,100
Hey, you bastard!

451
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,520
- Quickly!
 - Hey, done?

452
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,370
Yes!  Done.

453
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,400
Ah, those punks, really!

454
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,360
Bastards, get up!

455
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,350
Hey, Mustache!

456
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,420
I think you'll have to stay behind.

457
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,160
I'm the type of person that can't stand to be in debt to others.

458
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,810
Where are they? These bastards.

459
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,860
Hey, give the USB to me.

460
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,070
What?

461
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,160
Give it to me.

462
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,550
Where did they go?

463
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,230
I'll take care of it.

464
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,430
Just give it to me.

465
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:18,470
Why do you keep saying that? I'll keep it.

466
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,820
Here.

467
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,350
You go first.

468
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:27,680
What? Where are you going?

469
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,490
Geez!

470
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,410
If you have that much skill, you should quit fighting and become an athlete.

471
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,450
You bastard!

472
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,010
Hey you. Get in quickly.

473
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,210
Move yourself, hurry!

474
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,920
Close the door quickly!

475
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,050
- What about Ha Ri?
 - I don't know. 
 - You can't get in touch with him?

476
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,250
He's not answering. He took the phone and USB.

477
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,890
He has the external drive, too.

478
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,080
Ah, this punk! What is he thinking of doing?

479
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,590
Let's get going first. If we stay here, even weâ€”

480
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,970
Right. Hurry!

481
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,640
- You bastard, because of you, you came lateâ€” 
 - I took care of all the gangsters! You could go firstâ€”

482
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,970
Ah, be quiet everybody!

483
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,480
Nice to see you, rats!

484
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,920
What does he mean rats?

485
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,470
This wenchâ€” My walletâ€”

486
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,240
Everybody, drag them out!

487
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,180
Ah, really.

488
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,120
That's enough, Ahjussis! You already tied me up enough.

489
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,750
Hey, come here. Come on.

490
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,580
What are you looking at?

491
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,300
Take it easy.

492
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,480
Tie them up well, okay?

493
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,140
Are you okay?

494
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,620
Department Head Choi, we caught the rats.

495
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:46,430
It's okay, so just leave them alone.

496
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,550
Chairman.

497
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,270
You poor things, what shall you do?

498
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,330
That scammer bastard went over to Chairman Ji's side.

499
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,450
What?

500
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,550
 Don't trust Ha Ri too much.

501
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,790
 He's someone who can stab you in the back when it comes to money.

502
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,170
So,

503
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,240
you should have trusted someone who is trustworthy.

504
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,300
Anyhow, you're all going to be dead. Understand?

505
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,600
Detective Choi, let's go eat first.

506
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,370
Ah, I'm hungry.

507
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,330
 Even if you report this to the police, what do you think will change?

508
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,670
 Moreover, they don't take sides with the weak, like you.

509
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,630
 Prosecutors, judges, and congressmen. All they care about is money.

510
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,930
Do you believe me now?

511
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,310
If it's not enough, I can show you the video.

512
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,840
You want to take money from me?

513
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,020
Ah, what a disappointing way you're taking this!

514
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,200
If your son gets caught, what's going to happen to your company's image? That'll be completelyâ€”

515
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,320
Compared to that, this is just a small amount of money.

516
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,030
Of course, you have another copy.

517
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,460
Really, you don't think I came prepared?

518
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,200
If I don't contact them within ten minutes, they'll send it to the prosecutor right away.

519
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,050
And they'll add the emails that the man over there has exchanged with Team Leader Sim.  Good job, Department Head Choi.

520
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,400
You don't seem to care about how your friends are doing.

521
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,950
Please, who has friends these days?

522
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,580
Money is a friend.

523
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,890
Right! Money is a friend.

524
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,460
- Bring it.
 - Yes, Chairman.

525
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:51,460
The view is magnificent here. When could I live in a place like this?

526
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,430
You, where did you come from?

527
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,600
If you had that much guts, we would've already met each other.

528
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,140
It seems like you don't remember me.

529
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,590
Anyway, how can you remember a mere person like me?

530
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,690
You have a humble side too.

531
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:08,450
I should be humble if I want to live long.

532
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,010
Keep your promise.

533
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,630
Of course.

534
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:39,830
If you take care of things on your end, I'll delete all the copies. Then, bye.

535
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:44,470
Work hard! Oh oh, you're so untidy.

536
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,360
- How did you take care of matters like this? Do you think I pay you a salary for you to handle the matters like this? 
 - I'm sorry.

537
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,670
Bring Seong Goo right away! If you find that wench, get rid of that bastard too.

538
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,800
What a rude bastard!

539
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,290

540
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,490

541
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,050

542
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,340
Yes?

543
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,850
Please wait a moment.

544
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,440
Prosecutor, pick up the phone.

545
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,140
Who is that? Why are they not calling my cell phone?

546
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,980
It's some woman. She's saying she is with the victim who was sexually assaulted by Ji Seong Goo.

547
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,380
Yes. I'm Prosecutor Jang In Gyu.

548
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:17,250
- Push. Push.
 - Please. Please.

549
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:21,660
Hey. Please stop.

550
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,620
-  Push!
 - Ah, really! Stop!

551
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,940
Ah, the more I think about it, the more upset I am. He abandoned us and went to Chairman Ji?

552
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:34,100
Hey, tell me honestly. Did you receive Chairman Cheon's money that we stole from Ha Ri?

553
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,060
I didn't get it. He said he would give it to us after opening an overseas account.

554
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,840
Hey, I'm getting the feeling that you're suspecting even me now.

555
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,630
Then do you think I can't suspect you when you handed the USB over to him at once?

556
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,730
Who knew things were going to be like this, huh?

557
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,390
- What in the hell good did you do? Don't talk back to me!
 - You asked me first. That's why I talked back to you!

558
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:58,260
Ah, stop! Why are you grown-ass men acting like this and not thinking of getting out of here?

559
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,200
We'll talk later.

560
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,310
Ah, what are you doing?

561
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,420
Wow!

562
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,180
How did you untie that?  That's awesome.

563
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,540
Let's check whether we will get paid or not after catching him first.

564
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,910
- Hey, get rid of ours too.
 - She is much better at getting out than that black pig is.

565
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,070
Don't untie him. Don't.

566
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,230
Don't come, you pig.

567
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,300
Ah Ryeong.

568
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,210
What the heck.

569
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,480
I'm pretty busy right now,

570
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,470
so come on in together without wasting time.

571
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,570
We should take a number.

572
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,920
Who are you?

573
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,140
The report number is 39.

574
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,400
We're from Seo Woon Police Criminal Division. We came here after receiving a report.

575
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,580
Report?

576
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,080
- Search here!
 - Yes.

577
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,630
Why are you acting like this? What are you doing?

578
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,920
Please, stop it.

579
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,390
Is it locked? Hold on.

580
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,160
One, two, three!

581
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,100
You could get yourselves hurt.

582
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,940
Prosecutor Jang!  What brings you here?

583
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,090
I came here to have my stomach checked.

584
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,880
How about you?  Team Leader Sim, what brings you here?

585
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,390
We came here after receiving a report.

586
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,860
Report?  What kind of report?

587
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,230
Oh my?

588
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,490
How is she here?

589
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,490
Aigoo, where are you going?  Please go in.

590
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,700
Okay, we'll go in first.

591
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,960
- Wait, wait. I got it.
 - Okay.

592
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,640
What is this?

593
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,110
Well...

594
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,680
It seems everybody is here now.

595
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,980
Shall we have a three-party encounter?

596
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,720
Prosecutor, what are you talking about? I don't get it.

597
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,240
Aigoo, aigoo.

598
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,480
Block them. Block them.

599
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,720
Ah, really.

600
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,290
Let's go catch that bastard.

601
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,590
It seems they're angry.

602
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:19,000
Kang Ha Ri, where are you? Once I catch this bastard, I'll kill him.

603
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,150
I'll tear off his arms and legs.

604
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,540
- What are you doing?
 - Huh?

605
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,290
I dozed off. I have narcolepsy.

606
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,220
Narcolepsy?

607
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,510
It's okay.

608
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,850
Let's go.

609
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:03,140
You bastard!

610
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,710
- What shall I do with him?
 - Push him.

611
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,060
- Push him?
 - Hey!  Hold on.

612
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,160
- I came here because I was worried about you all!
 - Push him.

613
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,320
Hey!

614
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,590
Let go. Hey!

615
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,320
I'll go. I'll go on my own.

616
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,970
Why are you doing this to me?

617
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,970
 I got it.

618
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:27,620
The ambulance will be here soon. Now, you don't need to worry.

619
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,160
Thank you, Prosecutor.

620
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:35,260
Take good care of yourself.

621
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,450
Wait a moment.

622
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:41,750
He said to give this to you when you came.

623
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,010
The person who helped me.

624
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,650
Dike's scales.

625
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:02,000
 (Goddess of Justice - The scales held by the goddess symbolize the standards of justice)

626
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,290
 How many people?

627
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,620
 Chairman Cheon?

628
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,270
 Let's finish up now.

629
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,710
 Give us your hands.

630
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:33,930
 Let go of me.

631
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,930

632
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,970
 Who are you?  Do you have proof?

633
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,920
 Proof?

634
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,820
 I do have it.

635
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,620
 What is that?

636
00:47:53,960 --> 00:48:00,960

637
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:05,710
Here you go. Plug it in here, please.

638
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,530
Wait a moment.

639
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,710
It's coming up. Let's open it.

640
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,650
Can we trust this? This could be fabricated.

641
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,190
No. I'm sure of it.

642
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:25,240
During Chairman Cheon's case, the exact same USB was delivered to us.

643
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,110
Let's go to Ji Seong Goo.

644
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,670
Yes.

645
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,960

646
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,900
Now, everybody understands it all, right?

647
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,990
That's not bad.

648
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:06,890
Okay, how about you?

649
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:08,310
I understood. Even though I understand it,

650
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:12,420
I'll kill you if you act on your own one more time.

651
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,180
I said I got it! You've already said it more than a hundred times!

652
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,990
Anyhow, let's talk again later.

653
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:22,790
Anyhow, what a grudge! He's as big as a bear, but inside he's so small and petty.

654
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:23,570
Are you okay with that?

655
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,060
I'm too busy to talk, so don't talk to me.

656
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:26,940
- Don't talk to me.
 - Don't talkâ€”

657
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,130
- You talked to me first. 
 - You're going to start talking.

658
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,520
- You knew you were going to talk. I knew it.
 - Well,

659
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,790
let's get to it. Okay?

660
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:37,920
Hold on. Keep one thing in mind.

661
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,630
This is about speed, okay?

662
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,320
Yes.

663
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,800
I'm sorry.

664
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,240
Yes.

665
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,960
Yes.

666
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,800

667
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,570

668
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:45,780
Hello, are you one of the contractors?

669
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,490
Yes? Oh yes.

670
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:52,110
I think I saw you on TV. You're a weather caster, right?

671
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:56,420
How did you know? Not a lot of people know me.

672
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,320
It's connected.

673
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,040
Just wait a bit. I'll do the rest.

674
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,560
Stay put.

675
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,390
I will buy you something.

676
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,690
Then, let's go to that lounge.

677
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,780
Ji Seong Goo's here.

678
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,120
Do you play golf?

679
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,980
Yes.

680
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,820
I have a busy schedule.

681
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,610
I see. I think I've seen you on the golf channel before.

682
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,330
How did you know?

683
00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,060
- Do you play golf well?
 - A little.

684
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,660
Do you play well?

685
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,300
I just started playing it, so...

686
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,320
Oh, looks like I ran out of time. If you have the time next time, let's have coffee.

687
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,690
Work hard!

688
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:19,580
Let's go.

689
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,930
What are you trying to do? Are you here to hit on someone?

690
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:25,690
Hitting on? I'm working.

691
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,760
Okay, the preparations are done.

692
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,870
It's done.

693
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:39,700
Okay, I'm looking forward to it.

694
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,290
- There are no problems, right?
 - Of course not.

695
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,510
Take care of your own stuff.

696
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,410
Wow.

697
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,310
Are you a child? How can you live doing whatever you want?

698
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:53,380
But you said it was fine to do it.

699
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,750
You said I was going to achieve great things and shouldn't be worried about the little things.

700
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,020
Can you even say those kinds of words right now?

701
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,310
You're not in a position to say such things to me.

702
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,680
- You little punkâ€” 
 - Aigoo!

703
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,290
Judge. And even congressmen came as well.

704
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:10,300
It's an honor to have you.

705
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,640
You're doing something so good. Of course, we had to come.

706
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,260
Your son is so handsome. He could be a politician.

707
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,450
I am flattered.

708
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,580
Why? You're going to help him?

709
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:25,680
Why not? We need to have a young assemblyman in our party.

710
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,540
A simple person like me couldn't.

711
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,700
Let's head in.

712
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,480
- Here.
 - Let's go.

713
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,640
Yes, we should go in.

714
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,280
Have you been busy?

715
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,200
Congratulations.

716
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,950
Congratulations.

717
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,950
You must have prepared a lot.

718
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,050
Thank you.

719
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,640
The Hyung Jin Cultural Foundation Inauguration ceremony will begin now.

720
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,700
Let's start with a warm round of applause.

721
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,680
You've prepared a lot, Chairman.

722
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,510

723
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:37,200
 Hello, I'm Director Ji Seong Goo of the Hyung Jin Cultural Foundation.

724
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,680
 Hyung Jin Group has been operating under the motto, "With our neighbors. With our country.

725
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,420
 With our world."

726
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,820
 Hyung Jin Cultural Foundation was founded on one of the greatest businessmen of the Group, Ji Mok Hyun,

727
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:51,410
 with his philosophy of contributing to society.

728
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:54,320
 This is considered as Hyung Jin Group's philosophy as well.

729
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,190
 People become greater when they give to others.

730
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,610
 The Hyung Jin Cultural Foundation...

731
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:07,850
Three.

732
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,170
Yes, it's unbelievable.

733
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,650
What would you guys do without me?

734
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,820
 Nextâ€” willâ€” beâ€”

735
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:21,070
 It disappeared so suddenly.

736
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,480
Isn't that a bit too much?

737
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,130
What do you want? All his work is like that.

738
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,720
I can hear everything.

739
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,660
Sorry.

740
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:38,100

741
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,490
Criminal?

742
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,780
What is that? Sexually assaulted someone?

743
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,950
Huh?

744
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:47,230
What is that?  It says Ji Seong Goo didâ€”

745
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:49,260
What's going on?  Even Senior Director Ji Seong Hwanâ€”

746
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,940
That's ridiculous.

747
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,380

748
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,070

749
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,420
Why isn't it working?

750
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,660
 Even if you report this to the police, what do you think will change?

751
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,150
 Moreover, they don't take sides with the weak, like you.

752
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:22,960
 Prosecutors, judges, and congressmen. All they care about is money.

753
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,680
 Who do you think will even bother listening to your story?

754
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,550
 Who do you think will listen to you?

755
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,860
What is this? Let's go.

756
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,490
- How indecent!
 - That's what I mean.

757
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,460
Chairman. I think you should leave.

758
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,180
Dad, that isn't me!

759
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,800
Dad, you believe me, right? Right Dadâ€”

760
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,130
What are you waiting for? Take him away!

761
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,690
Dad. Dad!

762
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,950
- This is unbelievable! 
 - They should be ashamed!

763
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:51,720
How deceiving!

764
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,600
It's really unbelievable!

765
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,700
Let's go.

766
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,490
What are you doing right now?

767
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:12,070
You know how well I've supported you all this time, and you embarrass me like this?

768
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:16,090
Take care of this, while I'm telling you nicely. Understand?

769
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:19,300
Good evening, Chairman.

770
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:36,390
Why don't we have beef soup together? 
  (Beef soup is a popular menu item, often ordered during interrogation)

771
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:40,960
In an interrogation room. I'll order it to go.

772
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,310
What? Do I have to tell you everything?

773
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:59,540
Look into it quickly, whether it be Incheon or somewhere else.

774
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,440
I'm telling you to move, you bastard!

775
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,230
Cheese!

776
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:28,740
Huh?

777
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,280
What?

778
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,920
What are you guys? Cops?

779
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,920
You must not know who I am.

780
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,930
How could I not know a person as important as you?

781
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:54,250
I'm normally a very gentle person, so I can let most things slide,

782
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:57,600
but I can't hold back against people who harass women.

783
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:00,760
Don't come near me.

784
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,010
Why? Can't you hit a man?

785
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:04,690
Why?

786
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,300
He got him.

787
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:16,690
Let me go. Wait a second.

788
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,030
Wait a second.

789
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,820
You shouldn't use your fist like that.

790
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,350
You should live a good life, you bastard.

791
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,970
He doesn't seem that way, but he has a violent side.

792
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:45,720
I know, right?

793
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,810
Wow!

794
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:57,230
Ha Ri, you're the best. We don't need Jin Woong now.

795
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,530
Now let's head out to get Chairman Ji.

796
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,030
Let's go then. Hey, you can get out.

797
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:06,100
Jin Woong, we don't need you anymore.

798
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:44,790

799
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:46,930

800
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:54,110
Seong Goo, since we took care of it according to the law,

801
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:57,570
it feels great, doesn't it?

802
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:35,620
 I can't.  My leg got hurt.

803
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:46,050
Don't make a sound, you moron.

804
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:55,750
You go first.

805
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:09,490
How did he think to hide it in a church basement?

806
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:12,080
They're so creative when it comes to hiding money.

807
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,480
How well they indulge in playing petty tricks.

808
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,990
It worked.

809
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:32,510
Did it work?

810
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,000
It's done.

811
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:46,000

812
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,500
Wow.

813
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:55,190
Look at all that money!

814
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:03,490
We did it! We hit the jackpot!

815
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:10,490
 Wait, what is this? Hey!

816
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:14,940
â™«   If you lose your everything   â™«

817
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:19,420
â™«  Think you canâ€™t go back to the time  â™«

818
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,960
â™«  Keep in mind, itâ€™s not your fault  â™«

819
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,920
â™«  In the end, I am gonna be with you  â™«

820
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,360
â™«  Just walk without thinking, when you lose  â™«
 â™«  Fall, fall as far as you can, when you get further from happiness  â™«

821
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,420

822
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:36,530
 Aren't laws supposed to punish the guilty and protect the innocent?

823
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:40,290
 They make it so that they can use the law to their advantage and judge themselves. Why do we have to...?

824
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:44,610
 I will bring evidence no matter what.

825
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,440
 - What is this? 
 - The people you have to capture.

826
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,870
 Concrete evidence they can't worm their way out of.

827
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:51,090
 Definitive evidence.

828
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:54,300
 Make sure to bring a better player.

829
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,630
 With that cash that we take from themâ€”

830
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:58,010
 Are we okay today?

831
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:58,990
 The setting (setup) is done.

832
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:01,310
 Let's start the next round.

833
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:04,870
â™«  Someday my heart someday the timing will be right, until we part  â™«

834
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:08,970
â™«  If you lose your everything  â™«
