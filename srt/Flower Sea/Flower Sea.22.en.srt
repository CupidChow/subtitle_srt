Is he the President?

3
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,790
Can we trust what he says?

4
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,830
I confirmed with Mr. Deng Hui,

5
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,620
it really is the President.

6
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,240
If the President says

7
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,700
a solar eclipse might actually

8
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,740
help us switch back,

9
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,490
I think we should take the chance.

10
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,490
Worth a shot when desperate.

11
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,990
Did you check when the eclipse is?

12
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,420
This Saturday.

13
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,290
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

14
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,130
So soon?

15
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,950
But I'm worried,

16
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,540
what if we don't switch back?

17
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,290
Then we'll just keep trying.

18
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,950
The President's still in the country.

19
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,990
We can find him again.

20
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,740
If we fail this time,

21
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,000
you should come stay

22
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,040
at my place for a bit.

23
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,490
Your mom keeps mentioning you,

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,980
"Chen Jing'an is so thoughtful.

25
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,040
Hope she visits us often."

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,880
Okay.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,240
Before I realized,

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,160
Li Minqiu had been gone for days.

29
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,250
Chen Jing'an,

30
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,830
my gut tells me

31
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,830
Li Minqiu's leaving

32
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,450
is just the beginning.

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,330
More things will happen next.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
We'll see.

35
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,700
Stop talking nonsense.

36
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,620
Let's go on a picnic tomorrow.

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,000
Picnic?

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Tomorrow might have the solar eclipse.

39
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,620
The President said

40
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,700
this eclipse

41
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,700
has a high chance

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,200
of altering magnetic fields,

43
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,290
meaning

44
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,870
Zhu Niannian and I could switch back.

45
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,910
Since we're so close,

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,620
shouldn't we spend this big day

47
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,080
together?

48
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,200
Perfect!

49
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,830
I'll bring tons of snacks.

50
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,990
Once you switch back,

51
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,330
you can visit my place.

52
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,450
My mom won't stop talking about you.

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040
I'll go find Niannian, Shasha, and Changning.

54
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,160
(Not just the two of us?)

55
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,540
I was about to find you.

56
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,080
Let's have a group meal tomorrow

57
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,160
and witness my switch in person.

58
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,290
Sure.

59
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,800
I'll ask for a day off.

60
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,660
I'll go find the girls.

61
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,790
Wait.

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,910
Are you free tonight?

63
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,130
Tonight?

64
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,540
I probably can't go out tonight.

65
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,930
Why? What's up?

66
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,370
Wanted to take a walk with you.

67
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,380
A walk?

68
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,920
Just us two?

69
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,830
Then... I'll try to go out.

70
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,580
Okay.

71
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,170
Chen Jing'an.

72
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,250
Chen Jing'an.

73
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,760
There's something

74
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,870
I've kept to myself for three years.

75
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,060
When you read this letter,

76
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,090
I want to tell you...

77
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,460
Tian Ye,

78
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,580
how long have you been in there?

79
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
What are you doing?

80
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,910
Listen,

81
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,700
staying too long gives you hemorrhoids.

82
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,990
Almost done!

83
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,020
Coming out now.

84
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,740
You're already in grade 11

85
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,410
and you haven't improved a bit.

86
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,620
Only your toilet time

87
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,790
keeps increasing.

88
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,720
Move aside.

89
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,580
Move.

90
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,790
Tian Ye.

91
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,920
This kid...

92
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,200
What's he up to all day?

93
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,420
What are you doing?

94
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,170
Mom.

95
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,490
I brought you foot-soaking water.

96
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,870
You silly boy,

97
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,910
it's not nighttime yet.

98
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,160
Why would I soak my feet now?

99
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,880
Mom,

100
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,910
you always say I never improve,

101
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,990
that I'm forever a child.

102
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,040
I'm almost in college.

103
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,620
Shouldn't I show some growth?

104
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,740
Why are you acting so strangely today?

105
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,160
Did you get into trouble?

106
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,620
Why do you always assume the worst?

107
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,000
Can't I just...

108
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,250
suddenly feel like

109
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,620
doing something nice for you?

110
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,870
"Suddenly"?

111
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,450
There's gotta be a reason.

112
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,920
Mom,

113
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,910
since when does that need a reason?

114
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,080
I take it back,

115
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,370
you have improved.

116
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,170
Oh, Mom,

117
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,840
I made plans with Chen Jing'an.

118
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,290
We're picnicking tomorrow.

119
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,700
There will be an eclipse.

120
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,210
So...

121
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,570
can I

122
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,610
skip homework tonight?

123
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,040
Just you and Jing'an?

124
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,490
And Chen Changning,

125
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,910
plus a few others.

126
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,830
Mom, how's the pressure?

127
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,210
Not bad.

128
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,000
Mom,

129
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,870
want some tea?

130
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,040
I'll brew you a cup.

131
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,540
Enough fussing.

132
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,330
Just say it, how much do you need?

133
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,040
I'm not asking for money.

134
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,830
You're going out. Of course you need money.

135
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,200
But I've improved.

136
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,330
I still have leftover cash
from last time.

137
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,910
Now you've improved.

138
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,080
Obviously.

139
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,920
You've spent so much

140
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,620
raising me.

141
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,540
Starting today,

142
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,080
I'll be...

143
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,950
frugal.

144
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,660
Thank goodness your dad's not home.

145
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,490
If he heard this,

146
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,620
he'd just reward you with more money.

147
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,160
My good, good boy.

148
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,130
Dinner's ready. You're going out?

149
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,790
I...

150
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,950
A classmate's birthday.

151
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,210
Everyone's going.

152
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,160
I'd feel bad skipping.

153
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,330
Which classmate?

154
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,330
Deng Shasha.

155
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,380
Deng Shasha?

156
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,330
Is it her birthday today?

157
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,960
Obviously!

158
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,460
Fine, go.

159
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,370
Be back early.

160
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,330
I'm here.

161
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,290
We're picnicking tomorrow,

162
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,490
why meet today?

163
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,630
Honestly...

164
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm nervous.

165
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,290
Are you afraid

166
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,740
that I'll steal your spotlight

167
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,200
after switching back?

168
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,660
I'd love that.

169
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,790
But...

170
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,830
I'm nervous too.

171
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,580
Even though I told Niannian

172
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,450
to stay positive earlier...

173
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,460
I'm scared.

174
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,370
The higher the hopes,
the harder the fall.

175
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,290
Chen Jing'an,

176
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,450
no matter what happens,

177
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,620
you're the most important to me.

178
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,380
What's...

179
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,540
this?

180
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,260
Borrowed from the planetarium.

181
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,670
Try it?

182
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,200
I don't see anything.

183
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,500
Look again.

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,920

269
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,080
I'm leaving soon.

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,240

Oh,

274
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,950
I forgot to pack something.

275
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,910
Excuse me.

276
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,870
This kid...

277
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,990
Jing'an rarely visits,

278
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,290
and you won't even stay?

279
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,410
It's fine, Ms. Liang.

280
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,870
Jing'an, some water?

281
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,960
If you're free,

282
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,990
we could chat.

283
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,170
Of course.

284
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,660
Hey, I heard you switched to liberal arts?

285
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,950
Liberal arts means more memorization.

286
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,910
It's tough, you know.

287
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,910
It's not too bad.

288
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,660
But there are more subjective questions.

289
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,160
Sometimes, answering them

290
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,540
really strains my brain.

291
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,430
Yeah.

292
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,740
Back when Niannian studied liberal arts,

293
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,240
she'd always think

294
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,740
her answers were on the right track,

295
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,910
but then she'd check

296
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,410
the reference answers

297
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,310
and they'd be totally opposite.

298
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,120
In middle school,

299
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,200
she couldn't grasp the questions' intent.

300
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,240
Her answers were always off the mark.

301
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,450
She cried so many times over it.

302
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,240
Later, I told her

303
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,160
to keep practicing.

304
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,380
The more she answered,

305
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,080
the more she figured out the patterns.

306
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,460
Listen,

307
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,590
you just changed subjects.

308
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,870
The science-oriented mindset

309
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,330
won't change overnight.

310
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,410
But don't worry, just be patient.

311
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,330
I think doing a few more practice tests

312
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,870
should help.

313
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,920
You know what?

314
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,580
I even secretly did Niannian's tests.

315
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,370
I'm no teacher,

316
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,880
but I've got some experience.

317
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,290
If you ever need help,

318
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,450
just ask me, okay?

319
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,560
Ms. Liang,

320
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,200
you secretly did Niannian's tests?

321
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,290
Yeah, back then,

322
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,950
I just wanted to study them,

323
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,950
see if I could help her.

324
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,890
But

325
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,750
look at Niannian now,

326
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,740
improving so fast.

327
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,970
She doesn't need me anymore.

328
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,380
Ms. Liang,

329
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,540
you're such a good mom.

330
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,460
What's wrong?

331
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,340
You okay?

332
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,210
I'm fine.

333
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,540
I'm just really touched.

334
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,660
I'll go help Niannian pack.

335
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,170
Mom!

336
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,970
How do I look in this outfit?

337
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,470
Not bad.

338
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,140
But your hairstyle

339
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,970
doesn't quite match the outfit.

340
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,810
Does it look good?

341
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,140
Or not?

342
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,980
Um...

343
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,560
This one's nice.

344
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,850
Then I'll wear this.

345
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,260
Where are the other girls?

346
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,430
Why aren't they here?

347
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,560
Don't rush.

348
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,600
Let's wait a bit.

349
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,430
We're here!

350
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,760
(Waiting Hall)

351
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Why are you late?

352
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,550
Look at our dresses.

353
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,470
Don't we look good?

354
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,600
Yeah, super good-looking!

355
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,760
Of course!

356
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,220
Our faces are just that pretty.

357
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,470
What are you thinking about?

358
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,890
Nothing.

359
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,140
Let's go.

360
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,430
Let's go.

361
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,720
Let's go.

362
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,570
(So many people…)

363
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,260
(How do I bring it up
with Chen Jing'an later?)

364
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,470
No wonder your bag's so stuffed.

365
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,720
It's all snacks.

366
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,220
What's this?

367
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
Nothing.

368
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,060
Eat.

369
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,050
Is this a love letter for someone?

370
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,870
Which one of you has a thing for him?

371
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,250
Why look at me?

372
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,810
Just eat.

373
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,420
Tian Ye, you're keeping secrets

374
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,320
from me?

375
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,050
Why wouldn't I?

376
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,330
When you swapped with Zhu Niannian,

377
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,510
you didn't tell me.

378
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,720
I couldn't just announce it to the world.

379
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,470
Back then, Jing'an thought

380
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,600
if people found out we swapped,

381
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,140
they might send us to a mental hospital

382
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,100
or dissect us like lab rats.

383
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,550
I was afraid bad people would find out.

384
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:34,890
You didn't tell me,

385
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,220
so I was a bad guy?

386
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,970
I don't even know

387
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,050
how to respond.

388
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:42,860
Jing'an and I

389
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,470
thought it was just a dream,

390
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,470
so we did a lot of reckless things.

391
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,050
So that time,

392
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,550
the one went wild on the podium

393
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,760
was Chen Jing'an?

394
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,970
I don't even remember.

395
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,510
You gave the school a ton of complaints.

396
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,760
Director Jiang looked ready to explode.

397
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,470
Forgive me.

398
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,640
Ignorance

399
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,850
is no sin.

400
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,220
That's what I thought.

401
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,970
I knew something was off with you.

402
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,760
I thought you were cutting ties with me.

403
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,300
I was so worried.

404
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,100
Why were you worried?

405
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,510
I told you right after,

406
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,260
but you didn't believe me at first.

407
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,470
Something this crazy.

408
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,100
Who would believe it?

409
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,640
He did.

410
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,220
And he spotted the flaws right away,

411
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,260
even forced Zhu Niannian to confess.

412
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,800
I verified it scientifically

413
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,470
before accepting the swap

414
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,240
as something within my understanding.

415
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,970
This is about trusting science.

416
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,970
A top student's mindset

417
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,890
really is different from us ordinary folks.

418
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,720
Honestly,

419
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,220
when they told me the truth,

420
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,390
I didn't believe it either.

421
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,310
But then,

422
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,260
I thought about

423
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,720
everything that happened.

424
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,060
Other than a swap,

425
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,010
there was no other explanation.

426
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,470
Lately, my mom keeps asking me,

427
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,970
"Why doesn't Jing'an come over?"

428
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,890
"Did you

429
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,550
make her mad again?"

430
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,810
Don't laugh.

431
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,310
I don't even know

432
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,470
how to answer her.

433
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,060
I can't just

434
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,120
bring Niannian to my house, right?

435
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,020
Of course, you can.

436
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,070
That'd be more awkward.

437
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,550
Luckily, you're swapping back soon.

438
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,550
My mom's wish is finally coming true.

439
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,890
But I'm still a little worried,

440
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,760
what if we can't swap back?

441
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,050
It's not 100%...

442
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,470
Don't overthink it now.

443
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,050
Last night before bed,

444
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,470
I called Mr. Deng Hui.

445
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,010
If nothing goes wrong,

446
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,860
we'll meet the President tomorrow.

447
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,470
If today doesn't work,

448
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,300
we'll see the President tomorrow.

449
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,760
You'll swap back anyway.

450
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,430
Yeah.

451
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,350
Besides,

452
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,600
we might not fail today.

453
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,100
Even though they say,

454
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,220
"The higher the hopes,
the harder the fall,"

455
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,720
we can't just give up hope

456
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,850
out of fear.

457
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,720
That's right!

458
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,350
You're absolutely right.

459
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,220
Hand it over.

460
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,470
Hey.

461
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,070
Why don't you confess to Changning?

462
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,220
I'll help set it up.

463
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,980
No need.

464
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,060
He said

465
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,600
we can still be friends,

466
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,970
so I still have a chance.

467
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
Li Minqiu...

468
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,390
Is he still in the dark?

469
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,390
Let me call him,

470
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,230
see what he's up to.

471
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,640
Tian Ye, you're dead.

472
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,850
I was just asleep. Why'd you call?

473
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,890
Why sleep in the middle of the day?

474
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,470
He's abroad.

475
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,890
What time is it for you right now?

476
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,720
Probably early morning.

477
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,470
Did we just wake him up?

478
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,970
Why are you all together?

479
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,360
What are you hiding from me?

480
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,290
We're just having a gathering.

481
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,970
Only after I left?

482
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,220
Why?

483
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,720
Why not when I was still there?

484
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,300
To celebrate you being gone.

485
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,580
I think there's no hope.

486
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,640
No reaction at all.

487
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,720
Our bodies haven't changed.

488
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,720
Did we get the date wrong?

489
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Is the eclipse not today?

490
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,300
It should be right.

491
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,680
Maybe…

492
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,970
we can't see it from here.

493
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,060
It's fine.

494
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,970
Honestly, we were all prepared.

495
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,390
I told you last night,

496
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,140
no matter the outcome,

497
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,680
it's all the same.

498
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,260
Later, when you pick up Niannian,

499
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,350
bring her a jacket.

500
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,300
It's getting chilly.

501
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,560
Got it.

502
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,550
I'm already dressed.

503
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,970
You haven't found your jacket?

504
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,050
Found it.

505
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,470
Huiru,

506
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,760
I'm worried about your health.

507
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,600
Why don't you wait at home?

508
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,800
Let me pick up Niannian,

509
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,680
and come back for you.

510
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,970
Wouldn't that waste time?

511
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,480
Look,

512
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,470
I just don't want you

513
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,850
to get tired from the long ride.

514
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,350
Fine then.

515
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,890
Hurry up and go.

516
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,730
Okay.

517
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,350
How was it?

518
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,310
You got so tanned.

519
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,170
You're the tanned one.

520
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,390
No, you are, the darkest.

521
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:32,930
Not me.

522
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:49,730
Dad.

523
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:50,890
What brings you here?

524
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,820
Your mom asked me to pick you up.

525
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,640
And, well,

526
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,300
to bring Jing'an along too

527
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,180
for dinner at home.

528
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,680
Me?

529
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,140
Yeah.

530
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,970
Come on, the car's in the parking lot.

531
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,850
What about Shasha? Should she come too?

532
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,510
This trip's just for Jing'an.

533
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,140
I'll visit another time then.

534
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,010
You two go ahead.

535
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,310
Bye, sir.

536
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,410
Drive safely, sir.

537
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,480
Let's go.

538
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,470
What's wrong with you?

539
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,050
I feel like something's off.

540
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,980
Niannian.

541
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,180
Jing'an.

542
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,550
Why are you coughing suddenly?

543
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,200
Dad thought you were answering him.

544
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,200
I...

545
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,640
My throat's been a bit uncomfortable.

546
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,010
Stop lying to me.

547
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,720
The crease on this paper

548
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,260
has been here for a while.

549
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,970
Something this big happened.

550
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,970
Why didn't you tell us?

551
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,640
Dad...

552
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,220
How did you feel when you found out?

553
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,980
Shocked.

554
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,720
Scared.

555
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,100
Worried.

556
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,890
And I couldn't accept it.

557
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,220
Yeah.

558
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,260
When we first found out,

559
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,470
we were shocked too.

560
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,800
That's why we didn't dare tell you.

561
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,390
But I'm your father.

562
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,240
I have the right to know

563
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,140
something this big.

564
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,550
And if we knew earlier,

565
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,300
we could've helped you,

566
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,740
instead of

567
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,720
being kept in the dark,

568
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,050
only to suddenly find out

569
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,350
and be scared out of my mind.

570
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,050
I'm sorry, Dad,

571
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,640
for making you worry.

572
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,560
Mr. Zhu,

573
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,970
I'm sorry too.

574
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,470
Jing'an,

575
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,220
do your parents know?

576
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,720
My parents don't know.

577
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,640
But Chen Changning does.

578
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,850
You kids...

579
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,390
This is such a big thing

580
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,970
and none of you tell your parents?

581
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,220
You just hide it yourselves.

582
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,640
If I hadn't found out,

583
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,220
you would've just never told me.

584
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,350
We definitely wanted

585
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,510
to switch back asap.

586
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,800
But... we'll switch back soon anyway.

587
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,220
We really didn't

588
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,720
want to worry our parents.

589
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,470
You can switch back soon?

590
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,470
Yeah, Dad.

591
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,350
We contacted someone really capable.

592
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,050
He might be able to help us.

593
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,760
But don't tell Mom yet.

594
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,720
I'm afraid she won't take it well.

595
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,890
Everything will be back to normal

596
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,600
very soon.

597
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,470
I hope so.

598
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,850
Come in.

599
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,060
You're back.

600
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,720
You're back.

601
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,430
Jing'an's here too.

602
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,560
What's wrong?

603
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,300
Did you two fight?

604
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:47,810
It's nothing.

605
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,800
I was thinking,

606
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,800
since Jing'an's here,

607
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,890
why don't we

608
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,100
just eat at home?

609
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,300
Why didn't you tell me?

610
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,300
I'll start cooking.

611
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,930
No, no, you rest. I'll do it.

612
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,800
You two go to your room first.

613
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,640
Go play for now.

614
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,970
What's going on? Did they fight?

615
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,300
No.

616
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,100
You sit and watch TV.

617
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,640
I'll cook.

618
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,510
It won't take long.

619
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,300
I didn't expect Dad to find out so fast.

620
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,640
I should've hidden the letter.

621
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,850
Honestly, now that Dad knows,

622
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,430
I actually feel a little relieved.

623
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,140
We'd meet the President tomorrow,

624
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,100
better to avoid extra trouble.

625
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,350
Luckily, my dad's more sensible.

626
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,180
If my mom found out

627
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,210
we switched...

628
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,640
I'm afraid...

629
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,720
Mom?

630
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,720
