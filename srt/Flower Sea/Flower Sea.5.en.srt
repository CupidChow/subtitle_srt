00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:11,708
Jing'an

2
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:13,458
Nian Nian

3
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,333
Why are you here?

4
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,291
I came to see someone catch a cheater.

5
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,000
Catch what?

6
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,750
That...

7
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,000
Let me treat everyone to milk tea.

8
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:28,666
Sure, sure!

9
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:31,291
I want

10
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,000
a snow-top milk tea,

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,916
with full sugar and pearls,

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,208
and extra ice cream.

13
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,083
Hello, welcome!

14
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:39,625
Hello.

15
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,500
I'd like a cup of

16
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,208
snow-top milk tea,

17
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,250
with full sugar and pearls,

18
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,041
and add some more ice cream.

19
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,083
Hello

20
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:51,833
Hello

21
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,458
Attention, students

22
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:55,791
Students

23
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,791
After discussion among the key high schools in our city

24
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,833
and unanimous agreement by the school leaders

25
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,500
the originally scheduled

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,083
monthly exam at the end of the month

27
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,916
has been changed to a joint exam among nine schools

28
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,500
That means

29
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,666
the nine nearby middle schools

30
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,041
will take the exam together

31
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,916
As for the exam date

32
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:14,875
it has been moved up

33
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,125
The exam is coming soon

34
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,000
All students, please

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,832
get ready for the exam

36
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,166
and review diligently

37
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't waste your youth

38
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:27,582
Don't let yourself down

39
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,875
No way, the joint exam is this soon?

40
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:32,666
This is too sudden

41
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,832
It's not about whether it's sudden or not

42
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,166
How am I supposed to take both the arts and science exams?

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,207
I don't know either

44
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:41,375
What should we do?

45
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:44,707
Zhu Niannian

46
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,332
The homeroom teacher is looking for you

47
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:51,916
You go ahead

48
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:52,957
We'll talk later

49
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,207
The monthly exam has been moved up.

50
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,457
It's been changed to

51
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:03,791
the joint exam with the nine schools.

52
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,291
You probably already know about this, right?

53
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,166
Your recent performance has made me a bit worried.

54
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,416
I spoke with your mother on the phone earlier.

55
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,707
She said you promised her

56
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,082
that you would get into the top ten in this monthly exam.

57
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,957
I'm glad to see you have this determination.

58
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:20,582
If

59
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:22,250
there's anything in your studies or life

60
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,457
that you need me

61
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:24,541
to help you with,

62
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:25,707
just let me know.

63
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:27,707
I will definitely help you solve it.

64
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:31,375
Top... top ten?

65
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:32,416
That's right.

66
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,541
What's wrong?

67
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,166
Isn't this what you promised?

68
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,000
Teacher,

69
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,750
do you think I can make it into the top ten?

70
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:42,500
Nian Nian,

71
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,416
you're one of the top students in our class.

72
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:47,332
I've always had high hopes for you.

73
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,125
I think

74
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,375
as long as you

75
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,000
review seriously,

76
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,207
judging by your previous grades,

77
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,291
you have a great chance of making it into the top ten.

78
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:58,875
The main thing is to keep a good mindset.

79
00:03:59,207 --> 00:03:59,791
Teacher,

80
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,125
what if I

81
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,957
don't make it into the top ten?

82
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,457
What should I do?

83
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:06,375
Nian Nian,

84
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,332
I have a lot of confidence in you.

85
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,291
You must also have confidence in yourself.

86
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,082
Do you understand?

87
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,500
Chen Jing'an

88
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,625
Have you heard?

89
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,040
The joint exams are coming up soon.

90
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:27,958
What's up?

91
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:29,125
Chen Jing'an

92
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,000
I want to discuss something with you.

93
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,708
What is it?

94
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:33,458
It's just that...

95
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:35,250
For this exam,

96
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,083
can you help me out?

97
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,333
No.

98
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,915
Why not?

99
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,790
We worked together pretty well before.

100
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,250
Weren't we in sync?

101
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,625
If I don't do well this time,

102
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,458
my mom will chase me around the whole neighborhood again.

103
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,875
I'm your best buddy.

104
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,750
You can't bear to refuse me, right?

105
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,958
But I really can't help you this time.

106
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,875
Chen Jing'an

107
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:56,708
I...

108
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:58,375
It's not like I'll copy everything.

109
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,333
Just help me pass, that's all.

110
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,165
I really can't help you.

111
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,165
Besides,

112
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,750
the monthly exam is different from the joint exam.

113
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,250
We should be in different exam rooms.

114
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,833
We won't be in the same room.

115
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,290
This time,

116
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,125
you'll have to rely on yourself.

117
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,083
I'm going to die.

118
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:23,250
You should study hard.

119
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,125
Maybe you'll do well this time.

120
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,290
If I let you copy, wouldn't that hurt you?

121
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:29,833
Why are you suddenly

122
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:30,790
giving me a lecture?

123
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,415
Don't say anything to me.

124
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,583
Let me copy now,

125
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,790
and when it's time for my college entrance exam,

126
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,000
who will I copy from? That kind of talk...

127
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,415
That's not what I meant.

128
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,250
I mean,

129
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:40,375
this time,

130
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:42,125
I don't even have confidence in myself.

131
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:43,833
Let alone help you.

132
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,500
Forget it.

133
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,083
Just forget it.

134
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,040
Your excuse is too lame.

135
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,708
I don't want to hear you talk.

136
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,500
Let me be alone for a while.

137
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,375
Nian Nian,

138
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,250
Did the homeroom teacher call you to the office?

139
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,000
What did she want from you?

140
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,915
She wants me to be in the top ten in the joint exam.

141
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:16,208
How could I possibly do that?

142
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,040
Top ten in the grade

143
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,000
isn't that hard, is it?

144
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,500
You're such a good student.

145
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,875
You can easily get into the top ten.

146
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:24,915
Don't be nervous.

147
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,125
Am I really that good?

148
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:30,665
Did you forget?

149
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:32,500
Last time you had a stomachache during the exam,

150
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,415
you handed in your paper early and still made the top fifteen.

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,790
This time,

152
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,040
just watch what you eat,

153
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,250
and getting into the top ten is a sure thing.

154
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,708
But I'm not Zhu Niannian.

155
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,208
I'm terrible at liberal arts.

156
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,583
You don't need to worry too much.

157
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,415
I can study with you.

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,375
Tomorrow is Saturday.

159
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,958
Let's go to the library together.

160
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:06,165
You go by yourself.

161
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,415
I have something to do tomorrow.

162
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,125
Are you really not going?

163
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,125
I heard

164
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,750
Chen Changning often goes to the library on weekends.

165
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,290
Maybe you'll even run into him.

166
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:23,665
Why would I want to run into him?

167
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,665
Let me tell you a secret.

168
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,750
I saw your sister

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,458
sneaking off to the rock garden.

170
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,165
Look quickly.

171
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,083
Look!

172
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,040
Isn't it?

173
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,458
Can you make it into the top ten in liberal arts?

174
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,583
If I work hard, I probably can.

175
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,625
If you can, why can't I?

176
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,040
Before, to make your mom happy,

177
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,083
I told her I could get into the top ten.

178
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,540
Now your homeroom teacher also wants me to be in the top ten.

179
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,208
Isn't this pushing me into a corner?

180
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,708
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,915
My mom and my homeroom teacher

182
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:27,665
both have high expectations for me.

183
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,958
Don't apologize to me.

184
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,875
I'm not blaming you.

185
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,833
It's just that my foundation in liberal arts

186
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,750
is really too weak.

187
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,500
Whenever I memorize politics or history, I get a headache.

188
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,500
We need to think about what to do for the joint exam.

189
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,083
I don't know either.

190
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,958
I'm also bad at science subjects.

191
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,166
I checked online before.

192
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,875
There won't be any meteor showers anytime soon.

193
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:53,833
I think

194
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,541
we should take the initiative.

195
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,583
Let's look for

196
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,750
other than meteor showers,

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,583
if there's any

198
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,666
other way to switch back.

199
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,916
You want to switch back?

200
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,125
It's not about wanting to or not.

201
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,541
It's that we simply can't handle the joint exam.

202
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,958
Then we have no choice but to switch back.

203
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,291
Do you have any ideas?

204
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,416
Before,

205
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,541
you said

206
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,625
something about magnetic fields

207
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,458
and time travel or something.

208
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,000
I really don't understand.

209
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,708
Let me think.

210
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,250
I remember there's a book in Chen Changning's room.

211
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,541
At that time,

212
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,583
our eldest aunt brought back a rare copy from abroad.

213
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:31,541
It's called

214
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,000
"Amazing Memory."

215
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,208
The book talks about

216
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,750
a foreign scientist

217
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,875
who was already conducting experiments in this field.

218
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,583
I just skimmed through it back then.

219
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,500
I don't remember it very well.

220
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,583
Why don't you get that book

221
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,541
so we can study it together?

222
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,375
Remember,

223
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,666
don't let Chen Changning find out.

224
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,166
Isn't that stealing?

225
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,500
How can it be stealing if it's from our own home?

226
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,000
We're just borrowing it to take a look.

227
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,416
I'm just worried you'll get caught by Chen Changning.

228
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,375
And you'll blurt everything out on the spot.

229
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:55,833
But—

230
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:56,708
No more buts.

231
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:57,583
On Friday afternoon,

232
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,666
Chen Changning will have a test that runs late.

233
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,166
Use that time to get the book.

234
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,250
It's worth a try, even if it's a long shot.

235
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,625
I don't have any other ideas.

236
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,500
What are you doing here?

237
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,125
Me?

238
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,333
I wanted to talk to Chen Jing'an.

239
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,416
No way.

240
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,000
Hiding here to talk?

241
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,916
Of course you have to hide to tell secrets.

242
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,833
What, should I use a megaphone instead?

243
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,750
But what about you, senior?

244
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,375
What are you doing here?

245
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,041
Don't tell me—

246
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,625
Are you here to catch people dating early again?

247
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm just passing by.

248
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,458
I just happened to see you.

249
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,083
What a coincidence that you happened to pass by, senior.

250
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,791
You try to control everything, even the sky and planes.

251
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,333
Now you're even trying to control whether people whisper or not?

252
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:00,458
Chen Jing'an.

253
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,250
Can you stop laughing?

254
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:03,875
It's so noisy.

255
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,666
You try to control everything, even the sky and planes.

256
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,791
Now you're even trying to control whether I laugh.

257
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,375
Why are you looking at me like that?

258
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:21,625
Class is about to start.

259
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,375
Aren't you going back to the classroom?

260
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,333
Then I'll go first.

261
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,458
Stealing books.

262
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:50,875
Go ahead, eat.

263
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,750
What's the special occasion today?

264
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,750
Why did you make so much delicious food?

265
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:57,666
All this?

266
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,708
Your mom made it all to help you prepare for your exams.

267
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,750
By the way, I heard today

268
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,916
that your monthly exam

269
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:06,583
has turned into

270
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,958
a joint exam with nine schools, right?

271
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,458
Yeah.

272
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,666
I was just about to tell you.

273
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,208
Let me tell you,

274
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,916
you need to study hard.

275
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,250
You promised me

276
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,583
that you'd get into the top ten in your grade.

277
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,541
I still remember that.

278
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:25,916
Top ten...

279
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:27,541
That's right.

280
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,166
I have to make it into the top ten.

281
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,916
Forget your top ten!

282
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,208
I might as well be dead.

283
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,041
If—

284
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,416
I mean, if—

285
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:46,708
what if I

286
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,333
don't do well

287
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,208
and don't make it into the top ten?

288
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:53,750
It's okay.

289
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,250
Even if you miss it by a few spots,

290
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,500
as long as you tried your best,

291
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,958
it's fine as long as you have no regrets.

292
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,125
Top ten means top ten.

293
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,833
Even missing by one spot isn't good enough.

294
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,750
Why are you home so early today?

295
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,333
I handed in my test early.

296
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,041
Were you waiting for me?

297
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,583
No.

298
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,208
What do you want to eat later?

299
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,333
Anything's fine.

300
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,375
Did you steal the book?

301
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,583
No.

302
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,625
Chen Changning came back early.

303
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,333
Hello?

304
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,791
Can you talk right now?

305
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:25,916
Yes.

306
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,000
We can't wait any longer.

307
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,208
Your mom wants me to get into the top ten today.

308
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,833
How could I possibly make it into the top ten?

309
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,166
Think of another way.

310
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,500
We have to get the book out.

311
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:36,791
But...

312
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,458
What if I really steal the book,

313
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,583
and Chen Changning notices it's missing?

314
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,125
Wouldn't that make him even more suspicious?

315
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,291
That makes sense.

316
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,375
How about this instead?

317
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,000
You,

318
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,958
find a way

319
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,458
to get Chen Changning out of the house.

320
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,583
Then I'll go home

321
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,125
and check the book myself.

322
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:57,875
After I finish reading it,

323
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,375
I'll quietly put it back without anyone noticing.

324
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,083
That way, he won't find out.

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That book—

326
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,791
Is there really a way to swap it?

327
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,291
I'll have to see it to know.

328
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,125
Alright.

329
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why are you looking at me?

330
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,791
Aren't you going to the library today?

331
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,291
What would I go to the library for?

332
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,625
I mean,

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,625
well...

334
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,208
The entrance exams are coming up soon.

335
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,000
You need to make good use of your time to review.

336
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,875
So now you care about my studies?

337
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,500
Of course I care about you.

338
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,833
Isn't that what I should do?

339
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:11,333
Alright.

340
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:12,875
Let's go together then.

341
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,000
No, no, no.

342
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,583
I'm not going.

343
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,000
It's okay if I don't do well on the exam.

344
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,208
But you still have the recommendation exam.

345
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,083
I heard

346
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,166
that they also look at your usual grades for that.

347
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:27,625
Alright.

348
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:28,875
I'll go then.

349
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,916
When will you be back?

350
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,333
I...

351
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:53,666
I'll be back later.

352
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:54,666
Okay.

353
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:55,833
Then you...

354
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:56,875
Take care on your way.

355
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,250
That's strange.

356
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,583
I remember it was right here.

357
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,416
Why is it gone?

358
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,625
It used to be right here.

359
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,250
Why is it gone?

360
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,708
Nian Nian, haven't you seen it before?

361
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,208
No, I haven't.

362
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,291
Did Chen Changning just take it?

363
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:19,833
It's okay.

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,166
Anyway, Chen Changning's books

365
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,666
are all about astrophysics

366
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,500
and black holes.

367
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,416
Since we're here, let's take a look.

368
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,083
You look through these first.

369
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,291
If you find any useful related research,

370
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,125
let me know.

371
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,333
What are you doing in my room?

372
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,208
Nian Nian.

373
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,375
She came over to hang out.

374
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:03,958
Why are you back?

375
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,083
What does that have to do with being in my room?

376
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,166
I asked Chen Jing'an to show me around.

377
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:13,666
This is

378
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,375
the top student's room at No. 2 High School.

379
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,291
Who wouldn't want to take a look, right?

380
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,791
Now that I've seen it,

381
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,541
it's not much different.

382
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,125
Let's go.

383
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:47,958
My parents

384
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,166
We're back

385
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,541
Mom, Dad

386
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,250
This is my classmate, Zhu Niannian

387
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,583
She came over to hang out

388
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:01,666
Niannian

389
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,875
Hello, Niannian

390
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,916
Hello, Uncle, hello, Auntie

391
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,166
This is the first time An'an

392
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,291
has brought a female classmate home

393
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,125
Isn't it?

394
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,583
Stay for dinner

395
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,666
Where's your brother?

396
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,333
He's in his room

397
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:15,833
Okay

398
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,208
You two go play

399
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,625
We'll go make dinner

400
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,208
Mom, Dad, let me help you

401
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,041
No need

402
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,666
Niannian

403
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:30,875
is visiting our home for the first time

404
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:31,958
Go on

405
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,041
Keep her company

406
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,625
Go be with your classmate

407
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,125
Okay

408
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:40,416
You know

409
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,333
Don't you think

410
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,333
An'an seems a bit off today?

411
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,666
You noticed too

412
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,333
I feel like today, this kid

413
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,208
is deliberately

414
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,291
trying to please us in front of her classmate

415
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:52,708
Right?

416
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,125
How about this one?

417
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,458
This one's too salty

418
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,750
I'll improve next time

419
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Use less salt

420
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,583
I'm allergic to chives.

421
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,208
Nian Nian, why aren't you eating?

422
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,583
I just remembered I'm allergic to chives.

423
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,083
I'm allergic to chive dumplings.

424
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,166
Then why aren't you eating either?

425
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,791
Don't you love chive dumplings the most?

426
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,333
It's okay, Mom.

427
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,375
Today,

428
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,250
I just don't have much of an appetite.

429
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
No appetite?

430
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:56,916
Is your stomach hurting?

431
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,875
I'll go get you some stomach medicine.

432
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,041
No need, Dad.

433
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,625
Let me take a look.

434
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,208
Stick out your tongue, let me see.

435
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:08,625
Say "ah," come on.

436
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,458
I'm a doctor.

437
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:10,833
Stick out your tongue, let me see.

438
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:12,333
Hurry up.

439
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,791
There's nothing wrong with you.

440
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,041
Maybe you just ate too fast.

441
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,625
Eat slower, do you hear me?

442
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,333
Nian Nian

443
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,000
Don't think it's strange.

444
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:34,958
That's how we doctors are.

445
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,916
That's just how he is.

446
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:36,625
Before,

447
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,083
at our hospital,

448
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,916
there was an intern studying traditional Chinese medicine.

449
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,041
He didn't have much of an appetite.

450
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,291
So he wanted to

451
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,916
use acupuncture to treat himself.

452
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:45,541
But in the end,

453
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:46,666
guess what happened?

454
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,916
He turned himself

455
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,500
into a little hedgehog with all the needles.

456
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,375
What a lame joke.

457
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:54,166
Here.

458
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:54,833
An An.

459
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,916
You don't want to eat the chive dumplings?

460
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,125
Do you want some fish?

461
00:22:59,041 --> 00:22:59,708
Have some fish.

462
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:00,916
Eat some fish.

463
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:01,458
Fish is nutritious.

464
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:02,333
Eat some fish.

465
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,416
Let me get you a piece.

466
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,291
Here.

467
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,041
Thank you, Mom.

468
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,291
Eat up.

469
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:08,416
It seems like

470
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,791
they prefer Zhu Nian Nian as their daughter.

471
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:20,791
Kids,

472
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,083
come have some fruit.

473
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,250
Here, Nian Nian.

474
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:24,500
Have some fruit.

475
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,333
Ningning

476
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:31,416
Anan

477
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,625
I have something to tell you.

478
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,125
Before,

479
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,458
your dad and I were too busy at the hospital.

480
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,541
We didn't have time to come home and take care of you.

481
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,083
But we want to wait until this busy period is over,

482
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,916
and then try to stagger our shifts.

483
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:44,833
This way,

484
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,041
at least one of us can be at home to look after you.

485
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:47,875
Is that okay?

486
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:48,875
Okay.

487
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,000
Anan

488
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:51,416
Are you happy?

489
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:56,375
I'm happy.

490
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,583
You still hesitate even when you're happy.

491
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,416
Auntie, I'm leaving now.

492
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,625
My dad is here to pick me up.

493
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:07,958
So soon?

494
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,041
Well then,

495
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,875
Anan

496
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,125
See your classmate out.

497
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:12,958
By the way,

498
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,916
why is there a book in this cupboard?

499
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,250
Ningning, is this yours?

500
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:17,500
What book?

501
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:19,416
Yes.

502
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,291
But this book

503
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,666
was always in my room before.

504
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:24,958
I...

505
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,708
I'll walk Nian Nian downstairs first.

506
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,208
Goodbye, uncle and auntie.

507
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,041
Goodbye, Nian Nian.

508
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,208
Bye, Nian Nian.

509
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,375
Come over and play when you have time.

510
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,750
You don't need to walk me out, you can go back.

511
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:47,625
Nian Nian

512
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,458
Today at your classmate's house

513
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,250
Did you have fun?

514
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:54,708
Yes, I had fun.

515
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:57,250
Nian Nian

516
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:58,750
Be honest with Dad

517
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,416
Is there something on your mind?

518
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:02,333
No, there isn't.

519
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:03,666
Really?

520
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:05,833
But why do I feel

521
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:07,916
like you're not happy?

522
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:14,583
I'm really happy.

523
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:16,708
I have such a great dad

524
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:17,958
and such a great mom

525
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,291
Every day

526
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,125
I have endless dresses to wear

527
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:22,666
and so much delicious food to eat

528
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,416
Plus, Dad picks me up and drops me off at school

529
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,875
I even wake up smiling from my dreams

530
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,250
How could I not be happy?

531
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,791
Why is there a book in this cabinet?

532
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,250
Ning Ning, is this yours?

533
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:57,083
I...

534
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,833
I'll take Nian Nian downstairs first.

535
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,291
Chen Jing'an

536
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,291
What should we do next?

537
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,083
Nian Nian

538
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:14,791
I don't want to switch back anymore.

539
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,416
Chen Jing'an

540
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:37,166
Why did you suddenly say you don't want to switch back?

541
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,166
I just think

542
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,416
there isn't much time left before the exams.

543
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:45,166
I'm thinking

544
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,833
even if we find some useful information,

545
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,791
there won't be enough time to switch back.

546
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,000
With this time,

547
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,125
we might as well do something more meaningful.

548
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:54,958
What you said makes sense.

549
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:57,500
Besides,

550
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,458
the feeling of being the school beauty

551
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,666
I haven't enjoyed it enough yet.

552
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:04,916
Alright then.

553
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:05,875
I'll listen to you.

554
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:07,916
So what should we do next?

555
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,791
Don't ask me, let's think about it some more.

556
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,916
Standing alone in the chilly autumn,

557
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,458
as the Xiang River flows northward,

558
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,291
at the tip of Orange Isle.

559
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,833
Looking out, all the mountains are covered in red.

560
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,375
Dear idol,

561
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,541
please bless me to pass the exam.

562
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:18,083
Today's activity class has been changed to history class.

563
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:25,666
Stand up.

564
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,625
Hello, teacher.

565
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,250
Hello, students.

566
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:36,916
Back when I was in Class One,

567
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,291
English and math would take over the activity class.

568
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:40,875
Now in Class Eight,

569
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,791
even history is taking over.

570
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,083
The joint exams are coming up soon.

571
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,416
Look at your current state.

572
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,041
Do you look like you're ready for an exam?

573
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:49,333
Let me tell you all,

574
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:50,458
this time,

575
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:51,916
it's the joint exam for nine schools.

576
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:53,750
You must pull yourselves together.

577
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,708
Focus in class.

578
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,625
You must achieve the best results.

579
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:57,291
Do you hear me?

580
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,583
Heard you.

581
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:00,958
Louder.

582
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,625
Heard you.

583
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,625
Okay.

584
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,125
Turn your book to

585
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:08,000
page fifteen.

586
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,250
Thank you.

587
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,041
You're welcome.

588
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:14,500
Nian Nian.

589
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:15,791
I think this time,

590
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,458
Liu Xinyi is determined to compete with you.

591
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,875
You have to beat her.

592
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,208
Sit down.

593
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,541
Nian Nian.

594
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,208
Let's go sit over there.

595
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,625
You eat first.

596
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,291
We need to talk about something.

597
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,541
Nian Nian.

598
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:35,250
Go ahead and eat.

599
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:56,000
I've been thinking all morning.

600
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,666
Since we can't

601
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,791
switch back so quickly,

602
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,458
let's hurry and catch up

603
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,875
on the subjects we're not good at.

604
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,333
Let's just get through the exams first.

605
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,791
There's nothing wrong with your idea.

606
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,083
But there are only a few days left before the joint exams.

607
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:10,416
In such a short time,

608
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:12,083
it's impossible for us to catch up.

609
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:14,458
You're a science student.

610
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,291
Your logical thinking is strong.

611
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,250
It's not hard for you to do well in liberal arts.

612
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:19,000
You just need to

613
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,958
memorize the key points for liberal arts.

614
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,458
You'll be fine for the exams.

615
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:23,583
Although

616
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,541
you might not make the top ten in the grade,

617
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,083
but

618
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:28,083
at least you won't do too badly.

619
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,708
Do you really think science students are that amazing?

620
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:38,166
What about the key points in liberal arts?

621
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,208
You think I can just memorize them instantly?

622
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,500
I'm not a photocopier, you know.

623
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:44,375
The joint exam,

624
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:45,833
all have a set range of topics.

625
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,916
You just need to memorize the important points within that range.

626
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,125
That's enough.

627
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:50,833
I believe you can do it.

628
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,250
I'm really not being modest.

629
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,875
The key points in liberal arts are really hard to memorize.

630
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:02,500
Well then,

631
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:03,750
I'll give it a try.

632
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,250
But for me,

633
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:09,625
physics and chemistry

634
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:11,208
are like a foreign language.

635
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,208
In a short time,

636
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:14,750
it's just impossible.

637
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:16,375
Um,

638
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:17,916
don't get discouraged yet.

639
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:19,750
Actually, science subjects

640
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,541
have their own techniques.

641
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,833
Once you get the basics, they're actually easy to learn.

642
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:32,625
How about this:

643
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,041
We can complement each other.

644
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,125
You teach me how to approach liberal arts questions,

645
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,666
and I'll teach you science problem-solving techniques.

646
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,250
Isn't that a perfect match?

647
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,416
So,

648
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,375
what if I don't do well on the test?

649
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:48,125
Will Chen Changning be mad at me?

650
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:48,708
It's fine.

651
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,208
It's just my parents who might have an issue.

652
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,041
Don't worry, just do your best.

653
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:55,625
Don't mind them.

654
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:56,333
Okay.

655
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,083
Let's eat.

656
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,416
Niannian

657
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,208
What were you just talking about?

658
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,375
You didn't even invite me.

659
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,625
Nothing much.

660
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,583
If there's nothing else, I'll head out first.

661
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:11,416
Alright.

662
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:12,625
Oh, right.

663
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,083
Bring the practice test after school.

664
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:14,875
Let's meet at the milk tea shop.

665
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,041
Niannian

666
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,208
Are you and Chen Jing'an

667
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,250
going to study together after school?

668
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,166
Yeah.

669
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:27,000
Don't worry too much.

670
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:28,833
I can review with you.

671
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,375
Tomorrow is Saturday.

672
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,958
Let's go to the library together.

673
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:36,416
You can go by yourself.

674
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,458
I have something to do tomorrow.

675
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:43,791
What's wrong?

676
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:45,833
Nothing.

677
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:57,958
You go ahead.

678
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:59,541
I'm going to the milk tea shop to study.

679
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:01,708
To the milk tea shop to study?

680
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:03,208
Are you sure?

681
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,208
You're not just using studying as an excuse

682
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:04,750
to go out and have fun, are you?

683
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:07,625
I'm really going there to study.

684
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,583
The joint exams are just a few days away.

685
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,125
Are you going by yourself?

686
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,458
I'm going with Zhu Niannian.

687
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,416
I'll head over first, then.
