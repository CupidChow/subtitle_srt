00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,790
I was wrong to stop you from joining

4
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,450
the physics competition.

5
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,900
I heard the school has decided

6
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,760
to let Zhang Fenglai from Grade 12 win

7
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,760
to increase the direct admission quota.

8
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,910
I know.

9
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,540
You do?

10
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,290
Yeah, when you were talking to Deng Hui,

11
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,130
I overheard it.

12
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,240
Then why still participate?

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,910
I want to prove myself

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,240
and show the judges

15
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,050
that I'm better than the one they chose.

16
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,130
Alright.

17
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,210
Then you should go.

18
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,240
I'll surely win.

19
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,910
Why are you smiling like an idiot?

20
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,870
Possessed by Tian Ye?

21
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,130
Nothing.

The skewers at your family's farm stay
are delicious.

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,220
Of course.

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,830
I mix the seasoning myself.

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,620
How do you know
my family sells skewers?

63
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,580
I heard it from someone.

64
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,060
Never mind.

65
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,890
I'll come next time to eat skewers.

66
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,850
Sure.

67
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,050
I'll give you a 20% discount.

68
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:23,890
Alright.

69
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,750
You have to come.

70
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,010
Okay, I'll definitely come.

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,850

75
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,050
Anything on my face?

76
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,010
Your smile is creeping me out.

77
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm happy when I see you.

78
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,350
Why?

79
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,350
I'm just happy when I see you.

80
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,390
Good morning, Liu Xinyi.

81
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,400
I'm well prepared

82
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,820
for the speech contest today.

83
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,980
I won't lose to you.

84
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,260
Perfect, I also think I can beat you.

85
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,610
We'll see after the contest.

86
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Don't talk big yet.

87
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,510
Look at her.

88
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,980
Niannian.

89
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,100
Why try to get close to her?

90
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,220
She's actually quite nice.

91
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,970
We're classmates after all.

92
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,470
Don't be at odds anymore.

93
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,930
Alright.

94
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,050
(Nancheng No. 2 High School)

95
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,310
Niannian.

96
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,760
Minqiu.

97
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,760
Niannian, you still remember me?

98
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,640
Of course.

99
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,100
Are you here to repeat the year?

100
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,680
Yes, I am.

101
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,050
We can go to and from school together.

102
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,050
But my dad drives me.

103
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,430
Good luck.

104
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,990
You'll definitely get into university.

105
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,980
Bye.

106
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,710
What do you want to eat today?

107
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,980
The usual.

108
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,490
How's studying going lately?

109
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,720
Li Minqiu.

110
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,600
Chen Jing'an.

111
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,470
I'm telling you.

112
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,150
I'll be studying here in a few days.

113
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,510
We can compete again.

114
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
I'll crush you.

115
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,220
That's great.

116
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,100
You can crush me
as many times as you want.

117
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,220
Why do you keep hugging people?

118
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,220
I'm not hugging him.

119
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,600
I was just saying hi.

120
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,470
Is that how you say hi?

121
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,300
Why do you care about how I say hi?

122
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,850
Look how dirty this place is.

123
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,640
Yeah, we haven't cleaned in ages.

124
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,720
Dad, Mom.

125
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,640
Why are you back?

126
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,800
Changning, Jing'an.

127
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,680
Is school over?

128
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,200
Your mom and I have applied
to change our posts.

129
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,720
From now on, we won't be so busy

130
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,300
and can come back often to be with you.

131
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:27,720
Changning,

132
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,220
the college entrance exam is coming.

133
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,320
You need lots of nutrition.

134
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,900
We can't keep buying takeout.

135
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,220
Jing'an, you're still growing.

136
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,640
We used to be busy,

137
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,620
but from now on,
we'll have lots of time.

138
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,560
Tonight,

139
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,970
let's go to a restaurant.

140
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,810
What do you want?

141
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,640
Well...

142
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,140
I want the new buffet

143
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,720
that just opened in front.

144
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,200
Okay.

145
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,570
I heard that place is pretty good.

146
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,720
Let's go there then.

147
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,680
I'll go change.

148
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,640
Hurry up and let's go.

149
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,100
- Hurry.
- Hurry up.

150
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,600
I want to change too.

151
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,970
I want to wear the prettiest clothes.

152
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,690
I think wearing the school uniform

153
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,770
is too tacky now.

154
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,720
Chen Jing'an.

155
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,140
You can get 50% off
in the school uniform.

156
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,300
But I also want to wear

157
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,100
something prettier.

158
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,640
You've grown up.

159
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,890
You want to look pretty, huh?

160
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,850
Go ahead.

161
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,720
I can afford the full price anyway,

162
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,600
right?

163
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,100
I'll take you
to buy pretty clothes later,

164
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,970
okay?

165
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,980
Let's go.

166
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,100
Dad, Mom.

167
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,800
I want to tell you something.

168
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,140
Go ahead.

169
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,010
(Turning off)

170
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,600
Is something wrong?

171
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,390
Yeah, what's up?

172
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,230
You're so serious.

173
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,140
I want to talk to you

174
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,970
about my college entrance.

175
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,390
Haven't we talked

176
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,600
about this before?

177
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,350
Niannian,

178
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,850
do you have

179
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,970
a clear idea?

180
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,250
I want to apply to a university
in Beijing.

181
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,220
Beijing is too far.

182
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,390
We both hope

183
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,680
you can

184
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,300
stay by our side.

185
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,220
Besides, you've never

186
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,010
left us before.

187
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,220
If you go to Beijing,

188
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,600
we won't feel at ease.

189
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,910
By the way, tell me:

190
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,260
Why do you want to go to Beijing?

191
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,890
We have key universities
in the province.

192
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,720
If it's just

193
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,850
for pursuing freedom,

194
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,720
I don't think it's necessary.

195
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,350
I want to apply

196
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,640
to the Communication University
of China.

197
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,220
After graduation,
I want to be a reporter

198
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,890
or work

199
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,220
in a news-related field.

200
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,600
Have you thought it through?

201
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,390
Have you made your decision?

202
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,760
We are still worried

203
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,470
about you going to Beijing

204
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,600
and concerned about

205
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,050
whether you can take care

206
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,760
of yourself,

207
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,970
but if you have

208
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,970
made up your mind,

209
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,930
I guess

210
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,470
we have no reason

211
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,390
to oppose you.

212
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,890
Yes.

213
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,300
So,

214
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,600
you agree?

215
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,230
Niannian,

216
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,850
I used to think

217
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,470
you were still young,

218
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,260
but now, I've realized

219
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,220
you have grown up.

220
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,970
Go then.

221
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,220
We support you.

222
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,260
Thank you, Mom.

223
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,480
Thank you, Dad.

224
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,470
See? Niannian is just like me.

225
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,970
Listen, if I hadn't had you back then,

226
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,390
I might be a famous reporter

227
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,970
on TV now.

228
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:18,970
It was because of you.

229
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,140
Niannian is like you in every way.

230
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,150
- Yes.
- She even shares your reporter dream.

231
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,060
Niannian,

232
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,470
that's a good goal.

233
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,600
You have

234
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,560

Here's the stuff I confiscated
over the past three years.

240
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,970
I returned your phones

241
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,050
and valuables yesterday.

243
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,060
is all here.

244
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,260
I can't tell the owners.

245
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,390
Everyone,

246
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,820
come and get your things.

247
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
You don't want it?

248
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,140
Then I'll take it back.

249
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,220
Thanks, Director.

250
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,090

- Thanks, Director.

251

from a strange experience.

291
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,050
Before that,

292
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,350
I had a very long dream.

293
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,970
That dream was

294
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,220
especially beautiful to me.

295
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:34,930
In the dream,

296
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,760
everything changed.

I admit

I know about it.

living with you

00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,970

and well-mannered.

326
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,930
To be honest,

327
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,720
I was a little unaccustomed.

328

During the time you were my sister,

329
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,890

333
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,010
also gave Chen Jing'an a chance to grow.

I've learned to protect

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,850
Don't be scared. I can be your friend.

385
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:42,390
A pinky promise is valid for 100 years.

386
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,620
(Children's Welfare Home)
I took her to my parents.

387
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,970
Her palm was sweaty

388
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,620
- and cold.
- Dad, Mom.

389
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,710
I want her to be my sister.

390
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,820
But she held me tightly.

391
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,800
Very tightly.

392
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,050
That small strength

393
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,760
made me feel important.

394
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,850
I believe you'd understand.

395
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,720
You'd get it.

396
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,890
That sense of existence is hard

397
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,100
to find and confirm in this world.

398
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:06,850
My sense of existence

399
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,550
came from Chen Jing'an.

400
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,970
At the moment she gave me candy,

401
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,260
I felt a feeling I'd never had before.

402
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,180
So,

403
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,220
Zhu Niannian,

404
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,720
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,220
All we can be are friends.

406
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,670
I hope you can make further progress

407
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,510
in your studies

408
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,510
and soon get into your ideal university.

409
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,480
Lastly,

410
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,510
I really want to thank you.

411
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,970
I know being rejected in confession

412
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,300
is very hard to bear.

413
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,470
It wounds the pride,

414
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,470
but I sincerely hope

415
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,970
you will have a brighter life.

Of course, Li Minqiu.

He's now

431

Don't worry. Order more if you need.

433
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,640
It's on me today.

434
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,760
Thanks a lot.

435
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,050
Niannian,

436
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,300
you've got tanned.

437
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
Eat more.

438
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,370
Those years I was in West Africa

439
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,550
as a war correspondent,

440
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,890
I got completely tanned.

441
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,220
I guess it won't fade

442
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,060
anytime soon.

443
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,350
It's dangerous over there, right?

444
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,050
Sometimes, our place was

445
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,050
just one street away from the war zone.

446
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,850
We could hear bullets while sleeping.

447
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,760
Our country is the best.

448
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,470
I really admire you.

449
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,970
You're so brave.

450
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,100
Hey, hey, hey.

451
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,850
Why isn't anyone praising me?

452
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,850
I visited Niannian

453
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,050
every month and cooked her

454
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,220
the most authentic Chinese food.

455
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,140
You're really persistent.

456
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,300
We're the same.

457
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,470
Stop arguing.

458
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,350
Are you going to see
the teachers tomorrow?

459
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,970
Speaking of the devil...

460
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,470
Hello, Hui.

461
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,470
We're all here.

462
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,850
Hui, what are you doing?

463
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,400
You're having a gathering?

464
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,190
Yeah.

465
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,250
Zhu Niannian and Li Minqiu

466
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,500
just came back a few days ago,

467
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,410
so we're catching up.

468
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,470
You brats.

469
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,800
Why haven't you come to see me?

470
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,050
We'll go tomorrow.

471
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,270
Mr. Deng,

472
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,390
is that Ms. Yu next to you?

473
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,100
Looks like Ms. Yu.

474
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,600
Hello.

475
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,510
Long time no see.

476
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,850
Ms. Yu.

477
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,220
Why are you in Hui's office?

478
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,720
I...

479
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,470
I'm here to see Ms. Fan.

480
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,720
Right, she's here for Ms. Fan.

481
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,850
Then

482
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,890
where's Ms. Fan Ge?

483
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,480
Ms. Fan...

484
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,050
Well...

485
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,260
She's not here right now.

486
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,850
Yeah, you just missed her.

487
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,300
Okay, talk to you later.

488
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,280
Time to prepare lessons.

489
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,510
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

490
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,390
Bye-bye.

491
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,230
I think

492
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,960
we should go back to school right away

493
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,600
and catch Mr. Deng off guard.

494
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,010
I agree.

495
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Seconded.

496
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,510
- Seconded too.
- Seconded too.

497
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,850
Enough.

498
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,950
The food's getting cold.

499
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,930
Let's eat.

500
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,850
Wait, wait.

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,720
