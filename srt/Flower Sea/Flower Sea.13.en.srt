=Flower Sea=

2
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,660
There are wish trees,

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,620
=Episode 13=
and we can fish by the river.

4
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,450
When I was a kid, my dad
often bring me here.

5
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,330
Your dad's so good to you.

6
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,240
My dad often gave me pocket money,

7
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,040
but my mom
would take it away every time.

8
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,170
You should be grateful

9
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,450
that you have a mother.

10
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Why are you talking about parents?

11
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,620
Aren't we going fishing?

12
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,990
When will we get started?

13
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,830
In a minute.

14
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,370
Come with me.

15
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,740
I want to talk to you.

16
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,370
You guys, go ahead.

17
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,910
We'll be there in a minute.

18
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,330
What do you want to say?

19
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,580
Actually,

20
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,450
Minqiu was talking

21
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,000
about himself.

22
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,310
He didn't know
Chen Jing'an's background.

23
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,420
But,

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,080
I think Chen Jing'an

25
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,760
got a bit upset.

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,160
Talking about himself?

27
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,370
I shouldn't say much about his stories,

28
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,490
but I still want to explain it.

29
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,910
He didn't mean it.

30
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,920
It's okay.

31
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,130
I got it.

32
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,740
Besides, Chen Jing'an
won't hold a grudge.

33
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,870
Your mom told me

34
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,170
you didn't like

35
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,450
places like this, right?

36
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,200
You're here for Chen Jing'an,
aren't you?

37
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,330
Yes.

38
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,450
I've been investigating

39
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,490
the reason for your soul exchange.

40
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,740
Spending time with you

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,540
can help me get more details.

42
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,240
And according to some articles,

43
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,540
soul exchange is likely

44
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,540
to damage the body.

45
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,450
The chance is rare,

46
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,620
but you should be careful.

47
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,330
You're so good to Chen Jing'an.

48
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,170
Let's go,

49
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,910
or we'll be left behind.

50
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,040
What's going on?

51
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,740
Stop doing this. Let's go fishing.

52
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,700
Just ignore these two idiots.

53
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,620
What's the point?

54
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,290
They're back.

55
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,870
What were you doing?

56
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,880
Nothing.

57
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,290
Let's go.

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,370
She's mine.

59
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,250
Let's go

60
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,330
fishing.

61
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,330
This way.

62
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,410
Why did you take me here?

63
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,740
I noticed you were a bit upset.

64
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,660
The view is nice.

65
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,540
You can enjoy it.

66
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,370
How did you know?

67
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,790
Did you just peek at me?

68
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,290
I...

69
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,120
Listen,

70
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,200
this won't work.

71
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,950
You're so bad at
pretending to be friendly.

72
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,160
It's not like that.

73
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,450
I really want to make you happy.

74
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,990
Why are you being so good to me?

75
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,410
You'll find out.

76
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,290
Keep it to yourself.

77
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,830
I don't want to know anyway.

78
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,080
But I'm warning you.

79
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,290
We're too young to date someone.

80
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,700
Don't even think about it.

81
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,160
You're overthinking it.

82
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,750
Better be.

83
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,790
There's a wish tree.

84
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,240
Do you want to make a wish?

85
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,450
No way.

86
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,490
Why are you so childish?

87
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,790
Let's go.

88
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,970
(Machine-made Charcoal)

89
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,170
Still trying to light it?

90
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,460
Give it to me.

91
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,950
Can you do that?

92
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,430
Of course.

93
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,290
Are you sure?

94
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,370
Help Chen Jing'an
with the garlic skewers.

95
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,490
I'll help Niannian.

96
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,160
Why don't you deal with the garlic?

97
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,540
You're her bro.

98
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,700
I'm her childhood sweetheart.

99
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,620
You don't stand a chance.

100
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,790
Just go!

101
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,750
- Wait...
- Just go!

102
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,790
Niannian, let me help you.

103
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,670
Go on.

104
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,160
What's going on?

105
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,210
They can't start a fire.

106
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,130
I'll check on them.

107
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,330
What's the point?
You can't do it anyway.

108
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,500
I'm going with him.

109
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,120
How can you light it up
with so much charcoal?

110
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,620
That's how it works.

111
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,630
Where's the lighter?

112
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,680
Over there.

113
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,800
Hey,

114
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,450
why are you blowing on my charcoal?

115
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,080
You said you knew how to

116
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,920
start a fire,

117
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,410
and I actually believed you.

118
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,040
Wash your face.

119
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,130
None of your business.

120
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,580
Come on, I'll take you there.

121
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,690
Let's go.

122
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,260
(Jiande Aviation Town)

123
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,790
Chen Changning is so sly.

124
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
He even called for backup.

125
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,410
You can't imagine.

126
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,040
Niannian, you must stay away from him.

127
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,290
Don't let him corrupt you.

128
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,330
Don't worry.

129
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,490
I know myself.

130
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,540
By the way,

131
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,290
I have a big plan.

132
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,170
What is it?

133
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,870
Set Tian Ye up with Chen Jing'an.

134
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,420
Do they like each other?

135
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,330
I think they do,

136
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,830
but Tian Ye

137
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,740
won't admit it.

138
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,490
I've decided to give him a push.

139
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,910
Then what's your plan?

140
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,740
Tian Ye is scared of ghosts.

141
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,830
We'll try to freak him out,

142
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,790
and he'll ask

143
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,490
Chen Jing'an to protect him.

144
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,330
Then...

145
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,080
It won't work.

146
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,660
Chen Jing'an will think
Tian Ye is too timid

147
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,740
and look down on him.

148
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,290
Do you have an idea?

149
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,700
Didn't you say
you wanted to go to the bathroom?

150
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,410
Why are we here?

151
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,420
Actually,

152
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,620
someone wants to see you.

153
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,920
See me?

154
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,370
Just wait here.

155
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,700
There'll be a surprise.

156
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,960
Don't move.

157
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,120
Is everything ready?

158
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,210
He's coming.

159
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,380
Here.

160
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,040
So small?

161
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,120
Why are you here?

162
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,410
Go for it! Be together!

163
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,870
Go for it! Be together!

164
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,120
Go for it! Be together!

165
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
Go for it! Be together!

166
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,200
What the hell?

167
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,580
Where's Li Minqiu?

168
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,910
Li Minqiu?

169
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,660
He asked me to come here.

170
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,580
Did Chen Jing'an bring you here?

171
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,910
Chen Jing'an

172
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,160
said she wanted to surprise me.

173
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,040
Don't tell me

174
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,040
you're the surprise.

175
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,700
It's more of a prank.

176
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,660
They must be

177
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,660
hiding around here somewhere.

178
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,620
Stop hiding.

179
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,290
You two are too big

180
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
to hide yourselves.

181
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,660
If you used your brain for your studies,

182
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,160
you wouldn't rank at the bottom.

183
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,750
Tian Ye,

184
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,040
we think you both need

185
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,040
a little push.

186
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,290
We're doing you a favor.

187
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,620
You must've got this wrong.

188
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,250
It was just a prank.

189
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,330
Well, enjoy yourselves.

190
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,410
I need to go.

191
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,870
Is she shy

192
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,790
or actually angry?

193
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,830
How would I know?

194
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,700
Catch up and check on her.

195
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,910
It's dangerous for a girl to be

196
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,330
out alone at night. Hurry!

197
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,080
Tian Ye!

198
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,540
Don't you want to pursue her?

199
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,120
I shouldn't have helped you!

200
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,740
Chen Jing'an.

201
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,120
Stop trying to play matchmaker.

202
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,290
I have no feelings for her.

203
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,450
You're still denying it.

204
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,790
Do you think I can't tell?

205
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,040
I've known all along.

206
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,450
What do you know?

207
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,200
I don't even know.

208
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,870
Still pretending!

209
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,830
Chen Jing'an,

210
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,740
instead of suspecting me, you should

211
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,870
pay more attention to Chen Changning.

212
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,490
Don't you think

213
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,290
he's been so good to you lately?

214
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,490
Don't forget

215
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,580
he sees you

216
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
as Zhu Niannian.

217
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,240
Did he ever come here?

218
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,830

My dad will pick me up.

248
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,080
Niannian, we'll go the same way.

249
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,450
How about we go together?

250
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,050

You guys go ahead.

261
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,370
I want to talk to Niannian.

262
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,580
What do you want to say?

263
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,000
Niannian,

264
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,450
do you remember

265
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,160
how you always liked to

266
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,120
act as my girlfriend when we were kids?

267
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,750
Yes.

268
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,990
I saw you as my brother,

269
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,580
so I acted as your girlfriend.

270
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,540
Niannian,

271
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,870
but you're more than
just a sister to me...

272
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,500
I know. We're good friends.

273
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,120
Just go. My dad is coming.

274
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,960
Just go!

275
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,630
(Oh my god.)

276
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,330
(He was confessing his feelings.)

277
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,330
(Why do I have to go through this?)

278
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,450
How time flies.

279
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,950
When we have the chance,

280
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,740
we'll go out again.

281
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,540
Maybe after the Gaokao.

282
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,290
Did you have fun?

283
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,670
Yes, I did.

284
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,490
Good then.

285
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,750
Niannian.

286
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,580
No one else is here.

287
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,700
You don't have to pretend.

288
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,210
It's exhausting.

289
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,210
What are you doing?

290
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,380
Stealing something?

291
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,410
Shut up.

292
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,490
Cover for me. Hurry!

293
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,700
If you see Li Minqiu,

294
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,120
tell me right away.

295
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,670
Niannian!

296
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,130
Are you looking for me?

297
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,490
When did you come?

298
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,240
Niannian, is your backpack heavy?
I can help you.

299
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,170
Oh, no!

300
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,050
No need!

301
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,920
Please don't!

302
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,870
Why are you running?

303
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,330
I'm going to catch you.

304
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,240
Why running so fast?

305
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,580
You're going to the same class.

306
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,540
How ridiculous.

307
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,170
Niannian,

308
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,540
are you not feeling well?

309
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,740
Just tell me.

310
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,170
Niannian,

311
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,080
are you having your period?

312
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,660
You should have some hot water.

313
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,670
Niannian,

314
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,370
are you mad at me?

315
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,410
Maybe I said something wrong.

316
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,410
I'll apologize to you.

317
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,740
You can yell at me,

318
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,950
but don't ignore me.

319
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,330
I really care about you.

320
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,830
Could you please say yes?

321
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,490
I want to protect you

322
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,290
like I did when we were kids.

323
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,290
What

324
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,700
is love?

325
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,290
It only makes one stupid.

326
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,080
Niannian.

327
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,200
We didn't go to the beach
or get sunburnt.

328
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,290
Why do I feel your skin looks darker?

329
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,330
It was dark in the first place.

330
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,490
Didn't you know?

331
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,420
Well, I'm smart

332
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,380
and agile.

333
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,790
You just got lucky.

334
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,370
The autumn tour

335
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,540
only lasted two days.

336
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,120
I haven't had enough fun.

337
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,620
We should spend more time.

338
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,990
I didn't even row a boat.

339
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,130
Yes.

340
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,000
Next time,

341
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,540
if we go fishing,

342
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,330
we can get a fishing net.

343
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,910
When we pull the net,
there'll be plenty of fish.

344
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,490
Then we'll

345
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,580
build a grill

346
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,870
with some branches

347
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,290
and grill the fish like on TV shows.

348
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,370
The fish will be burnt so quickly.

349
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,240
I'm not going to grill fish with you.

350
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,540
Come on.

351
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,550
Li Minqiu will do all the work.

352
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,540
It'll be delicious.

353
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,250
Shasha.

354
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,460
You're here.

355
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,350
(Supermarket Entrance)

356
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,740
Wait, why are there three packs of tissues
with one box of yogurt?

357
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,740
I don't know.
It was like this when I got it.

358
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,080
You fetched them on purpose,
didn't you?

359
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,790
You should put them back.

360
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,790
Just two packs of tissues?

361
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,290
Do you think we stole them?

362
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,250
- Mom...
- Be quiet.

363
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,580
I didn't say that.

364
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,200
One pack of yogurt,
one pack of tissues for free.

365
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,620
But there are three packs.

366
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,040
I have a reason to suspect you.

367
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,660
What do you mean?

368
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,740
Where's your manager?

369
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,170
What are you talking about?

370
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,740
Why are you yelling at me?

371
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,740
If you feel wronged,

372
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,740
let's check the surveillance

373
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,160
and see what really happened.

374
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,080
What?

375
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,160
Deng Shasha.

376
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,040
Is this your mom?

377
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,540
Why is she arguing with the clerk?

378
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,960
Shasha.

379
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Is she your classmate?

380
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,990
Girl, listen,

381
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,410
don't buy anything here.

382
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,790
They're so stingy!

383
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Watch your attitude!

384
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
I'll file a complaint!

385
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
What's the big deal?

386
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,370
I'm not buying them!

387
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,490
Don't drag me. Get off me!

388
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,700
We did make a mistake.

389
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,450
Hurry. It's so embarrassing!

390
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,700
Embarrassing?

391
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,080
I told you to put them in your pocket,

392
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,660
but you didn't listen to me.

393
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,580
I'm embarrassing? Then find another mom!

394
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,290
Mom!

395
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,830
My classmate saw what happened.

396
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,410
She loves gossiping.

397
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,740
How am I supposed to face them?

398
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,620
Can you stop trying to get freebies?

399
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,950
Do you think I'm embarrassing?

400
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,330
Why am I always thrifty?

401
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,540
I'm doing this for our family!

402
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,880
They say

403
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,450
a child is never
ashamed of their family.

404
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,290
You're so ungrateful

405
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,490
just like your useless dad!

406
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
You're always saying this.

407
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,870
But you've saved money for Deng Peng

408
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,620
so that he can buy an apartment!

409
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,240
You've always been stingy with me!

410
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,330
How could you blame me?

411
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,620
Stealing is wrong!

412
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,200
My years of sacrifice meant nothing!

413
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,200
If I had known this,

414
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,950
I shouldn't have had you!

415
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,240
Then why did you have me?

416
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,490
I've ended up like this
all because of you.

417
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,830
You taught me

418
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,620
to flatter those rich people

419
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,330
and get freebies.

420
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,660
What kind of mother are you?

421
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,660
You're ashamed of me, right?

422
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,490
Then don't call me Mom!

423
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,790
Shasha!

424
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,290
Why are you here?

425
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,080
Where are you going?

426
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,490
It's late at night.

427
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,740
What if you get kidnapped

428
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,950
and sold to the mountains?

429
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,210
So what?

430
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,080
Life goes on wherever you are.

431
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,580
What are you doing here at this hour?

432
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,450
Your mom told us what happened.

433
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,410
We've been looking for you.

434
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,950
Now you've found me.

435
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,160
Mission accomplished.

436
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,290
You can go.

437
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,450
We've been looking for you.

438
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,580
At least let us take a break.

439
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,710
Here.

440
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,210
Sit down.

441
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,200
Shasha,

442
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,370
I know how deeply this has hurt you.

443
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,950
But didn't we tell you the other day?

444
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,330
Whenever you feel upset,

445
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,450
you can talk to us.

446
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,330
No matter what,
we're still best friends.

447
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,160
I'm fine.

448
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,370
Shasha, stop acting strong.

449
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,290
You said it was fine,

450
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,950
but you've been alone all day.

451
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,950
You didn't come to us.

452
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,990
So, you're still angry.

453
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,250
However, that's

454
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,540
how misunderstandings work.

455
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,950
The more you care,

456
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,330
the more badly you get hurt.

457
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,200
We care about each other,

458
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,540
so

459
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,700
why don't we forget about our grudges,

460
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,540
get to know each other,

461
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,950
and become friends again, okay?

462
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,790
Shasha.

463
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,950
Just give me another chance.

464
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,580
We'll start over, okay?

465
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,540
I promise,

466
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,500
I won't

467
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,080
suspect you again.

468
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,430
I'll be

469
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,620
at your service, okay?

470
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,830
Shasha,

471
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,370
could you please forgive me?

472
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,450
Can we go back to the old days?

473
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,700
I've told you I'm not angry at you.

474
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,410
I'm just

475
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,120
angry at my mom.

476
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,950
She thinks your families

477
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,040
are richer

478
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,370
than mine.

479
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,750
She thinks

480
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,700
you'll be useful to me.

481
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,490
So, she told me to flatter you

482
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,990
and get close to you.

483
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,700
However, I really want

484
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,240
to be your true friend.

485
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,040
But when I think about what she said,

486
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,490
I realize I'm doing exactly

487
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,990
what she told me to do.

488
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,410
It's not true.

489
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,910
Niannian, I made friends with you

490
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,700
not because of your family.

491
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,250
I know.

492
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,910
I know what kind of person you are.

493
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,240
So, I argued with her this time.

494
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,990
Why is my mother like this?

495
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,170
Shasha,

496
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,200
maybe your mom did make some mistakes,

497
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,330
but she still loves you.

498
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,790
She just expressed it in the wrong way.

499
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,790
You can try to understand her.

500
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,710
She even

501
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,040
wanted to steal a pack of tissues.

502
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,080
Everyone was watching us.

503
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,580
It was so embarrassing!

504
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,160
How should I understand her?

505
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,540
Do I have to become

506
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,910
someone like her?

507
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,330
Shasha,

508
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,950
have you ever thought about

509
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,120
why she'd do that?

510
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,950
She wants to save money

511
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,200
for more important things.

512
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,370
She's been saving money

513
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,660
so that you can afford

514
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,450
clothes and food,

515
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,790
and Deng Peng
can have money to get married.

516
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,160
She's not doing this for me.

517
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,120
I'm a girl, so she never

518
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,540
really cares about me.

519
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,200
To be honest,

520
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,540
your family does prefer boys.

521
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,700
My mom also has a bad temper.

522
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,740
She's always dressed up properly,

523
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,910
but when she gets angry,

524
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,990
she's completely different.

525
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,290
It's terrifying.

526
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,080
Every parent

527
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,790
loves their children.

528
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,380
How about this?

529
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,990
Stay at my place tonight.

530
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,950
You can go home
when your mom cools down.

531
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,830
Perhaps at my place.

532
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,450
We can talk a lot.

533
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,330
Besides, my parents are not at home.

534
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,740
You'll be more at ease.

535
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,700
Her parents went out,

536
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,910
but Chen Changning is at home.

537
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,910
It's so awkward.

538
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,950
You should go to my place.

539
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,330
Go to my place.

540
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,080
My bed is big.

541
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,040
My bed is also big.

542
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
My place.

543
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,880
My place!

544
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,790
My bed is bigger!

545
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,790
My bed is bigger!

546
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,180
Shasha,

547
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,870
you haven't been
this happy for a long time.

548
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,240
Come on, let's take a selfie.

549
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,080
Okay.

550
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,290
Niannian, promise me

551
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,660
you won't

552
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,830
hide anything from me.
We must trust each other.

553
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,370
I promise.

554
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,490
I promise I'll trust you.

555
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,950
We'll be best friends forever!
