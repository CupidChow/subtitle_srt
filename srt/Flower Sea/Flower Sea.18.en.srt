3
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,430
Are you okay?

4
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,220
Of course I'm okay.

5
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,180
Why are you here?

6
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,890
The post on Tieba...

7
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,310
I'm worried about you.

8
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,390
Worried about me?

9
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,140
You should be worried

10
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,350
about your sister, not me.

11
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,730
Chen Jing'an.

12
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,100
I know about

13
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,010
your soul exchange.

14
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,480
Chen Jing'an.

15
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,300
When did you find out?

16
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,050
When you changed subjects.

17
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,350
Did Niannian tell you?

18
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,730
No.

19
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,550
I figured it out myself.

20
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,430
And then?

21
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,970
You just pretended you didn't know

22
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,390
and saw me fake it

23
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,890
like a clown, right?

24
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,300
It's not like that.

25
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,350
Then why didn't you tell me?

26
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,600
Do you think it's funny?

27
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,010
Are you happy

28
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,720
that you've finally got rid of me?

29
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,220
Or

30
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,640
would you rather have

31
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,220
a sister like Zhu Niannian?

32
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,810
Chen Jing'an.

33
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,220
Is that

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,720
what you think of me?

35
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,260
What else could it be?

36
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,560
You've played dumb,

37
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,640
teased me,

38
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,760
and lied to me for so long.

39
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,640
Should I

40
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,720
praise you?

41
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Should I say you're smart?

42
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,350
Should I say

43
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,230
you're so smart

44
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,470
that you found out about

45
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,720
our soul exchange so quickly?

46
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,640
I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

47
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,050
But this is a big deal,

48
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,220
and you didn't tell me either.

49
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,600
You even told Tian Ye, not me.

50
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,010
Am I really not trustworthy?

51
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,350
I didn't tell you,

52
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,470
but you never planned to ask me, right?

53
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,140
If you really cared about me,

54
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,970
you should've come to me
and asked me right away.

55
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,720
Chen Jing'an, can you be
reasonable for once?

56
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,720
You hid it from me first.

57
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,140
I learned it from you.

58
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,720
Chen Jing'an, stop talking nonsense!

59
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm not.

60
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,970
Why do you always think the worst of me?

61
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,890
You knew

62
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,010
your sister was Zhu Niannian,

63
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,970
not me.

64
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,970
Why were you so nice to her?

65
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,470
You even gave her a pen.

66
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,720
You're kind to everyone

67
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,970
except me.

68
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,520
Didn't you say

69
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,890
felt-tip pens were better?

70
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,510
How could you blame me?

71
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,890
You care about her.

72
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,220
You're kind to her.

73
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,600
You definitely like her.

74
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,970
You're telling me the truth

75
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,800
because you know

76
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,560
Zhu Niannian

77
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,060
is Cheng Jing'an,

78
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,640
the person
who's being mocked by everyone.

79
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,970
You were worried about her,

80
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,010
so you came to me.

Don't you know
whom I'm worried about?

84
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,470
I was afraid you'd be upset,

85
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,350
so I came here right away
after seeing the comments.

86
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,140
I've been thinking about

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,510
how to solve this

88
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,510
and comfort you.

89
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,640
I don't need you to comfort me.

Chen Changning,

91
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,510
you don't know what I really care about.

I don't need your help.

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,470
I'd rather

94
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,890
be mocked by everyone

95
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,970

and Chen Changning

107

aren't alike at all.

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,100
It turns out they're not siblings.

I really feel sorry for Chen Jing'an.

111
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,220
She was so arrogant

112
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,800
probably because she felt inferior.

113
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,390
Chen Jing'an, are you okay?

00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,970
Jing'an, Jing'an!

00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,640
Let's hurry to the hospital!

116
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,510
My mom is in a coma after surgery!

117
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,640
What?

118
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,640
Niannian, you're so early.

119
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,970
Check on your mom.

120
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:12,850
She just woke up.

121
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,260
You should just stay here.

122
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,300
- But...
- But what?

123
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Her mom just woke up

124
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,640
and wanted to talk to her family.

125
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,100
You shouldn't interrupt them.

126
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,150
Let's go to my office

127
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,010
and have some snacks.

128
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,690
No need, Mom.

129
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,260
I want to wait here.

130
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,480
Jing'an,

131
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,300
you seem so worried about
Niannian's mother.

132
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,180
Really?

133
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
She's my friend,

134
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,720
so I care about her family.

135
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,850
Niannian also cares about you.

136
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,230
Really?

137
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,470
It's good to have a friend like her.

138
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,230
Niannian.

139
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,800
Why are you crying?

140
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,310
I'm not.

141
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,220
Stop crying.

142
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,300
I'm not crying.

143
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,060
Stop lying.

144
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,350
You don't have to act strong
in front of me.

145
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,720
Don't cry, okay?

146
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,560
I'm just feeling bad.

147
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,150
Why, Niannian?

148
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,920
I feel sad.

149
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,600
Niannian, don't cry.

150
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,470
My good girl.

151
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,510
You've grown up.

152
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,010
You need to be strong.

153
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
I'm

154
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,160
totally fine.

155
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,800
It's no big deal.

156
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,800
No big deal?

157
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,970
Of course.

158
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,390
Just a mild disease.

159
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,600
It caught me a bit surprised,

160
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,550
but I'll be fine.

161
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,720
When I leave here

162
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,530
and go home,

163
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,510
you'll still be our little princess.

164
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,550
Niannian.

165
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,890
Just be happy and go to school.

166
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,970
I'm totally fine.

167
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,310
Chen Jing'an.

168
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,820
Why are you crying?

169
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,470
I'm not.

170
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,140
I heard about the post.

171
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,510
They just have nothing to do

172
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,550
and like to gossip.

173
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,050
The more you care,

174
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,390
the happier they are.

175
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,390
Don't worry.

176
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
When we go to school,

177
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,870
if anyone talks nonsense,

178
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,890
we'll beat them!

179
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,260
It's not because of that.

180
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,300
We're friends. Don't act so strong.

181
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,800
We'll definitely have your back.

182
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,350
You're here.

183
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,100
Why didn't you come in?

184
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,180
Come on.

185
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,510
Come in.

186
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,220
Hurry. Come on in.

187
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:44,930
Here.

188
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,220
Why are you all here?

189
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,300
Mrs. Zhu,

190
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,040
we were having a self-study class

191
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,220
and had nothing to do,

192
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,060
so we came here.

193
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,550
Thank you.

194
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,680
Mrs. Zhu,

195
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,470
does it hurt?

196
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,390
No.

197
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,890
I'm fine.

198
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,730
Mrs. Zhu,

199
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,720
you've had the surgery,

200
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,970
so you can have chicken soup, right?

201
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,220
I'll bring it here next time.

202
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,470
Minqiu, no need.

203
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,850
She needs to have some plain food.

204
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,890
Okay.

205
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,890
By the way,

206
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,180
your mom

207
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,850
came this morning.

208
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,600
Really?

209
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,390
I haven't

210
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,220
seen her for many years.

211
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,220
Oh,

212
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,730
why did she

213
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,800
look so pale?

214
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,760
Your mom is a good person.

215
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,600
She's always kind.

216
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,220
We were neighbors for years,

217
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,720
and I never saw her lose her temper.

218
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,810
By the way,

219
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,260
your mom

220
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,890
told me something.

221
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,640
A mother and her son

222
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,550
don't hold grudges forever.

223
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,550
If there's a misunderstanding,

224
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,850
just resolve it in time,

225
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,300
and you'll be fine.

226
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,600
Got it, Mrs. Zhu.

227
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,010
Few children

228
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,550
understand their parents.

229
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,140
But actually,

230
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,970
they just need to communicate.

231
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,390
A while ago,

232
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Niannian and I

233
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,850
had the same problem.

234
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,050
We argued about

235
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,050
the speech competition

236
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,470
and changing subjects.

237
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,470
But now we're good.

238
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,510
Niannian

239
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,100
has grown up.

240
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,390
She's a good girl.

241
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,220
And I'm

242
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,510
happy now.

243
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,480
Right?

244
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,060
Okay, Huiru.

245
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,510
You need to rest well.

246
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,470
Don't talk too much.

247
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,050
Look, they're scared.

248
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,890
That's right.

249
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,720
I did talk a lot.

250
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,600
I seldom get sick, and now

251
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,720
I've finally realized something,

252
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,760
but you want to stop me.

253
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Look at you.

254
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,970
Mrs. Zhu,

255
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,760
you're the best mother in the world.

256
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,180
Every parent

257
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,050
is the best.

258
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,970
Chen Jing'an.

259
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,180
I'm going to sleep.

260
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,510
How did it go?

261
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,470
She's a bit angry.

262
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,260
How's your mom?

263
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,930
I heard...

264
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,300
She's fine.

265
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
It wasn't that serious.

266
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,350
The surgery went well.

267
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,480
What's wrong?

268
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,310
Well...

269
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,140
When I saw
the needle marks on her hand,

270
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,510
I felt I was such a bad daughter.

271
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,970
I can't share her pain.

272
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,890
I just...

273
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,220
I can't even call her Mom.

274
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,640
I know you're sad.

275
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,430
Sorry.

276
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,350
I can't help much right now.

277
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,550
But please trust me.

278
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,970
I'll help you switch back.

279
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,220
Thanks.

280
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,470
Stop crying.

281
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,850

I'll talk to her after she cools down.

297
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,310
Minqiu.

298
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,390
Why are you here?

299
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,430
I...

300
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,890
I just want to see you.

301
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:03,890
Now you've seen me.

302
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,100
You can go.

303
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,810
Wait a minute.

304
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,970
I know

305
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,220
you've been angry at me,

306
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,600
and you can't accept me.

307
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,980
But it's fine.

308
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,350
One day, you'll grow up

309
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,140
and have a child.

310
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Then you'll know

311
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,300
every parent

312
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,850
misses their child.

313
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,140
When I was away,

314
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,720
I missed you so much

315
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,300
every single day.

316
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,230
Back then,

317
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
I was poor

318
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,850
and didn't want you to suffer.

319
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,050
But I've earned some money

320
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,850
doing business overseas.

321
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,480
I want

322
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,060
to make it up to you.

323
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,260
Actually, when I was a kid,
I hated you both

324
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
because you left me alone,

325
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,800
and Dad remarried
and moved to another city.

326
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,600
But now I've grown up

327
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,510
and realized
you were having a hard time.

328
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,850
I forgave you a long time ago.

329
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,350
But I didn't know how to tell you.

330
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,050
Now I'm doing fine with my grandparents,

331
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,970
living a decent life.

332
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,970
I feel happy right now.

333
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,010
And I hope you can be happy.

334
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,050
Don't be trapped by guilt.

335
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,220
Take it.

336
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,350
Give me your phone.

337
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,550
I'll give you my new number.

338
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,970
If you want to see me,

339
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,890
call me in advance.

340
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,760
Don't just wait here alone.

341
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,100
What if I'm not coming back?

342
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,450
Okay, okay.

343
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,600
Minqiu, stop crying.

344
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,720
Just go home.

345
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,970
Be safe.

346
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,600
Mom.

347
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,280
Let's take the back path

348
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,350
to the classroom.

349
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,640
There are fewer people.

350
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,260
I don't want to go back.

351
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,850
My classmates

352
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,550
must be gossiping about me.

353
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,300
I've told them

354
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,640
not to spread the rumors,

355
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,390
and they all agreed.

356
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,970
If anyone brings it up

357
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,010
again,

358
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,720
the whole class will be angry.

359
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,140
Okay.

360
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,430
We'll

361
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,390
stay here for now.

362
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,970
We weren't born on the same day,

363
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,550
but we'll face this together today.

364
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,100
If we get closer

365
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,720
and are caught by Director Jiang,

366
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,550
we'll be famous for dating

367
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,850
in high school.

368
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,220
Shut up.

369
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,140
Who's dating you?

370
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,850
Can you just help me become famous?

371
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,050
If Director Jiang sees us,

372
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,470
everyone will know it by tomorrow.

373
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,800
I've even come up with a title.

374
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,890
Zhu Niannian, the campus belle,

375
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,010
has loved Tian Ye for two years

376
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,350
and finally got him.

377
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,510
And there'll be a selfie

378
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,970
that we took during the autumn tour.

379
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,720
Perfect.

380
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,460
But I've heard

381
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,100
Director Jiang is quite sly.

382
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,300
To spy on students' private lives,

383
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,470
he specifically created an account

384
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
on the school forum.

385
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,390
And he even picked

386
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,220
this 90s-nostalgia

387
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,100
username.

388
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,430
Take a guess.

389
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,100
What is it?

390
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,060
Love

391
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,980
Buried

392
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,970
with

393
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,850
My

394
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,810
Soul.

395
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,800
How ridiculous!

396
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,140
Who hated Director Jiang so much

397
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,220
that they spread this kind of rumor.

398
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,810
You finally laughed.

399
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,850
Rumors

400
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,850
will never end.

401
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,970
The new ones

402
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,640
will soon replace the old ones.

403
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,970
Besides,

404
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
after graduation,

405
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
no one will remember this.

406
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
I just

407
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,470
don't want people to pity me.

408
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,100
It's like I'm so miserable.

409
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,830
If I say

410
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,470
I knew this all along,

411
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,300
will you call me a genius?

412
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,470
What do you mean?

413
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,720
I knew this a long time ago.

414
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,220
8th grade.

415
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,060
For real?

416
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,550
By ancient standards,

417
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,260
our families

418
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,120
would be counted as

419
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,350
sworn kinship.

420
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,550
Your grandma and my grandma

421
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,010
used to be

422
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,010
the pillars

423
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,640
of the square dance group.

424
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,530
They often chatted together,
and I heard it

425
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,600
from your grandma.

426
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,640
Tian Ye, you traitor!

427
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,350
How could you hide it

428
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,470
from me for three years?

429
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,220
Because I never thought

430
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,220
it would be a problem,

431
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,060
okay?

432
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,180
Did I

433
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,640
ever change

434
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,520
my attitude

435
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,890
towards you

436
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,050
after knowing the truth?

437
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,890
Who am I to pity you?

438
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:44,730
After all,

439
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,800
you're the one who's always bullying me.

440
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,260
Do you really think

441
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,980
adoption

442
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,640
is not a big deal?

443
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,970
Of course.

444
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,890
So, don't feel upset.

445
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,600
They're just bored

446
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,260
with nothing better to do.

447
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,220
Locked in school every day,

448
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
they'd just turn

449
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,010
every tiny gossip

450
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,760
into mass chaos.

451
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,970
You're adopted.

452
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,180
So what?

453
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,140
Let's go back to class.

454
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,390
If we hear anyone talk about this,

455
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,700
just tell them,

456
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,650
"Are you that bored?"

457
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,660
Let's go!

458
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,510
Let's go!

459
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,600
Weren't you so excited when gossiping?

460
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,890
Now what?

461
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,280
Are you mute?

462
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,640
She's an adoptive daughter.

463
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,230
It's breaking news.

464
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,550
Why did you stop making up stories?

465
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,580
Xinyi,

466
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,080
stop scolding me, okay?

467
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,460
I just

468
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,050
love to gossip and talk nonsense.

469
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,470
I'd never do something

470
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,510
as shameless as

471
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,600
posting that.

472
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,180
We...

473
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,350
We just saw the post

474
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,260
and gossiped about it.

475
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,430
Gossip?

476
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,890
You gossiped about other people's pain.

477
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,370
Why do you care so much about

478
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,970
whether she's adopted or not?

479
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,140
Xinyi,

480
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,920
we're really sorry.

481
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,110
One more time, and our

482
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:05,970
tongues will ulcerate.

483
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,970
Just this once.

484
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,390
Liu Xinyi,

485
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,600
thank you.

486
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,640
Don't get me wrong.

487
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,390
I'm not helping you.

488
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,720
I just

489
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,600
don't want to be like them.

490
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,180
I want to leave a good impression

491
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,300
on Chen Changning.

492
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,600
Listen,

493
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,390
although you're adopted,

494
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,600
you're not different from others.

495
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,180
I won't back down.

496
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,470
You

497
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,470
outperformed me

498
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,640
in the hosting election.

499
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,930
But

500
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,180
I'll definitely win next time.

501
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,310
Understand?

502
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,180
I won't back down either.

503
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,970
Didn't you say you'd move on?

504
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,050
Why are you so scared?

505
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,300
Shut up.

506
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,530
First, read the special requirements

507
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,090
and understand the meaning of
the union and intersection of two sets.

508
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,390
So, you got this question wrong,

509
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,260
okay?

510
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,600
Okay.

511
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,470
Right?

512
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,350
Now you get it?

513
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,970
Don't be scared.

514
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,140
You're Zhu Niannian.

515
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,510
