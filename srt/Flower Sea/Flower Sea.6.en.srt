1
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:13,833
You go ahead.

2
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,416
I'm going to study at the milk tea shop.

3
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,583
Study at the milk tea shop?

4
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,083
Are you sure?

5
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,083
You're not just using studying as an excuse

6
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:20,625
to go out and have fun?

7
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm really going there to study.

8
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,458
The joint exams are in just a few days.

9
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,000
Are you going by yourself?

10
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,333
I'm going with Zhu Niannian.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,291
I'll head over first.

12
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,208
We need to start with this formula.

13
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,583
Then, just like before,

14
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:53,916
Did you understand?

15
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,875
I think I understood.

16
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:58,333
But then again,

17
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,166
I also feel like I still don't get it.

18
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,208
So are you

19
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,916
understanding or not?

20
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,791
I understand this formula by itself.

21
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,000
But I don't know

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,625
why we have to use this formula.

23
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,375
I think we could use another one too.

24
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,457
This one is a distractor.

25
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,541
You need to learn to tell them apart.

26
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:15,791
It's okay.

27
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,500
I'll show you a few more similar problems.

28
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,457
You'll get it, look.

29
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:18,875
Like this one,

30
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,250
it's just like the first one we did.

31
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,207
Hello.

32
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,332
Hi.

33
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:32,750
I

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,541
need some desserts and coffee.

35
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,041
Why did he come here?

36
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,666
I only told him I was studying at the milk tea shop.

37
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:55,750
I'm heading out first.

38
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,000
You're leaving?

39
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

40
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,916
We've already finished studying.

41
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:02,166
I just ordered some more milk tea and desserts.

42
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:03,166
Let's study a bit longer.

43
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,250
It's rare for Chen Jing'an to be able to sit down and study today.

44
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,416
Me?

45
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:13,000
I won't bother you two siblings.

46
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,332
I have something to do later.

47
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:15,625
I won't stay long.

48
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,332
Where did you get to in your writing?

49
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:33,000
Chen Jing'an.

50
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,625
I don't know how to solve this math problem.

51
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,375
Can you explain it to me?

52
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,207
Okay, okay.

53
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,582
This one is...

54
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,082
Which problem is so hard?

55
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:44,832
Let me take a look too.

56
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:47,000
I...

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,375
I...

58
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:50,332
I suddenly need to use the bathroom.

59
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,041
Let's go.

60
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,041
Nian Nian, let's go together.

61
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:52,541
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,707
Okay, okay, let's go.

63
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,541
Hurry up and explain the solution to me.

64
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:06,625
Otherwise,

65
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,875
when I start talking later,

66
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,957
I'll give myself away in front of Chen Changning.

67
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,582
Why are you so nervous?

68
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,458
No, it's not that.

69
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:18,083
You said at the beginning

70
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,000
not to let Chen Changning know

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,625
about us switching places, right?

72
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,458
Don't worry.

73
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,165
I just drank too much milk tea.

74
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:25,875
I'll go to the bathroom first.

75
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:26,750
I'll explain it to you when I get back.

76
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,125
Come.

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,250
Year after year.

78
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,625
Let's continue going over the problems.

79
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:34,708
As for the first question,

80
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,500
it's really simple.

81
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:38,165
You just need to

82
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,250
take the numbers given in the problem

83
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,790
and plug them in.

84
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,625
I think you're amazing.

85
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,458
After you explained it, everything became clear.

86
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,708
I'm heading home now.

87
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,040
That scared me to death.

88
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:12,833
Tianye.

89
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,375
Are you still having dinner?

90
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:15,333
Yes, yes, yes, right away.

91
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,665
Just let me finish this game.

92
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,625
All you do is play games every day.

93
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,333
Are games really that fun?

94
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,375
Don't you have anything else to do?

95
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:23,165
Why not ask Jing'an to watch a movie instead?

96
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,083
Mom.

97
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,750
Chen Jing'an has been busy studying lately.

98
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,250
The entrance exams are coming up soon.

99
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,290
Tianye.

100
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,833
It would've been better if you hadn't reminded me.

101
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,833
With your terrible grades,

102
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,915
you still have the nerve to talk about the entrance exams?

103
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,540
You're killing your own son.

104
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,500
Killing me, killing me, Dad.

105
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,125
I'll study, I'll study, I'll study—I'll study right after dinner.

106
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:51,125
All you do is play games.

107
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,458
You're back.

108
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,666
I remember you mentioned the physics competition before.

109
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,791
You said you weren't going to participate in the physics competition.

110
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,250
Let me confirm with you.

111
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,125
Have you made up your mind?

112
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:14,333
Yes.

113
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,291
I've made my decision.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,041
I'm not participating.

115
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,208
Got it.

116
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,041
Okay.

117
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,541
Now I feel

118
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,208
that relying on tutoring to get through exams

119
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,750
just doesn't work at all.

120
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,208
Actually,

121
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,541
I was thinking about it last night too.

122
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,125
Is there any other way?

123
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,958
Great minds think alike.

124
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,125
So, what ideas do you have?

125
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,958
I've thought of a way.

126
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,083
But it might not be very good.

127
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,708
Just hear me out.

128
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:58,916
Hurry, tell me!

129
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,000
It's when I get my period

130
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,291
my stomach really hurts.

131
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,791
Sometimes I can't even get up from the floor.

132
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,208
That's rough.

133
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,916
I don't think I've ever felt pain like that.

134
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,833
Now you can experience it for yourself.

135
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,083
But

136
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,541
what does your period have to do with

137
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,125
the solution you mentioned?

138
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,041
Last time, I couldn't finish my exam because of period pain.

139
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,750
I didn't even finish the test.

140
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,250
I did the math,

141
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,125
my period should come just a few days before the exam.

142
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,875
If you eat more cold stuff then,

143
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,583
maybe your period will come early.

144
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,916
If it happens during the exam,

145
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,041
you can use

146
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:38,958
this as an excuse.

147
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,125
My mom would probably believe it.

148
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,583
Nice one, Nian Nian.

149
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,125
That's creative.

150
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,083
I think it'll work.

151
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,375
But it really does hurt a lot.

152
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,125
I get bumps and bruises all the time playing basketball.

153
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,208
I'm pretty tough.

154
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,291
A little period pain

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,416
is nothing to me.

156
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:58,541
But

157
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,333
I also thought of a way.

158
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:01,833
But it's a bit risky.

159
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:02,958
Do you want to try it?

160
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,375
What way?

161
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,958
Let me tell you a secret.

162
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,125
Brother Hui

163
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,791
is the person making the physics exam for this joint test.

164
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,875
But I heard

165
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,875
that the team making the questions this time

166
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,541
has made questions for the college entrance exam before.

167
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,791
You really don't know much, do you?

168
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:20,916
Brother Hui

169
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,250
is a top-level physics teacher in the province.

170
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,208
He made questions for the college entrance exam ten years ago.

171
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:26,833
That's impressive.

172
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,041
It's not about whether he's impressive or not.

173
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,750
I'm telling you this

174
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,083
because I guess

175
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,541
the exam questions this time

176
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,708
have probably already been made by him.

177
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:41,916
You

178
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,250
You want me to

179
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,666
steal the test papers

180
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,583
This

181
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,083
How is that stealing?

182
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,000
We're just taking a look in advance

183
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,166
But

184
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,583
I think this

185
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,833
isn't really right

186
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,791
Desperate times call for desperate measures

187
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,250
Do you want to wait until the physics grades come out

188
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,083
and you do terribly

189
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:00,750
and then have someone

190
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,750
find out our secret?

191
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,416
But I'm scared

192
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,458
If you

193
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,500
don't feel comfortable

194
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,708
you can ask Tian Ye to come along

195
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:11,791
to keep watch for you

196
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,375
He's got the most experience with this kind of thing

197
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,125
Before

198
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,375
Didn't Hui always subscribe to

199
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,541
the Science Fiction World magazine?

200
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,583
Tian Ye and I used to borrow it all the time

201
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:25,916
Borrow

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,833
For book lovers, it's always called borrowing

203
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,416
You know?

204
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,041
Eat something

205
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,250
Let me see

206
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,625
No, no.

207
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,208
Chen Jing'an.

208
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,166
Do you have something you want to say to me?

209
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,500
Go ahead, I'm listening.

210
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,250
The entrance exams are coming up soon.

211
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,875
Isn't it a bit inappropriate to be reading comics now?

212
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,750
Chen Jing'an, you actually care about my grades?

213
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,583
But cramming at the last minute doesn't help.

214
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,375
I still can't pass no matter what.

215
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,708
Might as well just enjoy reading comics.

216
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,166
Just keep reading comics.

217
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,750
And keep having fun.

218
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,750
I have a way to help you pass the physics exam.

219
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,208
What way?

220
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,083
No problem.

221
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,166
Aren't you going to think it over?

222
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,208
If we get caught,

223
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,083
we'll get a demerit.

224
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,750
You've already done so much for my grades.

225
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,208
If I hesitate now, I'd be letting you down.

226
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:14,583
So, we...

227
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,083
When do we take action?

228
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:22,958
Nian Nian

229
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:23,958
Why are you still buying

230
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,291
such cold things now?

231
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,833
If you eat it now,

232
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,416
your period is coming soon.

233
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,666
Your stomach will definitely hurt.

234
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,708
The exams are coming up soon.

235
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,541
It's fine, I'm not afraid.

236
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,500
No, you shouldn't eat it.

237
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,666
Don't worry about me.

238
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,750
I just want to eat it.

239
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,208
What if it affects your exams?

240
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm not afraid.

241
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,958
You'll definitely have a stomachache then.

242
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,583
Give it to me.

243
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,416
Give it to me, give it to me.

244
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,375
The first point about advanced ancient agriculture

245
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,458
is the emergence of agricultural production.

246
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:55,583
The second point

247
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,833
is the tradition of intensive and meticulous farming.

248
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,541
As for advanced ancient agriculture,

249
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,083
it can be divided into several aspects.

250
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,666
One, two, three, four.

251
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,333
Teacher.

252
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,291
I want to go to the restroom.

253
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,541
Okay, go quickly.

254
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,791
It's divided into these four aspects.

255
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,958
The first aspect originated very early.

256
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,541
Reporting in.

257
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,750
Okay, come back.

258
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,291
It required two oxen to pull and three people to operate.

259
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,375
Later, there appeared

260
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,166
Teacher.

261
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,541
I need to go again.

262
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,083
I told you not to eat cold things, but you insisted.

263
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,291
Hot water.

264
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,000
Thank you.

265
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:32,541
I bought you some medicine.

266
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,083
Are you really that kind?

267
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,083
This joint exam,

268
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,833
I'm going to beat you fair and square.

269
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,625
Don't try to pull anything like

270
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,666
"My health isn't good"

271
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,416
or "I didn't do well" again.

272
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,000
Hurry up and take the medicine.

273
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,208
Get better soon.

274
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:47,916
Thanks.

275
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,541
But

276
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,000
I think this time,

277
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,666
you'll definitely get first place.

278
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,083
Don't say things like that to me.

279
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,458
Just do your best on the exam.

280
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:25,708
You

281
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:26,583
go in

282
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,458
I

283
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:28,583
will keep watch

284
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:29,750
It's fine

285
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,541
Hui is still in class with the second group right now

286
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,000
Mr. Yu

287
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:33,958
You startled me.

288
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:34,833
Hello, teacher.

289
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,791
You're a student from Class One, right?

290
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,291
What are you doing here?

291
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:41,750
Um...

292
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,166
Uh...

293
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,416
I have a

294
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:47,833
physics question I can't solve.

295
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,750
I wanted, I wanted

296
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,666
to ask Mr. Deng about it.

297
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,583
But he's not here.

298
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,083
Mr. Deng

299
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,666
should be teaching a class right now, right?

300
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
It's class time now.

301
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,416
Come back after class.

302
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,166
Hurry back to your class.

303
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,333
Mr. Yu

304
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,083
What's wrong this time?

305
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,750
Isn't the humanities office

306
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,708
over there?

307
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,916
I'm getting something for Ms. Fan.

308
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:41,875
Teacher.

309
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,083
You're leaving?

310
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,041
Didn't I tell you to go back to class?

311
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:44,916
Why are you still here?

312
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,416
Yeah.

313
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:48,833
Why am I still here?

314
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,250
Teacher, I'm leaving now.

315
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:31,958
Chen Jing'an

316
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,125
What are you doing here?

317
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,791
Teacher, I...

318
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,666
Did your brother tell you

319
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,666
that I have this outfit?

320
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,541
If you want to wear it,

321
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,791
come find me after class.

322
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,125
We're in the middle of class right now.

323
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,041
This isn't how a good student

324
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,041
should behave.

325
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,166
If I hadn't come back to get something,

326
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:53,708
this would be stealing.

327
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,416
Don't let it happen again.

328
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,208
I'm sorry, teacher.

329
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:58,291
Well then,

330
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,875
if there's nothing else, I'll go now.

331
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,000
Or...

332
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,208
Don't you want to try it on?

333
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,916
Um, it's way too big.

334
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:09,625
I...

335
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,041
I definitely can't wear it.

336
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,250
Goodbye.

337
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,291
Are you sure you don't want to try?

338
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:33,750
Class,

339
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:35,958
the joint exams are coming up soon.

340
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,541
Everyone, stay focused.

341
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,041
I heard from your physics teacher

342
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,916
that your knowledge of electromagnetic waves

343
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,041
is still pretty weak.

344
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,125
Zhang Kaiji

345
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:45,750
Here.

346
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:46,833
In a moment,

347
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,291
take the practice questions

348
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,833
that Teacher Deng prepared for you all

349
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:50,625
and hand them out.

350
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:51,375
After school,

351
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,416
turn them in.

352
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:56,875
This many?

353
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,291
Why is there another test paper?

354
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:07,166
Why is Mr. Lin, a math teacher, handling physics?

355
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,083
We didn't manage to steal the exam papers.

356
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,166
I don't want to just sit here and wait for doom either.

357
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:55,500
So,

358
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,958
let's see how many we can get right by luck.

359
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,291
I have an idea.

360
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:16,708
What idea?

361
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,083
Switch majors.

362
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:25,250
Switch majors?

363
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:25,958
Yeah.

364
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:27,083
You

365
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,000
switch to liberal arts,

366
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,208
and I'll switch to science.

367
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,208
You're already good at liberal arts.

368
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,375
And I'm not bad at science.

369
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,208
As long as we can switch successfully,

370
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,750
this exam won't be a problem.

371
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,375
But I...

372
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,833
No more buts, let's talk at the rockery.

373
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:41,708
Come on, let's go.

374
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,208
This physics exam,

375
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,416
is no problem for me.

376
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,208
My grades will definitely satisfy your mom.

377
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:49,166
Besides,

378
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,291
we're not the only ones who want to switch subjects right now.

379
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,333
It's not just the two of us.

380
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,000
No one will deliberately stop us.

381
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,583
When we

382
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:55,583
switch back later,

383
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,375
at worst, we can just switch again.

384
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,166
I've already thought of what to say.

385
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,416
We'll cry and beg the teacher,

386
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,416
saying the original subject was better.

387
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:03,750
I'm not worried

388
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,625
about what happens after we switch back.

389
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,791
It's just that if you suddenly bring up switching subjects,

390
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,791
my mom definitely won't agree.

391
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,291
If she doesn't agree, I'll just persuade her.

392
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:13,750
Besides,

393
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:14,625
your mom, in the end,

394
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:16,000
is just worried about my grades.

395
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,041
As long as my grades satisfy her,

396
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,583
what's the difference between studying arts or sciences?

397
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,291
But back in my first year,

398
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:22,583
my science grades were really bad.

399
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,416
If you suddenly say you want to switch subjects,

400
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,416
how will you explain

401
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,958
why your science grades have improved so much?

402
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,541
No matter how you explain it,

403
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,416
my mom won't accept it.

404
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,791
Then what should we do?

405
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,541
If you don't switch subjects,

406
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,083
when the joint exam results come out,

407
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:37,416
and she sees I did so badly,

408
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,583
won't she break down?

409
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,708
It would be better to bring up switching subjects early.

410
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:41,791
As long as I do well,

411
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,875
she'll be relieved, right?

412
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,083
Nian Nian,

413
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,375
better a short pain than a long one.

414
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:53,625
As long as you nod your head,

415
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,125
I'll go home and tell your parents right away.

416
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,125
Family.

417
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:01,958
My head hurts so much.

418
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,125
What should I do?

419
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,041
Family.

420
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:14,791
Do you have something

421
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,583
you want to say to Dad?

422
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,291
Dad,

423
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:32,375
I want to change my major.

424
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,625
Change your major?

425
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:37,833
To science.

426
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,416
You're much better at liberal arts than science.

427
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:41,750
Why do you want to change at such a crucial time?

428
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,166
Why do you want to switch majors?

429
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:48,333
I just

430
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,458
suddenly want to study science.

431
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,000
I've suddenly started to like

432
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,041
chemistry,

433
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:53,791
biology,

434
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,791
and physics.

435
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:56,458
I like solving problems.

436
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:57,916
I also like

437
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,625
that each problem has only one answer.

438
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:02,666
Aren't you just being unreasonable?

439
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:04,666
Back in your first year of high school,

440
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,416
how bad were your science grades?

441
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,666
Can you keep up?

442
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,500
Your mom definitely won't agree.

443
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:12,958
So

444
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,583
I'm telling you first.

445
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,375
Let's try to persuade Mom together.

446
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:17,541
Nian Nian,

447
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,250
I don't agree with you changing your major.

448
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,458
And I won't help you persuade your mom.

449
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:23,625
About this matter,

450
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,583
you don't need to bring it up with your mom again.

451
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,333
Dad,

452
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,041
Nian Nian,

453
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,291
don't be so stubborn.

454
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:43,083
Mom

455
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,083
Let me help you wipe that.

456
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,166
It's fine.

457
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,291
Your entrance exams are coming up soon.

458
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,375
Go review your notes quickly.

459
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,375
Don't make trouble here.

460
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,000
Mom

461
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:51,916
Go on, hurry.

462
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:54,458
Niannian

463
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,666
Come help me wash the dishes.

464
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:09,541
Were you just about to talk to your mom

465
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,416
about switching majors?

466
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,041
I want to give it a try.

467
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:15,458
Zhu Niannian,

468
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,333
what did I tell you this afternoon?

469
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:18,958
Your mom definitely won't agree to you switching majors.

470
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,500
So don't make her angry, okay?

471
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,666
But if you don't try,

472
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,333
how do you know she won't agree?

473
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:26,916
Then go ahead and try.

474
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:28,375
See if she agrees.

475
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,750
See if she gets mad.

476
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,333
What are you talking about? Switching majors?

477
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,333
I said I want to switch majors.

478
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:38,333
Mom,

479
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,875
I don't want to study liberal arts anymore.

480
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:42,375
I want to switch to science.

481
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:43,333
Niannian,

482
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,250
are you messing around again?

483
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,875
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

484
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:55,083
I'm not messing around.

485
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,083
I really want to study science.

486
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:58,208
If you don't believe me,

487
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,125
you can give me

488
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,458
a science test to see for yourself.

489
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,333
Your previous math and science grades—

490
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:03,791
don't you know how you did?

491
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,541
If you switch majors, I'm telling you,

492
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:06,791
I do not agree with this.

493
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,416
Let's see which teacher dares to help you switch.

494
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:10,458
Mom—

495
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,375
Don't call me Mom.

496
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,291
I'm telling you,

497
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,291
I don't have a daughter who goes against me every day.

498
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,125
Chen Changning,

499
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:38,791
I want to

500
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,541
discuss something with you.

501
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,416
I want to switch majors.

502
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,708
Switch to liberal arts.

503
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,625
Did Chen Jing'an ask you to switch?

504
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:57,791
What Chen Jing'an?

505
00:29:58,375 --> 00:29:59,666
I am Chen Jing'an.

506
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:12,958
Then let me ask you,

507
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,291
on your sixth birthday,

508
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,083
what did I give you?

509
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:22,333
That was all

510
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,041
when I was a kid.

511
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:26,083
It's been so long.

512
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:28,833
I can't really remember.

513
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:34,500
What about last year?

514
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,375
What did Dad give you?

515
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,375
Last year?

516
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,083
Last year,

517
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,041
he gave me

518
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,000
a phone,

519
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:55,875
shoes,

520
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:00,166
and a pencil case.

521
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,208
Who are you really?

522
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:12,166
You're not Chen Jing'an at all.
