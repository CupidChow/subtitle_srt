=Episode 19=

3
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,540
Don't look so guilty.

4
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,620
You're Zhu Niannian.

5
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,040
Zhu Niannian,

6
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,330
can I see your physics notes?

7
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,080
See?

8
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,920
No one's gossiping.

9
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,020
No one even asked you.

10
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,450
I don't care about this at all.

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,040
Chen Jing'an,

12
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,120
from now on, I'm your brother.

13
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,350
If anyone troubles you,

14
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,720
gossips about you, or bullies you,

15
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,140
ask me for help.

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,350
The guy I beat up last year

17
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,100
is still in the hospital.

18
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,760
If they can't shut their mouths,

19
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,600
don't blame me for kicking them.

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,680
One kick from me

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,260
sends them flying ten meters.

22
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,140
Back at my old school,

23
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,390
they called me "Leg Li".

24
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,800
Was he always this boastful?

25
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,600
He did brag,

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,050
but not this exaggerated.

27
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,720
But don't you think

28
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,600
he looks kinda cool like this?

29
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,320
Niannian, why are you laughing?

30
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
At you...

31
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,300
"One kick, ten meters."

32
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,050
You're really bodyguard material.

33
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,050
Niannian,

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
I was just showing off.

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,390
Did you have to expose me?

36
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,800
Niannian,

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,050
listen,

38
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,930
I was just trying

39
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,600
to scare off the gossipers.

40
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,100
I only see Chen Jing'an as a friend.

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,640
Besides,

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,800
I'm protecting her

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,050
for your sake.

44
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,930
Don't get me wrong.

45
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,180
I didn't.

46
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,430
I support you protecting her.

47
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,550
- Really?
- Of course.

48
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,770
Lately,

49
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,850
she's been feeling down.

50
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,430
Spend more time with her.

51
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,930
Mission accepted.

52
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,010
Zhu Niannian,

53
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,180
come here.

54
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,430
Let's talk.

55
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,100
Where are you going?

56
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,550
Can't you talk here?

57
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,640
No.

58
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,390
I've got nothing to say to him.

59
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,640
Niannian doesn't

60
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,010
want to talk.

61
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,820
I heard from some classmates

62
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,890
that Chen Jing'an is an adopted child.

63
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,470
We've never mentioned this publicly.

64
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,510
There's no need to.

65
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,800
To my parents,

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,800
Jing'an is their real child.

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,180
Who's spreading rumors at school?

68
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,050
Kids these days

69
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,680
are impulsive in their teens.

70
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,100
How's Jing'an?

71
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,680
It hit her hard.

72
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,720
She's always been strong-willed.

73
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,220
Hates being pitied.

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,300
That's why she excels at everything.

75
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
The school can't easily

76
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,350
step in to stop gossip.

77
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,060
Tricky situation.

78
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,470
Jing'an,

79
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,050
thank you

80
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,600
for coming every day.

81
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,180
Not affecting your studies?

82
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,220
Thank you, sir.

83
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,600
It's no trouble.

84
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,680
I hope Ms. Liang recovers soon.

85
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
You...

86
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,680
sound hoarse,

87
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,220
not resting well?

88
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,220
Just need some water.

89
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,850
Jing'an came to see her parents

90
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,220
and dropped by to visit Mom.

91
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,060
Actually,

92
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,890
you don't need to come daily.

93
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,180
Your mom just had her checkup.

94
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
She's fine now.

95
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,100
One more week of observation,

96
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,050
then she can leave.

97
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,050
I'll stay here

98
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,260
a while longer.

99
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,550
Niannian,

100
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,300
stay at Jing'an's place.

101
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,430
Don't cause trouble, understand?

102
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,430
Got it.

103
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,470
Jing'an,

104
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,760
we'll have to trouble

105
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,410
your family.

106
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,970
Ma'am,

107
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,050
it's no trouble.

108
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,050
Later, let Mr. Zhu

109
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,390
take Niannian home first

110
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,470
to grab some things.

111
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,600
Then she'll go to your place, okay?

112
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,050
Mr. Zhu should stay with you.

113
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,600
I'll take Niannian home.

114
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,010
Jing'an,

115
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,550
thank you so much.

116
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,930
Niannian's lucky

117
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,640
to have a friend like you.

118
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,850
I haven't been back in so long.

119
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,310
Niannian,

120
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,220
do you know

121
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,640
you're just like Lin Daiyu now?

122
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Always melancholy.

123
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,390
I just...

124
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,720
Cheer up.

125
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,070
I went through the rumors

126
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,100
and I'm still doing fine.

127
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,350
Once we switch back,

128
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,180
you can hug your mom tight,

129
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,850
then give her a big, smacking kiss

130
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,180
to make up for the one

131
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,720
you missed.

132
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,930
She might get startled.

133
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,180
No, she'd be overjoyed.

134
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,680
Come on,

135
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,970
pick what you want.

136
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,300
Your clothes are all so pretty.

137
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,140
I always thought this notebook was nice.

138
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,180
What's written in it?

139
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,640
Diaries.

140
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,020
You keep a diary?

141
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,790
You're such a romantic.

142
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,430
Why'd you put it back?

143
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,220
I'll open it when I come back.

144
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,140
Where's your dad?

145
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,720
Constipated, bathroom.

146
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,800
Tell him to hurry.

147
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,970
I rarely cook, you know.

148
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,930
If he's late, he gets nothing.

149
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,050
Dad!

150
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,220
Mom says come eat now.

151
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,800
Wait a sec.

152
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,300
Just a minute.

153
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,050
Mom says no food if you don't come.

154
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,550
What's for dinner?

155
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,220
Fish.

156
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,180
Donkey? [*homophone]

157
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,800
I don't eat donkey meat.

158
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,180
Mom, Dad says he won't eat fish.

159
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,640
Let's split his portion.

160
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,680
Suit himself.

161
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,300
He can starve for all I care.

162
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,430
Keep eating.

163
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,510
Good?

164
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,390
Yeah.

165
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,890
You started without me?

166
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,050
Who's in charge here?

167
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,640
Wow, fish.

168
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,970
I thought you hated fish.

169
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,220
You're so capable of change.

170
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,800
He told me it was donkey.

171
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,470
Now you want donkey?

172
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,100
Go eat a mule instead.

173
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,390
Eating or not? If not, I'm clearing it.

174
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,230
Yes, yes!

175
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,230
Here.

176
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,850
Eat.

177
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,220
Know who's boss now?

178
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,070
- You tell me.
- Here.

179
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,220
Give me some meat.

180
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,580
- Meat!
- Gone.

181
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,350
Changning invited you to lunch.

182
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,430
Why'd you skip it?

183
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,350
We're not talking now.

184
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,140
Slow down.

185
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,140
I won't steal yours.

186
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,140
How'd you know I love tofu buns?

187
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Li Minqiu told me.

188
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,550
He said you ate too many at physics camp

189
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,550
that it shocked him.

190
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,010
Looks like

191
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,180
one tofu bun

192
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,050
can solve all problems.

193
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,680
If one doesn't work,

194
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,390
try two.

195
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,720
That's my man.

196
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,300
I studied all night

197
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,300
how celebrities handle scandals.

198
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,050
How do they handle scandals?

199
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,930
When reporters grill them,

200
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,890
don't dodge.

201
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,890
Stand tall in the crowd,

202
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,180
let them talk. Once they're done,

203
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,550
they'll shut up.

204
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,600
Hello, I'm Chen Changning.

205
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,430
I want to

206
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,890
issue an announcement.

207
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
You've all seen the school forum posts.

208
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,890
Lately, there have been rumors

209
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,300
about my sister's background.

210
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,640
As her brother,

211
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,680
I need to set the record straight.

212
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,300
This is my first

213
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,850
and last official statement.

214
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,550
Jing'an is my biological sister.

215
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,550
I know the rumors started

216
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,890
from an anonymous post.

217
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,180
I hope you save yourself the shame

218
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,430
and delete it now.

219
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,800
Otherwise,

220
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,430
you'll face consequences.

221
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,280
To those who believed the rumors,

222
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,550
(Campus Radio)
don't become accomplices.

223
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,720
Remember,

224
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,350
rumors end with the wise.

225
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,310
Chen Changning!

226
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,560
Open the door!

227
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,850
Chen Changning!

228
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,300
Chen Jing'an,

229
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,050
are you listening?

230
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,610
Don't care what others say.

231
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,600
Open the door! Now!

232
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,860
You don't have to prove

233
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,530
- that I'm your brother.
- Chen Changning!

234
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,470
Are you insane?

235
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,430
- No one...
- Stop!

236
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,050
gets to judge us.

237
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,640
If anyone keeps harassing you,

238
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,300
spreading malicious lies,

239
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,050
come find me.

240
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,180
I'll deal with it.

241
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,640
I've been shielding you

242
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,050
since we were kids.

243
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,390
I've only been scolded twice in my life.

244
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,050
First time, when you sneaked spicy sticks

245
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,300
and told Mom I made you eat them.

246
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Second time, when you saved grocery change

247
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,800
to buy instant noodles

248
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,220
for collectible cards.

249
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,470
Speaking of groceries,

250
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,680
my first cooked meal

251
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,560
was for you.

252
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,680
You were crying, saying you were starving.

253
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,680
Back then,

254
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,050

336
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,840
when rumors spread at school,

337
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,260

349
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,730

356
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,250

358
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,090
why are you still playing bodyguard

359
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,800
by her side?

360
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,890
Someone's addicted to being a bodyguard.

361
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,470
Maybe a revolutionary friendship

362
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,760
has blossomed.

363
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,220

364
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,220

366
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,230
Right?

367
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,300
Actually, I'm just worried

368
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,720
there might still be troublemakers.

369
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,800

a few more days,

370

371
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,470

372
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,100

373
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,260
Why is he so...

374
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,970
clingy?

375
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,100
Li Minqiu doesn't know

376
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,640

377
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,140

378
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,350
That's weird.

379
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,720

380
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800

381
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,970

382
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,850

383
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,220

384
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,470
you're the real Zhu Niannian,

385
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,850
he'd probably

386
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,470
be overjoyed.

387
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,390
Or maybe disappointed.

388
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,890
True.

389
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,660
If he knew you've been living

390
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,390
with Chen Changning all this time,

391
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,470
he'd probably freak out.

392
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,390
So keeping it from him is good.

393
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,470
Alright,

394
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,390
let's preview the next lesson.

395
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,760
Your mom's condition is stable now.

396
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,850
You can focus on studying now.

397
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,760
I'll catch up
on what I missed these days.

398
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,230
That's great.

399
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,310
Go for it!

400
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,870
Don't smoke near the school.

401
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,220
Don't give them a bad impression.

402
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,970
Minqiu,

403
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,720
you've turned over a new leaf

404
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,850
in just a month?

405
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,140
What do you mean by that?

406
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,100
This is a total transformation.

407
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,220
Minqiu is a student now.

408
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,050
Can't look like a street boy at all.

409
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,300
He's gonna take the college exam.

410
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,640
But I'm worried now.

411
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,640
What's wrong?

412
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,930
Tell us about it.

413
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,390
You know, right?

414
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,600
I repeated my senior year for Niannian.

415
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,480
We know.

416
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,140
You played house as kids

417
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,310
and you were a pair.

418
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,600
But now,

419
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,720
I feel so guilty toward her.

420
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,300
I came here for her,

421
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,510
but at some point,

422
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,510
whenever I see Chen Jing'an,

423
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,480
my heart just...

424
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,010
starts pounding.

425
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,470
What's pounding mean?

426
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,550
You idiot,

427
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,350
it's obviously a crush.

428
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,970
Minqiu,

429
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,720
do you like Chen Jing'an now?

430
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,720
I'm such a scumbag.

431
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:21,470
It's understandable.

432
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,550
Yeah, pretty scummy.
It's understandable.

433
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,390
It's understandable.

434
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,230
But...
It's understandable.

435
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,260
It's understandable.

436
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,970
Minqiu, what's your plan?

437
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,140
I think you

438
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,510
want both, huh?

439
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,560
He's a real scumbag.

440
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,650
Don't let it happen again.

441
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,470
Don't be so impulsive.

442
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,560
Got it, sir.

443
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,300
Go home. School is over.

444
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,730
Okay.

445
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,810
Thanks, sir.

446
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,050
I won't disturb your rest.

447
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,350
I've got things to do.

448
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,050
Ms. Yu, thank you

449
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,550
for visiting me at the hospital.

450
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,640
Zhu, see Ms. Yu out.

451
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,710
Sure.

452
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,470
No need, I can go myself.

453
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,800
You need him here.

454
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,390
Ms. Yu, you're too kind,

455
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,660
bringing such a big fruit basket.

456
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,500
It's nothing.

457
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,980
You're here.

458
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,760
Ms. Yu, why are you here?

459
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,510
I came to see Niannian's mom.

460
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,100
Be more obedient,

461
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,050
stop upsetting your mom, okay?

462
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,720
I'll head out now.

463
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,970
Bye, Ms. Yu.

464
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:30,850
See you.

465
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,010
Why the rush?

466
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,220
Come, sit and rest a bit.

467
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,470
We got delayed because of homework.

468
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,470
Ran here in a hurry.

469
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,600
How are you feeling today?

470
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,220
Much better.

471
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,220
Your dad just helped me

472
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,300
walk around a little.

473
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
That's great.

474
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,430
Hey, Jing'an,

475
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,260
sorry to trouble you every time,

476
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,550
accompany Niannian.

477
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,060
No trouble at all.

478
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,260
I'm relieved to see you're okay.

479
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,020
Have you two eaten yet?

480
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,030
Not yet.

481
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,870
We'll grab something

482
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,140
on our way back home.

483
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,470
That won't do.

484
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,470
Zhu, hurry up and take the kids

485
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,050
somewhere nice to eat.

486
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,630
And

487
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,890
drop them home afterward.

488
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,850
Alright.

489
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,720
No need.

490
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,800
Mr. Zhu should stay and take care of you.

491
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,510
I'm fine, really.

492
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,100
Besides, you two have been running

493
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,350
between school and the hospital.

494
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,720
You must be exhausted.

495
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,050
Oh, actually,

496
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,970
your dad can bring me

497
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,890
something tasty later, right?

498
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,930
Right, Niannian?

499
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,100
Right?

500
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,510
Jing'an, don't stand on ceremony.

501
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,360
Is your brother at the hospital?

502
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,300
Call him to join us.

503
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,730
Yeah.

504
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,510
Your parents are busy,

505
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,300
so I'll treat you siblings to dinner.

506
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,100
Thank you

507
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,390
for taking care of Niannian.

508
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,550
After all, we're friends.

509
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:04,930
Let's go.

510
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,060
That's all.

511
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,980
Thank you.

512
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,550
Today we have a special offer,

513
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
every table gets a free fruit platter.

514
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,720
Any preferences?

515
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,680
No pineapple.

516
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,300
Anything but pineapple.

517
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,180
Thank you.

518
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,230
We'll be right back.

519
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,050
I'll go to the restroom.

520
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,010
Changning, you're in senior year, right?

521
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,970
Yes, sir.

522
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,640
Is studying stressful?

523
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:04,850
Manageable.

524
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,750
But staying in a rigorous mindset

525
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,350
is important.

526
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,470
Exactly.

527
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,510
You've got to stay driven.

528
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,680
That's

529
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
how you improve.

530
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,140
You're absolutely right, sir.

531
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,800
What major are you considering?

532
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,600
Astronomy.

533
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,630
But I heard you secured

534
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
a physics recommendation.

535
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,640
Right.

536
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,100
So it's a bit of a regret.

537
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,970
But if I can test

538
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,110
into Astronomy myself,

539
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,510
it'd be more meaningful.

540
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,560
Impressive.

541
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,300
As a top student,

542
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,260
do people keep their distance?

543
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,600
Sir,

544
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,840
he's also student council president.

545
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,970
He helps everyone.

546
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,550
At school,

547
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,600
teachers and classmates

548
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,970
all like him.

549
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,220
Good.

550
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,390
Really good.

551
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,970
What's got you all so cheerful?

552
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,680
Niannian,

553
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,640
when you have time,

554
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,890
you should discuss

555
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,220
study methods with Changning.

556
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,970
He's already got his recommendation.

557
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,140
Learn from him.

558
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,500
I can study fine on my own.

559
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,600
Why would I need him?

560
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,970
It doesn't hurt to exchange ideas.

561
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,260
(I only left for a minute,)

562
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,720
