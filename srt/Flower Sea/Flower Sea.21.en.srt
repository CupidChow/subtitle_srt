=Episode 21=

3
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,480
Niannian,

4
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,970
it's been chilly lately.

5
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,140
Drink more warm water.

6
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,980
Thanks.

7
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,220
Niannian,

8
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
remember,

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,970
I'll always be your big brother.

10
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,100
If anyone troubles you,

11
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,220
you can tell me anytime.

12
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,660
What's wrong?

13
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,050
Sounds like you're saying goodbye.

14
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,730
Niannian,

15
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,220
I've kept these words in for too long.

16
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,970
I can't hold back anymore.

17
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,350
Well...

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,140
Lu Xun once said,

19
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,330
"Puppy love

20
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,720
might get you struck by lightning."

21
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,310
You've got it wrong.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,480
I...

23
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,220
Niannian,

24
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,470
I've thought about it a lot

25
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,350
I feel

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,510
if I don't tell you anything

27
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,800
or don't make it clear,

28
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,510
I'll keep feeling guilty.

29
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,470
Actually...

30
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,300
I just...

31
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,050
I just want your permission.

32
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,260
Hope you won't be mad at me.

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,600
Permission?

34
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,140
Permission for what?

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,600
Permission...

36
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,600
Permission to protect Chen Jing'an

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,600
like how I did you.

38
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,890
If I don't get your permission,

39
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,390
I won't sleep well at night.

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,010
I'll feel like...

41
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,300
I'm a complete jerk.

42
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,470
You got my permission.

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,100
Go ahead.

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,810
Niannian, you forgive me?

45
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,840
You're not mad?

46
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,600
Go for it.

47
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,850
Wow, that's rare.

48
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,470
You're doing homework?

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,300
Don't even ask.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,980
Mom's been acting weird lately,

51
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,390
forcing me to study,

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,860
checking my homework every day.

53
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,180
That's good.

54
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,760
You might make it to Tsinghua this way.

55
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,570
Tsinghua must be desperate then.

56
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,600
By the way,

57
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,950
Niannian's mom...

58
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,810
How's she doing?

59
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,720
You've been going to hospital.

60
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,350
No time to hang out.

61
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,550
Still thinking about playing?

62
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,430
Finish your homework.

63
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,350
Hey, what if...

64
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,970
I visit Niannian's mom at the hospital?

65
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,060
Solid reason.

66
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,220
Mom might give me a day off.

67
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,720
Come on,

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,850
if you go,

69
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,260
her mom might think you're dating.

70
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,050
Her condition just stabilized.

71
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,300
Don't mess it up.

72
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,310
Fine.

73
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,350
Li Minqiu

74
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,350
took Changning to play basketball. Coming?

75
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,480
Let's go.

76
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,220
So impressive!

77
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
You finished your match?

78
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,470
It's over.

79
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,730
It's over.

80
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,720
Who won?

81
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,830
Do you even need to ask?

82
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,880
Chen Changning, of course.

83
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,970
You played so hard

84
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,890
like it's the NBA.

85
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,970
Anyway, you lost.

86
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,720
This school court is your turf.

87
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,850
Dare to try mine?

88
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,010
Friendship first, competition second.

89
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,550
Just get along, you two.

90
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,850
Do you dare or not?

91
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,300
Let's compete in something else.

92
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,730
Like what?

93
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,850
Don't tell me it's dance games

94
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,510
in the arcade.

95
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,220
He's good at motorcycle games.

96
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,000
You could

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,100
race motorcycles with him.

98
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,260
Motorcycles? Too easy.

99
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,300
How about video games?

100
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Dare to have a match?

101
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,050
Video games? Seriously?

102
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,820
Video games it is.

103
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,770
Good.

104
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,550
League of Legends or World of Warcraft?

105
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,850
Pick one.

106
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,220
Or you choose.

107
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,720
Do you even know these games?

108
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,730
Right...

109
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,110
A top student like you

110
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,260
wouldn't have time for games.

111
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,050
I could teach you a few rounds.

112
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,850
Tian Ye, you coming?

113
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,140
No, no.

114
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,220
My mom's been strict lately.

115
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,350
Gotta go home for homework.

116
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,890
What are you laughing at?

117
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
Chen Changning...

118
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,100
probably doesn't play games, right?

119
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,390
You've lived with him this long.

120
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,080
Aren't you curious

121
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,280
why he's such a homebody?

122
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,550
Too bad we're going to the hospital.

123
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,850
Can't watch them compete now.

124
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,970
Alright, girls,

125
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,810
take a break.

126
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,470
I'm fine now, thank you both.

127
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm not tired.

128
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,350
Okay, Niannian.

129
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,720
You're always so sweet.

130
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
I know already.

131
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,220
Mom, if you like it,

132
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,600
I'll massage you every day.

133
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,640
Great.

134
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,560
By the way, Jing'an,

135
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,220
Niannian's been staying at your place.

136
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,410
I appreciate your help.

137
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,140
Ms. Liang,

138
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,640
you've said thank you so many times.

139
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,970
It's no trouble at all.

140
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,850
I genuinely care about you.

141
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,050
Thank you, Jing'an.

142
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,850
How about this, when I recover,

143
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,260
come visit us often.

144
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,820
I'll cook delicious meals for you.

145
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,850
Okay.

146
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,970
Ouch, be gentle.

147
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:30,850
Switch legs.

148
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,220
It hurts.

149
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,800
- Niannian, gentler.
- Feels good?

150
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,140
Good, but be gentle.

151
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,180
Be gentle, sweetheart.

152
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,720
It really hurts.

153
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,100
I could go easy on you.

154
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,600
Let you win a few rounds.

155
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,970
Otherwise, there's no challenge.

156
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,050
Just don't regret it later.

157
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,220
Why leave in such a hurry?

158
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,390
Ignore him.

159
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,140
Li Minqiu,

160
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,800
long time no see.

161
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,260
I don't want to fight today.

162
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,950
If there's nothing else, get lost!

163
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,100
Li Minqiu,

164
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,850
we still have unsettled scores.

165
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,470
You can't just walk away.

166
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,050
This is between us two.

167
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,140
Don't drag him in.

168
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,310
Let him leave first.

169
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,850
Sorry

170
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,060
for dragging you in.

171
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,100
Li Minqiu, stop playing hero.

172
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,970
Neither of you is leaving today.

173
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,930
Get them.

174
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,010
(Inpatient Department)

175
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,260
What's with all these people?

176
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,050
Emergency room's still packed this late.

177
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,320
No wonder your parents

178
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,640
are always too busy to come home.

179
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,310
Chen Changning,

180
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,050
you got a problem with blood?

181
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,550
This wouldn't happen to be

182
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,640
your first time in a fight, right?

183
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,470
A little squeamish.

184
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,550
Not my first fight.

185
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,550
Aren't you a good student?

186
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,300
In elementary school,

187
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,300
Chen Jing'an got bullied

188
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,100
really badly.

189
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,640
Respect.

190
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,050
Didn't know you had

191
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,800
this tough side to you.

192
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,470
Fighting takes credit.

193
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,470
I really didn't expect

194
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,600
you to handle yourself so well today.

195
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,180
Our plans got ruined

196
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,470
by those jerks.

197
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,550
No arcade today.

198
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,060
Next time,

199
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,260
after we recover,

200
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
I can teach you gaming.

201
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,060
No need.

202
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,640
Don't be polite.

203
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,850
You protected Chen Jing'an well

204
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,430
all these years.

205
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
From now on,

206
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,220
you can retire

207
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,300
and leave her to me.

208
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,680
I'll protect her.

209
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
She's my sister.

210
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,800
Why would I entrust her to you?

211
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,180
The truth is

212
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,350
you're not a child anymore.

213
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,800
You can't cling to Chen Jing'an

214
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,640
forever.

215
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,050
She'll get married someday.

216
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,970
She can't exactly take you along.

217
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,550
Or would you be her bridesmaid?

218
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,260
It's not your concern.

219
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,350
It is my concern.

220
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,550
You need to

221
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,890
learn to let go.

222
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,180
Let go.

223
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,300
Just worry about yourself.

224
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,760
With me around,

225
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,430
Chen Jing'an doesn't need your care.

226
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,930
(Oh, my,)

227
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,800
my future brother-in-law is so clingy.

228
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,800
How'd you get here so fast?

229
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,440
Your brain's broken. We've been here

230
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,300
the whole time.

231
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,800
Oh, right.

232
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,050
Next patient: Li Minqiu.

233
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,930
Jing'an.

234
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,260
It's okay.

235
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,220
It doesn't hurt.

236
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,180
Don't worry.

237
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,800
Who's worried about you?

238
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,800
You should be glad

239
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,390
your right hand is intact.

240
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,800
Or how would you do homework?

241
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,350
Do Mom and Dad know?

242
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,390
I didn't tell them.

243
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,220
But what were you thinking?

244
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,050
Getting into fights for no reason.

245
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,140
Don't do this again.

246
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,010
Understood?

247
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,720
Okay.

248
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,300
Chen Changning,

249
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,180
your turn.

250
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,890
Frowning like that...

251
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,600
So you do care about me.

252
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,180
We're friends.

253
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,600
Of course, I care about you.

254
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,180
Just friends?

255
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,140
If not friends,

256
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,220
then what?

257
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,060
Chen Jing'an,

258
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,050
actually I...

259
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,890
I don't know

260
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,890
when you became

261
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,850
so important to me.

262
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,220
It's just...

263
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,550
Well…

264
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,180
I like you.

265
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,550
I don't know how it happened.

266
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,050
I thought of you as a buddy.

267
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,390
But somewhere along the way,

268
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,850
my feelings…

269
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,850
changed.

270
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,680
Chen Jing'an,

271
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,800
does it make me unreliable

272
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,850
that my feelings

273
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,550
changed so fast?

274
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,430
No,

275
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,900
you're great.

276
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,600
Then how do you feel about me?

277
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,850
Sorry,

278
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,050
I like someone else.

279
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,930
Who?

280
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,470
Tian Ye?

281
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,890
No.

282
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,800
Hey, how are you getting home later?

283
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,970
Niannian's dad is

284
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,300
driving us home.

285
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,850
We could

286
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,720
give you

287
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,180
a ride too.

288
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,310
No need.

289
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,640
I called my mom.

290
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,970
She'll pick me up.

291
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,850
You made up with your mom?

292
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,470
Sort of.

293
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,050
What you said last time

294
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,220
made sense.

295
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,850
Come on, give me your bag.

296
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,720
I'll carry it.

297
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,640
It's fine.

298
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,140
Stop moving around.

299
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,550
You'll reopen your wounds.

300
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,010
I'm fine.

301
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,050
You're acting like I'm dying.

302
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,350
Don't say that.

303
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
This is serious.

304
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,220
No more fights.

305
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,930
They started it.

306
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,300
Really. It wasn't my fault.

307
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,890
All I see is you're hurt.

308
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,550
Fine, no more fights.

309
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,180
It's not that bad.

310
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,220
The bandages just look scary.

311
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,930
Minqiu,

312
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,470
I know

313
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,100
you're a good kid.

314
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,290
But no matter what,

315
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,800
no more fighting.

316
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,100
Even if you don't care about me,

317
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,140
think of your grandparents.

318
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,050
If they saw you hurt like this,

319
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,140
they'd be so worried.

320
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,050
Why wouldn't I care about you?

321
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,640
If I didn't care,

322
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,050
I wouldn't ask you to pick me up.

323
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,550
Don't worry.

324
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,180
I definitely won't fight anymore.

325
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,550
Minqiu,

326
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,640
actually...

327
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,930
Actually I...

328
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,310
What?

329
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,430
Actually,

330
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,640
I will be leaving soon.

331
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,050
Would you like to come with me?

332
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Go abroad together?

333
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,850
Are you joking?

334
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,050
I'm serious.

335
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,300
I won't force you.

336
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,470
If you don't want to,

337
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,050
just forget I mentioned it.

338
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,600
I have grandparents and friends here.

339
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,050
I can't go abroad with you.

340
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,050
I'm sorry.

341
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,930
It's okay.

342
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,930
I won't blame you.

343
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,390
Alright.

344
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,300
Go on upstairs.

345
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,970
Don't worry your grandparents.

346
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,220
- Go ahead.
- You...

347
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,100
Not coming up?

348
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,300
It's too late.

349
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,180
I will visit tomorrow.

350
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,470
Medicine.

351
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,800
Remember to apply the medicine.

352
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,600
He'll recover in a few days.

353
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,100
After that, he'll be back.

354
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,470
That's not what I'm worried about.

355
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,180
What worries me is

356
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,880
some classmates were around

357
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,390
when they fought that day.

358
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,300
They took photos and posted them online.

359
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,760
Now the school administrators know.

360
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,430
How will they handle this?

361
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,930
It seems...

362
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Director Jiang hates

363
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,220
student fights most.

364
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,970
The worst part is

365
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,550
Chen Changning was involved this time.

366
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,300
It's doomed.

367
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,600
Listen, guys,

368
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,300
I heard Chen Changning
and Li Minqiu fought

369
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,800
over Zhu Niannian.

370
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,970
Nonsense.

371
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,050
Got any proof?

372
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,800
Does this need proof?

373
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,720
Isn't it obvious?

374
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,050
Tell me,

375
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,180
when two men fight,

376
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,100
isn't it always

377
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,550
over a woman?

378
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,890
Faced with a beauty like Zhu Niannian,

379
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,350
even Chen Changning couldn't resist.

380
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,140
Right?

381
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,390
What nonsense is that?

382
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,050
Calm down.

383
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,890
I'm just stating facts.

384
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,970
Sit.

385
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,550
Oh, Chen Changning.

386
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,050
What am I going to do with you?

387
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,050
Do you think you can do whatever you want

388
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,890
with good grades

389
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,350
and a guaranteed admission spot?

390
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,640
Hanging with bad students,

391
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,720
fighting with street boys.

392
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,640
You…

393
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,050
What were you thinking?

394
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,550
Sorry, Director Jiang.

395
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,300
Fighting wasn't my intention.

396
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,300
But they did provoke us first.

397
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,970
Did you have issues?

398
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,010
No.

399
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,390
I didn't know them before.

400
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,720
Then why would they pick on you?

401
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,180
Who threw the first punch?

402
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,060
They did.

403
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,430
That day,

404
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,850
if you weren't with Li Minqiu,

405
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,550
this probably wouldn't have happened.

406
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,350
It wasn't his fault.

407
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,720
Those guys looked for trouble.

408
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,810
Sorry, sir,

409
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,430
for causing you trouble.

410
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,470
This isn't just about causing me trouble.

411
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,850
The direct admissions review is coming.

412
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,970
With this incident now,

413
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,230
whether you keep your spot

414
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,850
is now in question.

415
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,710
You...

416
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,550
You've really disappointed me.

417
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,060
Anyway,

418
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:00,970
your punishment

419
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:01,820
isn't decided yet.

420
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,100
I'll see if we can

421
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,180
fix this.

422
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,220
Go back to class now.

423
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,470
Also,

424
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,550
no more trouble these days.

425
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,550
Thank you, sir.

426
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,140
Changning!

427
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,050
Chen Changning!

428
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,510
What happened?

429
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,300
Why did you get into a fight?

430
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,600
Your teacher said

431
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,970
the direct admission might be revoked.

432
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,060
Dad,

433
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,310
Mom,

434
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,470
I'm sorry

435
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,050
for worrying you.

436
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,390
I'll accept any punishment from school

437
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,390
and face your criticism honestly.

438
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,660
As for the admission spot,

439
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,140
I never liked physics anyway.

440
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,430
I'll get astronomy

441
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,550
with my own abilities.

442
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,470
Changning,

443
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,050
we're not blaming you.

444
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,200
I know

445
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,220
you wouldn't start a fight intentionally.

446
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,180
But fighting is unacceptable.

447
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,550
What if you got hurt?

448
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,310
Promise us,

449
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,720
no more impulsive actions.

450
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,550
Okay,

451
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,640
I promise.

452
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,300
Chen Changning,

453
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
what if your face got injured?

454
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,600
How would you find a girlfriend?

455
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,510
Niannian,

456
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,550
sorry.

457
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,550
You had to see this.

458
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,560
Um...

459
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,550
Chen Changning...

460
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,970
Um…

461
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,050
I think Chen Changning

462
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,350
relies on his talents.

463
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,350
So scars don't matter.

464
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,390
How's your hand?

465
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,260
Is it okay?

466
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,970
Fine, doesn't hurt anymore.

467
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,640
Look, I can carry things.

468
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,600
Be careful.

469
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,930
Your wound might reopen

470
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,890
and bleed everywhere.

471
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,930
It's not a serious injury.

472
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,100
"Bleed everywhere"?

473
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,720
By the way,

474
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,640
how's Chen Changning?

475
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,640
His injuries weren't as bad.

476
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,300
He should be almost recovered.

477
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,970
That's good.

478
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,300
But this fight incident

479
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,390
is very serious

480
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,470
in Director Jiang's eyes.

481
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,800
You might get disciplinary records.

482
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,970
If Chen Changning gets punished,

483
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,720
his direct admission

484
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,800
will be revoked.

485
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,810
What?

486
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,550
Li Minqiu!

487
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,050
The Director wants you.

488
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,550
Sir.

489
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:20,970
How's your arm?

490
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,680
Fine, almost healed.

491
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,930
Your arm may be fine.

492
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,470
But the off-campus fight is serious.

493
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,720
It caused a terrible influence.

494
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,300
To satisfy

495
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,350
all parties involved,

496
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,680
we've decided

497
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,140
on punishments
according to the school rules.

498
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,320
Each of you gets

499
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,140
a major disciplinary record.

500
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,050
And Changning's admission is revoked.

501
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,060
Changning,

502
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,300
the school can't favor you

503
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,850
just for good grades.

504
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,720
I tried my best.

505
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,390
Thank you, sir.

506
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,550
I can get in without it.

507
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,100
Do you know

508
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,430
this disciplinary record

509
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,980
will stay in your file

510
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,800
forever?

511
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,390
Director Jiang,

512
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
this isn't fair.

513
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,720
How is it unfair?

514
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,550
Of course, it's unfair.

515
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,180
We didn't start the fight.

516
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,550
They came after us.

517
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,100
We had to defend ourselves.

518
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,300
Should we just take the hit?

519
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,850
This counts

520
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,430
as self-defense.

521
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,430
Why punish us?

522
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,130
Take a look.

523
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,640
It doesn't matter

524
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,050
whether it's a "self-defense" or not.

525
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,390
You injured them this badly.

526
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,470
Their parents

527
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,600
brought medical reports

528
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,500
to school last night,

529
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,600
demanding answers.

530
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,760
Or they'll call police.

531
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:45,890
What could I do?

532
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,680
Let them arrest you?

533
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,800
Liu Shuai set me up.

534
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,550
If you hadn't gone there,

535
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,800
he wouldn't have had the chance.

536
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,050
You shouldn't have gone to internet cafes.

537
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,260
You...

538
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,800
You corrupted Chen Changning,

539
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,640
a promising student.

540
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,350
Do you know

541
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,230
how much damage

542
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,890
you've caused the school?

543
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Not expelling you

544
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,540
is lenient enough.

545
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,890
This has nothing to do with him.

546
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,550
I have a feud with Liu Shuai.

547
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,640
Changning just helped me.

548
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,640
At least it's heroic behavior.

549
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,200
How can you give him a record

550
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,640
and revoke his admission?

551
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,390
He deserves an award instead.

552
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,850
And actually,

553
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,350
this thing started

554
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,550
because I caused trouble.

555
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,640
Any punishment should be mine alone.

556
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,680
Chen Changning's just

557
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,550
an unlucky guy caught in my mess.

558
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,680
Punishing him as well

559
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,300
would make the school look merciless.

560
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,890
Li Minqiu,

561
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,550
do you understand

562
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,640
how serious this is?

563
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,220
If you take

564
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,800
all the blame,

565
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,300
you'll get expelled immediately!

566
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,760
Don't blame him.

567
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:01,970
I'll take the record.

568
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,050
I accept the punishment.

569
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,180
No.

570
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,300
The admission is important.

571
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,350
It's fine.

572
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,720
Without it,

573
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
I can still get admitted.

574
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:10,930
Sir,

575
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
just give me the record.

576
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,680
Don't expel Li Minqiu.

577
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,050
Chen Changning!

578
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,050
What are you doing?

579
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,850
Are you crazy?

580
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,550
A total nerd!

581
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,720
I answer for my own actions.

582
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,720
Who asked you to play hero?

583
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,720
Who do you think you are?

584
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:29,930
Mind your own business.

585
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:32,890
Li Minqiu,

586
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,220
what are you trying to do?

587
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,100
I just hate his holier-than-thou attitude.

588
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,930
I handle my own problems.

589
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,050
I don't need his fake heroics.

590
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,510
Li Minqiu.

591
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,890
Stop barking. Annoying!

592
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,430
Stop it! Are you insane?

593
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,300
I just don't like him

594
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,350
and want to punch him.

595
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,050
Chen Changning,

596
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,050
you're done here.

597
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:53,930
You can go.

598
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,060
Li Minqiu,

599
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,470
you don't have to.

600
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,300
- I know...
- You know nothing.

601
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,600
Stop pretending to be good.

602
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,970
Li Minqiu!

603
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
You've gone too far!

604
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,050
Call your parents!

605
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,140
You'll get expelled!

606
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,530
Why are you still here?

607
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,430
Li Minqiu,

608
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,930
is it fun?

609
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,890
It is.

610
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,180
The school lifted

611
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,100
your punishment.

612
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,640
Happy ending.

613
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,050
But what about you?

614
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
I was never cut out for studying,

615
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,890
but you're different.

616
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,300
You're a top student.

617
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,680
I can't ruin your future.

618
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,300
But this wasn't all your fault.

619
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,100
It was, of course.

620
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,180
Let's review:

621
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,930
I started the competition,

622
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,100
dragged you to the internet cafe.

623
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,070
We didn't make it, tho.

624
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,220
Also,

625
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,720
I'm the one who had issues

626
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
with Liu Shuai.

627
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,550
See? Nothing to do with you.

628
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,040
Why interfere?

629
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,890
I didn't want to involve you,

630
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,390
or I'd have hit them harder.

631
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,800
I won't let you get expelled.

632
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,140
I'll talk to him myself.

633
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,680
Changning, will you ever stop?

634
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,300
Are you looking down

635
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,180
upon me?

636
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,890
I've really decided to quit school.

637
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,390
Even without this incident,

638
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,800
I wouldn't have stayed much longer.

639
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,310
Stop making it worse,

640
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,280
okay?

641
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,050
What did Director Jiang say?

642
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,550
With my silver tongue,

643
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
I saved Changning.

644
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,100
Really?

645
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,150
Is he good?

646
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,970
Li Minqiu,

647
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,890
you're amazing.

648
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,010
What about you?

649
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,060
Nothing too serious.

650
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,550
But I might have more freedom now.

651
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,800
What do you mean?

652
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,050
Niannian,

653
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,550
I'm dropping out.

654
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,640
Today might be my last day at school.

655
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,100
What will you do after leaving?

656
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,800
I'm not entirely sure yet.

657
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,890
But I've discussed

658
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,930
with my grandpa and mom,

659
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,390
I might as well go abroad.

660
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,680
You have no idea.

661
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,180
My mom's been begging me to go overseas.

662
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,640
Don't feel pressured about it.

663
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,350
When I return in a few years,

664
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,220
I'll come back as

665
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,430
a high-value returnee.

666
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,800
I have a promising future.

667
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,430
Don't forget us after you leave.

668
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,050
Who would've thought

669
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,550
Changning didn't end up going abroad,

670
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,930
but you do.

671
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,350
And so soon.

672
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,350
We won't even have time to see you off.

673
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,050
My mom always wants me to go abroad.

674
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,800
She pulled strings long ago

675
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,300
to get my visa sorted secretly.

676
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,470
Plus,

677
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,550
her business needs her back.

678
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,600
So I'm leaving tomorrow.

679
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,720
Though you can't see me off,

680
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,720
isn't today

681
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,800
my farewell party already?

682
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,470
So sudden...

683
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,180
You'll be gone for years.

684
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,520
Will we...

685
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,300
drift apart eventually

686
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,970
and go our separate ways?

687
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,140
All good things come to an end.

688
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,930
After high school,

689
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,220
we'll go our own way.

690
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,930
Though goodbyes are sad,

691
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,350
it's something we all go through.

692
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,550
In the future,

693
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,220
we'll each have different lives.

694
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,970
We can't stay together,

695
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,720
but as long as we remember each other,

696
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,890
we'll meet again someday.

697
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,050
Who knows what the future holds?

698
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,680
What do you all want to do

699
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,800
when you graduate?

700
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,640
I want to work in astronomy,

701
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,220
studying the stars.

702
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,300
I want to be a journalist

703
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,140
to interview tribes in Africa,

704
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,640
then film wildlife on the savannah.

705
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,930
Then maybe I'll go to Africa too,

706
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,050
to do international trade.

707
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,300
I just want to get prettier,

708
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,720
become stunning

709
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,390
and famous worldwide.

710
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,800
And me,

711
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,390
I'll be rich,

712
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,850
then eat my way around the globe.

713
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,430
Such low ambitions.

714
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,850
Why even stay in school?

715
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,470
Just go inherit your family fortune now.

716
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,310
Says you!

717
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,550
What about you?

718
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,470
Me?

719
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,050
I want to be a physicist,

720
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,390
surpass Newton

721
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,850
and Hawking,

722
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,100
study black holes,

723
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,800
unlock science's mysteries.

724
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,550
Physics is fine.

725
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,850
But maybe set

726
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,680
a more realistic goal?

727
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,430
Can't I dream big?

728
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,050
Besides, my lowest is still better than you.

729
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,550
Then let's make a pact:

730
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,260
Ten years.

731
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,050
We'll reunite in ten years

732
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,300
and see if our dreams came true.

733
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,890
Who knows?

734
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,390
Maybe some of us

735
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,850
will even end up together!

736
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,700
I think

737
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,860
Deng Shasha's suggestion

738
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,890
is really great.

739
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,050
Don't worry, everyone.

740
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,930
I definitely won't let you down.

741
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,310
Good.

742
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,890
Then we'll wait and see.

743
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,800
Mom.

744
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:58,980
You should rest at home

745
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,300
for the next few days.

746
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,300
Any plans for dinner?

747
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,720
Dad and I will cook for you.

748
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,680
That sounds good.

749
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,930
I'll have to trouble you two then.

750
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,300
By the way, next week,

751
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,050
invite Jing'an over.

752
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,300
I want to treat her to dinner.

753
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,610
These past days,

754
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,550
she's been taking care of me in hospital.

755
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,680
I need to thank her.

756
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,140
Okay.

757
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,720
I'll get you some water.

758
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,300
Dear President,

759
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,680
I'd like to ask

760
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,970
what does

761
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,430
"When the eclipse comes,

762
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,800
miracles will appear again" mean?

763
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,680
You've got the wrong person.

764
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,740
I'm not the president.

765
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,350
You are the president.

♪Sweetness flows like honey♪

767
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:11,993
