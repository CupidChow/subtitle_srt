Chen Changning is going abroad?

3
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,800
Sorry, Jing'an.

4
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,300
The night your aunt came,

5
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,720
she told us about it,

6
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,300
but you told me my mom
was sick the next day,

7
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,510
and I got so anxious
that I forgot to tell you.

8
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,140
Are you okay?

9
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,510
You just heard what my mom said, right?

10
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,970
What?

11
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,850
I'm adopted.

12
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,300
Jing'an...

13
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,470
So,

14
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,970
last time my aunt came,

15
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,300
you felt her dislike toward me, right?

16
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,260
I'm not my parents' biological child,

17
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,260
so she thinks

18
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,720
I'm not related to her by blood,

19
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,200
and she has never liked me
since I was little.

20
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,850
Every time she visits us,

21
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,140
it's a torment for me.

22
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,890
Are you scared knowing I'm adopted?

23
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,140
Even Tian Ye

24
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,720
doesn't know this secret.

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,640
I didn't plan to tell you,

26
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,970
but since you overheard,

27
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,300
I won't hide it anymore.

28
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,850
After all,

29
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,760
you still have to live

30
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,350
with my family with this identity.

31
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,970
If you don't know the truth,

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,220
you might slip up.

33
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,810
Jing'an,

34
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,600
I will never tell anyone about this,

35
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,260
but you also need to know

36
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,260
that your parents truly love you.

37
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,890
Though they are busy with work every day

38
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,470
and have no time to take care of you,

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,760
they really love you.

40
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,010
During these days living with them,

41
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,720
I can clearly feel

42
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,260
that their love for you

43
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,050
is no less than for Chen Changning.

44
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,350
Of course, I know.

45
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,970
My parents have never

We can just take the bus home.

178
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,670
You should stay here
to look after Mrs. Zhu.

179
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,570
She can't be left alone.

180

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,810
Let's go.

191
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,720
Why did you have to tag along?

192
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,820
I don't feel at ease
leaving Niannian here.

193
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,010
What's wrong with my coming?

194
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,730
Come here.

195
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,320
We need to talk.

196
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,350
No.

197
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,600
Why can't you talk here?

198
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,850
Come here.

199
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,500
(Going abroad)

200
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,850
(makes you high and mighty, huh?)

201
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,010
(Talking so aggressively.)

202
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,800
Good for you.

203
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,850
Your sad act this time
was pretty convincing.

204
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,550
Go remind Chen Jing'an:

205
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,100
If this keeps up,

206
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,350
Tian Ye might also find out
about the swap.

207
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,140
Actually,

208
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Chen Jing'an

209
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,600
already told him.

210
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,980
What?

211
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,720
Niannian, don't worry.

212
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,470
Mrs. Zhu will definitely
get better soon.

213
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,350
Don't worry.

214
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,220
You have to stay happy, okay?

215
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,140
I know.

216
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,830
Chen Jing'an,

217
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,600
do you have an extra quilt
at your place?

218
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,470
I want...

219
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,760
What are you doing?

220
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,640
What do you want?

221
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,970
What are you doing?

222
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,220
You're not welcome.

223
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
What did you just say?

224
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,510
I want to sleep on your floor.

225
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,350
You, out too.

226
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,280
You... I...

227
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,970
Chen...

228
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,470
Niannian.

229
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,220
What's wrong with him?

230
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,640
No idea.

231
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,850
- Is it because of you?
- Is it because of you?

232
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,850
- No.
- No.

233
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,720
I just wanted to sleep on his floor.

234
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,220
It's because of you.

235
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,760
You even got me kicked out too.

236
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,720
He's so petty.

237
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,300
You dragged me down.

238
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,010
Good morning, everyone.

239
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,350
Next week, the student council

240
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,970
will hold the leadership election.

241
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,760
The Grade 12 members,

242
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,510
led by Chen Changning,

243
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,800
will soon finish all their duties.

244
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,470
The new president

245
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,850
and each department director

246
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,550
will be elected from Grade 11 members.

247
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,760
Anyone interested in running

248
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,100
should bring their materials

249
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
to the student council office
to register.

250
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,640
Zheng Chuan,

251
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,640
Chen Changning is stepping down.

252
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,350
You're getting a promotion.

253
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,970
Don't play with fire.

254
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,550
I can't do that.

255
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,140
Speaking of him,

256
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,470
isn't he guaranteed admission?

257
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,520
He's not under much academic pressure.

258
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,010
Why does he step down so early?

259
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:43,970
How would I know?

260
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,350
Didn't Chen Jing'an tell you any info?

261
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Because Chen Changning is going abroad.

262
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,300
Why is he suddenly going abroad?

263
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,470
I have no idea.

264
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,350
Have you told him about the swap?

265
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,720
He was furious yesterday.

266
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,850
Maybe he already knows.

267
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,220
Come on.

268
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,300
He's going abroad anyway.

269
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,720
What's the point of saying it now?

270
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,850
Changning.

271
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,220
Mr. Deng.

272
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,890
I might not be able to work

273
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,970
as your teaching assistant.

274
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,560
Why?

275
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,500
I applied for a volunteer position

276
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,800
at the local planetarium.

277
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,240
I just got the reply yesterday.

278
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,180
You were accepted?

279
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,120
Starting next week,

280
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,190
I'll be a docent at the planetarium
every weekend.

281
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,220
It clashes with your class,

282
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,860
so I have to turn you down. Sorry.

283
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,720
No need to apologize to me.

284
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,390
Your dream has always been astronomy.

285
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,970
That's a great thing.

286
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,430
Don't worry.

287
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,470
I'll support you unconditionally.

288
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,550
As for my class,

289
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,510
you don't need to worry.

290
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,420
I'll ask Fan Ge to help me with it.

291
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,510
He won't be busy starting next week.

292
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,350
Alright.

293
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,480
Thank you, Mr. Deng.

294
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,730
You have to give it your all.

295
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,730
I will.

296
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,230
You may leave.

297
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,180
Sure.

298
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,470
Zhu Niannian.

299
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,470
Are you really going abroad?

300
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,170
Do you not want me to go abroad?

301
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,350
What's it got to do with me?

302
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
I was just asking.

303
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,260
Go if you want.

But I think

306
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,470
I heard Jing'an say before

307
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
that you two were going

308
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,720
to study in Beijing together.

309
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,970
Yes.

310
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,890
Beijing.

311
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,520
You admit it?

312
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,970
Then what about now?

313
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,390
Now that you have a chance
to study in America,

314
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
you immediately toss aside your promise.

315
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,510
But MIT has the best astronomy.

316
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,010
I've always liked astronomy.

317
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,880
But you promised Jing'an.

318
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,360
What you're doing now is called

319
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,500
breaking your word

and abandoning loyalty for profit.

321
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,680
So,

322
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,720
does Chen Jing'an not want me
to go abroad?

Jing'an has no say

326
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,110
on whether you go abroad or not.

327
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,770
Maybe Jing'an just wants to remind you

328
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,560
not to worship foreign things blindly.

329
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,970
Don't become a fake foreigner

330
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,310
after studying abroad for a few years.

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,550
- Actually...

332
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,370
I'm just passing on Jing'an's words.

333
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,450

Although the doctor said

340
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,430
it's just a minor surgery

341
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,940
and she'll be fine afterward,

342
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,010
I still can't help feeling anxious.

Let's visit your mom after school today.

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,640
Something came up at home yesterday,
so I couldn't go.

345
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,260
Won't it be too much trouble?

346
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,640
Of course not.

347
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,760
We're best friends,

348
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,640
right?

349
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,720
By the way,

350
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,470
is Chen Changning really going abroad?

351
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,850
Yes, his parents agreed.

352
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,260
If he goes,

353
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,720
it'll be at least four or five years.

354
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,170
If he does grad school,

355
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,050
it'll be even longer.

356
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,300
Don't you feel a little reluctant?

357
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
He loves astronomy so much.

358
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Studying abroad

359
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,800
is nothing but good for him.

360
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,850
Since he's already decided,

361
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,640
I'll surely support him.

362
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,010
Niannian, you're amazing.

363
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,720
If it were me,

364
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,970
I'd definitely be reluctant.

365
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,850
I have no position to be reluctant.

366
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,970
I can only respect his decision.

367
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,970
Once he leaves,

368
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,640
won't you two have even less chance?

369
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,300
Why not confess your feelings

370
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,470
before he goes abroad?

371
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,470
As the saying goes,

372
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,860
strike first to gain the advantage.

373
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,890
That way,

374
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,850
when he's overseas,

375
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,140
he'll always be thinking of you.

376
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,470
Maybe you could even start

377
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,760
an epic cross-country romance.

378
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,010
What are you thinking?

379
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,470
I'm in Jing'an's body now.

380
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,010
How can I confess to him?

381
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,760
Besides, my mom is still lying
in a hospital bed.

382
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,970
All I want now

383
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,220
is for her to get better soon

384
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
and for me and Jing'an
to switch back quickly.

385
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,600
Everything will be fine.

386
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,470
(Inpatient Department)

387
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,550
Shasha, it's been so long
since I saw you.

388
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,010
In the future, you should visit us often

389
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,140
with Jing'an.

390
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,800
- Sure.
- Have some fruit.

391
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,140
Today, your aunts came by.

392
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,390
They brought some fruit.

393
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,050
Your mom can't eat it all,

394
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,470
so take it with you later.

395
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,430
You can share it.

396
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,760
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

397
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,310
Mrs. Zhu,

398
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,470
you have surgery tomorrow.

399
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,300
Niannian said she's worried about you,

400
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,620
so we want to take leave tomorrow

401
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,860
to stay with you.

402
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,220
Yes, can we come?

403
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,220
You can't take leave.

404
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,390
It's just a small surgery.

405
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,220
You can't let it affect your studies.

406
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,800
You can't come here

407
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,680
unless class is over.

408
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,180
But I...

409
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,100
Niannian, be good.

410
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,930
Don't get distracted at school.

411
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,220
Come after school.

412
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
You're going out?

413
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,950
I'm going to find Auntie

414
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,060
for shopping

415
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,530
to prepare for the luggage.

416
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,100
Packing already?

417
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,050
What a fake foreigner.

418
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,350
Let's go.

419
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,640
Minqiu.

420
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,310
Why are you here?

421
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,600
I just got back yesterday,

422
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,720
so I came to see you.

423
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,350
Are you done?

424
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,560
I'm leaving.

425
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,230
Minqiu,

426
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,470
I haven't seen you in over three years.

427
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,470
Let me have a look at you.

428
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,470
You've grown taller.

429
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,800
I sent you some sneakers.

430
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,890
Why aren't you wearing them?

431
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,970
Do you not like them?

432
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,100
Then I'll buy you some more.

433
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,830
Those things are too expensive.

434
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,780
Not suitable for me.

435
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,230
I sold them.

436
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,430
Minqiu,

437
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,470
I know

438
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,390
you blame me.

439
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,550
But I had my reasons back then.

440
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,850
After your dad and I divorced,

441
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,390
I couldn't raise you.

442
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,970
I couldn't afford it.

443
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,970
So, I left you with your dad.

444
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,050
That's all in the past.

445
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,470
No need to say those things.

446
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,140
My grandparents treated me really well.

447
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,800
The three of us

448
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
are doing well.

449
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,180
Are you done?

450
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,220
Rest easy.

451
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,810
Minqiu...

452
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,100
Don't be mad.

453
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,970
We can't decide

454
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,720
these things.

455
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,100
Chen Changning

456
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,550
decided to go abroad just like this.

457
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,010
He forgot all his promises to me.

458
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,420
When he comes back,
you have to scold him for me.

459
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,180
But

460
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,010
it's not wrong for him to choose

461
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,720
to go abroad to pursue his dream.

462
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,720
But he promised me

463
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,550
we'd go to university
in Beijing together.

464
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,220
Sorry, Jing'an.

465
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,970
I don't want to discuss these things.

466
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,300
Sorry, Niannian.

467
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,470
I was just venting.

468
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,260
I forgot you're still worried.

469
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,970
I'm okay.

470
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,470
I just

471
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,510
can't help worrying

472
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,220
about my mom's surgery tomorrow.

473
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,260
My dad is performing it.

474
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,260
He's very experienced, so don't worry.

475
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,760
Besides, it's a minor surgery.

476
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,760
I understand all that,

477
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,220
but I still can't help worrying.

478
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,850
Then after school tomorrow,

479
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,390
let's rush there immediately, okay?

480
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,720
I really can't understand you.

481
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,890
You claim it's for my sake,

482
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
but I'm doing all of this for you.

483
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,050
I don't have much money,

484
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,510
but I can afford

485
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,350
your study abroad at least.

486
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,510
Can't you reconsider?

487
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:58,930
Auntie,

488
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,850
I've thought it through.

489
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,010
My answer to you now

490
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,350
is the result of deep consideration.

491
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,890
Can't you see it?

492
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,970
If you refuse to go abroad now,

493
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,600
you'll definitely regret it

494
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,100
in ten or twenty years.

495
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,510
I don't know if I'll regret it

496
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,100
in ten or twenty years,

497
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,350
but I know

498
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,300
I won't regret it

499
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,220
during those years.

500
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,810
You...

501
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,390
You're making me so mad.

502
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,510
This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

503
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,140
If it were someone else,

504
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,850
they'd definitely grab it.

505
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,550
But you act like you're possessed.

506
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,440
I really don't know
who you got this stubbornness from.

507
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,470
Auntie...

508
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,550
No need to see me off.

509
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,650
I'm leaving in two days.

510
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,050
If you

511
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,930
decide to go abroad,

512
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,720
rest easy and go with your aunt.

513
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,220
Your dad and I will explain it to her.

514
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,140
No need.

515
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,720
I'm not going abroad.

516
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,680
I'll find a chance
to explain it to Auntie.

517
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,550
Don't be sad.

518
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,720
Even if you don't go abroad,

519
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,180
you'll have a bright future.

520
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,300
I just feel

521
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,800
sorry for Auntie.

522
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,550
Didn't you

523
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,050
already decide to go abroad?

524
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,300
Why suddenly change your mind?

525
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,140
When did I decide to go abroad?

526
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,300
You stepped down
from the student council,

527
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,050
and you told Mr. Deng

528
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,970
he'd have to lead

529
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,600
the natural science club.

530
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,220
Doesn't that mean you're going abroad?

531
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,680
Student council elections

532
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,600
happen at this time every year.

533
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,140
The club thing

534
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,640
is because I'll volunteer

535
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,640
at the planetarium starting next week.

536
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,220
I never planned to go abroad
from the start.

537
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,850
Why didn't you say so earlier?

538
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,180
You made me worry for nothing.

539
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,060
Worry?

540
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,310
Who's worried?

541
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm going to sleep.

542
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,720
Wait a minute.

543
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,670
I have something to tell you.

544
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,390
I'm not listening.

545
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,430
(Grade 11)

546
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,350
These two lessons are very important.

547
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,140
You must remember

548
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,140
the knowledge I stressed.

549
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,930
Okay? Did you hear me?

550
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,140
Yes.

551
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,010
Okay.

552
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,140
Class dismissed.

553
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,140
Stand up.

554
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,060
Goodbye, Ms. Yu.

555
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,050
Why help her?

556
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,180
She has hands, doesn't she?

557
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,430
Is there something on my face?

558
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,050
No.

559
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,800
Give me your phone.

560
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,020
Hurry, I want to see
what was posted on Tieba.

561
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,550
Last night,

562
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,000
someone posted

563
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,430
that you were adopted.

564
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:37,795
