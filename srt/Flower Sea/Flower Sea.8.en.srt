1
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,291
Zhu Niannian

2
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:18,041
You

3
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:18,666
transferred to

4
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:19,916
our class

5
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:20,833
That's right

6
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:21,791
Tian Ye

7
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,375
From now on, we'll be desk mates

8
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,333
Going to the bathroom

9
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,333
I just transferred here

10
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,666
I thought you were Deng Shasha

11
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,583
Sorry about that

12
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,583
You scared me to death

13
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:53,875
Tian Ye

14
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,208
Switch desks with me

15
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,166
No way

16
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,166
My desk mate is the Chinese class representative

17
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,583
You can copy his Chinese homework from now on

18
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,458
Besides

19
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,166
Isn't Chinese your worst subject?

20
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,083
You're mistaken

21
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,208
Physics is my worst subject

22
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,582
And I can copy from the school beauty

23
00:02:09,457 --> 00:02:10,125
Tian Ye

24
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:12,041
Then switch seats with me

25
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,082
From now on, physics homework

26
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:14,375
how about I do it for you?

27
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,041
Don't think

28
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,125
I don't know what you two are up to.

29
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:21,457
With you two looking like that,

30
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,791
the school beauty would never like you.

31
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,250
She wouldn't like you either.

32
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:26,082
Your comeback

33
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,916
has no effect on Tian Ye at all.

34
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,625
Tian Ye

35
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,291
just say yes.

36
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,666
Tian Ye

37
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,500
I give up.

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,207
Just say yes.

39
00:02:41,457 --> 00:02:42,332
Tian Ye

40
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:44,166
What are you guys doing?

41
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,082
No, no, no.

42
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:48,250
It's nothing, really.

43
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,957
How come after just a few days apart

44
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:03,791
your relationship has progressed this much?

45
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:09,541
Report.

46
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,166
Nian Nian, you're here.

47
00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:13,332
Nian Nian.

48
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:14,291
You suddenly switched subjects.

49
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,250
You really caught me off guard.

50
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,707
I don't know if it was just a moment of impulse,

51
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:18,250
or

52
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,625
if there was some other reason.

53
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,916
I still want to try to keep you.

54
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,457
Teacher.

55
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,000
I've already moved to Class One.

56
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:27,000
I know you've already moved.

57
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,416
But I still want to leave you a way back.

58
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,500
Think about it.

59
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,791
The joint exams are coming up soon.

60
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:33,916
You weren't doing well in science before.

61
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:35,666
It's hard to get good grades.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,375
I think

63
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,125
before the joint exams,

64
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,125
you should think it over carefully.

65
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,250
Class Eight will always welcome you back.

66
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:41,791
Teacher.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,750
Don't worry.

68
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,957
I definitely won't regret it.

69
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:45,791
As for my science subjects,

70
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,541
I'll take them very, very seriously.

71
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,457
You really don't need to worry.

72
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,832
Stand up.

73
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:01,666
Good morning, teacher.

74
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,541
Good morning, students.

75
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:07,707
This in-class quiz

76
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,041
I have finished grading.

77
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,875
Everyone has made overall progress.

78
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:11,582
However,

79
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,166
only one student

80
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,916
got a perfect score.

81
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,415
It must be you.

82
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:18,540
Zhu Niannian transferred to another class.

83
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,040
You're the best at history in our class now.

84
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,250
It's her.

85
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:25,250
Chen Jing'an.

86
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,625
Let's give her a round of applause.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,125
Actually, when Chen Jing'an

88
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,290
first transferred to our class,

89
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,333
I was especially worried

90
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,625
that you might not keep up with the grades.

91
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:38,540
But

92
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,583
now I see there was no need to worry.

93
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,458
All I can say is

94
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,458
Chen Jing'an

95
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,165
is truly talented in the humanities.

96
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:45,708
Come here.

97
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:51,625
Congratulations.

98
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,708
Thank you, teacher.

99
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,125
I will keep working hard.

100
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,208
Go back to your seat.

101
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,250
Whose is this?

102
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,625
I accidentally bought too much.

103
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,790
It would be a waste if I can't finish it.

104
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:19,790
If you don't mind,

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,040
I don't mind at all.

106
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,208
You can even do it like this?

107
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,415
This is way too advanced.

108
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:38,375
Oh my god.

109
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,540
You’re not going to snitch to the teacher, are you?

110
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,208
What are you talking about?

111
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,040
How did you learn to be just like

112
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,875
Chen Jing’an?

113
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:58,665
Here, take it.

114
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,165
The school beauty really gets special treatment.

115
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:13,750
Shasha

116
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,083
Shasha

117
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,415
From now on, we'll be classmates.

118
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,125
Do you want some water?

119
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,165
No, thanks.

120
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,750
Before Nian Nian switched classes, she specifically told me

121
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:31,665
that you are her best friend.

122
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,915
She wanted us to get along well too.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,665
Really.

124
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:36,625
Really.

125
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,875
I just can't figure it out.

126
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:43,583
She was doing just fine,

127
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,000
so why did she change her major?

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,290
I asked her, but she wouldn't say.

129
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,625
Maybe she just

130
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,875
simply didn't want to study liberal arts anymore.

131
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,000
Look,

132
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,665
there are plenty of people who switch majors in the second year.

133
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:55,958
Isn't that pretty common?

134
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,333
I don't think it's that simple.

135
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,290
Lately, it seems like

136
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,208
she's always hiding something in her heart.

137
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,000
Something's off.

138
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:04,875
You...

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,790
Don't overthink it.

140
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,083
She's totally normal.

141
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,208
I'm her best friend.

142
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:11,750
I definitely know her better than you do.

143
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:16,165
At home,

144
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,333
how do you get along with Chen Changning?

145
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:24,000
We just get along as usual.

146
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:26,125
So what's he like at home?

147
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,583
Is he very different from how he is outside?

148
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,040
Let's not talk about Chen Changning anymore.

149
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,208
Let's talk about something else.

150
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,833
Then I'll ask one last question.

151
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,583
Does he like any girl?

152
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:43,958
I don't think so.

153
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,165
No, he doesn't.

154
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,540
That's great.

155
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,540
Let good things stay within the family.

156
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,540
I think Nian Nian and Chen Changning

157
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,415
are actually a good match.

158
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,250
What do you think?

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's do a good deed.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,500
Let's try to set them up.

161
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,583
It would be a shame if two such great people aren't together.

162
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,665
That would be a pity.

163
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,125
Keep your voice down.

164
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,750
Don't let others hear.

165
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,625
So it's settled then.

166
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:08,040
After all, you're Chen Changning's sister.

167
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,165
And also Nian Nian's friend.

168
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,208
You'll have plenty of chances to set them up.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We've agreed on this, okay?

170
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:23,290
Nian Nian.

171
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,665
You told Chen Jing'an you were worried about me?

172
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,875
Chen Jing'an already told me.

173
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,208
We're getting along pretty well now.

174
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,250
Nian Nian.

175
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,458
It's Chen Changning.

176
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,541
So childish.

177
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,833
I heard from Chen Jing'an

178
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,250
that you transferred to the physics class.

179
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,833
Are you getting used to it?

180
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,500
It's okay.

181
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,041
Chen Jing'an.

182
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,500
She's really something.

183
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,458
She actually helped Nian Nian and Chen Changning get together.

184
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,000
I heard from Chen Jing'an

185
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,250
that you've helped her a lot.

186
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,625
If you have anything going on at school

187
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,250
or need any help,

188
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,416
you can always let me know.

189
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,083
Senior Chen Changning,

190
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,875
our Niannian

191
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,958
switched from liberal arts to science.

192
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,541
Although she works extremely hard,

193
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,458
but

194
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,166
her foundation in physics, chemistry, and biology is still a bit weak.

195
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,875
If you have time,

196
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,791
could you help our Niannian

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,916
with some tutoring?

198
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,875
Deng Shasha, what's with you?

199
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,416
My grades are good enough to tutor him!

200
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:51,708
Niannian,

201
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,166
don't pretend to be shy at a time like this.

202
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:54,875
This is

203
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:55,833
a chance to be alone

204
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,791
and a great opportunity to build your relationship.

205
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,166
You can't miss it.

206
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,125
Forget it.

207
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,958
Chen Changning definitely won't agree.

208
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,208
Senior,

209
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,625
please think about it.

210
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:08,833
Sure.

211
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,875
Then it depends on when Zhu Niannian

212
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,500
has time.

213
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,166
This Chen Changning must be fake, right?

214
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:24,625
Senior.

215
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,416
That's how it is.

216
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,375
What about Nian Nian?

217
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,791
Her family is pretty strict.

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,208
If she wants to go out,

219
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,875
she has to tell her parents in advance.

220
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:32,875
Otherwise,

221
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,875
we'll wait until she confirms the time,

222
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,458
then we can make plans.

223
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:37,291
Okay.

224
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,291
Alright.

225
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:41,791
Nian Nian.

226
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,666
Do you think Chen Changning

227
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,833
is interested in you too?

228
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,875
Otherwise, why would he start a conversation with you?

229
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,666
But next time, you shouldn't

230
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,666
be too reserved.

231
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,708
What if he misunderstands

232
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,666
and thinks you don't want to talk to him?

233
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,333
What would you do then?

234
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,333
What nonsense are you talking about?

235
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,833
I'm being serious.

236
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,416
From my intuition,

237
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,041
he definitely likes you.

238
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,333
Impossible.

239
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,416
Nian Nian, be more confident.

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,333
You're so outstanding,

241
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,583
good-looking,

242
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,458
gentle,

243
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,625
and have great grades.

244
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,958
If he gets to know you,

245
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,375
he'll definitely like you.

246
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,083
Nian Nian.

247
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,375
Don't be shy.

248
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,291
Changning is here.

249
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,041
Come in.

250
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:31,625
Earlier, you

251
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:32,666
asked me about

252
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,000
the issue of memory exchange, right?

253
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,583
I’ve gathered some information.

254
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:36,875
Take a look.

255
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,250
Sixi Maruko

256
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,041
Yes.

257
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,000
These

258
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,083
are all from Sixi Maruko’s

259
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,125
science fiction novels.

260
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,958
I compiled some sci-fi concepts from them.

261
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,250
I think

262
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,833
some of the principles in there

263
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,458
are related to memory exchange.

264
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:58,416
See if

265
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,875
they might inspire you.

266
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,083
Although science fiction novels are fictional,

267
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,208
the knowledge points in them

268
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,541
are solid and real.

269
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,833
If you don’t believe me,

270
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,625
you can go read Sixi Maruko’s novels

271
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,708
and study them carefully.

272
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,041
Also,

273
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,958
I recommend a few movies for you to watch.

274
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,291
They’re all listed above.

275
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:21,375
Teacher,

276
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,416
this Sixi Maruko

277
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,208
isn’t that you?

278
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,083
Sorry.

279
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,375
I’ll return the book to Teacher Fan.

280
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:39,541
Okay.

281
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:45,625
Teacher Deng

282
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,250
Let him know later.

283
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,125
I left it here for him.

284
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,583
Okay, no problem.

285
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:52,916
By the way, Teacher Deng,

286
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,125
You

287
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,750
Is it really Four Happiness Meatballs?

288
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,333
Teacher Yu

289
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,666
has also read my book.

290
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,333
I've heard a little about it.

291
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:13,916
See,

292
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,125
the history teacher

293
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,666
has read the science fiction novel I wrote.

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,125
During break time,

295
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,125
you should read it carefully too.

296
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,750
It will definitely help your studies.

297
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,166
Okay.

298
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,000
Chen Jing'an

299
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,041
You're really great.

300
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,166
From now on,

301
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,583
besides Nian Nian,

302
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:46,833
you're my best friend.

303
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,208
Did something good happen to you?

304
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,250
Something amazing!

305
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,833
Thank you so much this time.

306
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:52,916
That's all I'll say.

307
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,166
The joint exam is coming up soon.

308
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,416
I'm going to study hard now.

309
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,875
Put away all the books on the table.

310
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,541
If there's no space, put them in my office.

311
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:43,750
Come on.

312
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:56,458
Hurry.

313
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:30,583
Nian Nian

314
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:31,750
Do you want me to help you?

315
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,541
No need.

316
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,791
I'm very strong.

317
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:34,416
It's fine.

318
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,000
Come here.

319
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,625
You should go back.

320
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,125
Jingan

321
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,291
The exam is over.

322
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,125
All examinees, please put down your pens immediately.

323
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,000
Zheng Chuan

324
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:29,958
Come to my place to watch a movie later.

325
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:30,958
Let's invite Chen Jing'an too.

326
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:31,833
Sure.

327
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:32,750
After three days of exams,

328
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,041
we can finally relax.

329
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,541
Got any new movies?

330
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,375
Yeah.

331
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,625
Japanese ones.

332
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:49,625
Japanese ones.

333
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:53,833
What kind?

334
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,208
You wouldn't like them.

335
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,250
They're not suitable for you.

336
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,416
Let's go find Chen Jing'an.

337
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,041
Okay.

338
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,041
Let's go.

339
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,375
I'm Chen Jing'an!

340
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,000
You won't show me the good stuff.

341
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,458
How did you do on the exams?

342
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,916
Zhang Fenglai from Class 2 made a statement.

343
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:18,916
She said she wants to surpass you.

344
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:20,916
Not bad.

345
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,375
The English reading section was a bit beyond the syllabus this time.

346
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,041
There were a lot of rare words I hadn't seen before.

347
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,250
The average score probably won't be very high.

348
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,791
The one about aerospace.

349
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,125
Last year, the US reported new achievements in aerospace.

350
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,333
It was an excerpt from a magazine article.

351
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,375
I've read it.

352
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:38,875
No way.

353
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,583
You even predicted the topic?

354
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,208
My aunt sent me the magazine.

355
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,458
I just happened to glance at it.

356
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,208
Boss.

357
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,458
Let me see it too.

358
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,041
I want to see how many points I got.

359
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:49,416
No time.

360
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,250
Where are you going?

361
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:53,833
Got something to do.

362
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,041
Tianye

363
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,583
That Korean movie last time was so boring.

364
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,291
Today's one has to be more exciting.

365
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:17,666
Don't worry.

366
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,791
The exciting part is coming up soon.

367
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,666
Look, look, the exciting part is about to start.

368
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,666
Stop pretending, stop it.

369
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,333
Come on, Zheng Chuan.

370
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,791
Can we not watch horror movies?

371
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:44,583
Stop messing around.

372
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,166
Since when have you ever been scared of horror movies?

373
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,750
Tianye

374
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,625
Is someone here at home?

375
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,041
My mom's here, my mom's here.

376
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,250
My mom's here.

377
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,000
Why is it so dark? Why didn't you turn on the lights?

378
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,166
Hello, Auntie.

379
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,541
Auntie.

380
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,333
Jing'an is here.

381
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,833
What were you two just doing?

382
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,875
Watching a movie.

383
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:19,750
At night.

384
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,875
Stay for dinner.

385
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,250
What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you.

386
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,791
No need, Auntie.

387
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,583
My brother is still at home waiting for me to eat.

388
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,166
Auntie, I have something to do too, so I'll head out.

389
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,500
Uh...

390
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,041
Wait.

391
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,125
I'll deal with you later, kid.

392
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:37,958
Jing'an

393
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,125
Hello.

394
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,375
I saw you mention in your post

395
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,083
that you've experienced a swap.

396
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,750
Yeah, that's right.

397
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,083
Do you know what triggered the swap?

398
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,708
How did you switch back in the end?

399
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,541
How long did it take to switch back?

400
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,125
Did it cause any harm to your body?

401
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,041
Big brother,

402
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,375
I was just bragging online.

403
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,416
Is it really necessary to dig so deep into this?

404
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,666
No way.

405
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,375
My son has grown up.

406
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,583
He even dares to watch those adult movies.

407
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,083
Back in the day, we were only twenty.

408
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,333
What are you saying? What are you saying?

409
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,666
Kids at sixteen or seventeen

410
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,166
are the most curious about this.

411
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,583
Your son might be the same.

412
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,750
Very curious.

413
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,666
But the key point is,

414
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,458
he even watched it with Jing'an.

415
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,583
Do you think there's something wrong with his head?

416
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,541
If you put it that way, this is kind of serious.

417
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,000
How could it not be serious?

418
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,083
You should have a good talk with him later.

419
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:20,916
What can I even say?

420
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,333
I'm an adult, talking to him about this...

421
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,125
It's not exactly comfortable.

422
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,916
It's the 21st century.

423
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,083
Why are your ideas still so old-fashioned?

424
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,291
Are you going to talk to him or not?

425
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:34,333
Talk about what?

426
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:36,791
Come here.

427
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,916
Your dad wants to talk to you.

428
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,250
Come on, come on.

429
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,458
I have something to tell you.

430
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,041
I need to talk to you.

431
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:51,833
What's up?

432
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,166
Shameless.

433
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,833
Be honest.

434
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:03,791
Say it.

435
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:09,333
Movie.

436
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,916
At your age,

437
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:13,791
watching this

438
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,166
isn't appropriate.

439
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,875
And you even watched it with Jing'an.

440
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,291
No,

441
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,291
we just watched a horror movie together.

442
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,000
Son, I've been through this.

443
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,500
Who watches horror movies so sneakily?

444
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,333
We really just watched a horror movie.

445
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:32,000
Last time,

446
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:32,625
my mom

447
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:33,916
got so scared she cried, right?

448
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,083
It's just that

449
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,333
I didn't want her to lose face in front of my classmates.

450
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,625
Do you know what time it is?

451
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,250
What are you all chatting about?

452
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:46,791
Go to bed, now.

453
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm exhausted.

454
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,416
You sold me out again, didn't you?

455
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,041
I'm going to the bathroom.

456
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:09,541
Oh my god

457
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,875
Chen Changning is first in the whole school again this time

458
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,958
Definitely Tsinghua or Peking University material

459
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,583
Don’t be jealous

460
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,875
She won the physics competition last semester

461
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,500
She’s already got a guaranteed admission

462
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,041
Nian Nian, did you hear that?

463
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,250
Chen Changning is really amazing

464
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,125
Let me check your score

465
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,083
Let’s go, let’s go

466
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,458
Look at Chen Jing’an and Zhu Nian Nian’s grades

467
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:32,916
Didn’t they just switch majors?

468
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,166
They actually made it into the top ten in the grade

469
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,916
Zhu Nian Nian is first in physics again

470
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,208
These scores are almost inhuman

471
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,541
Good-looking and good grades

472
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,375
How are we supposed to compete?

473
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,583
Nian Nian, you’re incredible too

474
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:48,833
How did you do it?

475
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,166
Keep it low-key, keep it low-key

476
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,458
You’re amazing, a perfect score

477
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,291
A hundred points

478
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:57,625
Chen Jing’an

479
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,250
Why are you here?

480
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:03,875
To celebrate, of course

481
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:05,708
Impressive, Chen Jing’an

482
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:07,666
Just switched to the liberal arts class and already scored so well

483
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:08,916
Teacher Lin in Class One

484
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,000
Keeps praising you to the skies

485
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,000
Your favorite snacks

486
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:16,416
I bought you a lot

487
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,458
Thank you

488
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:19,666
I don’t eat spicy strips

489
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,166
I mean

490
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,375
Recently

491
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,791
I’ve got pimples, so I can’t eat spicy food

492
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:30,541
It’s okay

493
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:31,250
Then

494
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:32,625
When you don’t have pimples

495
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:33,875
You can eat them again

496
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,125
You go back to the classroom first.

497
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:41,208
Thanks for the spicy snack.

498
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:41,958
Thank you, thank you.

499
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,291
Look at this new book I bought.

500
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:51,500
Thunder Assault

501
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:52,916
The writing on it is so good.

502
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,208
We are the long sword of the People's Air Force.

503
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,625
We are the shoulders of our motherland.

504
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,458
I've wanted this book for a long time.

505
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,208
The packaging isn't opened yet, don't open it for me.

506
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,458
Tian Ye

507
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:07,041
What's wrong? You look so down.

508
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,208
How many times has it been now?

509
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,708
Still can't face your own grades?

510
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,541
I feel like Chen Jing'an has no feelings for me.

511
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,625
I think I'm about to lose her as a friend.

512
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:26,083
What's wrong with you?

513
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,375
She used to ignore me before.

514
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,291
She didn't even tell me when she changed departments.

515
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,375
I just gave her

516
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,208
her favorite spicy snacks, but she didn't want them.

517
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,083
Don't feel too bad.

518
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,375
A woman's heart is impossible to fathom.

519
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,041
A forced melon

520
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,083
is never sweet.

521
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,500
Some people

522
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,291
are destined to just pass through your life.

523
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,958
I feel really upset.

524
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,166
It hurts.

525
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,541
Xinyi,

526
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,625
at the beginning of next month

527
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,208
is our school's 60th anniversary

528
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,000
celebration.

529
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,958
You're the class president of Class 8

530
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:14,125
and also the arts committee member.

531
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,333
It's a good chance to organize your classmates.

532
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,708
Prepare some talent performances.

533
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,000
I heard people from the TV station will come to record.

534
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:21,875
It's just right,

535
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,666
after the joint exams are over,

536
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:24,916
you all can relax a bit.

537
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:26,208
No problem.

538
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:26,916
Teacher.

539
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:40,916
What's wrong with you?

540
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:43,291
No.

541
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,500
I've had a friendship with Chen Jing'an for over ten years.

542
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,083
I can't just let it end like this.

543
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,250
So what can you do about it?

544
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,458
I'm going to talk to Old Lin.

545
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,125
I want to switch departments.

546
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:51,875
Dude,

547
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:52,791
don't be impulsive.

548
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,125
I've thought it through.

549
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,250
I'll just say

550
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,833
that when I saw my entrance exam results,

551
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:58,583
I reflected deeply on my failure.

552
00:27:58,833 --> 00:27:59,750
I realized

553
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,291
I'm not cut out for science.

554
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,333
Maybe

555
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,708
if I join the liberal arts class,

556
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,333
I'll have a chance to start over.

557
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,041
Looks like you're really going for it.

558
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:18,083
Chen Jing'an,

559
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,083
I didn't expect

560
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,625
you'd be so talented in liberal arts.

561
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,916
You really should have joined our class earlier.

562
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,291
But it's not too late now.

563
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:27,083
Sorry, teacher.

564
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,083
I need to borrow Chen Jing'an for a moment.

565
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:28,625
Let's go.

566
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,500
I want to tell Tian Ye about us switching places.

567
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,083
Why?

568
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:40,916
Didn't you say

569
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,666
we can't let anyone else know?

570
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,250
Tian Ye thinks I want to end our friendship.

571
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,958
He said today that he wants to transfer to the liberal arts class.

572
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:48,958
I'm about to go crazy.

573
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,125
I'm just afraid of being exposed.

574
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:54,500
That's why I didn't dare get too close to him.

575
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,208
I'm not blaming you either.

576
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:00,041
I just don't want to lose him as a friend.

577
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,541
He can be trusted.

578
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:04,958
Do you agree with me telling him?

579
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,375
If you want to tell him,

580
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:08,583
I support you.

581
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:11,375
That's fine then.

582
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:17,875
I'm leaving now.

583
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,375
Chen Jing'an.

584
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,125
Hurry to class.

585
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:32,500
Zhu Niannian.

586
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,916
You brought me here

587
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,083
for what?

588
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:40,416
Tian Ye.

589
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:42,666
What I'm about to tell you

590
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,166
you might not believe.

591
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,416
But you have to trust me.

592
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:47,708
What I say

593
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:48,916
is all true.

594
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:54,666
Actually,

595
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:00,541
I am Chen Jing'an.
