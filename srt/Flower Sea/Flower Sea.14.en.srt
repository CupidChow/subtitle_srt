=Episode 14=

3
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,150
Niannian, promise me

4
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,550
you won't

5
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,680
hide anything from me.
We must trust each other.

6
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,220
I promise.

7
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,350
I promise I'll trust you.

8
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,050
We'll be best friends forever!

9
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,160
I'm so sorry

10
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,780
that you have to come at this hour.

11
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,350
Mrs. Deng,

12
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,070
Shasha is a good girl.

13
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,900
Please stop arguing with each other.

14
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,860
Yes, Mrs. Deng.

15
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,850
Shasha was crying so hard.

16
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,930
Niannian!

17
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,150
Shasha,

18
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,440
you know me well.

19
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,460
I'm sharp-tongued but tender-hearted.

20
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,390
When I'm angry,
I just spew out harsh words.

21
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,420
Are you really mad at me?

22
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,600
I'll definitely

23
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,600
try to control myself, okay?

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,310
Family quarrels never last long.

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,660
Niannian,

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,420
call your dad and tell him to relax.

27
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,310
You can stay longer.

28
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,180
Have some fruits.

29
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,680
Thanks, Mrs. Deng.

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,740
Thanks, Mrs. Deng.

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,020
Shasha,

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,530
your dad

33
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,600
looks so into it.

34
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,680
Will he really hit the jackpot one day?

35
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,430
If I win the lottery,

36
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,680
I'll buy a new house first!

37
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,480
Maybe you should find a new wife.

38
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,720
No way.

39
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,570
You wouldn't dare.

40
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,780
Stop reading that.

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,310
Fix the pipe right away.

42
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,990
- It keeps leaking.
- Okay, okay.

43
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,530
- Look at you.
- I'll fix it right away.

44
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,590
Have some fruits.

45
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,440
Go ahead.

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,640
Hurry.

47
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,250
According to the latest forecast
from the observatory,

48
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,540
a meteor shower
initially expected at the end of the year

49
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,560
will arrive early next week.

50
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,890
Southern areas

51
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,800
will have the best views,

52
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,820
so get ready for this wonderful event.

53
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,680
It'll arrive early.

54
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,320
Next week.

55
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,720
Are you going to make a wish?

56
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,980
Yes.

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,340
If the wish you make

58
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,510
really comes true,

59
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,890
it'll be terrible.

60
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,050
Why?

61
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,480
I once made a wish upon a shooting star,

62
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,900
hoping that Deng Peng's feet

63
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,060
would become the stinkiest in the world.

64
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,970
If it really comes true,

65
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,310
it'll be a disaster.

66
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,430
Disaster!

67
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,200
Deng Shasha! Stop talking nonsense!

68
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,600
My feet don't stink! Smell them!

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,530
What do you think you're doing?

70
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,810
- Come on!
- Go away!

71
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,070
There will be a meteor shower next week.

72
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,430
Maybe we'll switch back.

73
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,730
If it really happens,

74
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,610
all of this

75
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,220
will be like a dream.

76
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,800
If we switch back,

77
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,060
we'll have to face another storm.

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,430
We'll change subjects again.

79
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,290
I'll be fine,

80
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,310
but you won't be that lucky.

81
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,990
I hope we can go through this final week

82
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,440
without any more mishaps

83
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,640
and switch back safely.

84
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,900
Niannian,

85
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,960
have you thought about

86
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,960
what you would do

87
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,660
if we couldn't switch back

88
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,520
after the meteor shower?

89
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,840
I don't know.

90
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,520
I think we'll switch back.

91
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,890
Did you read the news?

92
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,140
There will be a meteor shower next week.

93
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,130
It happened before the soul exchange.

94
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,980
At that time,

95
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,130
the meteor shower was expected
to arrive in three months,

96
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,680
but it arrived early.

97
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,430
Perhaps we can

98
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,220
switch back next week.

99
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,220
I was going to talk about this.

100
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,760
The soul exchange

101
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,010
was very likely caused by

102
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,600
the meteor shower's
magnetic field disruption.

103
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,010
I did some research.

104
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,310
Experiencing the same event

105
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,220
does give you the highest chance,

106
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,890
but it's not a certain thing,

107
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,220
so you'd better lower expectations.

108
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,430
If you can't switch back,

109
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,350
you'll be very upset.

110
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,920
If

111
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,560
we can't switch back,

112
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,640
you'll be upset too, right?

113
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,310
Yes.

114
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,730
Niannian,

115
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,180
I've been thinking about this.

116
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,050
I think we should join

117
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,430
the natural science interest group.

118
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,420
In the class,

119
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,570
Mr. Deng Hui

120
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,720
will talk about
some strange natural phenomena.

121
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,220
Maybe we can know more
about our soul exchange.

122
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,290
The meteor shower might

123
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,620
help us switch back,

124
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,140
but we must be fully prepared.

125
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,100
But Jing'an,

126
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,070
I study liberal arts.

127
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,160
It's a science group.

128
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,370
Can I join it too?

129
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,710
Of course.

130
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,490
Mr. Deng Hui is a nice person.

131
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,060
Besides,

132
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,330
Chen Changning was the one
who organized the group.

133
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,230
Mr. Deng Hui

134
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,640
is in charge of
the registration process,

135
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,560
but Chen Changning

136
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,100
is the real leader.

137
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,680
If he doesn't agree,
just try to persuade him.

138
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,690
Niannian,

139
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,850
you're Chen Jing'an now.

140
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,010
In Chen Changning's eyes,
you're his sister.

141
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,400
What if we switch back?

142
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,470
It's even better.

143
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,310
Just tell him

144
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,060
you lose interest and want to quit.

145
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,460
Didn't we agree to have no more secrets?

146
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,520
No wonder...

147
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,500
I just couldn't figure out

148
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,710
why Niannian would become
so different.

149
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,810
It turns out

150
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,560
so many strange things have happened.

151
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,890
Did it harm your body?

152
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,840
No.

153
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,970
It's such a big deal.

154
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,390
Why didn't you tell me?

155
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,810
Were you worried I'd tell others?

156
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,060
We agreed to have
no more secrets, didn't we?

157
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,730
You still don't trust me.

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,930
Shasha,

159
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,890
listen to me.

160
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,720
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

161
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,230
We woke up and found

162
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,390
we exchanged souls.

163
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,810
It was just so crazy

164
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,840
that I was worried

165
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,290
you'd be freaked out.

166
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,200
Besides,

167
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,220
we'll probably switch back
in a few days,

168
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,310
so I didn't tell you.

169
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,830
Good thing we've been friends
for a long time,

170
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,380
and I know both of you well.

171
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,410
Otherwise, I wouldn't believe you.

172
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,230
Actually,

173
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,050
we really don't want

174
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,040
more people to find out.

175
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,430
Otherwise, we might be
sent to some science lab.

176
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,810
Shasha, I'm sorry.

177
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

178
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,560
Why would this happen to you?

179
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,760
Niannian, you've had a hard time.

180
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,970
You must've been so scared.

181
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,800
So, you trusted me, didn't you?

182
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,140
You always trust me.

183
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,510
Shasha,

184
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,410
at first, I was really scared,

185
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,810
but now I'm fine.

186
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,260
This is really important.

187
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,480
Please keep the secret.

188
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,740
I wonder if the interest group

189
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,060
will talk about soul exchange.

190
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,340
But it doesn't matter.

191
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,510
We have a backup plan.

192
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,060
However, I have a strong feeling

193
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,720
that after the meteor shower,

194
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,260
we'll definitely switch back.

195
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,810
I also have a feeling

196
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,010
that we'll be able to
be ourselves again.

197
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,430
But I think I'm going to miss this.

198
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,990
Well,

199
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,780
I've been Zhu Niannian
for quite a while.

200
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,060
In the past, I never wore skirts,

201
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,930
but now I'm wearing them every day.

202
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,070
I'm really going to miss

203
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,220
all the skirts in the wardrobe,

204
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,560
this

205
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,450
soft bed,

206
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,260
and the cozy room,

207
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,240
not to mention the soup,

208
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,480
dishes,

209
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,110
and pastries your mom made.

210
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,290
I really can't

211
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,260
stand it.

212
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,550
You can come to my place anytime.

213
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,950
Okay.

214
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,860
Niannian,

215
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,350
you've stayed at my place
for a long time.

216
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,350
Is there anything you're going to miss?

217
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,070
I...

218
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,080
I think I'm going to miss...

219
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,930
Chen Changning.

220
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,020
What?

221
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,770
(Wh-What does she mean?)

222
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,090
(Does she)

223
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,190
(like Chen Changning?)

224
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,120
Hello?

225
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,980
Hello?

226
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,310
You're still up?

227
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,600
I was just talking to Jing'an.

228
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,100
You're still up.

229
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,720
I was preparing materials
for the interest group.

230
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,010
You organized the group on purpose

231
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,640
because you wanted

232
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,300
Chen Jing'an to read
the soul exchange materials

233
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,390
you've collected, right?

234
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,650
Yes.

235
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,470
You see right through me.

236
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,760
Actually, I'm a bit worried.

237
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,180
What if you can't switch back?

238
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,260
So, I can only share all my findings

239
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,810
with Chen Jing'an.

240
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,640
I can deliver the message.

241
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,810
No.

242
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,030
You don't know much about this.

243
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,680
She'll find out.

244
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,890
Actually,

245
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,410
I think

246
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,020
you can just tell her

247
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,760
that you've found out.

248
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,560
Not now.

249
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,180
What if you can switch back

250
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,720
after the meteor shower?

251
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,440
Rest early.

252
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,030
Why did you suddenly

253
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,600
hang up last night?

254
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,110
My phone died, so I went to sleep.

255
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,170
Well, did you hear

256
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,350
what I said?

257
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,980
What?

258
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,130
You asked me

259
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,310
what I'm going to miss

260
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,670
after switching back,

261
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,150
and

262
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,250
I said

263
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,720
Chen Changning.

264
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,040
Why are you going to miss him?

265
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,700
He's just a cunning fox

266
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,040
full of schemes.

267
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,620
Why-

268
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,480
Why are you going to miss him?

269
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,500
But I don't agree.

270
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,400
To me,

271
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,260
he's righteous,

272
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,150
kind,

273
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,060
handsome,

274
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,600
and outstanding,

275
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,280
and he's got that warm smile.

276
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,900
Chen Jing'an,

277
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,140
if I have feelings for him,

278
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,060
will you support me?

279
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,600
What's wrong with you?

280
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,240
Why do you have to like him?

281
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,810
I'm not joking.

282
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,790
I'm serious.

283
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,440
I've

284
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,470
liked him

285
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,530
for 418 days.

286
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,060
The summer before grade 10,

287
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,060
my mom took me here to get enrolled,

288
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,510
and

289
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,810
Chen Changning
was a student union volunteer.

290
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,410
I've had

291
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,970
a crush on him since that time.

292
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,360
However, I didn't have the courage
to get close to him,

293
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,100
so I just kept my distance.

294
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,940
To my surprise,

295
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,300
a miracle came,

296
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,290
and we exchanged our souls.

297
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,420
I became

298
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,010
someone who can stay with him every day.

299
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,180
At first, my feelings for him were just

300
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,990
a beautiful fantasy for youth,

301
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,170
but after spending a few days with him,

302
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,220
I realized

303
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,820
I really like him,

304
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,100
and I want to get into
a relationship with him.

305
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,430
I want to give it a shot this time.

306
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,310
Jing'an,

307
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,810
do you think he'll like me?

308
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,600
How can you date someone in high school?

309
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,990
Then after we switch back,

310
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,050
after I get into college,

311
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,880
can you help me pursue Chen Changning?

312
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,520
We haven't switched back.

313
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,930
Let's wait until then.

314
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,480
Jing'an...

315
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,410
Do you think

316
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,290
Chen Changning has been

317
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,640
a bit close to the fake Zhu Niannian?

318
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,600
Is it possible that he likes her?

319
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,440
No way.

320
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,680
Niannian is just acting as his sister.

321
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,850
Of course he'd help her.

322
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,670
No.

323
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,220
You're wrong.

324
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,850
Chen Changning

325
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,430
doesn't know you exchanged souls.

326
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,180
Now you're Zhu Niannian.

327
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,300
Chen Jing'an isn't the one

328
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,310
who's being mocked by others.

329
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Do you get it?

330
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,260
The person Chen Changning

331
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,140
is trying to protect

332
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,810
is not you

333
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,520
but Zhu Niannian,

334
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,560
the real owner

335
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,600
of this body.

336
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,680
Are you blind or something?

337
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,560
What's wrong with her?

338
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,310
Want to go to the snack shop?

339
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
I heard

340
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,640
their new ice cream flavor

341
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,800
is amazing.

342
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,010
Not interested. I'm not going.

343
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,990
Why do you look so upset?

344
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,130
You can come with me
and watch me eat it.

345
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,480
I'm not going! Leave me alone!

346
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,680
So annoying.

347
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,760
(She looks angry)

348
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,000
(and upset)

349
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,970
(and doesn't want to move.)

350
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,100
Fine, I'm going anyway.

351
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,190
Do you need me

352
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,220
to buy anything for you?

353
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,100
Got it.

354
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,930
You don't study sciences,

355
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,610
but you get physics tutoring
on weekends.

356
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,180
Isn't it bad for your studies?

357
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,680
Just one weekend.

358
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,640
We'll switch back next week,

359
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,640
and I'll talk to Mr. Deng.

360
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,180
He's a nice person and will understand.

361
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,390
It's not just for Chen Jing'an, right?

362
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,310
You want to see Chen Changning,
don't you?

363
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,250
What are you talking about?

364
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,830
No secrets, remember?

365
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,690
Why are you still hiding it?

366
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,070
I knew it!

367
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,100
You must be
more into Chen Changning now!

368
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,150
In the past, I could only
watch him from a distance,

369
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,060
but now it's different.

370
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,220
We can spend time together every day.

371
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,180
I want to create
more beautiful memories of us

372
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,130
so that after graduation,

373
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,060
I'll have the courage
to confess my feelings.

374
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,970
Go for it.

375
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,220
I'll try to set you up with him.

376
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,350
Have some hot water.

377
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,100
What for?

378
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,170
I bought something you need.

379
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,850
What?

380
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,720
A whole pack is too big.

381
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,930
I was embarrassed

382
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,820
and couldn't carry it,

383
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,890
so I opened the package
and hid them on me.

384
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,790
Didn't know you'd be embarrassed.

385
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,600
Come on, grab a piece

386
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,760
and go to the bathroom.

387
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,450
The latest forecast shows

388
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,870
that the meteor shower

389
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,180
will arrive tonight

390
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,260
as expected

391
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,430
in the southern areas.

392
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,910
And

393
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,760
hundreds of meteors

394
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,220
will streak across the sky.

395
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,430
It's really rare to see

396
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,760
two meteor showers

397
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,010
in such a short time.

398
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,630
Mom, take a break.

399
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,510
Leave it to me.

400
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,640
Stop pretending. I'm done with it.

401
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,750
Go to your room and study.

402
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,890
Mom, just let me help you.

403
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,340
I want to do something for you.

404
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,140
Thank you for cooking for me every day.

405
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,940
Hey,

406
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,760
what's wrong with you?

407
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,390
I'm your mother.

408
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,630
Why are you being so polite?

409
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,140
Just don't cause trouble all the time.

410
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,930
Hurry, get out.

411
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:38,980
Go!

412
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,720
(Maybe I won't have the chance
to make you mad.)

413
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,150
Dad,

414
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,840
thank you for picking me up
after school.

415
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,770
Thanks.

416
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,870
Niannian, you're so sweet today.

417
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,150
Have an apple.

418
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,400

liked you

What are you doing?

446
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,060
I knitted

447
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,880
this scarf for you.

448
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,510
Maybe I won't be here tomorrow.

449
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,970
So, this is my goodbye gift.

450
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,140
Thank you

451
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,260
for taking care of me.

452
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,310
Did you knit it yourself?

453
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,350
You can

454
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,970
wear it in winter.

455
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,650
Thanks.

456
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,370
Living as Jing'an for a month

457
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,140
left me so many beautiful memories.

458
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,680
It was like a dream.

459
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:52,920
I hope

460
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,800
we can still be friends

461
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,100
after Jing'an and I switch back.

462
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,270
Wait a minute.

463
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,980
I've also prepared

464
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,900
this for you.

465
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,010
I-I will cherish it.

466
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,980
By the way,

467
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,460
if

468
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,970
I wake up and find

469
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,470
we've switched back,

470
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,600
I won't be able to take this pen.

471
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,210
Remember to tell Jing'an

472
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,100
to take it to school,

473
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,100
okay?

474
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,270
Okay.

475
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,440
Thanks.

476
