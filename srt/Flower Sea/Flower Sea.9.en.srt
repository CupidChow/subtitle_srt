1
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:09,500
Actually,

2
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,375
I am Chen Jing'an.

3
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,291
She says she's Chen Jing'an.

4
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,375
Zhu Niannian,

5
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,083
today isn't April Fool's Day.

6
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,166
Don't laugh.

7
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,291
I'm being very serious with you.

8
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,291
I really am Chen Jing'an.

9
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,333
Did you and Chen Jing'an

10
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,000
lose at Truth or Dare?

11
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,416
Think about it carefully.

12
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,666
Do you think the current Chen Jing'an

13
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,041
is the same as the old Chen Jing'an?

14
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:46,875
Do you remember last time

15
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,500
when Li Minqiu hit her on the head with a basketball?

16
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:50,416
Would something like that

17
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,291
ever happen to me, Chen Jing'an?

18
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:54,750
The two of us

19
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,750
swapped places.

20
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,791
You two really made up a complete story.

21
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:09,875
Are you forcing me to use my ultimate move?

22
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,875
When you were in eighth grade,

23
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,041
You had a fight with your mom and ran away from home.

24
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,500
You even took your family’s bicycle.

25
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:20,582
And then?

26
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:22,250
You broke your leg halfway there.

27
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,041
You ended up in the hospital.

28
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,332
When I went to visit you at the hospital,

29
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,875
you were sobbing your heart out,

30
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:27,457
crying as you told me

31
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,791
that your mom didn’t understand you.

32
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,832
You even hugged me while crying,

33
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:31,500
saying

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,041
I must never tell anyone about your embarrassing moment.

35
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,082
Would I ever lie to you

36
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,291
and tell others about this?

37
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,625
I swore a solemn oath.

38
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:38,416
Wait a second.

39
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,332
Wait.

40
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,541
Wait, wait, wait.

41
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,250
Hold on.

42
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,000
Let me catch my breath.

43
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:44,916
Let me catch my breath first.

44
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:47,916
Let me catch my breath first.

45
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:01,291
Hurry up and write.

46
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:01,916
Let me copy it when you're done.

47
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:04,041
I don't know how to write it.

48
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:05,332
Go.

49
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,541
We're not afraid of him.

50
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,166
You'll definitely beat him this time too.

51
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:11,250
What's going on between you and Zhu Niannian?

52
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,291
You've really been acting more and more like her lately.

53
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:15,416
Don't touch my hair.

54
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,457
Come with me to the bathroom.

55
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:19,541
I just transferred here.

56
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,791
I thought you were Deng Shasha.

57
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:21,416
Sorry.

58
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,625
You won't snitch to the teacher, will you?

59
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:25,666
How did you end up acting just like...

60
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,416
...Chen Jing'an?

61
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,666
You really are...

62
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,791
...Chen Jing'an turned into...

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,875
...Zhu Niannian.

64
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,916
I'm not dreaming, am I?

65
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,457
Does this hurt?

66
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:47,582
It hurts.

67
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:50,207
So what's really going on?

68
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:51,207
Keep your voice down.

69
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:54,125
You guys didn't...

70
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,041
...go through some supernatural event, did you?

71
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:57,125
Don't talk nonsense.

72
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,000
There must be...

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,582
...some scientific explanation for this.

74
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,750
We just haven't figured out the reason yet.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,625
About this...

76
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,750
I'm only telling you.

77
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:07,207
Only the three of us know.

78
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:08,791
You can't tell anyone.

79
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,207
I'm only telling you because we're close.

80
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,082
Don't worry.

81
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,875
I'd never betray my buddies, not even if you beat me to death.

82
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:19,750
Good brother.

83
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,540
Good morning, everyone.

84
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,250
Embrace the spring breeze and raise your ambitions.

85
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,415
Celebrate our glorious years.

86
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,790
We are about to welcome

87
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,040
the 60th anniversary of Nancheng No. 2 High School.

88
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,375
The city TV station will send a crew to film.

89
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,040
To showcase the spirit of our students,

90
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,000
the school

91
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,000
will organize a host selection event for the anniversary.

92
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,415
Interested students can

93
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,415
go to the student council office

94
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,708
to sign up before Wednesday.

95
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,790
The TV station is coming to record.

96
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,250
Doesn't that mean we can be on TV?

97
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,040
Yeah.

98
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
If you become the host,

99
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,875
your parents can see you on TV at home.

100
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,583
Forget about hosting.

101
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,958
You have to be good-looking and eloquent to get chosen.

102
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:03,875
I think this time

103
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,250
it'll probably be Zhu Niannian.

104
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:06,125
As for her,

105
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:08,083
she's just good-looking.

106
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,290
When it comes to eloquence,

107
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,915
the winner of the last speech contest

108
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,540
wasn't it Liu Xinyi?

109
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,458
Exactly.

110
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,290
I think it's her.

111
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,000
I think so too.

112
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,125
No, I think it's her.

113
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,290
She's just good-looking.

114
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,083
Stop sighing.

115
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:41,665
After all, you are

116
00:05:41,665 --> 00:05:43,540
one of the most famous beautiful teachers at school.

117
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,750
What's wrong with asking you to perform on stage?

118
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,625
They're all students.

119
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,165
How could I possibly do that?

120
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,375
Besides, I'm a history teacher.

121
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,750
I don't have any special talents.

122
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,333
Do you want me to

123
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,290
go up there and perform

124
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,250
by reciting the Records of the Grand Historian?

125
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:01,915
Stop laughing.

126
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,458
Hurry up and help me think of something.

127
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,250
How about

128
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:06,790
you go on stage

129
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,540
and do a Hanfu fashion show?

130
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
A Hanfu fashion show?

131
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,790
That's even more embarrassing.

132
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,083
What's so embarrassing about that?

133
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,625
Just pretend you're giving a lecture.

134
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,833
Take a few steps and come down.

135
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,290
Excuse me.

136
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:20,790
Niannian.

137
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,290
Are you here to see Teacher Shi?

138
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,083
I asked her to come.

139
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:24,875
Zhu Niannian,

140
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:26,415
the school anniversary is coming up soon.

141
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,915
About the play "Romeo and Juliet,"

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,833
are you okay with it?

143
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,833
A play?

144
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Why is there a play to perform too?

145
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,665
Zhu Niannian never told me about this.

146
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,415
Tian Ye already knows

147
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:42,500
about us switching places.

148
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,040
He promised he wouldn't tell anyone.

149
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:44,875
So don't worry.

150
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:47,665
And also,

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,583
I originally planned during the school anniversary

152
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,290
to perform with Tian Ye

153
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,665
in their song and dance show.

154
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,665
But suddenly, Teacher Shi came to me

155
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,290
and asked me to act in some play.

156
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,915
I didn't really know what was going on at the time,

157
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,083
so I didn't dare say anything.

158
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,165
Well,

159
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,540
the play shouldn't be

160
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
a very important thing, right?

161
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,500
No,

162
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,625
this play

163
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,708
was something Teacher Shi asked me about

164
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,333
during last semester's arts performance.

165
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,500
I agreed to do it.

166
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:10,790
Actually, I'm not that interested

167
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,290
in acting in plays.

168
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,415
It's just that

169
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
I couldn't refuse the teacher at the time.

170
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:16,750
That's good, then.

171
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,000
I thought

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,665
it was like the last speech contest,

173
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,040
where if I messed up, I'd be done for.

174
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,333
Since that's the case,

175
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:25,125
I'll just find a way to turn it down.

176
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:25,875
But

177
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:27,875
I've already promised Teacher Shi.

178
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Wouldn't it be a bit bad to back out now?

179
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,125
It's not that important anyway.

180
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,083
Even if I don't act,

181
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,375
they'll just find someone else to do it.

182
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
It's fine, right?

183
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,375
Besides,

184
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,500
even though I'm pretending to be you,

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,915
I can't possibly

186
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:40,625
do everything

187
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,125
exactly the way you would have.

188
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,290
As long as it doesn't cause any trouble,

189
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,040
I think

190
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,665
I have the right to choose what to do

191
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,833
and what not to do.

192
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:49,790
You do too.

193
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:50,708
After all,

194
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,415
we don't know

195
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:52,750
when we'll be able to switch back.

196
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,125
What do you think?

197
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:55,875
I think what you said makes sense.

198
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,165
Actually,

199
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm also planning to use your identity

200
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,083
to enter the host selection competition.

201
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,665
Wouldn't everyone be scared to death?

202
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:04,875
Chen Jing'an as the host—

203
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,041
Help!

204
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,833
How did I end up standing here?

205
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,541
What's that shining in the window?

206
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,125
That's the east.

207
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,750
Juliet is the sun.

208
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,083
Rise,

209
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,458
beautiful sun,

210
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,000
and drive away the jealous moon.

211
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,291
Does that guy down there have to be so dramatic?

212
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,791
Romeo, oh Romeo

213
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Why must you be

214
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,208
Romeo

215
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,125
He’s not a foot

216
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,250
He’s not a hand

217
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,041
He’s not a nose or a face

218
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,333
What is he then

219
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,125
Juliet

220
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,250
You said the wrong line

221
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,291
I can’t remember

222
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,291
Say the next line

223
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,708
Then I’ll do as you say

224
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,708
As long as you call me for love again

225
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,916
Then I’ll be baptized again

226
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,458
And renamed

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,250
From now on

228
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,041
I’ll no longer be called Romeo

229
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,500
What’s the next line

230
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,166
Who are you

231
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:02,750
You are

232
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,083
From Inner Mongolia

233
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,250
Why are you standing here

234
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,708
Romeo

235
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,125
Stop, stop, stop

236
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,500
Zhu Nian Nian

237
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,500
Are you even memorizing your lines

238
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,208
Is that Inner Mongolia

239
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,000
That’s Montague

240
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,708
Teacher

241
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,333
I think this is too hard

242
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,958
I really can’t remember it

243
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,916
Zhu Niannian, what are you doing?

244
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,125
You can't remember your lines.

245
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,541
And you ruined the props again.

246
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,041
Teacher.

247
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,708
I really can't remember them.

248
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,625
Niannian.

249
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:53,458
Ms. Shi.

250
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,208
Didn't I tell you to memorize them a long time ago?

251
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,000
If you perform like this at the school anniversary,

252
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,500
everyone will laugh at you.

253
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,250
Teacher.

254
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,416
No more excuses.

255
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,625
Let's leave it at that for now.

256
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,208
Go back and memorize them properly.

257
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,958
Next time we'll rehearse the whole thing.

258
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,291
Niannian.

259
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,250
Memorize them well, I believe in you.

260
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,250
You can do it.

261
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,291
Teacher.

262
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,250
It's okay, senior.

263
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,708
I think you did really well just now.

264
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,833
I even felt

265
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,333
it was like a real Juliet standing there.

266
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,000
Um...

267
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,291
Senior Zhu Niannian.

268
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,625
Let me introduce myself.

269
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,875
I'm Wang Lihong from Class 1, Grade 10.

270
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,541
Can I add you on QQ?

271
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,500
What's wrong?

272
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,166
Chen Jing'an.

273
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,916
I heard that when you were acting in the play,

274
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,208
Teacher Shi got angry.

275
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,541
It's nothing serious.

276
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,375
I didn't want to act in the first place.

277
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,875
So I didn't even memorize the lines.

278
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,208
Chen Jing'an.

279
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,708
Why don't you just act properly?

280
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,083
Stop going against the teacher.

281
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Acting in a play is much easier than taking an exam.

282
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,416
Just treat it as

283
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,166
an after-class relaxation activity.

284
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,250
What do you mean I'm going against the teacher?

285
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,916
You were the one who said before

286
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,250
that you didn't want to act in the play either.

287
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,041
So,

288
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,041
whatever she tells you to do,

289
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,166
you just have to do it?

290
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,666
Don't you have your own thoughts?

291
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,000
Why are you acting like a puppet?

292
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,250
That's really living without any sense of self.

293
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:29,458
I...

294
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,125
Maybe I was a bit harsh, but I...

295
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:32,958
I get it.

296
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,041
Now I'm not even allowed to have a temper.

297
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,083
What's wrong with you?

298
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,208
Say something, what's wrong with you?

299
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,083
Sit down.

300
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,416
Alright, everyone, quiet down.

301
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:20,916
Today,

302
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,500
we have a new student in our class.

303
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,583
Let's have the new student introduce themselves.

304
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,541
Everyone, please give a round of applause.

305
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:33,500
Hello, everyone.

306
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,833
My name is Li Minqiu.

307
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,375
From now on, call me Brother Qiu.

308
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,625
I've got your backs.

309
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,333
Brother Qiu? Seriously?

310
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,208
Come on, come on.

311
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,708
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

312
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,750
Enough with the Brother Qiu stuff.

313
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,958
From now on, we're all classmates.

314
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,416
Everyone, study hard.

315
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,791
Don't cause any trouble.

316
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,791
Go ahead.

317
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:53,958
Teacher.

318
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,625
There's an empty seat over there. Can I sit there?

319
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,166
Sure.

320
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,791
Niannian is a good student.

321
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:03,625
From now on,

322
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,666
ask Niannian for help more often.

323
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:05,625
Niannian,

324
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,041
help the new student out.

325
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:12,833
Alright, everyone.

326
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,583
Turn your books to page twenty-eight.

327
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,125
Niannian,

328
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:15,708
Surprised?

329
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:46,958
I didn't expect this.

330
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,583
I came to sign up and even got to see Chen Changning.

331
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,416
Even if I don't get chosen, it's still worth it.

332
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,375
Girls,

333
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,208
Pay attention when you're filling out your information.

334
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,041
Your eyes,

335
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,375
don't let them wander elsewhere.

336
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,833
You're here to sign up for the host selection,

337
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,458
not to check out handsome guys.

338
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,166
Chen Jing'an,

339
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,750
you're signing up too?

340
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,291
Before,

341
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,166
I've never seen you join

342
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,708
these kinds of school art events.

343
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,291
I just

344
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,583
suddenly got interested in hosting.

345
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,916
So I wanted to give it a try.

346
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,333
Try it?

347
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,333
I suggest you don't.

348
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,375
Look,

349
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,000
so many people are signing up.

350
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,666
The competition is fierce.

351
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,250
If you're just here for fun,

352
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,166
you'll probably get eliminated.

353
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,375
But if you don't try,

354
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,916
how will you know the outcome?

355
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,041
The outcome?

356
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm definitely going to win first place.

357
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:39,666
In a competition,

358
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,583
don't count on luck.

359
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:42,708
Otherwise,

360
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,708
you won't even know how embarrassing it is

361
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:44,750
when you lose.

362
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,625
Have you heard of a dark horse?

363
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:49,875
Yes,

364
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,750
someone no one expects to win,

365
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,416
but suddenly surprises everyone.

366
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:55,750
That's thanks to

367
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,833
those who didn't believe in you.

368
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,208
Such a protective brother.

369
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:23,958
Nian Nian

370
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,708
Do you want some candy?

371
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,166
I’m not eating anymore.

372
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,041
Do you like candy?

373
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,000
You ate my candy.

374
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,208
Switch seats with me.

375
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,125
You already ate it.

376
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:51,583
I didn’t eat it.

377
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,541
Don’t bully my deskmate.

378
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:03,708
Nian Nian

379
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,250
You always took my side when we were kids.

380
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:10,916
Nian Nian

381
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,916
Let’s go to the cafeteria to eat.

382
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,000
Tian Ye is coming too.

383
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,625
I’ll go too.

384
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,625
Alright, alright.

385
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:32,541
Li Minqiu

386
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,291
Didn’t you already graduate?

387
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,583
Why are you suddenly studying at No. 2 High School?

388
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,833
I didn’t do well on the college entrance exam last year.

389
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,208
My grandpa wasn’t satisfied.

390
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,666
He insists I’m college material.

391
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,666
He made me repeat a year.

392
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,833
At first, I thought repeating was pointless.

393
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,875
But now it’s different.

394
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,083
To tell you the truth,

395
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,125
I came here for someone this time.

396
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:57,791
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

397
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,583
Stop being so nosy and eat your food.

398
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:08,750
By the way, Chen,

399
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,416
Zhu Niannian,

400
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:14,583
Um,

401
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,208
how's your dance practice going?

402
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The school anniversary is about to start registering performances.

403
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,750
No problem at all, don't worry.

404
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,458
What dance?

405
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,583
What school anniversary?

406
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,166
You just got here, so you don't know.

407
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,291
No. 2 High School.

408
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,500
We're about to have our 60th anniversary celebration.

409
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,166
Every class can put on a performance.

410
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,166
Zhu Niannian and I

411
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,208
plan to do an exciting song and dance.

412
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,333
We want to get the whole crowd hyped.

413
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,625
Two people aren't enough to get everyone excited.

414
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,500
Count me in.

415
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,916
Sure, no problem.

416
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,583
Hurry up, hurry up!

417
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,416
Come on, come on!

418
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,875
Keep going!

419
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,083
You can do it!

420
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,041
Go for it!

421
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,541
Keep it up!

422
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,291
Go!

423
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:33,875
Keep going!

424
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,625
Speed up, speed up! Hurry!

425
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,250
Come on!

426
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,541
Keep it up!

427
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:43,875
Go!

428
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,000
Keep going!

429
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,041
Hurry up!

430
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,208
Go!

431
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,458
Seven.

432
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:54,666
Keep going!

433
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,416
Twenty-five.

434
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,166
Niannian, what about mine?

435
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,541
Yours is over here, take it yourself.

436
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:14,416
Tian Ye,

437
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:15,375
come here.

438
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:21,958
You go.

439
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:22,625
Help Xiao Pang.

440
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,208
Run with him.

441
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,625
Why does it have to be me?

442
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,541
You're the sports committee member.

443
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,125
You have to be responsible for your classmates.

444
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:28,958
Go quickly.

445
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:30,708
Hurry up.

446
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,625
Go, Tian Ye!

447
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,000
Go, Tian Ye!

448
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,500
Tian Ye.

449
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,291
You know, this Tian Ye

450
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,208
really is a responsible PE class representative.

451
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,500
Keep going!

452
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:42,458
He...

453
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,166
Yeah.

454
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,083
Just half a lap left.

455
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,208
Keep it up!

456
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Can you go any faster?

457
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,083
Yes.

458
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,125
I'll run with you.

459
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,375
Try your best to keep up.

460
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,333
Tian Ye.

461
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,166
Thank you.

462
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Do you eat ice cream every year?

463
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,583
Thanks.

464
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,125
What about mine?

465
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,125
Don't you already have water?

466
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,166
Nian Nian

467
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,458
How did you prepare this time?

468
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,750
Today, all of us

469
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,000
will go on stage and rehearse once.

470
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:23,875
Sorry, teacher.

471
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,083
I didn't prepare.

472
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:26,958
What?

473
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,041
You're telling me now that you didn't prepare?

474
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:30,500
Do you want everyone

475
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,750
to wait until you're ready?

476
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,250
Do you still want to perform or not?

477
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,625
I don't want to perform.

478
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Nian Nian, what are you saying?

479
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,208
What's wrong with you?

480
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,000
Does anyone want to play Juliet?

481
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,291
Me.

482
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,750
Teacher, can I play a cross-gender role?

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,875
Did you see that?

484
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,541
If you don't play Juliet,

485
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,833
there are many people who want to.

486
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,375
When something is entrusted to you,

487
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,750
you need to learn to take responsibility.

488
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,291
This is the minimum respect

489
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,666
for others and for yourself.

490
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:55,791
Look at them.

491
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,791
Even if they're playing supporting roles,

492
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,125
even if they're just background with no lines,

493
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,750
they're all working harder than you.

494
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,375
I'll give you one last chance.

495
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,375
Think about it carefully.

496
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,750
Understood, teacher.

497
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,000
Nian Nian

498
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,333
What’s going on with you?

499
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,541
You already agreed to all of this before.

500
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,000
Why are you suddenly backing out?

501
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:49,958
Teacher

502
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,416
I’m sorry.

503
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,708
Don’t apologize to me.

504
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,583
This play is the result of Teacher Shi’s hard work.

505
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,166
She has such high hopes for you.

506
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,708
If you back out now,

507
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,000
won’t you let her down?

508
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,458
Teacher

509
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:06,666
Let me think about it.

510
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,166
Don’t make a decision you’ll regret.

511
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,250
Act

512
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:27,500
Don’t act

513
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:29,666
Act

514
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:31,250
Don’t act

515
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,083
Don’t act

516
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,000
Act

517
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,541
It seems this is fate.

518
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:47,541
Then I’ll

519
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,791
reluctantly

520
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:49,333
take the role.

521
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:56,916
Not eating.

522
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,791
Not eating.

523
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,166
What's wrong?

524
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,416
From now on, I need to focus on rehearsing for the play.

525
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:04,958
I can't perform in the show with you anymore.

526
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:05,958
What?

527
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,375
Keep your voice down.

528
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,458
I knew there was something else going on.

529
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,666
It can't be anything good.

530
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:14,250
Tian Ye.

531
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,083
What's wrong with you?

532
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:17,416
Zhu Niannian.

533
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:18,958
She's going to rehearse for the play.

534
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:19,958
Before, we

535
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:21,458
carefully planned a song and dance show.

536
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,666
Now it's going to fall apart.

537
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:23,833
Song and dance show?

538
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Do you still need people?

539
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:26,791
How about me?

540
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:28,875
You?

541
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:30,833
I think he could work.

542
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,333
Dudu is so cute and chubby.

543
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:33,625
That contrast is adorable.

544
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:40,625
Zhu Niannian.

545
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,625
I was too harsh last time.

546
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,500
It was my fault.

547
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,375
I apologize to you.

548
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,791
Please don't be mad at me anymore.

549
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:50,250
What about the play?

550
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:52,083
I've decided to act in it too.

551
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,333
But...

552
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,750
When it comes to acting in plays,

553
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,291
I don't have much

554
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:57,625
experience.

555
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,541
So could you teach me

556
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:00,916
how to act?

557
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:08,458
No.

558
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,541
Saying it like this makes me lose face.

559
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,208
Zhu Niannian,

560
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,291
I was wrong to speak so harshly last time.

561
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:18,916
I apologize to you.

562
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:20,125
You...

563
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:21,708
Please don't be mad at me anymore.

564
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,000
Also,

565
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,250
about the play...

566
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,375
I've decided to take the role.

567
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,375
You don't need to thank me.

568
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,583
It's what I should do.

569
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:30,791
But,

570
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,625
for the sake of your reputation,

571
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:33,958
you have to

572
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:34,875
teach me

573
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,583
how to act in this play.

574
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,625
No, saying it like this sounds way too arrogant.

575
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:53,916
Chen Jing'an,

576
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:55,833
Chen Jing'an,

577
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,000
I know you're under a lot of stress.

578
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,875
But you mustn't let it get to you.

579
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:03,458
You really mustn't let it get to you.

580
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:09,541
Chen Changning,

581
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,625
Can you go to the print shop with me?

582
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,583
I want to print out the script for Romeo and Juliet.

583
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:16,583
Print it out.

584
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,041
Why print the script?

585
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,666
Chen Jing'an is helping me with the play.

586
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,625
But she's run into some trouble.

587
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,833
I want to help her.

588
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:26,458
Acting in a play?

589
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:27,666
She's playing Juliet.

590
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:30,833
Someone like Chen Jing'an

591
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,083
is only suited for comedy.

592
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:34,583
Let's go.

593
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:05,958
Is this play hard to perform?

594
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,458
Jing'an doesn't have any experience acting in plays.

595
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,416
This play also has a lot of lines.

596
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,875
She has to memorize all of them.

597
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,750
And she also needs to put emotion into it.

598
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,750
That's pretty challenging for her.

599
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:17,958
But

600
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,458
I'll make good notes.

601
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,625
I'll do my best to help her.

602
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:24,750
Let me help Chen Jing'an rehearse.

603
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,916
If you help Chen Jing'an with the male lines,

604
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:29,916
she'll get distracted.

605
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,166
Compared to you,

606
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,625
my rehearsing with her will be much more efficient.

607
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,583
She's acting in your role.

608
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,250
You don't want her to mess up, right?

609
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,750
But

610
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,958
How should I tell Chen Jing'an?

611
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:45,750
No need to say anything.

612
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:47,416
I'll just go over there.

613
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,791
Alright.

614
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,125
Thanks.

615
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,125
I was just thinking,

616
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,708
Jing'an is really lucky to have a brother like you.

617
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,291
You did all of this.

618
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,416
There are also some lines I recorded in here.

619
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,666
If you can't control your emotions,

620
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:36,916
you can refer to this.

621
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,250
Isn't this my Walkman?

622
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,291
What?

623
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,416
Are you afraid I'll embarrass you by using your identity?

624
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:47,458
Yes.

625
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,833
You already embarrassed me at the last speech contest.

626
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:51,875
No matter what you say this time,

627
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,208
you can't mess up the competition.

628
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:53,958
Do you understand?

629
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,375
You really don't trust me that much?

630
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,958
You think I can't do anything right, don't you?

631
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,208
Jing'an,

632
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,416
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

633
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,750
This isn't something you're good at anyway.

634
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:04,333
Just do your best.

635
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:05,875
Besides,

636
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,250
this was supposed to be my responsibility.

637
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:09,625
The fact that you can help me

638
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,208
already makes me very grateful.

639
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:13,875
You're welcome.

640
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:17,375
Actually,

641
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:19,375
what you said to me last time,

642
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,791
I've thought about it carefully.

643
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:23,000
Many times,

644
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,125
I really don't know how to refuse others.

645
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:26,541
And I'm afraid to

646
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,875
express my true feelings.

647
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,208
I'll try to change that little by little.

648
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,250
Actually,

649
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,666
I was wrong too.

650
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,125
At that time,

651
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,083
I was only thinking about myself.

652
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,583
I didn't consider your feelings at all.

653
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:41,666
I'm sorry.

654
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:43,583
It's okay.

655
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:45,541
So,

656
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:47,208
does this mean we've made up?

657
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,916
I wasn't really mad at you anyway.

658
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,500
What I said back then was just out of anger.

659
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:54,708
I regretted it as soon as I said it.

660
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,208
Let's rehearse our lines together after school.

661
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,708
At the next rehearsal,

662
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:00,250
let's surprise everyone.

663
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:00,916
Okay.

664
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,625
Chen Jing'an, how far have you gotten with your script?

665
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,333
I've only written half.

666
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,250
Nian Nian has a lot of hosting experience.

667
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,625
Let's go find her after school.

668
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:19,666
Have her take a look at your script.

669
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,000
She can share some of her experience with you.

670
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,541
She's right.

671
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,000
You really should ask Zhu Nian Nian for help.

672
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,625
That way, it'll be more interesting to compete with you.

673
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,333
No need.

674
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,041
I can write it myself.

675
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,125
You're just an amateur newbie.

676
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,750
Why aren't you more open to advice?

677
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:37,708
Chen Jing'an.

678
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,083
With Nian Nian guiding you,

679
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,958
you might even get a good ranking.

680
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:43,416
Okay.

681
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,291
I'll go find her later then.

682
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:47,833
Then let her know for me.

683
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:48,666
Whether it's her

684
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:49,791
or her student,

685
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,166
I'm sure to win.

686
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:56,208
Don't worry about her.

687
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,500
Just focus on writing your script.

688
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,208
I'll go find Nian Nian next period.

689
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,166
I'll let her know.

690
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:02,041
Ask her to help you review it after school.

691
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,291
And give you some suggestions.

692
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:05,166
Actually,

693
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,583
we have a rehearsal for the play after school.

694
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,458
Just the two of you?

695
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:11,708
Yeah.

696
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,250
Can I join you?

697
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,208
Probably not.

698
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,208
Nian Nian only asked me to go.

699
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:46,541
Looks like

700
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:48,333
I've completely fallen out of favor.

701
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,291
Do you love me?

702
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:03,625
I know you'll definitely say yes.

703
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,541
My dear, gentle Romeo.

704
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:07,750
If you truly love me,

705
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,625
then tell me sincerely.

706
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:16,666
Why are you here?

707
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:18,958
I'm here to rehearse.

708
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:21,583
Rehearse what?

709
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,041
Romeo and Juliet.

710
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,416
Chen Jing'an invited me to come and act with you.

711
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,250
Then why didn't she tell me?

712
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,541
Maybe she forgot.

713
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,541
Then wait for her to come.

714
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,375
And have her tell you again.

715
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,416
Forget it.

716
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,208
It's better to have someone to act with than no one.

717
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,375
Then you play the male role.

718
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:50,625
Read lines with me.

719
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:51,583
Okay.

720
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,708
Don't deny that you love me in front of him.

721
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm willing to admit in front of you that I love him.

722
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:07,875
Your emotions here aren't right.

723
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:10,166
This isn't how Juliet would speak.

724
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:11,583
It's too harsh.

725
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,416
But she's being forced into marriage right now.

726
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,875
She loves Romeo so much.

727
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,208
And Paris is so annoying, isn't he?

728
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,291
Can't she be a little harsh?

729
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,833
Juliet is a noble lady.

730
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:26,916
Even if she resists the engagement,

731
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,791
she wouldn't act so rude.

732
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,000
Then what's the point of acting it out?

733
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:32,333
When facing someone you really dislike,

734
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,625
you still have to be polite.

735
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,041
If the audience doesn't feel frustrated, I do.

736
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,750
So for you,

737
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:39,750
if you're rude to someone,

738
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:41,916
it's because you dislike them?

739
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:42,791
What else could it be?

740
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:43,750
Should I stand in front of him and say,

741
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,625
"I like you"?

742
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:48,583
Why are you telling me this?

743
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,750
Aren't we discussing the script?

744
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,291
An'an, you finally made it.

745
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:57,583
Why did you call your brother here?

746
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,458
He just gives random directions and makes things worse.

747
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,583
Sorry.

748
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,833
But Tian Ye and the others are also rehearsing.

749
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,375
I had no choice but to ask him.

750
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,625
I’m not blaming you.

751
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:12,583
It’s just that—

752
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:14,125
When he plays Romeo like that and says,

753
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,291
"Let’s run away together,"

754
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,708
I don’t find it romantic at all.

755
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,541
All I want to do is call the police.

756
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,000
Officer, please save me.

757
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,625
Am I that scary?

758
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:24,500
Very scary.

759
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,083
For the sake of a successful performance,

760
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,500
can you just bear with it for now?

761
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:34,583
Alright then.

762
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,333
I'll do you this favor.

763
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:38,125
Rehearse with him.

764
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:39,708
We don't have much time.

765
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:41,166
Let's hurry and rehearse.

766
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,208
Let's rehearse the farewell scene first.

767
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,583
That scene is quite important.

768
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:45,250
Okay.

769
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,000
Alright.

770
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:52,041
Let the daylight come in.

771
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,375
Let life go out.

772
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,000
Farewell.

773
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:56,041
Farewell.

774
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,208
Give me a kiss.

775
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,708
Then I'll leave.

776
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,083
Are you leaving just like this, my husband?

777
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:04,875
Wait a moment.

778
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,416
Where did it go wrong?

779
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,875
I think

780
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,875
the way you deliver your lines so stiffly

781
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,375
is a bit too unnatural.

782
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,375
But you two

783
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,500
are playing lovers right now.

784
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,875
Even ordinary friends would hug when parting.

785
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:21,125
Otherwise, it looks too fake.

786
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,291
The audience might criticize it.

787
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,541
But we can't hug either.

788
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:29,583
It's so awkward.

789
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:31,708
Holding hands is fine too.

790
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:34,958
Let's try it this way first.

791
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:43,458
Don't move.

792
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:44,916
Say your lines.

793
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,166
Then

794
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:52,333
goodbye

795
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:54,708
my

796
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:56,000
friend

797
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:58,583
husband

798
00:36:58,875 --> 00:36:59,875
my beloved

799
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:04,000
I will see you again

800
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:05,375
my beloved

801
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,458
I will never give up any chance

802
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:09,875
to express my true feelings to you
