1
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:10,000
Pinky swear, hang it up, and never break it for a hundred years.

2
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:14,875
Let's do this one.

3
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,541
They're here to adopt children.

4
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:18,666
Here you go, little one.

5
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:19,708
For you.

6
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,250
Do you want new parents?

7
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,500
But the uncles and aunties all prefer boys.

8
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,875
They don't like girls.

9
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,291
Come on, let's go over there.

10
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,125
Mom and Dad.

11
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:31,625
Ningning.

12
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,000
I want her to be my little sister.

13
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:38,791
What's your name?

14
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,083
You actually thanked me so politely.

15
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,708
Even White Rabbit candy doesn't work anymore.

16
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:11,541
Is it really that serious this time?

17
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,791
Today's breakfast is all your favorites.

18
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:27,875
Eat up.

19
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,416
You...

20
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:36,916
You're not sulking anymore.

21
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,666
You're so nice to me.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,125
Why would I be upset?

23
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,000
Eat up.

24
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,375
You'll have to go to school by yourself later.

25
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,166
I have to go to the recommended students' seminar.

26
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:51,416
It's not on the way.

27
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:57,457
Oh, right.

28
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,416
Last time after you used the voice recorder,

29
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,125
where did you put it?

30
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:03,500
I...

31
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:04,832
I forgot.

32
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:06,500
It's okay.

33
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,416
You finish eating and go to school.

34
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,250
I'll look for it myself later.

35
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:12,082
Then...

36
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,125
Are we coming back together after school this afternoon?

37
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:16,750
Chen Jing'an.

38
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:22,500
How could I possibly

39
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,082
stay at the recommended students' seminar all day?

40
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:27,957
Hurry up and eat.

41
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,040
Can I help you with something?

42
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,000
You're asking if I have something to say?

43
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,540
You embarrassed me in front of Chen Changning before.

44
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,165
We haven't settled that score yet.

45
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,708
Don't think

46
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,665
I don't know what you're up to.

47
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,165
You really think that just because you're Chen Changning's sister

48
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:32,790
you can do whatever you want?

49
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,415
Apologize to me right now.

50
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,625
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:39,415
Although I don't remember where

52
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:40,458
No, that's not right.

53
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:40,958
Although

54
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:41,958
I

55
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,083
forgot what I did to upset you.

56
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:44,665
But

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,165
if it was my fault,

58
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:47,665
I'll apologize to you, okay?

59
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,165
What are you doing?

60
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,125
This is boring.

61
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:52,790
Let's go.

62
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,000
Chen Jing'an.

63
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,040
Are you okay?

64
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,708
I just heard you apologize to them.

65
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Are you afraid of her or something?

66
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:03,458
Does she have something on you?

67
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:05,375
No, she doesn't.

68
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:06,958
I just think

69
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,250
it's better for classmates to get along.

70
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:11,875
Even the boss wants to make peace now?

71
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,500
I don't really want to cause trouble.

72
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,750
But you don't have to

73
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,915
lower yourself to apologize like that.

74
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:20,208
That's not like you.

75
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,290
It's like you've become a different person.

76
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:22,500
I

77
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,415
It's because

78
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,875
I just don't think it's worth arguing with them.

79
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,333
It's not worth arguing with them.

80
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:35,958
Disdainful

81
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:39,750
On a higher level

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,915
I got first place in this speech contest

83
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,540
What does that have to do with me?

84
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,000
But everyone says you let me win

85
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,250
Zhu Niannian

86
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,250
Why didn't you take the contest seriously?

87
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,415
I could have rightfully taken first place

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,958
You are Zhu

89
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:05,750
You are that

90
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,625
The one I've always defeated

91
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,415
That eternal runner-up, Liu Xinyi

92
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:10,625
Zhu Niannian

93
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,333
You

94
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,125
No one knows what Zhu Niannian is really thinking

95
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,500
If she didn't talk nonsense

96
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,833
She would definitely be the champion now

97
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,790
Who knows

98
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,125
Maybe she just wanted to experience what it's like to lose

99
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,708
Did you go to the information session today?

100
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,375
What did the principal talk about?

101
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:03,125
Were there any must-know tips for interviews?

102
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,000
Any little tricks or tips?

103
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:06,000
I took notes.

104
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:06,958
You can read them yourself.

105
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,540
He's so nice to me.

106
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,290
What did you write here?

107
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,625
You're seeing things.

108
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,250
Today we're going to talk about British history.

109
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,665
It involves a famous historical figure.

110
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:46,833
Named Newton.

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,958
I asked everyone to preview this before.

112
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:49,875
Now,

113
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,458
I'll call on a student to talk about it.

114
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,750
Tell us about Newton's most important historical contribution.

115
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:58,915
Zhu Niannian,

116
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,790
why don't you answer?

117
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,625
The three laws.

118
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,540
The first law?

119
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,833
Also called the law of inertia.

120
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,165
It says that

121
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:25,290
force is what changes the state of motion of an object.

122
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,625
Without external force,

123
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,790
an isolated particle

124
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:31,208
will remain at rest or move in a straight line at constant speed.

125
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,250
There's also the law of universal gravitation.

126
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,500
It says that

127
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,333
F equals the gravitational constant G

128
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,250
times the product of the two masses

129
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,083
divided by the square of the distance between them.

130
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,000
Did I get it wrong?

131
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,958
Not exactly wrong,

132
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,000
but Niannian,

133
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,125
you should look at it

134
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,958
from a humanities and historical perspective

135
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,250
when analyzing Newton.

136
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,250
That's about right.

137
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,625
Okay, let's continue.

138
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,041
Why did you write so much?

139
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,208
Did I write too little?

140
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,625
It's okay.

141
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,208
Just add more when you think of something later.

142
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,791
Nothing really happened today.

143
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,000
Nothing you couldn't handle, right?

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,458
Don't even mention it.

145
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,083
So, the history teacher today—

146
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,416
She suddenly called on me.

147
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,416
To answer what?

148
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,416
About Newton's

149
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,583
historical significance.

150
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,833
How would I know that?

151
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,541
Luckily, I thought quickly.

152
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:54,500
I just recited

153
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,625
Newton's

154
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:56,958
three laws

155
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,083
and the law of universal gravitation.

156
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,625
I repeated them word for word.

157
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:00,916
And I got away with it.

158
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,375
You're really quick-witted.

159
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:04,875
I still don't know

160
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,083
when we'll be able to switch back.

161
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,875
It's fine to wing it once,

162
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,291
but I can't do it every time.

163
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,875
There are still so many exams coming up.

164
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,708
If I have to take liberal arts exams, I'll definitely mess up.

165
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:25,416
Oh, right.

166
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,916
But think about it carefully.

167
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:28,875
Before we switched,

168
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,375
was there anything

169
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,750
unusual that happened?

170
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,541
A meteor.

171
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:36,541
Yeah.

172
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,250
It must be because

173
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,958
the meteor caused changes in the Earth's magnetic field.

174
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,500
That's why we ended up like this.

175
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,666
So when the next meteor appears,

176
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,750
can we switch back?

177
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:45,916
Go back to normal?

178
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,083
I don't know.

179
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,666
It's not like meteors appear every day.

180
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,166
For now,

181
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,958
let's just keep pretending to be each other.

182
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,583
How's it going with my mom?

183
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,250
Your mom?

184
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,416
She's still upset.

185
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,083
She barely talks to me.

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,541
Is your dad picking you up today?

187
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,125
Why do you look so preoccupied?

188
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,083
Cheer up!

189
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,166
I just heard there are some thugs from outside school

190
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,625
waiting to ambush someone at our school gate.

191
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,416
No way, who got into trouble?

192
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,916
I heard it's Chen Jing'an.

193
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,083
What did you say?

194
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,166
There are thugs standing at the school gate

195
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,541
looking for trouble with Chen Jing'an.

196
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,250
Nian Nian, where are you going?

197
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:38,708
To help.

198
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:40,625
To help.

199
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,666
Nian Nian, wait for me!

200
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,416
Come on, Chen Jing'an.

201
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,791
If you have the guts, just go.

202
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,500
Don't chicken out.

203
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,041
Minqiu!

204
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,416
You guys are ganging up on one person.

205
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,583
At least wait until I have enough people on my side.

206
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,458
This time, it's just the two of us, one-on-one.

207
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,125
Chen Jing'an, what are you scared of?

208
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,416
Weren't you pretty tough before?

209
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,833
You're the one looking for trouble.

210
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,708
Aren't you afraid the teacher will come?

211
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,291
I'm not even a student at this school.

212
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,333
What do I have to be afraid of?

213
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,166
Li Minqiu

214
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,625
Don't go too far.

215
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,125
Chen Jing'an, you're just scared, aren't you?

216
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:27,583
Coward.

217
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:28,833
How do you write "coward"?

218
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,583
Chen Jing'an has never been a coward.

219
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:31,750
Come on.

220
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:32,916
Go.

221
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,125
We're not afraid of him.

222
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,208
You'll definitely beat him this time too.

223
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,208
Fight.

224
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:39,666
Fight.

225
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,250
It's fine.

226
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,916
I'll cheer you on.

227
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,041
Come on.

228
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:45,833
I'll give you a ride.

229
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:46,833
No way.

230
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,125
If you two go by bike,

231
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,375
what if you run away halfway?

232
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:50,958
Chen Jing'an

233
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,458
You ride with me.

234
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,416
Then you ride with me.

235
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,041
Fine, I'll ride.

236
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:58,708
Who's afraid of whom?

237
00:12:58,875 --> 00:12:59,333
Chen Jing'an

238
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,208
Get on.

239
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,000
Chen Jing'an

240
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,333
Your friends have hyped you up so much.

241
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,791
Don't let him down.

242
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:09,583
Chen Jing'an

243
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:10,208
Get on.

244
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,666
We may be few, but we're not cowards.

245
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:15,708
Get on.

246
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:31,875
Sit tight.

247
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,125
Chen Jing'an

248
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:40,000
How much trouble have you gotten into out there?

249
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:52,958
Nian Nian

250
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,250
Don't go join the crowd, Nian Nian.

251
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,000
It's dangerous.

252
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,708
It's really dangerous.

253
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,416
I regret this.

254
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,833
I shouldn't have come here.

255
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,166
Can we still run away now?

256
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,500
Don't be afraid.

257
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,500
We're already here.

258
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:51,666
So

259
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,875
let's just go for it against them.

260
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,583
Last time, I was careless.

261
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,083
This time, I'm definitely going to win back my pride.

262
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,458
If I don't beat you all badly today,

263
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,958
then my last name isn't Li.

264
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,166
We're not afraid of him.

265
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,041
Go!

266
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,750
We can definitely win this time too.

267
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,166
But I don't know how to play basketball.

268
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,291
Chen Jing'an.

269
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,375
You're way too cocky.

270
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,833
And you say you can't play basketball?

271
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,583
Last time, you totally crushed our leader.

272
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:35,750
Enough talk.

273
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,166
This time, I'm going all out.

274
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,541
Go, Chen Jing'an!

275
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,041
Qiu will definitely win!

276
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:51,791
Chen Jing'an will definitely win!

277
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:54,541
Let's start.

278
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,625
Are you okay?

279
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,375
Li Minqiu, what are you doing?

280
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,291
Did you do that on purpose?

281
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,583
That's not fair!

282
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,041
She didn't dodge herself.

283
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,833
Who told you to hit her?

284
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,916
Dude, who are you?

285
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,625
Does it matter who I am?

286
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,791
Why did you hit her?

287
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,375
Bro.

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,041
You've got it wrong.

289
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,041
I just accidentally missed the ball.

290
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,541
He didn't do it on purpose.

291
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,041
Since when do you hang out with people like this?

292
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,333
What do you mean by that?

293
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,916
What's wrong with people like me?

294
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,458
I'm warning you.

295
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,250
Don't mess with my sister again.

296
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,958
When did I ever mess with your sister?

297
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,833
We were just playing ball together.

298
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,041
Playing ball?

299
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,208
You call this playing ball?

300
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,250
Why don't you teach me too?

301
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,708
How to make your nose bleed as well.

302
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,708
I'm really fine.

303
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,041
I'm really fine.

304
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:17,500
Chen Jing'an.

305
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,375
What happened to your nose?

306
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,041
Why are you here?

307
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:20,916
You...

308
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,000
Nian Nian.

309
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:23,916
Enough talking.

310
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,083
Let's go.

311
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,208
Li Minqiu

312
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,750
You're the one at the school gate

313
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,791
who blocked Chen Jing'an, right?

314
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,416
Her nose was your doing too.

315
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:43,375
We

316
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,750
just played ball together, that's all.

317
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:45,750
Played ball?

318
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,958
You played ball and ended up like this?

319
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,333
Then teach me

320
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,125
how to play ball and make your nose bleed.

321
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,166
Why does that sound so familiar?

322
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,458
Considering this time

323
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,291
that Chen Jing'an isn't holding it against you,

324
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:00,583
I'll let it go for now.

325
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,208
But if you dare touch my people again, just try me.

326
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,958
Nian Nian, Nian Nian

327
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,791
Chen Changning and the others have gone far.

328
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,333
Let's go, let's go.

329
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,583
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

330
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,125
Qiu-ge

331
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,750
Isn't that the school beauty from No. 2 High?

332
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,166
Why is she so fierce?

333
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,208
Hitting means affection, scolding means love.

334
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,000
When we played house as kids,

335
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,708
they even pretended to be a couple.

336
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,291
Nian Nian

337
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,750
When did you and Chen Jing'an

338
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,458
get so close?

339
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,291
Do you know how dangerous it is

340
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,458
to suddenly run over like that?

341
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,375
You've been saying that the whole way.

342
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,541
I got it.

343
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,291
Know what?

344
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,833
You got close to Chen Jing'an

345
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,458
actually because of him, right?

346
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,208
What?

347
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,666
Nothing, nothing.

348
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,291
I understand everything.

349
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,541
School had just ended.

350
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,250
The two of us

351
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,416
and those three

352
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,833
The three of them—we arranged to play ball here.

353
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,750
Then Chen Jing'an and I stood on this side.

354
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,708
And then Li Minqiu,

355
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:00,916
he brought two people to stand on that side.

356
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,125
He was going to pass the ball to us.

357
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,041
Once he passed it to us, the game would start.

358
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,625
We were standing here when the ball came flying over.

359
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,666
I don't know what happened with Chen Jing'an.

360
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,625
She didn't even try to catch the ball.

361
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,583
Then, with a smack,

362
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:08,958
it hit her right on the nose.

363
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,166
Jing'an's nose got hit.

364
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,250
She got a nosebleed.

365
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,208
It's all Li Minqiu's fault.

366
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,333
It's all your fault.

367
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,833
I really want to smack you with a shoe.

368
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,250
Why are you blaming me?

369
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,375
I wasn't the one who hit her.

370
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,166
Dad,

371
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,041
Look at Mom.

372
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,708
You didn't protect Jing'an.

373
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,916
If we don't blame you, who else?

374
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,041
Your mom is right about everything.

375
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,208
Go.

376
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,708
Go to the pharmacy and buy some medicine.

377
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,750
Go apologize to Chen Jing'an.

378
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,000
Right now?

379
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,958
It's already so late.

380
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,125
Are you going or not?

381
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:40,833
I'll go.

382
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,125
I don't know whose real mom you are.

383
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,208
I'm going right away.

384
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:46,500
Let me tell you,

385
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,458
buy the best and most expensive medicine, got it?

386
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,375
Our daughter-in-law

387
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,416
can't have her looks ruined.

388
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,250
That's right.

389
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,583
The lady of the house is right.

390
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,083
What are you looking at?

391
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,583
I'll let you look, I'll let you look.

392
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,500
Take a look.

393
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:57,583
Look.

394
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,375
My breast hurts.

395
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,291
What's going on with you today?

396
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,333
It's just...

397
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,458
I was just playing basketball.

398
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,375
Zhu Niannian is gone too.

399
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,500
When did you two get so close?

400
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,125
We...

401
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,250
We just...

402
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,791
Last time, she accidentally ran into a bicycle.

403
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,625
I spoke up for her.

404
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,625
After a while, we became friends.

405
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,083
Niannian is a really nice person.

406
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,875
Her grades are good too.

407
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,333
And she has a great personality.

408
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,666
If you got to know her,

409
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,208
you'd definitely like her.

410
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,666
Not interested.

411
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,000
And also,

412
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,041
you and that Li Minqiu,

413
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,291
what's your relationship?

414
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,625
Minqiu gege

415
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,041
Minqiu gege

416
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,708
When have you ever called me "ge"?

417
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,541
Ge

418
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,875
From now on, you're not allowed to see that Li Minqiu anymore.

419
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,208
Did you hear me?

420
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,083
He obviously looks like a troublemaker.

421
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,250
Li Minqiu is not a troublemaker.

422
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:07,916
He just—

423
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,041
Chen Jing'an.

424
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,625
Chen Jing'an.

425
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,125
Chen Jing'an.

426
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,583
Chen Jing'an.

427
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,333
Come down, come down.

428
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,625
I have something for you.

429
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,333
Okay.

430
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,250
Please don't be mad, okay?

431
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,166
I've finished my homework.

432
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,625
I just want to spend some time with you.

433
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,333
Me?

434
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,541
I don't need you to keep me company.

435
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:58,958
I'm not important.

436
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,333
Do whatever you want.

437
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,500
Do whatever you like.

438
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,416
I don't have the right to tell you what to do anymore.

439
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,333
I'm here to admit my mistake.

440
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,458
I promise it won't happen again.

441
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,416
From now on,

442
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,500
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

443
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,000
As long as you don't get mad at me.

444
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:19,875
Then for the next monthly exam,

445
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,416
what do you plan

446
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,583
to rank?

447
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,166
Whatever rank you want me to get,

448
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,291
that's the rank I'll get.

449
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,333
Top ten in the grade.

450
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,708
No problem.

451
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:34,875
What about next month?

452
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,375
There's also a debate competition you must join.

453
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,458
Win a place for me.

454
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,333
I'll participate.

455
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,583
Beijing is too far.

456
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,750
Go to college here for me.

457
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:46,791
Live at home.

458
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,041
Don't go to college in Beijing.

459
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,083
I'll stay here for college.

460
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:52,541
Don't lie to me.

461
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:53,708
My word is my bond.

462
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,333
Once I say it,

463
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,291
even four horses can't take it back.

464
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,083
Sorry, Zhu Niannian.

465
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,958
Let me get through this first.

466
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,333
Didn't I already promise you?

467
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,083
Here.

468
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,083
I was originally planning to...

469
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,958
You won an award in the speech contest.

470
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:29,583
This is for you.

471
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,500
Is it really for me?

472
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:34,708
Go ahead and try it.

473
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:43,916
What is this?

474
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,375
It's medicine I bought for your nose.

475
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,333
I don't know which one works best.

476
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,541
So I bought them all.

477
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,458
As soon as my mom heard you got hurt,

478
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,875
she urged me to come see you right away.

479
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,833
Honestly, I was too lazy to go upstairs.

480
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,125
All of these are from your mom for me?

481
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:58,958
Yes, that's right.

482
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,458
Does your nose still hurt?

483
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,500
It doesn't hurt anymore.

484
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,375
These medicines—

485
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:07,708
I still don't know which one works best.

486
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,541
So I bought them all.

487
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,041
This one is a spray.

488
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,041
It's easy to accidentally spray it into your eyes.

489
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,208
Just use a cotton ball to apply it.

490
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:32,333
This

491
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,500
This is medicinal powder.

492
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,416
It needs to be mixed with a little water before applying.

493
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,541
But the thing is,

494
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,250
it's kind of black and looks ugly.

495
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,208
But

496
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:40,625
you weren't pretty to begin with.

497
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:41,166
We

498
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:41,791
We don't care about that.

499
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:42,583
Right?

500
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:46,083
By the way, Chen Jing'an,

501
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:47,625
what's going on between you and Zhu Niannian?

502
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:50,333
Why did she suddenly today—

503
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,375
Was it you—

504
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:54,875
We just became friends.

505
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,958
Not bad, Chen Jing'an.

506
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,083
I thought you just envied her.

507
00:25:59,083 --> 00:25:59,916
I didn't expect you'd actually go over

508
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:00,875
and become friends with her.

509
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:02,625
You know,

510
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,458
you've really been getting more and more like her lately.

511
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:10,208
Really?

512
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,208
Of course!

513
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:12,000
You even imitate her.

514
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,208
Look, for example, this—

515
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:14,958
Your hair.

516
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,083
No, I don't.

517
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,791
You still say you don't?

518
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:19,708
You just won't admit it.

519
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,291
There's nothing embarrassing about it, right?

520
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:27,583
Chen Jing'an.

521
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,625
I'm so sleepy.

522
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,083
It's over, it's over.

523
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,541
I got caught slacking off.

524
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,458
Why do I feel like

525
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,750
he's not throwing away trash,

526
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,916
but throwing me away?

527
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:36,958
It's so dark, you should hurry home.

528
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:39,375
Okay, I know.

529
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,166
Remember to apply the medicine.

530
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:40,916
And later on,

531
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,291
say something nice about me in front of my mom.

532
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,875
After all, I went through all this trouble to bring you the medicine.

533
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:44,541
Alright, alright.

534
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:45,208
Okay, I got it.

535
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:45,500
Bye.

536
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,291
See you.

537
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:14,833
Come here.

538
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,208
I have something to tell you.

539
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:37,166
Chen Jing'an.

540
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,083
What do you think about early romantic relationships

541
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:42,333
What's your opinion?

542
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:43,958
Early romantic relationships.
