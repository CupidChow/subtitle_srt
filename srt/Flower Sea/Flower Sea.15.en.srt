=Episode 15=

3
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,330
Why am I still here?

4
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,710
Chen Jing'an?

5
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,450
I'm Zhu Niannian.

6
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,830
Sorry.

7
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,040
What are you shouting for?

8
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,350
Had a nightmare?

9
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,220
No, I was vocal practicing.

10
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,170
Louder!

11
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,990
No, I was vocal practicing.

12
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,240
Trying to sleep in again?

13
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Hurry, I even squeezed toothpaste for you.

14
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,120
Come on.

15
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,700
Brush your teeth and have breakfast.

16
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,400
Fine.

17
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,170
Let's go.

18
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,210
Time for school.

19
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,740
My stomach hurts suddenly.

20
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,790
What's wrong?

21
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,410
Got sick from breakfast?

22
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,900
Let's go to the hospital.

23
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,790
It's fine.

24
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,410
I'll just go to the bathroom.

25
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,410
You go ahead.

26
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,580
Don't be late.

27
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,880
You good?

28
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,670
It's okay.

29
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,450
Don't wait for me.

30
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,950
Don't be late.

31
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,750
Alright.

32
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,700
Be careful on the bus then.

33
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm running late.

34
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,080
I'm leaving first.

35
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,870
Why the sudden business trip?

36
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,120
Is it that urgent?

37
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,870
Who'll take Niannian to school?

38
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,200
It's fine, Mom.

39
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,290
I can take the bus myself.

40
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,970
I don't want it either,

41
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,290
but this client

42
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,240
is really important.

43
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,390
I'll be back tomorrow. See you.

44
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,250
Bye.

45
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,080
Eat up quickly.

46
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,040
I'll take you later.

47
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,740
Mom, are you okay?

48
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,630
I'm fine.

49
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,910
Just some chest pain.

50
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,410
Probably your dad's fault.

51
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,040
Then don't take me to school.

52
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,880
I'll go myself.

53
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,330
Alright, be careful.

54
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,300
We still haven't switched back.

55
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,330
Last night's meteor shower was fake.

56
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,990
Maybe...

57
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,580
the way is wrong.

58
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
What if it wasn't the meteors?

59
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,450
If not meteors, then what?

60
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,410
That was the only unusual thing

61
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,200
happened that day.

62
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Some records do show

63
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,660
meteors can alter magnetic fields,

64
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,830
causing

65
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,450
unexpected phenomena.

66
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,790
Unless...

67
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,620
maybe not every meteor

68
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,740
changes magnetic fields.

69
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,330
It's about probability.

70
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,370
That actually makes sense.

71
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,040
Then maybe

72
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,910
the next meteor

73
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,200
could trigger the change,

74
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,910
and we'd switch back.

75
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,880
But

76
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,120
what if it never happens?

77
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,950
Could we be stuck like this?

78
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,040
Do we have to

79
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,410
rely on meteors?

80
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,580
Can't we

81
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,910
create a magnetic field?

82
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,830
Like an electromagnet.

83
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,290
You thought of that?

84
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,990
I thought you didn't know physics.

85
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,540
Maybe because

86
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,410
the interest group discussed magnets,

87
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,410
so I learned a bit.

88
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,250
But

89
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,830
electromagnets are too weak.

90
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,370
Unless we build a super one

91
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,580
and alter it precisely.

92
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,830
That's so hard.

93
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,700
Chen Changning and I

94
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,290
discussed this in the interest group.

95
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,040
Unless

96
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,290
it's a natural phenomenon,

97
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,410
it's nearly impossible artificially.

98
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,080
You're good at physics.

99
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,620
You'll figure it out.

100
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,120
I'll research more later.

101
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,250
Don't worry,

102
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,950
we will switch back.

103
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,050
No wonder they wanted to change subjects.

104
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,430
And you asked

105
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,890
about memory swaps.

106
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,430
So this is why...

107
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,680
Unbelievable.

108
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,490
When I first found out,

109
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,640
I couldn't believe it.

110
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,550
But it's true.

111
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,300
I thought last night's meteors

112
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
would fix it,

113
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,220
but no.

114
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,430
Most research

115
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,680
is speculation,

116
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,850
little authoritative data.

117
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,680
I remember you know many people.

118
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,720
You may have friends who study

119
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,140
astrophysics or similar fields.

120
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,050
That's why I came to you.

121
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,010
Their bodies

122
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,640
show no abnormalities,

123
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,100
meaning the swap

124
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,350
isn't harmful.

125
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,050
Don't worry too much.

126
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,470
As for switching back...

127
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,890
This is beyond

128
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,180
my understanding.

129
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,050
I'll look into it

130
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,470
and think carefully

131
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,390
about which friends could help.

132
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,800
Thank you, sir.

133
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,720
No need for thanks.

134
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,550
We're teacher and student,

135
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,010
and friends too.

136
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,930
But

137
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,300
it's impressive how Chen Jing'an

138
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,550
kept this secret.

139
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,560
So please pretend

140
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,350
you don't know.

141
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,050
Don't worry, I will.

142
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,350
I'll update you immediately

143
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,140
if there's any progress.

144
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,810
Thank you, sir.

145
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,050
You can go back to class.

146
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,220
Hey,

147
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,310
Ms. Yu.

148
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,060
Well,

149
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,660
I just thought of

150
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,470
a body-swap premise

151
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,600
for my novel.

152
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,320
After school,

153
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,640
let's discuss at the café.

154
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,180
Mom.

155
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,310
Mom.

156
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,920
Mom.

157
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,340
Mom.

158
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,210
Mom.

159
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,330
You're home.

160
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,890
Mom, are you okay?

161
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,690
I'm fine.

162
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,120
Just dizzy this afternoon.

163
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,640
I've been resting till now.

164
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,200
Go do your homework.

165
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,240
I'll make dinner.

166
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,350
You sure you're okay?

167
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,800
I'm fine.

168
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,470
Go on.

169
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,440
What's wrong?

170
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,010
I suddenly feel

171
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,220
uneasy.

172
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,260
Too tired lately?

173
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,220
Rest early after dinner.

174
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,980
Okay.

175
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,720
Mom.

176
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:28,970
Mom, are you okay?

177
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
My chest hurts.

178
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,470
Let me help you up.

179
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,310
Don't move me.

180
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,300
Call 120.

181
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,510
Okay, I'm on it.

182
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,300
I'll clean up.

183
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,980
It's fine.

184
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,310
Coming.

185
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:00,890
Auntie.

186
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,430
Changning, eaten yet?

187
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,390
Yes.

188
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,350
Why are you here?

189
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,970
Need to discuss something.

190
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,330
Auntie.

191
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,970
Auntie.

192
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:14,810
Here's water.

193
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,300
Weren't you feeling unwell?

194
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,350
Go rest in your room.

195
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,560
Okay.

196
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,810
Changning,

197
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,550
I returned mainly

198
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,260
about you studying abroad.

199
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,220
Abroad?

200
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,140
You want to study astronomy, right?

201
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,050
It took me great effort

202
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,010
to finally contact

203
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
an astronomy professor

204
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,140
at MIT recently.

205
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,640
I showed him your transcripts.

206
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
He said he'd be happy

207
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,900
to write a recommendation letter.

208
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,680
That's why I came back

209
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,300
to discuss

210
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,350
taking you abroad.

211
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,260
Here's my plan.

212
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,510
First come to America with me,

213
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,420
complete one high-school year

214
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,250
to settle in.

215
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,430
Meanwhile,

216
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,680
prepare for MIT's entrance exams.

217
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,510
With your academic record,

218
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,010
you'll definitely pass.

219
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,430
What do you think?

220
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,890
Thanks, Auntie.

221
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,510
I'll consider carefully.

222
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,720
Consider?

223
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,510
What's there to consider?

224
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,260
This opportunity is incredibly rare.

225
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,890
As long as you like,

226
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,890
your parents will definitely agree.

227
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,300
MIT's astronomy program

228
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,600
is ranked first in the world.

229
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,640
This chance won't come again.

230
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,680
Auntie,

231
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,970
this is...

232
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
really quite sudden.

233
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
I'm not prepared yet.

234
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,890
I'll think about it.

235
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,760
What's there to think about?

236
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,550
Once you're in America,

237
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,760
I'll cover

238
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,800
all your expenses,

239
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,010
everything arranged.

240
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,930
You just focus on studying.

241
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,520
Most high schoolers in China

242
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,510
can only dream of going abroad.

243
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,100
Jing'an,

244
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,180
don't you think

245
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,550
Changning should come with me?

246
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,890
I don't know.

247
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,300
Let him decide for himself.

248
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,640
I know this is unexpected.

249
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,260
You might feel overwhelming.

250
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,640
But it's okay,

251
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,510
I'll give you time.

252
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,510
I know

253
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,010
you're a smart kid.

254
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,590
Opportunities like this

255
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,510
don't come along often.

256
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,180
Think it over quickly

257
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,510
and give me your answer,

258
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,640
okay?

259
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,470
Okay.

260
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,760
I'll think it through properly.

261
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,930
(Nursing Station)

262
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,260
Don't worry, young lady.

263
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,430
Trust Dr. Zhang.

264
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,010
You've been dizzy with chest tightness?

265
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,850
Yes, sometimes

266
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,680
I can't catch my breath.

267
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,300
What's wrong with me?

268
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,720
Initial tests

269
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,430
show arrhythmia,

270
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,010
but we don't know

271
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,350
the specific type

272
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,680
or cause yet.

273
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,760
More tests are needed.

274
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,890
If it's sinus arrhythmia,

275
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,760
it's not serious.

276
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,930
But if it's something worse...

277
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,850
What could happen?

278
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,470
Hard to say.

279
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,510
Let's do the tests first.

280
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,010
Don't be nervous.

281
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,850
Stay relaxed.

282
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,850
Trust our medical team.

283
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,760
You'll be fine.

284
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Thank you, Dr. Zhang.

285
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,640
You're welcome.

286
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,510
Thank you,

287
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,020
ma'am.

288
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,260
Rest well now.

289
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,390
I'll arrange the tests.

290
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,390
Niannian,

291
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,260
were you scared?

292
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,140
Don't worry,

293
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,140
I'm okay.

294
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,050
Mom, just rest.

295
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,650
I called Dad.

296
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,140
He's coming soon. I'll check for him.

297
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,430
Are you really going abroad?

298
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
You heard it.

299
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,050
I haven't decided.

300
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,550
But...

301
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,760
when your aunt

302
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,680
mentioned it,

303
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,680
I could tell

304
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,180
you were tempted.

305
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,930
It's MIT after all.

306
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,430
Who wouldn't be tempted

307
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,600
by that opportunity?

308
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,930
Then why say

309
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,300
you need to think about it?

310
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,050
Am I asking too much?

311
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,430
What do you think?

312
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,970
Should I go abroad?

313
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,300
I don't know.

314
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,550
But

315
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,680
MIT's astronomy program...

316
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,720
It would be a pity to miss it.

317
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,720
As your friend,

318
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,430
I'll support

319
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,800
whatever you decide.

320
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,180
I mean...

321
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,470
as a friend,

322
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,180
I respect your choice.

323
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
What about Chen Jing'an?

324
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,850
(Chen Jing'an)

325
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,850
(Chen Jing'an)

326
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,850
Niannian,

327
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,980
where's your mom?

328
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,650
Dad, you're finally here. Hurry.

329
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,690
I'm sorry, Huiru.

330
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,720
I came too late.

331
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,100
Weren't you coming back tomorrow?

332
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,220
I heard you fainted.
It scared me to death.

333
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,760
So I rushed back right away.

334
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,100
Don't blame me.

335
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,890
How could I blame you?

336
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,720
You're the one supporting our family.

337
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,350
Huiru,

338
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,600
how are you feeling now?

339
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,180
Much better.

340
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,180
Don't worry, Huiru.

341
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,140
Focus on recovering.

342
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,070
I'll handle everything.

343
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,260
You'll get better.

344
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,350
Niannian's here.

345
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,950
I have something to do.
I'll leave you alone.

346
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,180
Look at this kid...

347
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,850
(Should I call Zhu Niannian?)

348
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,930
(It is her mom who's sick, after all.)

349
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,720
(But...)

350
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,890
(she's probably asleep by now.)

351
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,970
Niannian?

352
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,350
Ms. Zhang.

353
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,100
Why are you out here?

354
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,100
Worried about your mom?

355
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,010
Go ahead.

356
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,430
Don't worry.

357
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,760
Just stay calm.

358
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,970
Trust our medical team.

359
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,010
Let me tell you,

360
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,850
I'm really skilled.

361
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,600
Ms. Zhang,

362
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,220
Jing'an told me about you.

363
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,390
She said her parents

364
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,260
are amazing doctors.

365
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,060
She even brags about us to you?

366
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,040
Of course.

367
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,430
Jing'an said

368
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,100
her parents save lives as doctors.

369
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,470
She's so proud.

370
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,760
Really?

371
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,760
Actually, since she was little,

372
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,470
Jing'an wanted to be a doctor.

373
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,350
But later, she wanted
to be a physicist instead.

374
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,680
No idea why.

375
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,260
Probably spent too much time
with her brother.

376
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,190
He influenced her.

377
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,640
It's a shame.

378
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,510
If we weren't doctors,

379
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,930
if we had more time for Jing'an,

380
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,850
her brother wouldn't have affected her.

381
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,180
Maybe in the future,

382
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,470
the medical field

383
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,010
will have one more famous female doctor.

384
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,850
Being a doctor isn't something

385
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,390
one just decides on a whim.

386
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,350
Jing'an could do it.

387
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,350
She's really smart.

388
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,890
If she wants it,
she can make it.

389
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:49,850
Niannian,

390
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,140
you're really smart too.

391
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,680
What do you want to be in the future?

392
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,510
I also want to be a physicist.

393
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,350
You too?

394
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,220
No wonder you two get along.

395
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,970
But she switched to liberal arts.

396
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,390
No idea why.

397
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,800
Ms. Zhang,

398
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,600
are you upset

399
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,600
that Jing'an switched?

400
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,140
Why would I?

401
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,510
She must have her reasons.

402
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,540
Anyway,

403
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,510
she's always had her own mind.

404
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,350
But her dad and I

405
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,100
never dared to ask her.

406
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,470
We were afraid she'd think

407
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,200
we had opinions

408
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,760
about her switching subjects.

409
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,940
But we don't.

410
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,070
As long as she's happy,

411
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,440
we support her.

412
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,970
Ms. Zhang,

413
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,100
you're so sweet.

414
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,100
Ms. Zhang,

415
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,850
when do you get off work?

416
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,180
I'm on the night shift tonight.

417
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,350
That's so tiring.

418
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,510
It's fine.

419
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,510
I'm used to it.

420
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,600
Mr. Zhu.

421
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,680
Oh, it's you.

422
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,100
- Yes.
- About my wife's condition…

423
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,850
Don't worry.

424
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,640
The test results
will be out tonight.

425
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,470
Just stay relaxed.

426
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,140
Trust our medical team.

427
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,040
She'll be okay.

428
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,600
Niannian,

429
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,430
your mom's asleep for now.

430
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,470
I'll take you home to rest.

431
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,600
You rushed back from work.

432
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,140
Why don't you go rest?

433
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,350
I'll stay with her.

434
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,190
Listen to me.

435
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,680
You have class tomorrow.

436
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,140
We'll head out first.

437
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,560
Alright, go ahead.

438
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,720
What happened to you?

439
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,070
Your dark circles are heavy.

440
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,720
Niannian's mom

441
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,220
was hospitalized last night.

442
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,800
What?

443
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,350
Is it serious?

444
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,260
Does Niannian know?

445
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,510
I haven't told her yet.

446
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,140
But when I called her dad this morning,

447
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,600
it seemed worse.

448
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,720
She has to know.

449
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,470
How do I tell her?

450
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,390
Right now, I'm in her place.

451
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,600
Even if I tell her,

452
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,850
it'll just make her worry.

453
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,760
She can't help anyway.

454
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,850
But no matter what,

455
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,430
it's her mom. She has the right to know.

456
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
You think

457
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,220
you're protecting her,

458
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,010
but it's not fair to her.

459
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,720
Like Chen Changning,

460
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,650
he thought what he did to you

461
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,100
was for your own good.

462
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,850
You didn't appreciate it.

463
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,100
Why bring up Chen Changning now?

464
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,100
My bad, my bad.

465
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,790
I need to tell you something.

466
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,720
What is it?

467
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,050
Promise me first,

468
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,390
if I tell you,

469
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,520
don't freak out.

470
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,940
What is it?

471
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,680
Did you find a way
to create the super magnetic field?

472
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,850
Last night,

473
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,260
your mom

474
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,220
fainted and was hospitalized.

475
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,010
What?

476
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,550
Where are you going?

477
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,930
I'm going to the hospital.

478
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,350
Calm down!

479
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,720
Have you forgotten?

480
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,720
You're Chen Jing'an now.

481
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,350
Are you really going to tell your mom

482
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,350
you're Zhu Niannian?

483
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,970
In her condition,

484
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,390
can she handle that shock?

485
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,970
Why did you only tell me now?

486
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,100
No wonder I felt so uneasy last night.

487
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,100
I wanted to tell you yesterday,

488
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,680
but I was afraid you wouldn't sleep

489
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,180
from worrying.

490
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
So I kept it from you.

491
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,180
How is she now?

492
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,100
Is it serious?

493
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,260
I talked to your dad this morning.

494
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,140
The test results showed

495
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,350
a congenital narrow blood vessel.

496
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,430
It wasn't a big issue before,

497
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,060
but recently, she's been overworked,

498
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,060
and it triggered symptoms.

499
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,890
Don't panic, okay?

500
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,470
The chief physician is my mom.

501
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,010
Trust her.

502
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,100
She'll cure her.

503
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,430
I want to go to the hospital.

504
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,940
Well,

505
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,260
after school,

506
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,720
tell Ms. Zhang you miss her.

507
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,850
She's the chief physician of your mom,

508
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,140
so you can visit your mom.

509
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,930
Stay calm, okay?

510
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,850
Now, go back to class.

511
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,420
Let's go to the hospital later.
