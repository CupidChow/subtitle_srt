00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:04,970
=Flower Sea=

2
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,220
=Episode 20=
I'm so full.

3
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,580
Finally, I can relax.

4
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,910
Mom's condition is fine now.

5
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,790
The rumors are resolved too.

6
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,370
But Jing'an,

7
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,660
you really won't forgive Chen Changning?

8
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,330
I won't forgive him so easily.

9
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,720
He'd been keeping it from me.

10
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,300
Before,

11
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,200
I thought he didn't know

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,160
about our secret.

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,330
I acted like a clown

14
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,330
in front of him.

15
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,240
He must've been laughing at me inside.

16
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,470
You're really something too.

17
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,990
You knew but didn't tell me.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,910
Letting him laugh at me for so long.

19
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,370
Sorry, Jing'an.

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,660
I promised him first.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,200
Actually,

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,740
he wanted to tell you a few days ago.

23
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,240
But at that time,

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,580
you thought he was going abroad

25
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,080
and ignored him completely.

26
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,660
He didn't get the chance.

27
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,410
You're defending him now?

28
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,540
Fine, fine, let's not talk about this.

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,160
Tell me about your childhood instead.

30
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,660
I'm a little curious.

31
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,850
Curious about what?

32
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,970
Chen Changning said

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,390
you were very obedient as a kid.

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,640
How'd you turn out like this now?

35
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,470
Can't a girl change?

36
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,930
Fine.

37
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,220
Back then,

38
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,140
my parents wanted a boy,

39
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,470
so I was afraid of being disliked.

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
I was careful with everything at home.

41
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,350
I didn't dare eat too much.

42
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,970
I didn't dare speak too much.

43
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,970
Because I was shy,

44
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,220
my classmates called me Scaredy Cat.

45
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,970
Then one time,

46
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,760
when a bully picked on me,

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,970
Chen Changning saw it.

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,220
Did he teach that bully

49
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,100
a lesson?

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,050
Not at all.

51
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,720
He was just watching and laughing at me

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,140
for not fighting back.

53
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,890
So annoying.

54
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,640
How could he do that?

55
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,470
So in anger,

56
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,220
I beat up the bully first,

57
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,720
then punched Chen Changning too.

58
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,350
So is it

59
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,970
from that moment

60
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,550
you became tougher?

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,100
Not exactly.

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,390
I was still scared back then.

63
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,800
Afraid the bully would tell the teacher.

64
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,890
Afraid Changning would tell my parents.

65
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,550
I barely slept that night.

66
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,720
If your mom asks who hit you,

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
say it was me.

68
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,890
Don't say Chen Jing'an. Got it?

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,030
Got it.

70
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,810
Stand straight!

71
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,310
Changning,

72
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,550
why can't you behave?

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,640
Why fight with a classmate?

74
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,720
Sorry, Dad.

75
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,470
I won't hit anyone again.

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,680
Does it hurt?

77
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,220
Let me get you some medicine.

78
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,800
You did well,

79
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,720
but hitting someone is wrong.

80
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,470
Just yell back next time.

81
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,890
This, this, and this…

82
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,100
Mercury conjunct Moon,

83
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,010
sunspot magnetic field,,,

84
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,140
I don't get any of it.

85
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,350
Same rule,

86
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,260
explain it clearly,

87
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,140
or you're not leaving.

88
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,890
I'll explain seriously.

89
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,220
You listen seriously.

90
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,050
Didn't I listen seriously before?

91
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,050
This is my last time here.

92
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,470
Give others a chance to ask questions.

93
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,720
I promised Niannian

94
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
to keep an eye on you.

95
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,970
I won't let you bother her.

96
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,470
I'm not bothering her.

97
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,050
I have something to say.

98
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,390
She said she doesn't

99
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,720
want to talk to you.

100
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,890
Chen Jing'an,

101
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,050
these science experiments

102
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,300
seem related to physics.

103
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,510
I don't understand.

104
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,970
Can you explain, physics genius?

105
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,760
I'm no genius.

106
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
How aren't you a genius?

107
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,800
Don't want to explain?

108
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,680
I'll explain.

109
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,550
It's actually simple.

110
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,640
You just didn't think of it.

111
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,480
Look here,

112
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,220
see this part?

113
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,100
That solves it.

114
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,140
Zhu Niannian,

115
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,220
how are you so smart?

116
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,720
What did you eat as a kid?

117
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,890
Was it…

118
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,890
walnuts every day?

119
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,010
That's why you're so smart?

120
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,050
Where'd your family buy them?

121
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,010
How many a day?

122
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,850
Is six enough?

123
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,550
Six won't cut it.

124
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,470
Maybe eight?

125
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,800
Ten might work.

126
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,200
The more, the better?

127
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,510
(Inpatient Department)

128
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,640
Your recovery is going well.

129
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,230
Just watch your diet these days.

130
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,970
And try to stay emotionally stable.

131
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,970
Also,

132
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,690
you can take short walks outside.

133
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,720
You can check out soon.

134
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,310
Thank you, Dr. Zhang.

135
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,640
And,

136
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,350
thank you

137
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,760
for looking after Niannian.

138
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,600
After Huiru is discharged,

139
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,560
we'd like to treat your family to a meal

140
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,470
when you're available.

141
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,640
I feel really bad about this.

142
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,220
My husband and I have been so busy.

143
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,350
We haven't even had time for the kids.

144
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,170
Don't say that.

145
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,550
I'm really grateful

146
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,100
Jing'an was there for Niannian.

147
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,720
So this meal is a must.

148
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,640
Alright, then focus on getting better.

149
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,510
You know Jing'an has a short temper

150
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,850
and doesn't hold grudges.

151
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,850
I think

152
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,800
you two just lack communication.

153
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,140
Like how we were with Shasha before.

154
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,970
But if you trust each other,

155
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,970
find a moment to talk it through.

156
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,220
She'll understand.

157
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,640
She won't even hear me out.

158
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,050
She's already decided I tricked her.

159
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,730
We...

160
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,150
often take out our temper

161
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,260
on those closest to us.

162
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,470
But think of it this way,

163
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,930
it's because

164
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,810
we know

165
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,720
they'll never leave us,

166
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,970
no matter what.

167
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,220
Last night,

168
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,470
Jing'an told me about your childhood.

169
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,390
Back then,

170
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,350
she tried so hard to please you

171
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,260
because she feared you'd abandon her.

172
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,470
Now she dares to lash out at you

173
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,350
because she trusts you more.

174
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,600
I know.

175
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,640
You know nothing.

176
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,230
If you really knew,

177
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,600
you shouldn't have hidden it

178
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,220
from me in the first place.

179
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,140
Guess I was wrong.

180
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,400
I shouldn't have encouraged you

181
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,180
to curse as a kid.

182
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,850
You're not wrong.

183
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,100
Everything you do is right.

184
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,510
You two talk it out.

185
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,970
I'll go find Shasha.

186
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,140
Wanna talk?

187
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,050
I've got nothing to say to you.

188
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,850
Everything you do is right,

189
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,970
and it's all for my own good.

190
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,470
If I don't appreciate it,

191
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,720
it's my fault, right?

192
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,390
I thought you envied Zhu Niannian,

193
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,970
so I wanted you to experience her life.

194
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,970
Shallow.

195
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,640
What do you think I envy about her?

196
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,140
Her many dresses?

197
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,640
Her big bed?

198
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,970
Your good intentions

199
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,720
are just what you assume.

200
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,260
You don't know what I truly want.

201
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,810
Chen Jing'an,

202
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,810
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,010
I was too presumptuous.

204
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,200
I thought you liked her family.

205
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,470
I don't prefer them.

206
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,470
I just envy
how cherished she feels there.

207
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,010
I also want

208
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,390
a dad who drives me to school,

209
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,350
a mom who cooks

210
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,390
for me daily.

211
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,810
But being

212
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,850
their daughter

213
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,140
is already a blessing.

214
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,470
I never dared ask for more.

215
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,430
I...

216
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,560
Chen Jing'an,

217
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
Mom and Dad adore you.

218
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,970
To them, you can be moody,

219
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,010
be yourself,

220
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,890
be willful.

221
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,510
You're never an outsider.

222
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,300
Understand?

223
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,720
I do.

224
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,850
Let go of me.

225
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,100
Not mad at me anymore?

226
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,850
What's mad?

227
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,720
My dictionary

228
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,170
has no such word.

229
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,720
Chen Jing'an,

230
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,560
remember this,

231
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,650
you're the most important to me.

232
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,140
So no matter what,

233
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,930
trust me.

234
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,720
Got it?

235
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,510
Got... it.

236
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,560
Mr. Deng Hui told me

237
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,700
the president of the association

238
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,350
returns next week.

239
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,350
He'll try to arrange

240
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,390
a meeting with him.

241
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,600
Really?

242
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,890
That's great! We're saved.

243
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,970
We must thank Mr. Deng properly.

244
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,390
I've planned what to do
after switching back.

245
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,340
What's that?

246
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,970
First, battle it out on the court,

247
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,100
then kiss my parents.

248
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,560
What?

249
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,970
Think I won't dare?

250
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,820
Zhu Niannian's my witness.

251
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,850
If you chicken out,

252
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,550
you'll face punishment.

253
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,260
How's he gonna punish me?

254
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,720
Using that move again?

255
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,470
Jing'an,

256
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,010
I want to see my parents tomorrow.

257
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,220
Tomorrow?

258
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,390
It's Saturday.

259
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,560
I'll go with you.

260
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,560
Me too.

261
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,720
To see Mom and Dad.

262
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,350
Let's go.

263
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,070
What happened?

264
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,390
You look so gloomy.

265
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,350
I just remembered,

266
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,620
Jing'an hasn't come to our place

267
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,850
in a while.

268
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,730
Yeah, seems like it.

269
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,720
Could it be...

270
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,470
Tian Ye and Jing'an

271
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,890
had a fight?

272
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,470
No way.

273
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,970
Come on,

274
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,850
you know how dense your son is.

275
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,550
Last time Jing'an's nose was hurt,

276
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,720
he didn't even buy her medicine.

277
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,850
And lately,

278
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,220
Tian Ye hasn't mentioned her.

279
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:56,890
Chances are

280
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,970
they had a falling out.

281
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,350
Honey,

282
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,430
you're right.

283
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Tian Ye...

284
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,390
When he gets back,

285
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,550
I'll teach him a lesson.

286
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,220
Mom, Dad, I'm home.

287
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,140
You rascal!

288
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,510
- Stop right there!
- Wait!

289
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,470
You dare run?

290
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,470
Wait, Mom, what did I do?

291
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,470
You fought with Jing'an?

292
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,140
You've got a death wish!

293
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,470
We didn't fight.

294
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,600
Dad, help me!

295
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,720
Help!

296
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,600
- Take this!
- Stop hitting me!

297
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,600
Dad, save me!

298
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,440
Domestic violence!

299
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,310
Child abuse!

300
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,210
Dad, help!

301
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,970
Mom!

302
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,850
Mom.

303
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,220
Jing'an came to see you.

304
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,180
Jing'an's here?

305
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,720
Come here, sit.

306
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,140
Thank you, Jing'an.

307
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,980
Where's my dad?

308
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,070
Your dad?

309
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,470
He went to the office.

310
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,780
He'll be back soon.

311
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,180
Ms. Liang,

312
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,850
how are you feeling now?

313
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,970
Well,

314
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,220
I'm fine.

315
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,210
Maybe

316
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,050
I can leave here

317
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,300
soon.

318
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,550
Stay a few more days.

319
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,220
Lying in bed all day

320
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,220
is so boring.

321
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,470
Maybe I'll recover faster

322
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,550
at home.

323
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,600
Alright, alright.

324
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,220
Mom, Jing'an brought you dough drop soup.

325
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,640
Really?

326
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,220
Smells great.

327
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,970
Leave it, I'll eat later.

328
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,800
Jing'an, thank you

329
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,100
for being so thoughtful.

330
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,970
Did Niannian tell you?

331
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,230
Yes.

332
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,760
She specifically reminded me.

333
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,680
She said

334
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,760
you've been here so long,

335
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,850
you must be craving this.

336
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,030
Exactly.

337
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,050
When I'm sick,

338
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,470
I don't want anything else,

339
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,850
but dough drop soup.

340
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,850
Niannian, thank you

341
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,970
for remembering me.

342
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,140
Jing'an...

343
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,220
what's wrong?

344
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,220
Seeing you...

345
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,470
I thought of my own mom.

346
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,510
Listen, Dr. Zhang

347
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,760
is just too busy, right?

348
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,960
She rarely

349
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,220
comes home to care for you.

350
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,350
But don't worry.

351
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,560
Your mom

352
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,800
is definitely the one

353
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,140
who loves you most in the world.

354
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,600
I know.

355
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,570
By the way,

356
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,600
don't waste time here.

357
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,720
Niannian's with me.

358
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,600
Go see your parents.

359
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,470
Okay?

360
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,350
Okay.

361
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,730
Ms. Liang,

362
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,220
I'll head out now.

363
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,100
I'll visit again later.

364
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,350
Sure.

365
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,680
Mom,

366
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,390
I'll walk Jing'an out.

367
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,890
Go ahead.

368
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,890
Are you okay?

369
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,850
I just want to spend time with my mom.

370
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,870
The president will be back.

371
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,470
We'll switch back.

372
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,720
Don't worry now.

373
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,550
I'll take good care of your mom.

374
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,300
Thank you, Jing'an.

375
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,050
No need for thanks.

376
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,100
Go back inside.

377
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,970
Stay with my mom,

378
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:42,840
okay?

379
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,180
Take care.

380
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,760
Jing'an?

381
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,430
Are you okay?

382
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,720
Crying?

383
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,720
No.

384
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,640
Just...

385
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,220
got something in my eye.

386
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,100
Coming straight from work?

387
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,390
Yes.

388
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,640
Glad you're okay.

389
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,290
Is Niannian inside?

390
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,300
Why aren't you going in?

391
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,390
I just came out.

392
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,800
I was visiting my parents.

393
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,100
I...

394
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,520
I should go, Mr. Zhu.

395
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,600
Goodbye.

396
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,100
(Cardiology Department Director's Office)

397
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,550
Just you alone?

398
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,930
Mom's busy.

399
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
Why did you come alone?

400
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,180
Have a seat.

401
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,970
Thank you.

402
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,060
Let me guess,

403
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,490
did your mom say

404
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,510
you should visit your own mother.

405
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,100
So you got kicked out.

406
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,680
Don't be sad.

407
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,760
It means she loves you.

408
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,220
She's thinking from my mom's perspective,

409
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
urging you

410
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,970
to visit your own mother.

411
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,050
Empathy like this

412
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,890
shows how much she misses her daughter.

413
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,700
But…

414
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,560
You know it,

415
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,220
but it still hurts.

416
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,140
Then try not to dwell on it.

417
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,470
I believe you'll switch back soon.

418
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,350
The lost time

419
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,720
can be made up later.

420
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,470
Jing'an told me the same.

421
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,050
Seems we're in sync.

422
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,100
Chen Changning,

423
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,220
if...

424
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,220
After Jing'an and I switch back,

425
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,800
can we still be friends?

426
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,390
We've…

427
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,300
talked about this before.

428
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,310
Oh, yes.

429
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,050
I almost forgot,

430
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,390
I did ask you once.

431
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,610
Back then,

432
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,100
my answer was mostly polite.

433
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,100
But I'll say it again,

434
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,260
this time sincerely:

435
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,510
I'd like to stay friends.

436
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,980
Good.

437
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,260
Then I'll look forward

438
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,510
to being your friend

439
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,010
after I return.

440
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,720
Your mom went too hard.

441
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,510
Now you pity me?

442
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,100
You didn't help yesterday.

443
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,800
I'd just have been beaten.

444
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,850
I didn't hit him.

445
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,890
When have I ever really hit him?

446
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,970
He's just clumsy,

447
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,850
ran into the wall when dodging.

448
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,220
Here, ice it.

449
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,050
Or people will think I'm abusive.

450
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,220
Mom, you're too much.

451
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,770
You can't chase me around the house

452
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,670
just because you think

453
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,260
I fought with Chen Jing'an.

454
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,640
I'm so wronged!

455
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,720
Who's your real child here?

456
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,970
If you didn't fight,

457
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,970
why hasn't she visited

458
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:32,890
for so long?

459
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,100
It's because she's…

460
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,730
busy studying.

461
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,590
Busy studying?

462
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,760
After Jing'an switched to liberal arts,

463
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,890
is she struggling to keep up?

464
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,680
So she focused on school

465
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,960
and forgot about you.

466
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,800
Plus, she's in liberal arts now,

467
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,650
and you're in sciences.

468
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,220
You barely see each other.

469
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,100
This can't go on.

470
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,140
Transfer him to liberal arts.

471
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,530
Great idea!

472
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,770
Wait, no...

473
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,680
Hold on, hold on.

474
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,720
Dear parents,

475
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,300
please leave this alone,

476
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,180
okay?

477
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,220
The real reason is

478
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,970
a classmate's mom

479
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,300
was recently hospitalized.

480
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,010
Jing'an has been accompanying her,

481
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,760
so she couldn't visit.

482
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,100
Oh…

483
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,640
Feel better?

484
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,050
Much better.

485
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,930
Much better?

486
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,280
Then go study!

487
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,400
Did you finish

488
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,600
the assignments I gave you?

489
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,100
With your lousy grades,

490
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,390
how can you compare to Jing'an?

491
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,470
Oh,

492
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,070
you like her that you want to

493
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,600
make her your daughter-in-law?

494
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,640
Pfft.

495
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,850
You worthy?

496
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,560
I am.

497
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,720
My son

498
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,510
is handsome, like me,

499
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,350
smart,

500
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,230
like me.

501
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,100
If he actually tried,

502
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,470
he'd excel.

503
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,470
Wow.

504
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,220
"No parent thinks their child dumb."

505
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:00,930
Mom,

506
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,810
same here.

507
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,730
Listen,

508
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,220
"No child thinks

509
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,310
their mom ugly."

510
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,760
What did you say?

511
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,550
Whose side are you on?

512
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,970
Give me the money!

513
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,510
You're giving him cash?

514
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,560
Minqiu,

515
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,550
what did you call us for?

516
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,140
Same thing as last time.

517
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,800
Last time you said

518
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,350
you didn't like Zhu Niannian anymore

519
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,510
and like Chen Jing'an now.

520
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,350
How's it going with her?

521
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,430
No progress.

522
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,100
Niannian and I grew up together.

523
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,640
Even though she said

524
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,890
she'd treat me as a brother,

525
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,220
I just can't get past

526
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,350
this mental block.

527
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,390
How could I fall for her best friend?

528
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,350
That'd make me such a scumbag.

529
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,470
Minqiu,

530
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,220
you had a crush on Zhu Niannian,

531
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,510
but she may not like you back.

532
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,970
Now you're just shifting your crush,

533
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,890
who happens to be

534
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,810
her best friend.

535
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,990
It's not being a scumbag.

536
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,060
That's just sad.

537
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,980
Get lost.

538
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,760
I asked you to cheer me up,

539
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,720
not mock me.

540
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,180
Minqiu,

541
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,890
what do you actually want?

542
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,010
Are you planning to

543
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,490
keep a distance from Zhu Niannian

544
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,720
and focus on her friend?

545
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,100
I don't want to distance from Niannian.

546
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,970
I've protected her all these years.

547
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,800
She's like a sister to me.

548
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,140
And in the future,

549
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,850
I'll still look out for her.

550
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,390
Bro,

551
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,720
you're protecting Zhu Niannian

552
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,100
while liking Chen Jing'an.

553
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,970
That's a real scumbag.

554
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,220
Honestly,

555
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,220
you're the king of scumbags.

556
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,100
See?

557
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,640
I told you I am.

558
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,720
This is so frustrating.

559
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,600
Minqiu,

560
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,100
it's not that complicated.

561
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,470
Just go after Chen Jing'an

562
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,390
and treat Zhu Niannian
as a regular friend.

563
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Problem solved.

564
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,220
Then I wouldn't be

565
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,720
a jerk anymore?

566
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,640
Not at all.

567
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,480
That could work.

568
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,890
Yeah.

569
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,800
Mr. Zhu,

570
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,970
be careful on the road.

571
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,930
Bye, Mr. Zhu.

572
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,970
You two head upstairs.

573
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,600
- I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

574
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,470
Bye, Dad.

575
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,730
See you.

576
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,850
Be good.

577
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:14,211
