1
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,000
Who are you, really?

2
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,958
You're not Chen Jing'an at all.

3
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,375
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Are you Zhu Niannian?

5
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,416
How did you become Chen Jing'an?

6
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,750
That morning, when I woke up,

7
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,791
I was already here.

8
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,041
Which day?

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It should have been September 15th.

10
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:07,958
Has it been that long?

11
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,500
Then do you know

12
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:19,125
how you two switched?

13
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,416
Or rather,

14
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,041
before you switched,

15
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:23,416
what exactly happened?

16
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,750
Chen Jing'an and I have discussed this.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,500
The night before we switched,

18
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,707
we both saw a meteor.

19
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,416
Chen Jing'an guessed

20
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:32,582
maybe

21
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:35,207
the meteor caused some kind of magnetic field change.

22
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,957
Maybe next time there's a meteor,

23
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,166
we can switch back.

24
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,832
But we've checked the information.

25
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:40,957
In the next two months,

26
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,625
there won't be any meteors.

27
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,000
How did you find out?

28
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:01,500
Pan-fried buns.

29
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:04,791
And chive pockets.

30
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,957
Chen Jing'an can eat two servings.

31
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,666
Appetite and food preferences

32
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:12,250
are personal physiological responses.

33
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,750
She might slip up once,

34
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:15,666
maybe twice,

35
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,250
but never every single time.

36
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,916
And yesterday's math test,

37
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,000
and the physics competition.

38
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,832
You have too many flaws.

39
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,916
But most importantly,

40
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,332
Chen Jing'an would never

41
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:30,166
be so nice to me like you are.

42
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:31,291
But for several days in a row,

43
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,291
every word I said that would make Chen Jing'an lose her temper

44
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:34,750
got no reaction from you.

45
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:39,625
I figured it out.

46
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,041
Don't worry.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,166
I'll definitely find a way

48
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:45,541
to switch you two back.

49
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:47,416
You...

50
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:48,625
do you

51
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,416
really hope

52
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,207
we can switch back as soon as possible?

53
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes.

54
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,332
We'll definitely switch back soon.

55
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:51,708
Are you there?

56
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,833
Chen Jing'an

57
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,290
I'm Zhu Niannian

58
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:37,750
Let's go

59
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,333
Get on.

60
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:05,750
Has Chen Jing'an ever thought about switching back?

61
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,375
Before,

62
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,875
because she was afraid she wouldn't do well on the entrance exam,

63
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,665
Jing'an said she really wanted to switch back.

64
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,125
But yesterday, she suddenly said she didn't want to anymore.

65
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,625
Because she thought about changing majors.

66
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,833
I think so.

67
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,290
Zhu Niannian,

68
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,333
I hope you can do me a favor.

69
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:26,250
Don't tell Chen Jing'an yet

70
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,250
that I know about this.

71
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:28,208
Is that okay?

72
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:30,915
Why?

73
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,208
This might be a bit unfair to you.

74
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,166
Because it's my own selfishness.

75
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:39,750
I know she might prefer

76
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,541
the atmosphere in your family.

77
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,958
Before I find a way to switch back,

78
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,375
I hope her dream of a pink family of three

79
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,916
can last a little longer.

80
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,000
Thank you.

81
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,333
Let's go.

82
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:57,958
It's not unfair.

83
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,000
Because being a little closer to you

84
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,458
is also my dream.

85
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:18,916
Let's go.

86
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,041
Why are you also having insomnia? Look at those dark circles.

87
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,375
Is it because the transfer isn't going well?

88
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,208
I...

89
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,791
just haven't figured out yet

90
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,708
how to tell Chen Changning about this.

91
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,125
So I haven't been sleeping well.

92
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,666
Let me tell you,

93
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,291
you really don't need to worry about Chen Changning.

94
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,250
I'm telling you,

95
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,416
He definitely won't agree at first.

96
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,250
But you have to be patient and wear him down.

97
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,458
Just keep pestering him shamelessly.

98
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,125
If that really doesn't work,

99
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,416
then try crying, making a scene, and threatening.

100
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,916
That's how I used to deal with him.

101
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,666
Even though he's a bit difficult,

102
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,458
he's afraid of me pestering him.

103
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,791
As the saying goes,

104
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:04,708
good things

105
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,750
take time and effort.

106
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,208
But,

107
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,958
your mom is getting even harder to deal with.

108
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,250
Yesterday, as soon as I mentioned switching majors to her,

109
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,666
she got angry right away.

110
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,708
You'd better think of a solution.

111
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,000
What did my mom say?

112
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,250
Your mom,

113
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,833
was really intense.

114
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,583
Yesterday, I told her I wanted to switch majors.

115
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,833
She exploded immediately.

116
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,791
I thought you had calmed down these past few days.

117
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,583
Turns out you were just waiting for me here, huh?

118
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,833
Ever since you messed up the speech contest,

119
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,000
and now you want to switch majors,

120
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,916
was this all part of your plan?

121
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,833
How long are you going to keep causing trouble?

122
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,083
I'm telling you, if you switch majors,

123
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,125
I do not agree with this.

124
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's see which teacher dares to help you switch.

125
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,500
And that was it.

126
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,791
I really don't know.

127
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,791
How did you manage to deal with your mom?

128
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,083
She used to

129
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,666
respond to gentle persuasion, not force.

130
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,291
But ever since the subject change,

131
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,250
she doesn't respond to anything.

132
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,458
Hurry and help me think of a solution.

133
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,833
I don't know what to do either.

134
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:55,916
Chen Jing'an,

135
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,625
maybe you shouldn't change subjects.

136
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,333
With your intelligence,

137
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,583
if you work hard at liberal arts,

138
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,666
there shouldn't be any problem.

139
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,583
Just stop upsetting my mom.

140
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,166
Okay?

141
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,166
Didn't we agree last time?

142
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:06,875
Zhu Nian Nian,

143
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,375
changing subjects is the only option right now.

144
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,875
You can't just give up because of a little difficulty.

145
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:12,916
If I go back now

146
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,333
and admit I was wrong, saying I won't change subjects,

147
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,875
what will your parents think of me?

148
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,250
They'll think I'm not serious.

149
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,333
Then I'll be stuck in the middle, pleasing no one.

150
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,375
But how do you know

151
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,375
that studying liberal arts won't work out?

152
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,583
You haven't even tried your best.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,666
Aren't you just judging based on one test paper

154
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,291
and giving up because it was hard?

155
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,791
What do you mean by that?

156
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,416
Are you blaming me for everything now?

157
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm not blaming you.

158
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,083
I just think

159
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,875
changing subjects isn't the only way.

160
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,625
Then find a path you can actually take.

161
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:40,625
One that doesn't require changing subjects,

162
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,625
doesn't make your mom angry,

163
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,208
and won't mess up your exams.

164
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,250
Do you have such a path?

165
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,125
No.

166
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,291
Then what do you want to do?

167
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,250
I don't know.

168
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,750
Do whatever you want.

169
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,791
What's wrong?

170
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,666
Why are you unhappy?

171
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,958
You girls are really so difficult.

172
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,583
You back off as soon as there's a problem.

173
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,083
We had already agreed on this before.

174
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,083
And now you suddenly back out.

175
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,625
It's really making me mad.

176
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,375
Did you have a fight with Chen Jing'an?

177
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,083
Yeah.

178
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,083
It's fine.

179
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,500
So what if you argued?

180
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,708
You two were never really on the same page anyway.

181
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,541
Last time I asked her to help you make a connection,

182
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,041
she kept making excuses too.

183
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,583
I don't think you can rely on her at all.

184
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,250
You don't need to please her.

185
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,958
You don't need to go to her anymore.

186
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,208
If you need anything, just ask me to be with you.

187
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,833
I'm definitely more reliable than her.

188
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,583
Are you really reliable?

189
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:54,875
Very reliable.

190
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,833
Right now,

191
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,833
I'm actually having a bit of trouble.

192
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,458
Can you help me think of a solution?

193
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,500
What's going on?

194
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,041
I'll definitely help you.

195
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,083
I want to change departments.

196
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,291
What?

197
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,708
You want to change departments?

198
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,333
Come on.

199
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,375
Go, Zheng Chuan!

200
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,041
Come on, use your strength!

201
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,416
Put some strength into it, Zheng Chuan! Go!

202
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,208
Take him down!

203
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,666
Use your strength!

204
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,958
Yes, don’t hold back!

205
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,916
Put in some effort!

206
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,208
Push!

207
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,083
Harder, harder!

208
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,541
Give it here!

209
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,208
Chen Jing'an.

210
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,250
Do you want to eat?

211
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:05,958
Tian Ye.

212
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,208
You’re giving away something that’s not yours again.

213
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:10,875
Thanks, I’m not eating.

214
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,416
What’s wrong with you?

215
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,250
You look so down.

216
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,291
You...

217
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,208
Did Chen Changning knock you out again?

218
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:19,833
What’s up with her?

219
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,375
How would I know?

220
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,958
From the looks of it,

221
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,500
it doesn’t look good.

222
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,541
You jinxer!

223
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,208
That Deng Shasha...

224
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,958
Not only does she refuse to help me switch departments,

225
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,708
now there’s another person stopping me from switching.

226
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,291
What are you doing?

227
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,375
Can we talk for a bit?

228
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,625
I don't have anything to talk about with you.

229
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,750
Aren't we friends?

230
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,375
You want to be friends with me?

231
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,708
It's not that easy.

232
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,208
I'm a big deal at No. 2 High School.

233
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,541
How hard is it?

234
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,250
Didn't we have a good chat before?

235
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,000
Don't try to get close to me.

236
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,916
If you act like this, it makes me think you

237
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,166
have bad intentions.

238
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,458
What could you possibly do

239
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,166
to make me think you have bad intentions?

240
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,791
D-don't come over here.

241
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:33,750
I'm annoyed right now.

242
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:34,916
I don't have time for you.

243
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,708
Let me tell you,

244
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,166
no matter how upset you are, you still have to eat.

245
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,458
There's nothing

246
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,208
that can't be solved by a meal.

247
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:53,583
Right?

248
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,375
People are made of iron,

249
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:56,666
food is steel.

250
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,916
If you skip a meal, you'll be starving.

251
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,083
So trust me,

252
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:01,750
really,

253
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:02,708
eat more,

254
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,583
eat more meals.

255
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,458
Come here for a second.

256
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,833
I have something to tell you.

257
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,500
Well,

258
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:11,458
Well,

259
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,541
I'm going to the cafeteria first.

260
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,541
I've already spoken to the dean.

261
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,583
About your transfer to another class.

262
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,291
This afternoon, get ready to take the transfer exam.

263
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,875
The dean said the joint exams are coming up soon.

264
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,708
Applying for a transfer at this critical time

265
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,208
will be stricter than before.

266
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,583
Are you okay with that?

267
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,041
I can do it.

268
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,041
Good luck.

269
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,541
Stop playing, it's so hot.

270
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,041
Alright, Tianye.

271
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,125
You know I'm about to die from the heat.

272
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,375
It's not for you.

273
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,708
It's for Chen Jing'an.

274
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,708
Why isn't she back yet?

275
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,916
She'll be back after class.

276
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,416
You won't be able to wait for her.

277
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,750
The ice cream will melt.

278
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,500
Fine, fine, take it, eat it.

279
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,000
Okay.

280
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,250
Xiaopang, here.

281
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,416
Do you have any tissue?

282
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,291
No.

283
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,208
Here.

284
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,291
Let me introduce someone to everyone.

285
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,166
We have a new student transferring to our class.

286
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,291
Chen Jing'an.

287
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,166
Say hello to your classmates.

288
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,125
Hello everyone, my name is Chen Jing'an.

289
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,500
Please take care of me.

290
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,333
Niannian.

291
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,958
Why did Chen Jing'an transfer to our class?

292
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:04,958
I don't know.

293
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,375
You just...

294
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,375
Sit here.

295
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,125
You'll share a desk with Huang Jingmai.

296
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:12,875
Okay.

297
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:13,416
Go ahead.

298
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,458
Hello, my name is Huang Jingmai.

299
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,958
From now on, we'll be desk mates.

300
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,916
I know.

301
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,041
Know what?

302
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:08,958
Niannian

303
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,500
Chen Jing'an

304
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,541
Congratulations!

305
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,583
Congrats on successfully transferring departments.

306
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,958
I can't believe you actually fooled me.

307
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,541
Didn't you say this morning

308
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,458
that you hadn't mentioned the transfer to Chen Changning?

309
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,041
Didn't you also say

310
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,166
that transferring wasn't the only option?

311
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,583
Then why did you transfer?

312
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,541
I didn't mean to deceive you.

313
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,291
It's because

314
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,583
because...

315
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,250
Because of what? Just say it.

316
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:51,500
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,791
I thought we were on the same side.

318
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,708
When we run into problems,

319
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,500
we should help each other and solve them together.

320
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,250
Because of the joint exam,

321
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,333
I haven't slept well for days.

322
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,041
This morning,

323
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,458
I was worried you couldn't handle Chen Changning.

324
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,458
I was trying to come up with a solution for you.

325
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:06,666
And what about you?

326
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:07,916
Zhu Niannian,

327
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,166
you can't be so selfish.

328
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,333
Let me tell you,

329
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,000
this department,

330
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:17,916
I'm definitely transferring.

331
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,000
If you won't help me, I'll figure it out myself.

332
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,791
Chen Jing'an, calm down, don't be impulsive.

333
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,375
Let's take our time to discuss the transfer.

334
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,375
Take our time, my foot!

335
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,375
I'm not listening to you anymore.

336
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:29,791
Jing'an

337
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,125
I don't get it.

338
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,541
Changning

339
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,208
I really can't understand.

340
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,791
Chen Jing'an was doing well in science.

341
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,375
Why did you transfer her to liberal arts?

342
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,375
I'm sorry, teacher.

343
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,375
I can't explain this to you for now.

344
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:55,791
But switching subjects

345
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,416
is definitely the best choice right now.

346
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,625
Please calm down, teacher.

347
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:00,750
I won't calm down.

348
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,500
Chen Jing'an is someone I

349
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,541
worked so hard to train.

350
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,416
She was a promising physics student.

351
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,791
And now you've ruined her future.

352
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,291
How are you going to make it up to me?

353
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,833
How about an idea worth discussing?

354
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,041
What idea?

355
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:18,791
The memories of two people

356
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,916
or a soul swap

357
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,541
could that ever be possible?

358
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,125
There's no such technology in the world yet, right?

359
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,791
Teacher,

360
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,500
can you find any related research

361
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,375
or information?

362
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,166
As long as it exists,

363
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,541
I'm sure I can find it.

364
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,916
Then, when you have time,

365
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:36,958
please help me look into it more.

366
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:37,500
Alright.

367
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,250
Don't worry.

368
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,166
Thank you, teacher.

369
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,666
Class is about to start.

370
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,875
I'll go now.

371
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:44,625
Okay.

372
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,166
Go ahead.

373
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,791
Soul swap...

374
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:55,750
This kid is

375
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,500
deliberately changing the subject, isn't he?

376
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,041
This kid...

377
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:42,916
You didn't hurt yourself, did you?

378
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,625
I'm fine.

379
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:03,708
Let's go.

380
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,333
Be more careful next time.

381
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:29,250
Huiru.

382
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,166
We're back.

383
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:35,333
I'll go change my clothes first.

384
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:38,583
Mom.

385
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,458
Let me help you take care of your wound.

386
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,000
I remember

387
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,208
there was ointment for scrapes in the medicine Tianye bought last time.

388
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,083
No need.

389
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:49,791
I can do it myself.

390
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,000
Then I'll go make dinner.

391
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,833
Are you still going to eat or not?

392
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,416
Wait for me a bit.

393
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,958
I still have one last question to finish.

394
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:20,625
Almost done.

395
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,333
What question are you working on?

396
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,333
Mom,

397
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,541
I know you don't want me to switch majors.

398
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,250
It's because you're afraid I'm not good at science.

399
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,250
Wait until I finish this physics test.

400
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,000
You and Dad can check my answers.

401
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:32,708
Then you'll see

402
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,041
I'm not bad at physics at all.

403
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,625
I can totally switch to science.

404
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,583
Do it later.

405
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,333
Eat first, do you hear me?

406
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,208
Just give me two more minutes, I'll be done soon.

407
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:49,916
Alright.

408
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:50,583
I'm done.

409
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:51,791
The answers are here.

410
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:52,958
You can check them.

411
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,125
I'm going to eat first.

412
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:11,958
I didn't expect

413
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:13,791
you could cook for yourself.

414
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,541
I only know

415
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:18,958
how to boil dumplings or cook noodles and things like that.

416
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,708
Just try it, see how it is.

417
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,291
Thank you.

418
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:43,750
What are you looking at?

419
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,208
Is it good?

420
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,291
It's good.

421
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:50,000
Thank you.

422
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:09,208
Nian Nian

423
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:10,833
Be honest with Dad.

424
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,958
Did you really think it through

425
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,875
before deciding to switch to science?

426
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,416
Yes, really.

427
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:19,291
I really plan to study science seriously.

428
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:20,291
And

429
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,000
I just finished a physics test.

430
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,750
Once Mom grades it, you'll see.

431
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:25,958
Okay.

432
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:27,333
Dad believes you.

433
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,083
But switching subjects

434
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:31,458
should be done gradually.

435
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,541
Your mom's health lately

436
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,125
hasn't been very good.

437
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,208
She can't handle too much stress.

438
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,583
We refused your request to switch before

439
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,541
because we were afraid you were acting on impulse.

440
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:45,750
It could delay your own progress

441
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,250
and hurt your mom.

442
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:48,625
So, as your dad,

443
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:51,583
I hope you make your decision after careful consideration.

444
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:52,625
Only then should you decide.

445
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,750
As long as you don't regret it,

446
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,666
I will support you unconditionally.

447
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,333
And I'll help you convince Mom.

448
00:28:58,666 --> 00:28:59,458
Because

449
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,416
we both love you.

450
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:26,833
Mom,

451
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:28,958
how many points did I get?

452
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:58,250
Congratulations, Nian Nian.

453
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,875
You've transferred to our class.

454
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:02,833
That's right.

455
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:03,750
Tian Ye

456
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:04,583
From now on,

457
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:05,666
we'll be desk mates.

458
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,416
Let's go to the bathroom.
