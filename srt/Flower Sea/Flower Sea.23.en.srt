My dad found out too soon.

3
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,800
If I'd known, I would've hidden
the letter and paper.

4
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,930
Actually, after my dad found out,

5
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,600
I even felt a bit relieved.

6
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,180
Luckily, my dad is relatively rational.

7
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,010
If my mom found out

8
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,850
that we'd switched,

9
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,390
I'm afraid...

10
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,010
Mom.

11
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,390
What's wrong?

12
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,180
Huiru,

13
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,510
this is

14
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,800
a bit complicated

15
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,390
and not easy to accept.

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,930
So, you hid it from me?

17
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,510
She's my daughter.

18
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,930
I carried her for ten months

19
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,300
and raised her for 16 years,

20
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,100
and now she's become someone else?

21
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,640
How long did you want
to hide this from me?

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Forever?

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,470
Mrs. Zhu...

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,390
Don't talk to me.

25
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,760
By the way, answer me:

26
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,510
When exactly did this happen?

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,010
It was September 15.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,510
That's why

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,760
you've been

30
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,430
so rebellious lately, right?

31
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,510
I'm sorry, Mom.

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,850
We didn't mean to hide it from you.

33
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,010
We were just afraid

34
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,410
you wouldn't be able to accept it.

35
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,720
Let's go to the hospital.

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,930
Let's find out what happened.

37
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,080
- Let's go.
- Huiru.

38
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,180
This is way too bizarre,

39
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,250
and

40
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,680
they might not even find anything.

41
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,600
If this gets out,

42
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,640
it won't be good

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,610
for Niannian or Jing'an.

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,760
Then tell me what to do.

45
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,100
What should we do?

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,260
Jing'an, at this point,

47
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,230
you can't hide it
from your parents anymore.

48
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,010
We'll tell them first

49
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,100
and figure out what to do.

50
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,020
Okay?

51
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,180
I'll call your dad now

52
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,430
and set up a time.

53
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,770
Actually,

54
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,390
we came so suddenly

55
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,260
to tell you something.

56
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,760
It's about our daughter.

57
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,770
What is it?

58
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,600
Thanks for coming all this way.

59
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,410
Here's the thing.

60
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,270
Actually,

61
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,100
she is Jing'an,

62
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,010
your daughter.

63
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,010
The Jing'an you see

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,510
is actually our daughter,

65
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,930
Niannian.

66
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,040
We got the wrong baby?

67
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,390
I don't know.

68
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,220
No.

69
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,890
You might've misunderstood me.

70
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,390
I mean,

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,890
their souls,

72
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,510
or rather, their memories,

73
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,050
have switched.

74
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,010
Mr. Zhu, are you joking with us?

75
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,760
Mom,

76
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,510
they're not joking.

77
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,930
Dad, Mom,

78
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,010
I really am Chen Jing'an.

79
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,260
What?

80
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,180
Wait, hold on.

81
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,390
I...

82
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,100
I don't understand what you mean.

83
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,550
You've completely confused me.

84
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,260
She is Chen Jing'an.

85
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,850
Though she's in Zhu Niannian's body,

86
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,100
her consciousness is Chen Jing'an's.

87
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,510
She's in Chen Jing'an's body,

88
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,890
but her consciousness is Zhu Niannian's.

89
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,010
Simply put,

90
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,100
they've swapped souls.

91
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,930
What?

92
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,510
How is that possible?

93
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,390
When I first learned about it,

94
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,050
I also found it unbelievable.

95
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,600
How could something like this happen?

96
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,640
Dr. Zhang.

97
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,890
Lately,

98
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,760
your daughter's personality
has changed a lot.

99
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,430
Didn't you notice?

100
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,760
Yes, her personality changed,

101
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,390
but girls change as they grow up.

102
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,500
It's normal
for their temperaments to shift.

103
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,640
How could something like this happen?

104
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,140
No wonder...

105
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,100
No wonder I felt Niannian

106
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,720
seemed

107
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,300
so familiar.

108
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,300
She's actually Jing'an.

109
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,300
You're really Jing'an?

110
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,770
Don't worry.

111
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,390
I just contacted the President on Weibo

112
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,180
and set up a meeting for tomorrow.

113
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,650
Maybe you could still switch back.

114
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,020
Really?

115
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,650
We won't know until we meet.

116
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,220
Don't worry.

117
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,050
Everything has its pattern.

118
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,230
Once we meet the President tomorrow,

119
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,260
this will all be over.

120
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,680
But I'm scared...

121
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,050
Don't scare yourself first.

122
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,770
Changning,

123
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,800
go back to your room and rest.

124
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,760
I want to talk to Jing'an for a bit.

125
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,640
Okay?

126
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,600
Sure.

127
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,270
Jing'an,

128
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,350
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,260
We haven't been good parents.

130
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,760
Something this big happened,

131
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,430
and we were the last to know.

132
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,760
Jing'an,

133
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,050
do you remember
when you first came here?

134
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,100
You were so timid back then.

135
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
You only spoke

136
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,010
to Chen Changning,

137
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,640
not me or your dad.

138
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,600
I thought back then

139
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,390
that you didn't want me,

140
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,550
and you wanted a boy.

141
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,510
Silly child.

142
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,550
We brought you home.

143
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,800
How could we not want you?

144
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,850
But when Chen Changning said

145
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,510
he was going to bring me home,

146
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,300
you two didn't seem

147
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,350
very glad.

148
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,300
You got us wrong.

149
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,010
Do you know why?

150
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,930
Before we went to the welfare home,

151
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,760
Chen Changning said

152
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,510
he wanted a younger brother.

153
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,600
So,

154
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,930
when he brought you

155
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,300
to stand in front of us,

156
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,180
we were a bit surprised.

157
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,140
The first time

158
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,350
you called me "Mom",

159
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,260
I was especially moved.

160
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,010
I cried.

161
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,050
You asked me why I was crying

162
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,190
and even wanted to blow sand
out of my eyes.

163
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,930
You remember all that?

164
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,260
Of course.

165
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,260
I...

166
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,600
I have a good memory.

167
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,100
Yes.

168
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,930
You have a good memory.

169
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,760
That's why you've always remembered

170
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,180
your background.

171
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,680
Your dad and I both knew that,

172
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,800
but we never dared to bring it up

173
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,260
or meddle in it.

174
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,140
We were afraid you'd be sad.

175
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,300
And back then,

176
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
you were always with Changning,

177
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,390
so

178
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,350
we just let

179
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,760
Changning take care of you.

180
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,850
But we didn't expect...

181
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,930
We didn't expect that you'd grow

182
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,930
more and more distant from us.

183
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,720
Mom...

184
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,100
Jing'an,

185
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,140
I want to apologize to you.

186
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,540
No.

187
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,010
I understand.

188
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,510
I know you've always had

189
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,930
my best interests at heart.

190
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,800
I admit:

191
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,010
When I was little, I didn't understand

192
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,510
and blamed you.

193
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,010
But now that I've grown up,

194
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,300
I understand everything.

195
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,600
It was wrong of me

196
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,550
to hide this from you.

197
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,510
I made you worry.

198
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,140
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,760
Please stop crying.

200
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,970
We'll both stop, okay?

201
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,010
Things have come to this.

202
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,800
We can't change it.

203
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,300
Let's not overthink it.

204
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,530
I've lived with Jing'an

205
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,100
day and night for three months.

206
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
And she's leaving now.

207
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,550
I really can't bear it.

208
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,930
Isn't she adopted?

209
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,020
How about this?

210
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,100
We can treat her like our daughter

211
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,300
and bring her here to live with us.

212
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,930
That's a good idea.

213
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,680
We'll bring Jing'an back

214
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,140
and let her live with us.

215
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,850
If they switch back one day

216
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,800
and she wants to go home, she can.

217
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,260
If she doesn't,

218
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,390
it's all the same anyway.

219
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,500
They're both our daughters.

220
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,760
Will Jing'an's parents

221
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,180
agree to that?

222
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,850
Then how about this?

223
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,890
Let the two of them

224
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,020
spend some time

225
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,010
living with us

226
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,260
and some time living with them.

227
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,640
This way, they'll become

228
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,180
our shared daughters.

229
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,510
Isn't that great?

230
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,300
That's a good idea.

231
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,180
Right?

232
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,010
Then why don't we

233
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,600
go talk to them now? Come on.

234
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,470
Huiru.

235
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,680
It's so late.

236
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,250
Let's wait until tomorrow.

237
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,200
Tomorrow morning,
I'll take Niannian over.

238
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,260
You can make breakfast at home

239
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,050
and get ready to welcome Jing'an back.

240
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,970
How about that?

241
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,970
- Okay.
- Let's sleep.

242
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,390
Come in.

243
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,430
You're still awake?

244
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,550
I'm scared.

245
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,100
What if Zhu Niannian and I

246
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,430
can never switch back?

247
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,350
The future is long.

248
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,970
No matter what,

249
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,680
don't give up hope.

250
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,200
What if the worst happens?

251
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
When we were little,

252
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,600
we pinky-swore

253
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,800
to be best friends forever.

254
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,930
No matter what happened,

255
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,850
we'd always stay together

256
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,390
and never be apart.

257
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,470
Did we?

258
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,550
I don't remember.

259
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
Then remember it again.

260
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,600
You're so childish.

261
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,070
Have you remembered it now?

262
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,300
Yes, I have.

263
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,600
We have to always be together

264
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
and will never be apart.

265
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,510
You must remember that.

266
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,600
That is

267
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,600
how things are.

268
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,260
Sorry to bother you

269
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,890
so early in the morning.

270
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,390
Niannian's mother

271
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,550
has been badly shaken,

272
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,210
and she's not in a good mental state.

273
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,180
So,

274
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,260
we want to bring Jing'an

275
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,890
to live with us too.

276
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,220
After all,

277
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,260
her face right now

278
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,600
is Niannian's.

279
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,680
I know this is

280
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,930
a bit selfish,

281
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,100
but we'll treat Jing'an

282
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,180
just like our own daughter.

283
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,850
If they switch back
by some stroke of fate

284
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,100
and Jing'an wants to return,

285
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,050
she can.

286
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,140
Jing'an,

287
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,680
this is something

288
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:18,890
we can't decide

289
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,010
for you.

290
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,720
Tell us.

291
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,350
What do you plan to do?

292
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,260
What if

293
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,890
we can't switch back?

294
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,260
No one can say for sure

295
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,880
whether you can switch back or not.

296
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,930
Jing'an,

297
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,510
we've heard some things

298
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,010
about your background.

299
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
It's not very polite

300
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,760
to bring it up now,

301
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,510
but if you can't switch back,

302
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,970
we will absolutely

303
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,890
treat you like our own daughter.

304
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,430
And in a way,

305
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,890
Niannian and Jing'an

306
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,760
are both our daughters.

307
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,100
From the days
Jing'an has spent living with us,

308
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,010
I can see

309
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,010
she's been very happy.

310
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,390
Jing'an.

311
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,760
Tell me the truth.

312
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,930
Do you like

313
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,640
living in their place?

314
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,470
Of course.

315
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,430
I can imagine

316
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,050
why you like it there.

317
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,010
When I was little,
I also had a princess dream.

318
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
It's perfectly normal for girls.

319
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,260
So, you don't need to feel guilty.

320
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,510
Just tell me the truth.

321
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,850
Do you like the Zhu family?

322
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,510
At first, I did like it.

323
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
But that's because

324
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,550
I thought we could switch back.

325
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,300
Then what do you think

326
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,400
about Mr. Zhu's suggestion?

327
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,010
Jing'an,

328
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,180
before you came to our home,

329
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,760
your dad and I

330
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,390
already had our biological child,

331
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,850
but since we decided

332
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,760
to bring you home,

333
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,050
we've completely treated you

334
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,100
as our own daughter.

335
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,510
We love you very much.

336
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,010
We can't bear to part with you.

337
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,260
Neither can Changning.

338
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,930
We truly hope

339
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,010
you'll stay.

340
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,970
Of course,

341
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,470
if you decide

342
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,140
to go to the Zhu family,

343
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,010
we'll respect your choice.

344
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,010
Why are you crying?

345
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,260
I...

346
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,640
I didn't want to say this.

347
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,300
I didn't want to pressure you.

348
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,180
But this is really

349
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,430
what I think.

350
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,640
Alright, don't cry.

351
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,510
Crying isn't Jing'an's style.

352
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,390
Then why did you name me Jing'an?

353
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,690
We didn't think too much about it.

354
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,010
We just wanted you to have a name

355
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,500
that'd make it sound like you're part

356
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,930
of the same family as Changning.

357
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,430
Do you not like it?

358
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,600
I like it.

359
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,640
Alright, stop crying.

360
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,010
Look. Niannian and her dad

361
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,850
are still here.

362
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,010
What are you thinking?
Give us an answer.

363
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,510
Whatever you decide,

364
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,960
your dad and I will always love you.

365
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,010
I won't leave you.

366
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,350
But right now,

367
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,930
Mrs. Zhu is emotionally unstable.

368
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,930
I'll go stay with her for a few days.

369
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,800
Once she calms down,

370
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,930
I'll come back.

371
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Is that okay, Mr. Zhu?

372
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,730
Yes, of course.

373
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,250
Then I'll go pack my things

374
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,450
and head to their place.

375
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,720
Dad, Mom.

376
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,260
I'm leaving.

377
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,140
Don't worry.

378
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,430
We'll take care of Jing'an.

379
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,470
Chen Jing'an,

380
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,220
where are you going?

381
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,220
Changning.

382
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,930
Jing'an is going to live
with them for a few days.
