1
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,041
Chen Jing'an

2
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:10,958
What do you think about dating at a young age

3
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,208
Do you have any opinions on it

4
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:14,833
Young love

5
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,375
If it's about young love

6
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,041
I think

7
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,041
At our age

8
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,666
Having a crush on someone

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,375
is pretty normal, right

10
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:30,750
So, do you

11
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,750
have a crush on someone

12
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:37,833
No

13
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,166
Really

14
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:41,916
What about you

15
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,041
Do you

16
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,750
have special feelings for any girl

17
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,458
Of course not

18
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:56,458
Then

19
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:57,666
If

20
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,541
you like someone

21
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,458
would you be with her

22
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,625
Impossible

23
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:10,875
Don't get off topic

24
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:13,541
You're in high school now

25
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,000
You should know what you should do

26
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,166
and what you shouldn't do

27
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,250
Chen Jing'an, you're hesitating

28
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:22,457
I'm not

29
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,125
You'd better really understand

30
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,541
If I find out you're dating early

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,332
Chen Jing'an, you're done for

32
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,291
I understand

33
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,000
And also

34
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:33,832
From now on, you're not allowed

35
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:35,250
to hang out with Li Minqiu anymore

36
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,207
Okay

37
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,332
Wait for me a moment

38
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,207
Why are you here?

39
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,332
Chen Jing'an.

40
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:10,666
I came here specifically to apologize to you.

41
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,291
Look.

42
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,582
I bought you lots of snacks.

43
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:18,791
What's wrong?

44
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,457
Nothing.

45
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:21,832
I came here just to apologize to you.

46
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,082
I hit you yesterday.

47
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,082
That was my fault.

48
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,666
I found out you live here.

49
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,207
So,

50
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,332
I made a special trip to apologize.

51
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,666
All of these are for you.

52
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,250
Since there are so many tasty things,

53
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:32,625
please don't hold it against me.

54
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:33,957
Also,

55
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,375
can I ask you for a favor?

56
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,041
Help me explain things to Nian Nian.

57
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,582
It's all just a misunderstanding.

58
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,416
From now on, I'll look out for you.

59
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,582
If anyone tries to bully you,

60
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:42,500
just let me know anytime.

61
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,375
Where did the snacks come from?

62
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,332
Tian Ye bought them.

63
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,791
He said he was apologizing to me.

64
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:13,707
Didn't he already give you

65
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:14,500
medicine yesterday?

66
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,040
He said just medicine wasn't enough.

67
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:19,165
So he bought some snacks too.

68
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,790
But Tian Ye doesn't live here.

69
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,375
He made a special trip to bring them.

70
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,415
Do you want a drink?

71
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,415
I don't want any.

72
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:38,875
Chen Jing'an.

73
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:41,665
Remember what you promised me yesterday.

74
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,333
That's great.

75
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,665
Your roundabout strategy.

76
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,665
What are you planning to do next?

77
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:54,915
What roundabout strategy?

78
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:56,665
Which history question?

79
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,333
You don't have to hide things from me.

80
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,375
I know everything.

81
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,665
I thought so before.

82
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,415
You should be more proactive.

83
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,915
Now you're starting with Chen Jing'an.

84
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:10,250
That's actually a good idea.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What do you mean, starting with me?

86
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,500
What are you doing to me?

87
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,790
What is she talking about?

88
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,583
So what are you going to do next?

89
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,708
What next step?

90
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,208
There's no next step.

91
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:23,875
Nian Nian.

92
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:29,583
Didn't you make a good start yesterday?

93
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,000
Why are you backing off today?

94
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,790
Nian Nian, Nian Nian, wait for me, Nian Nian!

95
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:39,915
You order.

96
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,458
Hurry up, hurry up.

97
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,375
It's my turn, it's my turn.

98
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,083
Can you do it or not?

99
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:44,833
Don't distract me.

100
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,958
It's my turn, let me try.

101
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:48,000
Which one of you can do it?

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,875
Can you do it?

103
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:49,875
I have to be better than you.

104
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:50,665
Not as good as me.

105
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:51,708
Hurry up and hit him.

106
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,915
You guys are playing—what are you playing?

107
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,583
Chen Jing'an

108
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,165
When did you get rich?

109
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,750
It's the first time I've seen you buy so many snacks.

110
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,915
Is it because I played basketball with you yesterday

111
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,708
and even stayed up late for you,

112
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,165
that you were moved by my actions

113
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,165
and bought these for me on purpose?

114
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:08,083
Yes.

115
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,665
I bought them just for you.

116
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,458
Chen Jing'an, you love me so much.

117
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,875
You're welcome, you're welcome, no need to thank me.

118
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,833
These are a reward from Chen Jing'an.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,915
Your humble servant thanks you.

120
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,500
Thanks, but I won't eat any.

121
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,333
It's okay.

122
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,708
I'll save some for you.

123
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,583
Alright, everyone.

124
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,208
Please take a close look at this question.

125
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,125
The solution approach for this question

126
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:51,540
is a key point for this month's exam.

127
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,165
If you master the solution approach for this question,

128
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,333
in this month's exam,

129
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,583
you can score at least ten more points.

130
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,540
Tian Ye

131
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,208
please explain

132
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:11,415
the solution approach for this question.

133
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,000
This question...

134
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,040
This question...

135
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,415
Put your hand down.

136
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,333
Put it down.

137
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,415
Tian Ye

138
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,750
Let's think about it later.

139
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,750
Think carefully about what to eat.

140
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:41,790
Niannian, look.

141
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,208
It's Chen Jing'an.

142
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,915
Let's call her to join us later.

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,915
Let's go eat in the cafeteria.

144
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,415
We can't give up halfway.

145
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,165
Chen Jing'an

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Have lunch with me and Nian Nian at noon.

147
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,415
Sure.

148
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,208
I-I'll join too, I'll join too.

149
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,583
Tian Ye

150
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,333
I need to talk to you about something.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,290
How's your nose? Is it better?

152
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,041
It doesn't hurt now, it's much better.

153
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:34,666
That's good.

154
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,291
What's wrong with you?

155
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,416
My eyes are uncomfortable.

156
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:44,916
Nian Nian

157
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,083
Hurry and let her help you make a connection.

158
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,458
What connection?

159
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,083
Forget it.

160
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,291
I'll just talk to her for you myself.

161
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,500
Chen Jing'an

162
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,708
Try this dish.

163
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:56,958
It's really delicious.

164
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:58,791
Thank you.

165
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,458
Just now

166
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,041
What did Chen Changning want with Tian Ye just now?

167
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,416
I don't know.

168
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:05,666
Why do you care about other people's business?

169
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,375
Whatever it is, it doesn't affect our meal.

170
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:13,791
Which one of you kicked me?

171
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,041
Chen Jing'an

172
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,916
Your brother is so outstanding.

173
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,083
There must be a lot of people who have a crush on him.

174
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,708
Do you often help him pass love letters?

175
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,500
No way.

176
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,125
Chen Jing'an would never do something so tasteless.

177
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:27,708
That's right.

178
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,541
I've never helped anyone pass a love letter.

179
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,625
I see.

180
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,041
I think,

181
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:34,708
Chen Changning

182
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,000
is like a walking clothes hanger.

183
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,333
Even such an ordinary school uniform

184
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:38,916
looks

185
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:39,958
tailor-made on him.

186
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,000
And look at our Nian Nian,

187
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,791
she's also like a clothes hanger.

188
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,750
When the two of them stand together,

189
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,833
it's like they're wearing couple outfits.

190
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:47,666
I think

191
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,875
this one is also really delicious.

192
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:50,500
Try it.

193
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,916
Okay, okay.

194
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,083
At school

195
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,666
There are many people chasing after Chen Changning

196
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,041
for sure

197
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,541
But I think none of them

198
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,791
are good enough for Chen Changning

199
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,250
The only one who is good enough for Chen Changning

200
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:07,916
is only

201
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,083
What's wrong with you?

202
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:11,500
Are you okay?

203
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,666
Are you okay, Chen Jing'an?

204
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,083
Drink your soup

205
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,166
Okay

206
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,250
Where was I just now?

207
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,041
Oh, right

208
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:21,916
Chen Changning

209
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:23,875
Just one meal

210
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,000
How many times have you mentioned Chen Changning during this meal?

211
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,166
Are you using him as a side dish?

212
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:26,833
But

213
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,625
Yeah, that's right

214
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,208
Let's hurry up and eat

215
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,666
The announcement will start urging us again soon

216
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,333
I'm done playing.

217
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:06,791
I'm done, I'm done.

218
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:07,666
I'm not playing anymore.

219
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,625
I haven't even had breakfast.

220
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,291
I came here just to get beaten by you.

221
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,250
I have something to ask you.

222
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,333
What is it?

223
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,791
Just to ask me something,

224
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,250
you had to beat me up this badly?

225
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,875
This way you'll tell the truth.

226
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,416
What do you want to know?

227
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,375
If I know,

228
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:30,625
and if I don't know,

229
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:31,958
I'll tell you everything.

230
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,833
Next time my mom beats me,

231
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,125
can I come to you for help?

232
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,166
Let's get to the point.

233
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,125
Do you think Chen Jing'an has been acting strange lately?

234
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,041
I think

235
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,750
her temper has gotten better.

236
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,416
That's not it.

237
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,041
She and that Li Minqiu from yesterday—

238
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,500
what's their relationship?

239
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:57,958
They're just friends from playing ball.

240
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,833
They met last time playing.

241
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,333
Why are you asking about this?

242
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,500
There's nothing fishy between them?

243
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:04,708
Fishy?

244
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,458
What could be fishy?

245
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,250
I suspect they're dating.

246
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,625
No way.

247
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,500
Chen Jing'an and Li Minqiu?

248
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,875
How could that be?

249
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,083
You're that sure?

250
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,375
Do you know the yogurt you're drinking

251
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,208
who bought it?

252
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,250
Chen Jing'an did.

253
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,541
It was Li Minqiu.

254
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:41,875
How is that possible?

255
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,083
Chen Jing'an clearly said she bought it for me.

256
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,750
Chen Jing'an didn't want me to know

257
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,750
that it was Li Minqiu who gave it to me.

258
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,541
So she told me you bought it.

259
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,166
Those two...

260
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,083
How could that be?

261
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,750
How could Chen Jing'an possibly like him?

262
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,750
You have to pick the right side now.

263
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,166
You absolutely can't cover for Chen Jing'an.

264
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,791
If she has any news, tell me immediately.

265
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,166
Got it?

266
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,666
You want me to

267
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,083
be a mole?

268
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,041
No,

269
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:20,875
an informant.

270
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,333
Alright.

271
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,625
I'll definitely keep an eye on Chen Jing'an for you.

272
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,833
We absolutely can't let her keep

273
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,500
going down the wrong path.

274
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,166
It's "wrong path."

275
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,375
As long as you get the idea.

276
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,750
Goodbye, teacher.

277
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,458
Goodbye, classmates.

278
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,541
What's wrong?

279
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:09,708
Chen Jing'an.

280
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,333
I heard a story recently.

281
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,958
Don't you want to know what the story is?

282
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
No, I don't.

283
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,916
Then let me tell you.

284
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,250
The story is about

285
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,125
a

286
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,041
naive and innocent female student

287
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:27,791
who, despite

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,708
her family

289
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:29,833
and friends' warnings,

290
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:30,583
she

291
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,250
was tricked by a delinquent

292
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,375
with sweet talk

293
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:35,916
and lost both her money and her innocence.

294
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,250
In the end,

295
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:39,916
she was disfigured,

296
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,333
got into a car accident,

297
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:42,666
had an abortion,

298
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,625
and was abandoned by everyone.

299
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,750
She died with regret.

300
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,333
She

301
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,083
was really miserable.

302
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,083
You actually believe such a fake story?

303
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,166
We live in a society ruled by law now.

304
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,166
The country wouldn't allow things like that to happen.

305
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,291
There are still a lot of delinquents nowadays.

306
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,166
What if it happens?

307
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,375
That kind of thing shouldn't happen around here.

308
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:07,791
How could it?

309
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,416
I think

310
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:11,875
Li Minqiu

311
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,916
is exactly that kind of person.

312
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,125
No way.

313
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,333
Li Minqiu

314
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,333
just looks hard to get along with,

315
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,791
but he's actually a good person.

316
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,083
It's over.

317
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,166
It's over.

318
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:32,500
Chen Jing'an has been completely brainwashed by Li Minqiu.

319
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,083
What can I use to save you?

320
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,541
My brother.

321
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:49,916
Niannian

322
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:52,875
Li Minqiu

323
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,125
What are you doing here?

324
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,541
You're even wearing our school uniform.

325
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,750
I borrowed the uniform just to come find you.

326
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,333
We haven't seen each other in so many years.

327
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,208
How have you been?

328
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,166
Me?

329
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm doing fine.

330
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,625
After I saw you yesterday,

331
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:06,666
when I went back last night,

332
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,083
I couldn't sleep the whole night.

333
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:08,875
No wonder.

334
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,125
You have dark circles under your eyes.

335
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,541
From now on,

336
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,500
go to bed early and get up early—it's good for your health.

337
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:14,708
Niannian

338
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,000
So you still care about me this much.

339
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,333
Do you remember when we were kids?

340
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,791
Once, when I got into a fight as a kid,

341
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,625
you even cried and put a bandage on me.

342
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,416
I'm not Zhu Niannian, how would I know?

343
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,541
Did you forget?

344
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,291
Of course I remember.

345
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,250
I just remembered I have something to do.

346
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,166
I need to go do my homework first.

347
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:33,958
I'll walk you back.

348
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,791
Li Minqiu

349
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,958
You're not even a student at our school.

350
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,708
What are you doing here?

351
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,583
What does me being here have to do with you?

352
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,291
I'm the student council president.

353
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,125
If someone suspicious

354
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,333
pretends to be a student and enters the school,

355
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,250
of course it's my business.

356
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,833
How am I suspicious?

357
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,458
I'm your sister's good friend, you know.

358
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,708
Did you get my permission to be her good friend?

359
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,083
I'm warning you.

360
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,583
Stay away from Chen Jing'an from now on.

361
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,208
Don't come to our school again.

362
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,666
You...

363
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,541
Why are you meddling so much?

364
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,083
I'm here to see Nian Nian about something.

365
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:07,958
Move aside.

366
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,916
I'll say it one more time.

367
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,458
Leave our school immediately.

368
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,083
Fine.

369
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,458
You win today.

370
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:17,750
But in the future,

371
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,458
I'll still come back.

372
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,833
And I'll bring a bunch of people with me.

373
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,583
Bye, Nian Nian.

374
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,375
What's going on?

375
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,708
Chen Changning is copying those TV heroes who save the damsel in distress.

376
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,166
Thank you.

377
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,416
Senior Chen Changning,

378
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,333
If he bothers you again,

379
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,500
you can tell me.

380
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,750
People like Li Minqiu

381
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,208
you must stay away from him.

382
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,500
Don't let him fool you.

383
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:51,791
Fool me?

384
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,541
He's just a bit annoying, that's all.

385
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,583
He wouldn't go so far as to trick people, right?

386
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,791
If someone like him wants to trick you,

387
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,791
you won't notice it so easily.

388
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,041
What's gotten into Chen Changning?

389
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,541
Senior Chen

390
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,375
Your senior year classroom

391
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,416
should be over there, right?

392
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,458
I need to go see a teacher

393
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,000
so it's on the way

394
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,291
You can actually say such a lame excuse

395
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,875
You really must be out of your mind

396
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,500
If Li Minqiu bothers you again

397
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,708
you can ask me for help

398
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:37,916
By the way

399
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,916
you can tell Chen Jing'an about Li Minqiu coming to see you

400
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:40,958
let Chen Jing'an know

401
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and remind her

402
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,333
not to get too close to Li Minqiu either

403
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:47,625
Okay

404
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,833
Being overly attentive for no reason

405
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,625
just doesn't seem like something Chen Changning would do

406
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,625
Could it be that he

407
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,625
is interested in Zhu Niannian?

408
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:01,833
Zhu Niannian

409
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,208
what's wrong?

410
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,625
I have something to do

411
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:07,750
I'll go first

412
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,208
Chen Jing'an

413
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,541
Here's what happened.

414
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,416
Now I think,

415
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,708
what your brother says

416
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,791
isn't completely unreasonable.

417
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What we should listen to,

418
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:46,958
we should listen to.

419
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,125
As for what we shouldn't listen to,

420
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,041
maybe just listen a little.

421
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,958
And as for what I say,

422
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:51,666
yes, that's right.

423
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,666
If you don't listen to Tian Ye's advice,

424
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,916
you'll suffer losses right away.

425
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,416
I really don't want you to go through those

426
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,375
unnecessary hardships.

427
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,083
and so on.

428
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:58,583
Right?

429
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,708
I'm truly sincere

430
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,875
in hoping you'll be well.

431
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,583
Please don't suffer those losses.

432
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,750
Your brother feels the same.

433
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,166
Even though he's not as attentive to you as I am,

434
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,541
Zhu Nian Nian

435
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,833
Chen Jing'an, I'm looking for you.

436
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:12,666
Come out.

437
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:17,875
So, you and Li Minqiu—

438
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,541
What exactly was your relationship when you were kids?

439
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,125
If he comes to see me again,

440
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:21,958
how should I handle it?

441
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,250
We were neighbors when we were little.

442
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,916
We used to play together a lot.

443
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,708
He took good care of me.

444
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,250
Later, he moved away,

445
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,916
so we didn’t really keep in touch.

446
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,625
You don’t need to worry too much.

447
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,583
If he brings up the past again,

448
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,291
just say you don’t remember.

449
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,625
After all, it’s been years since you last met.

450
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,625
Even if you slip up a little,

451
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,500
he probably won’t notice.

452
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,291
That’s good, then.

453
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,875
He came to see me today.

454
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,958
He said a bunch of things.

455
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,625
I didn’t know how to respond.

456
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:49,958
I was so afraid I’d give myself away.

457
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,000
Luckily,

458
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,041
Chen Changning sent Li Minqiu away.

459
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,375
Chen Changning sent Li Minqiu away.

460
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,083
Yeah.

461
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,250
Chen Changning also told me

462
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,500
a bunch of strange things.

463
00:20:58,916 --> 00:20:59,541
Like what?

464
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,250
He told me to keep my eyes open,

465
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,541
that there are a lot of people who play both sides,

466
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,666
and things like that.

467
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,916
Now that you mention it,

468
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,458
Tian Ye was acting weird today too.

469
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,583
He kept hinting to me just now

470
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,166
about the dangers of high school girls hanging out with delinquents.

471
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,375
Besides,

472
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,750
yesterday Chen Changning was asking me

473
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,041
what I think about dating at a young age.

474
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
He even forbade me from hanging out with Li Minqiu.

475
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,666
And today Tian Ye hinted at these things again.

476
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,041
Do they really think

477
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,833
that Li Minqiu and I are dating?

478
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,458
You and Li Minqiu?

479
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:31,541
It should be

480
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,708
you

481
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,250
and Li Minqiu.

482
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,583
How is that possible?

483
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,583
Their imagination is wild.

484
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,708
Why don't they go write a novel?

485
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,125
It must have been

486
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,666
a misunderstanding from when we played basketball yesterday.

487
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,458
I'll talk to Minqiu about this.

488
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,791
Let him help explain it.

489
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,416
You have to make sure he understands.

490
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,750
My lifelong reputation

491
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,083
can't be ruined by him just like that.

492
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:51,875
Also,

493
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:52,875
tell him from now on at school

494
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:53,708
not to come looking for me.

495
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,500
Even if I become someone like Zhu Niannian,

496
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,541
your reputation can't be ruined by him either.

497
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:58,625
Did you hear me?

498
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,166
Five

499
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,208
Four

500
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,041
Three

501
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:12,833
Two

502
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:13,375
One

503
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,291
Time's up.

504
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:23,000
How many?

505
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,500
Forty-five.

506
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,541
Changning, have you finished recording?

507
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:27,916
I'm exhausted.

508
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:28,541
Teacher.

509
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:29,916
Teacher.

510
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:30,708
Here you go.

511
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,833
Take these soccer balls to the equipment room.

512
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:34,666
Remember to count them.

513
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:35,541
Okay.

514
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,375
Look at your results.

515
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,333
You don't usually exercise.

516
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:42,708
And you slack off during practice.

517
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,500
Why did you bring me here?

518
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:49,416
Niannian.

519
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,083
Chen Changning.

520
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,250
Is waiting for you inside.

521
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,333
Deng Shasha.

522
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:55,291
What is it?

523
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,041
Shasha.

524
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,291
What?

525
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:02,125
Niannian.

526
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,125
In fifteen minutes,

527
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,041
I'll come back to open the door for you.

528
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,916
Shasha! Shasha!

529
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,250
Why are you here?

530
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:21,500
I'm here to return the ball.

531
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:23,916
Why did she lock the door?

532
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:26,958
It's a prank.

533
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,166
She'll open it soon.

534
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,333
Just wait till I get out, I'll deal with her.

535
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,416
It's fine.

536
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:33,791
I'm not busy anyway.

537
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,875
If you're not in a hurry,

538
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,916
I actually have something I want to tell you.

539
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:45,958
Alright then.

540
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Go ahead, senior.

541
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:49,875
Zhu Niannian,

542
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,125
actually, I'm a bit curious.

543
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,916
How did you become friends with Chen Jing'an?

544
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:57,166
I was able to become friends with her

545
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,166
because

546
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,375
I think she has a great personality.

547
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,125
She is

548
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,833
warm and cheerful,

549
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,000
lively and generous.

550
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,125
The main thing is,

551
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:11,083
she's also very loyal.

552
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:12,708
You seem to be

553
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,125
the first female friend I've seen Chen Jing'an have.

554
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,625
That's because they just don't recognize her worth.

555
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,125
As for me, Zhu Niannian,

556
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,458
I'm not like that.

557
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,583
You don't think

558
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,041
Chen Jing'an is unpopular, do you?

559
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,291
That's not it.

560
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,166
If you ask me,

561
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,125
you don't really understand Chen Jing'an at all.

562
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,541
Why do you say that?

563
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:38,791
Then tell me,

564
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:40,791
what do you think of Chen Jing'an?

565
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,083
Although Chen Jing'an may seem

566
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,208
like a bit of a tomboy

567
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:47,708
and acts carefree all day

568
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,833
she's actually very sensitive

569
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,916
She also has a headstrong personality

570
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,916
Once she sets her mind on something

571
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,166
nothing can change her mind

572
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,791
Wait, no

573
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:01,916
Are you complimenting her

574
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,166
or saying something bad about her

575
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:03,583
I...

576
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:04,791
I'm a bit confused by what you're saying

577
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
With a personality like hers

578
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:08,125
it's hard to say if it's good or bad

579
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,083
If she meets the right people and opportunities

580
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
then of course it's a good thing

581
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:15,333
But if she misjudges

582
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,791
it will only bring her pain

583
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,166
Isn't that a bit of an exaggeration

584
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,208
I think Chen Jing'an has good judgment

585
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,500
She has good judgment

586
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:26,375
Are you talking about Li Minqiu

587
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,041
I...

588
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:30,416
No.

589
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:31,833
What's going on between her and Li Minqiu?

590
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:34,250
I suspect they're dating early.

591
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,333
How is that possible?

592
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:36,875
I...

593
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:38,666
I assure you,

594
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:39,541
those two,

595
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:40,625
Chen Jing'an

596
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,125
would never like Li Minqiu.

597
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,291
Why are you so sure?

598
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,333
Do you know something?

599
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:45,958
I...

600
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,708
I don't know how to explain it to you.

601
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,000
But you can be completely at ease.

602
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,083
There's absolutely no way Chen Jing'an

603
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,333
would like Li Minqiu.

604
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,833
It's just Li Minqiu having a one-sided crush on Chen Jing'an.

605
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:56,833
No.

606
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,750
Why can't you get this straight?

607
00:25:59,375 --> 00:25:59,833
Then...

608
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:00,625
Tian Ye

609
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:01,958
Is it possible between Tian Ye and Chen Jing'an?

610
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:02,958
Impossible.

611
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,875
She never saw Tian Ye as the opposite sex.

612
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:06,458
See, that's exactly it.

613
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:07,916
As for Li Minqiu,

614
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:09,541
it's even less possible than with Tian Ye.

615
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,958
That's the best outcome.

616
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,541
Zhu Niannian

617
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,750
Actually, I'm really glad that Chen Jing'an could become friends with you.

618
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,750
It makes me quite happy.

619
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:28,875
Our family situation is a bit special.

620
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:31,083
Both our parents are extremely busy with work.

621
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:32,958
You could say that Chen Jing'an

622
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,333
grew up with only me by her side.

623
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,541
She has always been strong-willed since she was little.

624
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:37,541
But she also lacks a sense of security.

625
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,083
Sometimes she can be quite blunt when she speaks.

626
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,333
Especially towards those close to her.

627
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,083
But that's just her straightforward personality.

628
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,416
She gets over things as soon as she says them.

629
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,666
I didn't expect

630
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,375
that you actually understand her quite well.

631
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:56,958
I'm telling you all this

632
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,500
because if you two ever have a fight one day,

633
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,041
please don't take it to heart.

634
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:02,583
Don't hold it against her.

635
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:05,500
If you

636
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,416
could talk to Chen Jing'an like this normally,

637
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,291
maybe she wouldn't get so annoyed with you.

638
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,333
Has she ever complained about me to you?

639
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:14,541
No, not at all.

640
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:16,791
I just figured it out myself.

641
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:18,833
It's fine.

642
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:20,875
That's just how we get along.

643
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,208
Chen Jing'an

644
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:29,250
Tian Ye

645
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,291
I have something to do, so I'll head out first.

646
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,375
Take this, take it.

647
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:42,416
Where's Chen Jing'an?

648
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:43,708
She just left.

649
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,375
Oh no, I forgot what I was supposed to do.

650
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:57,833
Chen Jing'an

651
00:27:59,166 --> 00:27:59,708
Where's Niannian?

652
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,083
She hasn't come out yet.

653
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,291
Let's go to the milk tea shop.

654
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,333
I have something to tell you.

655
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,583
Is Chen Jing'an crazy or what?

656
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:22,875
Have you seen Chen Changning?

657
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,375
He went that way.

658
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,166
Why are you looking for him?

659
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,208
I haven't finished talking yet.

660
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,416
Is Chen Changning in the equipment room?

661
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:37,208
No, he's not.

662
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:38,250
I don't believe you.

663
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,708
You're not allowed to go over there.

664
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,500
Let me go over there.

665
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,333
It's none of your business.

666
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:43,375
You're not allowed to go.

667
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:45,458
Tian Ye.

668
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,541
Tian Ye, open the door.

669
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:47,833
Coming.

670
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:51,250
Chen Changning.

671
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,541
Chen Jing'an and Li Minqiu.

672
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:53,791
They went to the milk tea shop.

673
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:05,458
About what happened yesterday.

674
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,250
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

675
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,041
I didn't take it to heart either.

676
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:10,708
So,

677
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:11,666
you don't need to

678
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,041
give me these snacks.

679
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:13,875
Or

680
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,625
wait for me at the school gate.

681
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,833
My brother and my friends all misunderstood.

682
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:24,708
They thought we were dating early.

683
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,916
And Nian Nian also said

684
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,250
she doesn't blame you.

685
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:34,958
So you also don't need to

686
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,208
come and apologize to me.

687
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,166
That's good, that's good.

688
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:41,416
When I went to find her, she barely talked to me.

689
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,166
I thought she was still mad at me.

690
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,000
Jing'an

691
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:55,750
Nian Nian

692
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:56,625
Why are you here?

693
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,583
I came to see someone catch a cheater.

694
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:01,291
Catch what?

695
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,041
That...

696
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,291
Let me treat everyone to milk tea.

697
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:10,958
Sure, sure!

698
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:13,583
I want

699
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,291
snow top milk tea

700
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,208
with full sugar and pearls

701
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,500
and extra ice cream
