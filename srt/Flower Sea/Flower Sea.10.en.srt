1
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:10,958
Then

2
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,375
Goodbye

3
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:14,750
My

4
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,083
friend

5
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:18,750
husband

6
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,000
my beloved

7
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,041
We will meet again

8
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:25,416
my beloved

9
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,458
I will never give up any chance

10
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,875
to express my true feelings to you

11
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,125
Nian Nian

12
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:35,666
Nian Nian

13
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:36,916
Answer, Nian Nian

14
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,875
I'm not feeling well

15
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,166
I'll leave first

16
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,791
I can't go home late, goodbye

17
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:09,875
What are you looking at?

18
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,125
Nothing

19
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,832
I

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,957
I just remembered

21
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,207
Tian Ye and Liu Yu

22
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,082
It seems they're

23
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:19,125
rehearsing for the musical show

24
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:20,707
I wonder how their practice is going

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,541
It will definitely be a blast when the time comes

26
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:39,707
Dad

27
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,207
Why are you here?

28
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:42,750
Didn't I say I had rehearsal?

29
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,125
I worked overtime today.

30
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:45,082
I saw it was about time.

31
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,250
So I came to pick you up.

32
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,916
The car is parked in the parking lot.

33
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:48,791
Let's walk over.

34
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,375
Okay.

35
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:50,457
Oh, right, Dad.

36
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,166
This is

37
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,500
the one I often mention to you,

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,375
Chen Jing'an.

39
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:56,666
My classmate, Chen Jing'an.

40
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:57,541
Hello.

41
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,250
Uncle.

42
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:00,625
Hello.

43
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,500
Let's hurry home.

44
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,750
Don't keep your mom waiting.

45
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:04,625
Let's go.

46
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:19,625
I miss home.

47
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,082
What do you want for dinner?

48
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,457
We'll eat out later.

49
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:29,375
Sure.

50
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:16,165
Take a break, take a break.

51
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:16,875
Let me rest for a bit.

52
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,208
I'm so tired.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,500
Oh my god.

54
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,625
I'm exhausted.

55
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,875
You danced like that and you still want to rest?

56
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,083
Get up, get up, get up.

57
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:24,915
Get up.

58
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm telling you all,

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,333
stop putting on these song and dance shows.

60
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:31,915
Just call it

61
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,958
Wrestling Comedians.

62
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,708
You're the only one who talks big.

63
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,375
Liu Yu.

64
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,250
You haven't been practicing properly at home, have you?

65
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:39,625
During the performance,

66
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,915
if you dare to just sit down,

67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
I definitely won't let you off.

68
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:43,375
Alright.

69
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,625
I know, I know.

70
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,333
Just let me rest for a bit.

71
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,833
I'll get up and practice right away.

72
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,415
Let me tell you,

73
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:57,583
you used to

74
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,500
really be neighbors with Zhu Niannian?

75
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:00,875
Of course.

76
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,375
When we were kids, Niannian

77
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,415
always called me Brother Minqiu.

78
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:06,290
Tian Ye.

79
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,958
Then hurry up and call him brother-in-law.

80
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,250
Don't—

81
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:09,833
talk nonsense.

82
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,750
I'm warning you,

83
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,083
don't even think about Niannian.

84
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:16,665
Otherwise,

85
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,583
you

86
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:21,665
just put your heart

87
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:22,665
back in your stomach.

88
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,415
Fellow students,

89
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:31,540
Hello, teachers.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,333
I am Chen Jing'an from Class 8, Grade 11.

91
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,000
It's a great honor to be here

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
to participate in the host selection competition.

93
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,083
Many of you might be curious

94
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,415
why I am standing here.

95
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,833
Hello, teachers.

96
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:45,790
Hello, fellow students.

97
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,083
I am Liu Xinyi from Class 8, Grade 11.

98
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,415
I am Zheng Sixuan from Class 1, Grade 11.

99
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:51,125
This time,

100
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,375
I am running for the host position.

101
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,040
Because I believe some opportunities

102
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,000
must be fought for by oneself.

103
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:57,708
I think

104
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,833
an entertaining event like the school anniversary

105
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:00,790
especially needs

106
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,500
a lively host like me to set the mood.

107
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,208
Support me,

108
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,000
this opportunity to be the school anniversary host

109
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,415
is the start of me pursuing my dream of hosting again.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,790
The voting results are in my hands.

111
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,208
The student who won first place

112
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,540
performed exceptionally well just now.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,665
The host for this school anniversary is

114
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,500
Chen Jing'an.

115
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,165
Thank you, teacher.

116
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,790
Thank you, teachers.

117
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:45,165
Thank you, fellow students.

118
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:45,958
Thank you.

119
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,540
Thank you, everyone.

120
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,915
How could it be Chen Jing'an?

121
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,250
I don't know.

122
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,665
I've never seen her participate in this kind of event before.

123
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,915
Yeah, why is it her?

124
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,165
No idea.

125
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,500
But she did perform pretty well on stage.

126
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:08,958
Chen Jing'an

127
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,833
How did your competition go?

128
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,458
I got first place.

129
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:14,958
Really?

130
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,458
You're amazing!

131
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,458
First place!

132
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,083
It was my first time hosting a competition.

133
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,165
And I beat some people with experience.

134
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,708
Looks like you need talent for everything.

135
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,875
What's the use of just working hard?

136
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,208
Don't you think so?

137
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,458
Congratulations on becoming the host.

138
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,915
This chicken drumstick is your reward.

139
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,500
This is way too much.

140
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,750
I can't finish it all by myself.

141
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,500
Shasha

142
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:54,500
Let's eat together.

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,375
The three of us can share.

144
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,290
Um...

145
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,458
We have PE this afternoon.

146
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,540
Can you eat like this and be okay?

147
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,250
I'm fine.

148
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,915
I actually just want a Walkman.

149
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,458
But it's too expensive.

150
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,000
And my mom won't give me money.

151
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,915
So I have to save on food.

152
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,665
I still need my Walkman for the next few days.

153
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,833
Otherwise, I could lend it to you.

154
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,290
But you shouldn't make things hard on yourself.

155
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,750
Where's my food?

156
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:25,750
It's all yours.

157
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,375
Eat as much as you want.

158
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:26,958
Eat until you're full.

159
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:28,833
Thanks, Nian Nian.

160
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,500
I think this dish is pretty good.

161
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,375
Let me try it.

162
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,125
Sure, it's all yours.

163
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,041
Eat the drumstick.

164
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:42,625
Okay.

165
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:52,833
Nian Nian

166
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you listening to music?

167
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,083
No.

168
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,375
I always have trouble remembering my lines.

169
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,541
So I recorded them all in here.

170
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,666
I listen to them a few more times whenever I have free time.

171
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,791
Don't worry.

172
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,041
You definitely won't have any problems acting in the play this time.

173
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,416
At last semester's arts presentation,

174
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,083
didn't you do really well?

175
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,500
I even helped you pick the poem for your recitation.

176
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,416
What did you originally want to choose?

177
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,541
Bei Dao or that Shu Ting?

178
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,250
I forgot.

179
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,875
If you forget, just let it go.

180
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,166
Are you still rehearsing in private?

181
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,166
No, I’m not.

182
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,166
Chen Jing'an is preparing to host now.

183
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,166
There isn’t much time either.

184
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,166
Don’t worry.

185
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,458
If I really can’t memorize it,

186
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,208
I’ll secretly bring it with me during the performance.

187
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,791
I’ll listen and act at the same time.

188
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,458
Will that work?

189
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,500
Of course it will.

190
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,333
But it’s strange, actually.

191
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,625
When I rehearse privately with Chen Jing'an,

192
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,958
I’m pretty fluent.

193
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,708
But when it’s time to perform,

194
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,291
as soon as I see Romeo’s face,

195
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,333
I can’t remember anything.

196
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,125
But it’s okay.

197
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,250
I’ll listen to it a few more times.

198
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,375
It’ll definitely be fine.

199
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,666
Then let me help you rehearse.

200
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,000
We’ve known each other for so long.

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,166
We already have a good understanding.

202
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,333
It’ll definitely be twice as effective with half the effort.

203
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,541
I was just worried you wouldn’t have time.

204
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,458
We’re good friends.

205
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,125
Of course we should help each other.

206
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,541
It’s really not necessary.

207
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,625
Right now,

208
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,166
I just need to memorize the lines.

209
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,208
Nian Nian,

210
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,666
why are you being so distant with me now?

211
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,541
I didn't.

212
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,666
You did.

213
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,750
You used to come to me whenever you had something going on.

214
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,583
I was always there with you.

215
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,583
But ever since Chen Jing'an came along,

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,583
you only go to her when something happens.

217
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,166
You don't even think of me anymore.

218
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:31,500
That's not true.

219
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,791
Why are you getting angry for no reason?

220
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,375
She and I are good friends.

221
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,375
Isn't it normal for me to ask her for help?

222
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You wouldn't really be mad at me just because of this, would you?

223
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,375
Right.

224
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,166
There's nothing wrong with you going to her.

225
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,708
You two are the ones who belong in the same world.

226
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm just being too petty, I shouldn't have—

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,458
gotten in between you two and become a bother.

228
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,166
I'm leaving.

229
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,958
Haven't you memorized your lines yet?

230
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,750
If I listen a few more times, I'll remember them.

231
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,458
Jing'an.

232
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,500
You can do it!

233
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:53,875
I won't talk to you anymore.

234
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:54,791
I'll go first.

235
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,666
I'm going to change clothes.

236
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:56,416
Okay.

237
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,541
See you later.

238
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,541
Where is An'an?

239
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,375
Up ahead.

240
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,541
A lot of people came today.

241
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,333
Where should we sit?

242
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,500
Here.

243
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,208
In that spot.

244
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,625
What about An'an? Where is An'an?

245
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,166
She has a performance soon.

246
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,541
She's backstage.

247
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,708
Mom, Dad.

248
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,208
Let's sit here first.

249
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,625
The performance is about to start.

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,791
Over at the student council,

251
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,833
there are still some things to take care of.

252
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:29,583
I'll head over there first.

253
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,083
Alright.

254
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:30,625
Go ahead and take care of it.

255
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,458
Don't let it get delayed.

256
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:31,958
Okay.

257
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,875
When Nian Nian goes on stage later,

258
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,166
take plenty of photos.

259
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,583
I know, don't worry.

260
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,500
I'm a little nervous.

261
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,666
I wasn't even this nervous the first time I went on stage.

262
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,708
Why are you nervous? We're just watching a show.

263
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,083
Of course I'm nervous.

264
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,541
She's the host this time.

265
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,500
I never knew before

266
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,833
that she actually had this talent.

267
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,250
Just relax.

268
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:56,458
Take it easy.

269
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:16,375
Nian Nian,

270
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,250
your outfit looks amazing.

271
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,208
I don't even know what words to use to praise you.

272
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,750
Teacher Yu's outfit looks great too.

273
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,500
Two different styles of beauty.

274
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,375
Did you guys notice?

275
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,083
I'm

276
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:27,583
uh,

277
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,875
a Western princess,

278
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:29,750
and the teacher is

279
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:30,750
an Eastern princess.

280
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:32,791
This...

281
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,625
It's more than just a princess.

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,583
It's like a fairy descended to earth.

283
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,041
Stop it, you guys.

284
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,083
You're making me embarrassed.

285
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:39,958
Teacher,

286
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,291
you really look great.

287
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,125
In the future,

288
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,125
you should wear it more often.

289
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,083
It's perfect

290
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:44,708
for promoting

291
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,500
the beauty of our traditional Chinese clothing.

292
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:49,333
Tian Ye,

293
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,750
wipe your drool.

294
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,750
It's about to start.

295
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,500
Let's go ahead.

296
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,166
Okay.

297
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:58,708
Let's go.

298
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,333
Thank you.

299
00:13:59,416 --> 00:13:59,875
Go.

300
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,333
Hello everyone,

301
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,625
students,

302
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,458
this is an exciting moment.

303
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,208
Our Nancheng No. 2 High School

304
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,791
has weathered sixty years of ups and downs.

305
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,000
We have overcome many obstacles along the way,

306
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,250
pressing forward through hardships.

307
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,708
We have nurtured countless outstanding students.

308
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:31,875
Tonight,

309
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,333
we will accompany our alma mater

310
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,416
to celebrate together

311
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,958
its sixtieth birthday.

312
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,750
Let us wish our alma mater

313
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,750
a happy birthday.

314
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:47,375
Tonight,

315
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,500
the first performance

316
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
is a play,

317
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,750
an excerpt from Romeo and Juliet.

318
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,375
It is directed by Teacher Shi Jie,

319
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,083
starring Zhu Niannian from Class 1, Grade 11,

320
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,875
and Wang Lihong from Class 1, Grade 10.

321
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,500
Let us welcome them with a round of applause.

322
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,291
I gaze up at you in the night.

323
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,291
You are like a mortal in this world,

324
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,000
with eyes full of wonder.

325
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,041
Looking up at a winged angel,

326
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,208
riding on white clouds,

327
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,750
slowly gliding across the sky.

328
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,458
Romeo,

329
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,833
why must you be Romeo?

330
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,500
Deny your father,

331
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,166
and abandon your name.

332
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,250
Your name

333
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,416
is my greatest enemy.

334
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,750
Whether you are a Montague

335
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,375
what does it matter?

336
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,833
It is not a hand,

337
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,208
nor a foot,

338
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,708
nor any other part

339
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,791
of your body.

340
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,375
Even if you were not a Montague,

341
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,458
you would still be yourself.

342
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,166
So whether you are a Montague

343
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,083
what does it matter?

344
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,041
Then I will do as you say.

345
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,041
If you call me your love,

346
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,208
I will be reborn,

347
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,583
given a new name.

348
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,541
From now on,

349
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,125
I will no longer be called Romeo.

350
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,458
Who are you?

351
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,250
Why, in the darkness of night,

352
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,208
do you hide and listen to me speak?

353
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,833
I cannot tell you my name,

354
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,958
for it is your enemy.

355
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,041
If I were to write it on paper,

356
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,833
I would tear those words to pieces.

357
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,375
I recognize your voice.

358
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,833
Are you Romeo?

359
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,541
A Montague?

360
00:17:58,875 --> 00:17:59,666
No.

361
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,000
Beauty

362
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,541
If you think these two names

363
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,500
aren't very good,

364
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,583
let me know.

365
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,291
How did you get here?

366
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,916
Why did you come here?

367
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,000
I borrowed love's light wings

368
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,625
and flew over the wall.

369
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,833
As long as it's within my power,

370
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,791
I'll risk anything to try.

371
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,375
It's already dawn.

372
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,708
You should go quickly.

373
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,958
If my family finds you here,

374
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,708
they'll kill you.

375
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,000
Your eyes

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,250
are more dangerous than twenty swords.

377
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,500
As long as you look at me gently,

378
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,250
my body

379
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,416
won't be harmed.

380
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,666
The lark is urging you to leave with its song.

381
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,166
Now, you must go.

382
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,708
It's getting brighter.

383
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,500
It's getting brighter.

384
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,166
But our sorrowful hearts

385
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,500
are growing darker.

386
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,125
Then let the daylight in

387
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,583
and let life go out.

388
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,583
Farewell, farewell.

389
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,791
Give me one more kiss

390
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,250
and I'll go down.

391
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:10,708
Oh no.

392
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,875
I forgot my lines here again.

393
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,291
My husband

394
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,333
My beloved

395
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,291
My friend

396
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:34,708
I must

397
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,833
hear from you every hour of every day

398
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,083
hear your news

399
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,458
because a minute feels like many days

400
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,041
if you count it this way

401
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,583
by the time I see

402
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,916
my Romeo again

403
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,458
I don't know how old I'll have become

404
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,583
Goodbye

405
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,958
I won't give up any chance

406
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,750
to express my true feelings to you

407
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,416
So

408
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,500
will we have a chance to meet again?

409
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,541
We definitely will

410
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,333
All the sorrow and pain we're experiencing now

411
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,791
will become stories to share when we meet and talk in the future

412
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,083
Alright

413
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,333
You did really well just now.

414
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,375
Thanks to your reminder.

415
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:26,625
What's wrong?

416
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,458
My Walkman is missing.

417
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,875
I definitely put it in my bag just now.

418
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,041
Think about it, maybe you put it somewhere else.

419
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,791
I just put it in my bag.

420
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:35,625
But...

421
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,500
The zipper was open just now.

422
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,166
Someone must have stolen my Walkman.

423
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,541
Think carefully again.

424
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:48,833
Are you sure you didn't put it somewhere else?

425
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,958
No way, I put it in my bag.

426
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,666
Calm down first.

427
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,708
How can I calm down?

428
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,583
That was my birthday gift from my dad last year.

429
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,708
What kind of Walkman is it?

430
00:21:58,958 --> 00:21:59,833
I'll help you look for it.

431
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,291
That Walkman...

432
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,750
An'an lent it to me.

433
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,000
An'an specifically reminded me.

434
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,208
It was a birthday gift from her dad.

435
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,583
So I can't lose it.

436
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,541
Hello, Teacher Deng.

437
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:24,666
Hello.

438
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,000
Teacher, you haven't left yet?

439
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,458
Not yet.

440
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,000
Bye.

441
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:30,208
Hello, Teacher.

442
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,166
Teacher Deng.

443
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,583
You haven't left yet?

444
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,166
I'm waiting for you.

445
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,208
Waiting for me?

446
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,125
Why is your voice hoarse?

447
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,375
I've been tired all day, so my voice is hoarse.

448
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,416
It really makes people feel sorry for you.

449
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:49,750
This is for you.

450
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,708
For me?

451
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:51,833
Thank you.

452
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,875
Your performance today was amazing.

453
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,708
Let me show you one.

454
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,666
You have such a presence.

455
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:01,625
You really have it down perfectly.

456
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:02,750
I can't pull it off myself.

457
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,000
Isn't that frustrating?

458
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,375
Don't make fun of me.

459
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,416
I'm just average.

460
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,333
I'm so awkward on stage.

461
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,666
I get extremely nervous.

462
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,166
When it comes to being impressive, you're way better.

463
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,208
Your science fiction novels are so well written.

464
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,333
I really like the character designs in them.

465
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:17,125
Really?

466
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:18,416
Then I

467
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:19,458
will try

468
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,416
to find more inspiration

469
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,000
and write another one.

470
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:22,666
Sounds great.

471
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,208
If I get inspired,

472
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,625
can I talk to you privately?

473
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:26,416
As for me,

474
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,166
I really want to know

475
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:29,458
the opinions of female readers.

476
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:30,875
Especially from

477
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,166
someone like you, Teacher Minmin,

478
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:33,291
who is both cute

479
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,166
and gentle,

480
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,000
and also enjoys science fiction novels,

481
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,916
an outstanding young female teacher.

482
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:39,916
Sure.

483
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:40,916
If

484
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,500
you write another one,

485
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,583
I'll definitely read it.

486
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,625
That's wonderful!

487
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:51,666
Come on.

488
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:52,708
Have some meat.

489
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,750
You need to eat meat to grow taller.

490
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,541
Thanks, Mom.

491
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,041
Shasha,

492
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,166
the girl who played Juliet in your class today,

493
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,083
was that Zhu Niannian?

494
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,083
Yeah.

495
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:02,958
It was Niannian.

496
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,166
I have to say,

497
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,791
this Niannian is really talented.

498
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:06,750
Her performance was excellent.

499
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,166
And that host, Chen Jing'an,

500
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,833
has she been hanging out with you guys a lot lately?

501
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:13,416
Yeah.

502
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,250
Why?

503
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,541
That girl,

504
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,458
her hosting skills

505
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,333
are just like Dong Qing.

506
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,208
What do her parents do?

507
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,916
Her parents are doctors.

508
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:27,625
No wonder.

509
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:29,500
Shasha,

510
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,125
let me tell you,

511
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,916
your classmates are your first social connections

512
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:33,916
when you enter society.

513
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,958
You should build a good relationship with both of them.

514
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,750
Niannian goes without saying,

515
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,041
but Chen Jing'an,

516
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,750
you should get along well with her too.

517
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,208
In the future,

518
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:42,791
if you ever go to the hospital,

519
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:43,958
if you get sick or something happens,

520
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,375
wouldn't it be good to have someone to look out for you?

521
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,500
Look at my son,

522
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,625
he's really great.

523
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,083
Mom,

524
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,875
have one if you're tired from studying.

525
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:05,458
Thank you.

526
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:11,208
Mom,

527
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,291
you've been busy all day.

528
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:14,791
You should get some rest early.

529
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:16,958
Go to bed now.

530
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:17,833
You have school tomorrow.

531
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:18,791
Go on.

532
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:26,833
Mom, I'm sorry, I was wrong.

533
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:30,500
I swear,

534
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:31,708
from now on,

535
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,666
when I perform in plays,

536
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,041
I'll definitely memorize my lines well.

537
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:35,875
From now on,

538
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,166
I absolutely won't act in romance plays anymore.

539
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,166
Please don't be mad at me anymore.

540
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,208
I'm not mad at you.

541
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,166
Really?

542
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,875
You don't know what your mom looks like when she's mad.

543
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:50,625
Tonight,

544
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,458
she watched more attentively than anyone.

545
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,625
That's right.

546
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:57,083
Watching you on stage,

547
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,041
I suddenly realized

548
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:02,250
my daughter

549
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,666
has already become

550
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,125
a grown-up girl.

551
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,833
You won't be with me for many more years.

552
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:10,291
Mom, don't worry.

553
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,625
I'll be with you for my whole life.

554
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:12,583
You won't be able to get rid of me.

555
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,000
Okay.

556
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:16,375
Okay.

557
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:34,333
Shasha,

558
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:36,041
I know

559
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:38,625
you haven't been happy lately.

560
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,083
Even though I moved to the science class,

561
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,083
and we spend less time together,

562
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:44,958
you've always

563
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,583
been my most important friend in my heart.

564
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,250
Nian Nian

565
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,500
I hope we can be

566
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,125
best friends for life

567
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,125
I got mad at you

568
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,541
because I thought you had changed

569
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,458
I understand

570
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:21,166
Then it's a deal

571
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:23,083
From now on, let's be like we used to be

572
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:26,458
Don't leave me to play with Chen Jing'an alone anymore

573
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:27,750
And also

574
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,166
No more keeping secrets

575
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,416
Walkman

576
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,875
It was your dad who bought it for Chen Jing'an.

577
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,125
She was really upset when she lost it.

578
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,083
She suspects

579
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,166
if someone is targeting me on purpose.

580
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,000
It's all my fault for dragging her into this.

581
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:18,625
Don't overthink it.

582
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,000
Let Chen Jing'an talk to the teacher today.

583
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,916
Ask them to check the surveillance cameras.

584
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,041
Let's figure out what happened first.

585
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,000
Do you think something else might happen?

586
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,833
I think our school's students

587
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,125
probably wouldn't do anything too bad.

588
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:33,916
After all, No. 2 High is a key provincial school.

589
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,250
Tell the teacher about this.

590
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,083
The school and teachers will handle it.

591
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:42,208
Okay.

592
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,041
Ever since Chen Jing'an joined us,

593
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,208
we haven't spent time together like before.

594
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:50,625
Just the two of us together.

595
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,250
It's not like we're dating.

596
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:55,416
A world for just two people

597
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:56,958
can't fit a third person.

598
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:03,458
Nian Nian,

599
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,875
let's go find Teacher Yu.

600
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,791
Instead of suspecting classmates, it's better to ask the teacher to check the cameras.

601
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,250
Let's see what really happened.

602
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,166
Such an official suggestion

603
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:10,875
must have come from Chen Changning,

604
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,333
that model student told you, right?

605
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:13,333
Alright.

606
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:14,333
Shasha,

607
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:15,083
you go back to the classroom first.

608
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,083
Jing'an and I will go to the teacher's office.

609
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:17,916
Okay, let's go.
