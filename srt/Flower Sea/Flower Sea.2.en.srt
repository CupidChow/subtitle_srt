1
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:22,166
What's going on?

2
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,500
Isn't this a dream?

3
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:26,916
Does your leg still hurt?

4
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:30,625
The school nurse said you should try not to get it wet for the next couple of days.

5
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:34,957
Nian Nian.

6
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:36,416
You've always been the kind of student

7
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,041
who never makes teachers worry.

8
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,457
Why did you mess around at the speech contest today?

9
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:51,625
I've really become Zhu Nian Nian.

10
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,582
Then the me just now

11
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,541
was the real Zhu Nian Nian.

12
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,832
Nian Nian.

13
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,582
Zhu Nian Nian.

14
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,791
I'm talking to you, are you listening?

15
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:08,832
Teacher.

16
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,750
What did you just say?

17
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,041
I said,

18
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,832
You turned a perfectly good contest into this.

19
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:16,666
Don't you think you owe me an explanation?

20
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,625
The principal already came to ask me about it.

21
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,375
If you keep up this attitude,

22
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,207
then I won't be able to protect you either.

23
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:27,000
You'd better think carefully about the consequences.

24
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:29,957
Teacher

25
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:32,541
I'm sorry

26
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:35,541
I didn't know it would turn out like this

27
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:37,166
What should I do, what should I do

28
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:38,625
Heavenly spirits, earthly spirits

29
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,000
Someone save me, someone save me

30
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:42,750
I don't know if this is

31
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,125
because you're going through a rebellious phase or something else

32
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:46,707
But you must remember

33
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,832
right now is

34
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:50,166
the most important moment in your life

35
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,666
You absolutely can't take the wrong path

36
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:53,791
You must explain everything to me clearly today

37
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:54,750
Yes

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,707
Teacher

39
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,166
Yes

40
00:03:57,832 --> 00:03:58,582
I'm rebelling

41
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:00,332
Yes, I'm rebelling

42
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,416
Rebelling

43
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,541
I knew it

44
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,500
You couldn't have changed like this for no reason

45
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,666
What's going on

46
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,750
Did something happen at home

47
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,250
Really

48
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:09,875
That's right

49
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,291
Something happened at home.

50
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:16,208
Right now, my feelings are very, very

51
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,333
very, very complicated.

52
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,083
So what happened?

53
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,290
Can you tell me about it?

54
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:24,583
Teacher,

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,125
It's not convenient to talk about.

56
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:30,540
Is there anything you can't tell your teacher?

57
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,750
I can help you.

58
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,083
Teacher,

59
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,833
I really can't say.

60
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,458
Alright then.

61
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:41,165
Go back

62
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,665
and think it over carefully.

63
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,750
Try to get yourself back on track as soon as possible.

64
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,000
About this matter,

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,875
I'll help plead your case with the school.

66
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,083
After all, you've always been

67
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,708
an excellent student in both character and academics.

68
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,415
But

69
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:54,125
you must remember

70
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:55,333
that this matter

71
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,665
absolutely must not happen again.

72
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:58,915
Do you understand?

73
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:01,208
Teacher,

74
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,208
don't worry.

75
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,540
It definitely won't happen again.

76
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:06,915
Goodbye, teacher.

77
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,375
Four days of classes,

78
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,583
three days off.

79
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,458
Raise your hand if you agree with me.

80
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,790
Really?

81
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,790
I'm not dreaming, am I?

82
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,415
Shasha

83
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,040
Are you calling me?

84
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:56,083
Shasha, it's me.

85
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:57,040
Sorry, Chen Jing'an.

86
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,958
I have something urgent right now.

87
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,083
You and I—

88
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,625
Let's talk next time.

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,290
Sorry.

90
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,958
So soul-swapping really exists in this world.

91
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:27,915
Calm down, calm down.

92
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,125
Maybe things will go back to normal soon.

93
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,625
I finally found you, Nian Nian.

94
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:38,125
I finally found you.

95
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you okay?

96
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,165
Deng Shasha

97
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,665
What happened with your speech just now?

98
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,583
Don't bring it up.

99
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,583
If I had known this was real,

100
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,750
I definitely wouldn't have done it.

101
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,415
Now I'm in trouble.

102
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:54,500
What do you mean, real or fake?

103
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,250
I don't understand what you're saying.

104
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,790
Your mom is with Teacher Yu right now.

105
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:00,958
When you go home today,

106
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:03,125
I have a bad feeling about it.

107
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,790
My mom has a pretty good temper.

108
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,208
She won't do anything to me.

109
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,165
Don't worry.

110
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,458
Go through this set of problems in the next few days.

111
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:43,875
Just one sentence?

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,583
Then what should I say?

113
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,415
If I told you

114
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,625
I'm not Chen Jing'an,

115
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,208
I'm Zhu Nian Nian,

116
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,083
you'd definitely think I'm talking nonsense.

117
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,500
Are you still mad at me?

118
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:02,415
Forget it.

119
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,665
What happened to your arm?

120
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:08,750
It's nothing.

121
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,583
I bumped it myself.

122
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,500
I'm always bumping into things.

123
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,290
Chen Jing'an.

124
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,375
Can you act more like a girl?

125
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,208
About what happened yesterday...

126
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,375
I...

127
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:38,625
Class is starting.

128
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,541
I'll head back first.

129
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:01,750
Nian Nian.

130
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,666
Today's speech contest...

131
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,791
Did you not do your best?

132
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,333
Today...

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,916
It was an accident.

134
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,291
It's okay.

135
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:19,916
Dad thinks...

136
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,666
you're already excellent.

137
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,000
It's just a competition.

138
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,625
You can't always get first place.

139
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,083
If you didn't do well this time,

140
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,875
just work harder next time.

141
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,458
I'll definitely try harder next time.

142
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,041
Oh my gosh.

143
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,750
Such an understanding dad...

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,416
Nian Nian is so lucky.

145
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,208
Huiru.

146
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,333
We're back.

147
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:00,333
Huiru

148
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,291
Do you know

149
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,333
what your daughter

150
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,000
did at school today?

151
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,833
Wasn't it just that she didn't do well in the speech contest?

152
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't put so much pressure on the child.

153
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,708
Didn't do well?

154
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,208
She almost pointed at the principal's nose and scolded him.

155
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,708
And you say she didn't do well?

156
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,083
What?

157
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,291
And you,

158
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,083
you say you're busy with work all day,

159
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,000
but with this little thing,

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,458
have you ever cared about Nian Nian?

161
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,333
I'm telling you,

162
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,416
she completely embarrassed me today.

163
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,083
Nian Nian,

164
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,333
what exactly happened?

165
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,291
Today...

166
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,291
What happened today was an accident.

167
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,416
An accident?

168
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:36,833
I'm asking you,

169
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,250
did you tell your homeroom teacher

170
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,208
that something happened at home?

171
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,416
I'm asking you, what happened?

172
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,708
Now you're even lying?

173
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,708
Are you being rebellious now?

174
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,291
No.

175
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,500
I've taken care of you since you were little.

176
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,083
I even quit my job for you.

177
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,833
I always gave you the best of everything.

178
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:56,958
Ask yourself,

179
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,875
how many mothers

180
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,458
could do what I have done?

181
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,250
But look at you.

182
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,500
Just to go against me,

183
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,875
you pull something like this.

184
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,625
Have you grown up so much

185
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,125
that you can do whatever you want now?

186
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,208
Please don't be angry.

187
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,750
I didn't do it on purpose.

188
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:12,833
I thought that...

189
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:14,875
I...

190
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,958
I...

191
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,291
I...

192
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:19,375
I...

193
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,125
I don't know how to tell you.

194
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,750
What do you mean you didn't do it on purpose?

195
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,041
I think you've been planning this for a long time.

196
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,958
Yesterday, on your birthday,

197
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,583
you talked back to me at the dinner table.

198
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,291
And today you pull this again.

199
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,625
What did I do wrong?

200
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,041
Why are you treating me like this? Tell me.

201
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,375
I didn't.

202
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:37,750
I really didn't.

203
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,041
I gave birth to you and raised you all these years.

204
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,833
Is this how you repay me?

205
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,416
Huiru.

206
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,416
Don't touch me.

207
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,541
Niannian.

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,833
Hurry and apologize to your mom.

209
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
You really were wrong today.

210
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,166
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,833
I didn't mean to.

212
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,916
I really don't know what you're thinking all day.

213
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:09,458
Nian Nian

214
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:10,458
It's okay.

215
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,000
You go back to your room first.

216
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,250
I'll go talk to Mom.

217
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,333
Chen Jing'an

218
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,083
Come out and eat.

219
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:48,750
Your favorite snail noodles.

220
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,083
I made them especially for you.

221
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,041
Try some.

222
00:12:58,958 --> 00:12:59,708
Do you want it spicy?

223
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,666
No, don't make it spicy.

224
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:13,791
Chen Jing'an

225
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,250
I didn't let you join the physics competition before.

226
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,416
I was too stubborn.

227
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,416
I take back what I said before.

228
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,750
If you want to participate, go ahead.

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,333
If there are any questions you don't understand,

230
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,000
you can always ask me.

231
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,875
Chen Jing'an, you've gone too far.

232
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,375
I made this especially for you.

233
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,500
It's already been a whole night.

234
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,708
Why am I still in Chen Jing'an's body?

235
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,375
What exactly do I have to do to get back to normal?

236
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:04,666
Chen Jing'an.

237
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,125
Why are you spacing out instead of eating properly?

238
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,083
Sorry.

239
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,166
How are you eating?

240
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,000
Your mouth is all greasy from eating.

241
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,875
This liberal arts material

242
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,375
is just way too boring.

243
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,583
If this keeps up, I'm really going to go crazy.

244
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,083
Niannian

245
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,250
Where are you going?

246
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,083
Being the school beauty

247
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,750
really does feel different.

248
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,750
Science subjects are just too tough.

249
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,583
I can't even understand the questions.

250
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,458
How did they all learn this stuff?

251
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:00,958
Kaiji

252
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,666
Give me the ball, hurry up, let's go play basketball!

253
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,416
Catch!

254
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:05,375
You

255
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,458
Come play basketball with me.

256
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,583
Tianye, are you crazy?

257
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,541
Tianye

258
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,625
Can you help me call Zhu from your class?

259
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,750
Call which Zhu?

260
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,583
Can you help me call someone from your class—

261
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,291
Chen Jing'an.

262
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,541
Alright, alright.

263
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:20,500
Chen Jing'an!

264
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:21,708
Someone's looking for you.

265
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,375
Why are you running?

266
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:42,708
Why are you running?

267
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,541
I know you're Zhu Niannian.

268
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,583
I know this whole thing is surreal.

269
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,208
It's hard for you to accept right now.

270
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,291
Me too.

271
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,708
But we're in the same boat now.

272
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,041
You can't run away.

273
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,541
Let's go.

274
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:13,708
You used my body

275
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,083
and nothing unusual happened, right?

276
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:16,583
No.

277
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:17,916
That's good.

278
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,166
Why did we end up like this?

279
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:22,708
I don't know either.

280
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:24,791
But don't worry.

281
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,125
I'll definitely have your back.

282
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,125
So, after you woke up yesterday morning,

283
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,291
you found yourself in my body?

284
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:32,625
By the way,

285
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,500
you didn't tell Chen Changning, did you?

286
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,000
He doesn't know.

287
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,250
That's good.

288
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,458
Based on my initial assessment,

289
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,083
I think we probably

290
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,583
swapped souls with each other.

291
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,625
We switched bodies with each other.

292
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,750
Just like what happens in novels.

293
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,041
Anyway, I think we have to

294
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,208
keep this secret from each other.

295
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,375
If someone else finds out,

296
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,541
about something this unbelievable,

297
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,458
once it's discovered,

298
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,250
we'll

299
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,125
be caught and turned into lab specimens.

300
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,333
Is it really that scary?

301
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,208
I thought we'd switch back today.

302
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,041
But that's not how it turned out.

303
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:07,750
And then,

304
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,083
I did something bad.

305
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,375
I messed up your speech contest.

306
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,625
Your mom was really angry.

307
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,000
She insisted

308
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,125
I was acting out because of something that happened before.

309
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,916
What exactly happened before?

310
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,458
I want to ask you that too.

311
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,416
Why did you mess up the speech contest?

312
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,125
I thought I was dreaming!

313
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,666
If I had known it was real,

314
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,083
I definitely wouldn't have gone up there.

315
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,833
This contest is really important to me.

316
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,166
My mom cares about it especially.

317
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,291
But now it's already happened.

318
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:36,958
Think of something.

319
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:37,875
Help me out.

320
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,125
Just think of it as helping yourself.

321
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,250
Tell me

322
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,666
the whole story behind this.

323
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,791
And think about how to make it up to your mom.

324
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:44,958
Actually,

325
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,125
I don't think we need to force ourselves to do anything.

326
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,250
Maybe we'll switch back soon.

327
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,208
You think we can switch back too?

328
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,583
Maybe.

329
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:54,791
But

330
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:55,625
before that,

331
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,458
we need to exchange some ground rules.

332
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,166
Ground rules?

333
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,375
During this period,

334
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,750
you can't do anything that would make my mom angry.

335
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:05,750
As for the rest,

336
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,833
I'll handle it when I get back.

337
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,625
Can you handle it?

338
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,583
We need to play each other's roles well.

339
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,541
So we have to know each other's likes and habits.

340
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:16,750
For example,

341
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,958
things you always do

342
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,583
and things you would never do.

343
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,791
If we haven't switched back by tomorrow,

344
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,625
let's exchange ground rules here.

345
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:24,625
Got it.

346
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,416
So, we

347
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,250
should keep in touch.

348
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:27,916
Oh, right.

349
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,541
Where's my phone?

350
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,791
It's in the nightstand drawer.

351
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,208
You can use it to contact me anytime.

352
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,166
Also,

353
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,083
before all this,

354
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,208
if you run into any trouble,

355
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,041
you can always come to me.

356
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:35,875
I'll protect you.

357
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:38,750
Um...

358
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:39,708
Class is about to start.

359
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,083
Let's head back first.

360
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:44,375
I almost forgot.

361
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,458
You girls are always so shy.

362
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,583
During this time,

363
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,416
you can't do

364
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,708
anything that would make my mom angry.

365
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,458
Do you understand?

366
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,291
I got it.

367
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,458
And you absolutely can't tell Chen Changning.

368
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,458
Do you not get along with your brother?

369
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,208
Just look at him.

370
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,125
Anyone who gets along with him must be weird.

371
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:40,875
Who are you?

372
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:42,833
Me.

373
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,083
Teacher Deng Hui.

374
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,416
Come over and help.

375
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,375
My helmet is stuck.

376
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,125
Okay.

377
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:55,333
Teacher

378
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:56,750
What is this

379
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,750
A souvenir sent from the planetarium

380
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,291
I tried it on

381
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,333
But the helmet is a bit small

382
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:06,291
By the way

383
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,416
Aren't you

384
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:10,958
Going to apply

385
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,375
To be a planetarium volunteer

386
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,875
They also sent the relevant information

387
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,583
Take a look

388
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:19,750
Planetarium guide

389
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,125
That's right

390
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:22,291
It's a rare opportunity

391
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,791
If you're interested

392
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,208
Just use the email above

393
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,333
And try applying to be a volunteer

394
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,166
But

395
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,833
Aren't you

396
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,083
Preparing for the recommendation exam

397
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,208
Do you still have time

398
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,500
It's fine

399
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:33,666
It's only on weekends

400
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,541
There's no conflict

401
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,375
Even if there is a conflict

402
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,208
I'll try my best to adjust my schedule

403
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,000
Do you know why the teacher likes you

404
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:42,166
Why

405
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,666
Because you and the teacher

406
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,791
Both have

407
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,125
A passion for astronomy

408
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,708
A dedication to physics

409
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,250
A thirst for knowledge

410
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,416
And

411
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,000
A handsome appearance

412
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,791
I think what you said makes a lot of sense.

413
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,208
May I ask you one more question, if you don't mind?

414
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:01,833
Since you like astronomy so much,

415
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:03,583
why not apply to Nanjing University?

416
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,833
I want to go to Beijing even more.

417
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:11,875
That's rare.

418
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,541
At your age,

419
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,000
to already know so clearly

420
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,333
what you want for your future.

421
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:18,166
Alright.

422
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:19,708
No matter what you choose,

423
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:20,500
as your teacher

424
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,541
and as your friend,

425
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:23,458
I will support you.

426
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:25,250
Thank you, teacher.

427
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:26,833
I'll get going then.

428
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:28,375
Since you're already here,

429
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:29,791
why not try it on?

430
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,083
We won't have a lecture today.

431
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:38,958
Let's do an in-class exercise.

432
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,416
Another test?

433
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:43,708
Tian Ye.

434
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,708
Do you have a problem with that?

435
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:47,875
Physics class representative, Zhang Kaiji.

436
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:49,375
Here.

437
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,125
Please hand out the papers.

438
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,541
Collect them at the end of this class.

439
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,125
I'll go over them next class after grading.

440
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,041
Okay, teacher.

441
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:04,333
Do you know how to do it?

442
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,916
I can do most of it.

443
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:15,750
Let me copy yours.

444
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:18,083
No need.

445
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,333
Hurry up and write.

446
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,083
Let me copy it when you're done.

447
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,458
I don't know how to do it.

448
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,500
Stop messing around.

449
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:07,791
Write faster.

450
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,583
If I come in last again this time,

451
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,166
Hui will totally destroy me.

452
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,541
No whispering.

453
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:15,583
I'm talking to you, Tian Ye.

454
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:17,625
Teacher.

455
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:19,500
I wasn't whispering.

456
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:20,541
I was just

457
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,333
asking Chen Jing'an for help.

458
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:23,625
Trying my best

459
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:26,041
to soar in the field of knowledge.

460
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,000
With your grades, you think you can soar?

461
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,791
Looks to me like you're about to drown in the field of knowledge.

462
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:34,500
Be quiet and do your work.

463
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,416
I saw this book first.

464
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,000
But I got it first.

465
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,333
Go get another one.

466
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,250
I want the one you have.

467
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:06,833
Hey, classmate.

468
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,416
There has to be a first come, first served.

469
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,125
Hey, classmate.

470
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,833
Chen Changning, senior.

471
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,083
You probably don't know who I am, right?

472
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,208
I'm the school beauty.

473
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:23,416
Zhu Niannian.

474
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,375
What does that have to do with me?

475
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,916
Don't you know how to treat a lady with care?

476
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:45,708
Chen Changning

477
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:47,375
Just now

478
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:48,750
That was Zhu Niannian

479
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,250
School beauty

480
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:51,791
Could it be

481
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,416
Shouldn't you let her have it?

482
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:56,666
I got it first

483
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,250
Why should I give it to her?

484
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:00,583
If she wants to see it

485
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:02,208
She can see it after I return it

486
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:04,750
As expected

487
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,333
Heaven is fair

488
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,916
It gave you unmatched beauty and intelligence

489
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:09,958
But took away

490
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:11,666
Your talent for making girls happy

491
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,041
If in the future

492
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,208
You can't get a wife

493
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:16,166
I'll have my son Li Jiaheng

494
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,000
Call you godfather

495
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:18,833
Shut up

496
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:31,583
Stand up

497
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,875
Hello, teacher

498
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:36,958
Hello, students

499
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,583
Your chemistry teacher has something to do

500
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:40,833
We'll have physics this period

501
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:47,833
Physics class rep Zhang Kaiji

502
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,750
Hand out the test papers from last class

503
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:50,916
I've already graded them

504
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:51,875
Okay, teacher

505
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:57,125
How many points do you think I'll get from guessing

506
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:58,250
How many points can I get

507
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,041
Wang Liqiu

508
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:03,791
Liu Yu

509
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,833
Hope I get lucky

510
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,625
And guess a few more answers right

511
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:11,625
Tian Ye

512
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,125
Zheng Chuan

513
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,583
Chen Jing'an

514
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,375
Now he's really drowned.

515
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:33,291
Chen Jing'an

516
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,333
What was your score?

517
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,333
This time, one student's result

518
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,833
really surprised me.

519
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:50,083
Chen Jing'an

520
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,458
Look at your test paper.

521
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,458
How many points?

522
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,291
Eighteen.

523
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,416
Is the new material really that hard?

524
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,458
Even a top student like you did so poorly.

525
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,666
Tian Ye has already drowned.

526
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,708
Looks like you're on the road to drowning too.

527
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:15,708
And going full speed ahead.

528
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,500
Sorry, teacher.

529
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,000
Chen Jing'an

530
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,958
Don't take your anger out on the test paper.

531
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,625
Don't I already know how you usually do?

532
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:27,500
Stay away from Tian Ye from now on.

533
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,000
Don't do this again.

534
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:32,625
Sit down.

535
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:36,541
Okay.

536
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,375
Open your test papers.

537
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:39,833
First question.

538
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,583
Chen Jing'an

539
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:49,666
You're such a good friend.

540
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,625
You took the fall for me.

541
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,541
You actually failed on purpose.

542
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:12,791
In class today,

543
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,333
I noticed she seemed off.

544
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:17,958
She's been acting strange these past couple of days.

545
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:20,291
By the way, teacher,

546
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:22,791
did Chen Jing'an sign up for the physics competition?

547
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:25,041
No, she didn't.

548
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:26,875
She's young,

549
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,458
but has quite a temper.

550
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,416
Find some time to have a good talk with her.

551
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,583
She's a promising student, just like you.

552
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,166
She can't let her emotions affect her studies.

553
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,416
Let's go.

554
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:58,458
There's this much left.

555
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,541
I'm full.

556
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,166
I'll go back to my room first.

557
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:04,250
Chen Jing'an.

558
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,041
Wait a moment.

559
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:12,583
Chen Jing'an.

560
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:14,916
Here you go.

561
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:27,833
Thank you.

562
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,500
Do you want some candy?

563
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,666
Thank you.

564
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,833
If I eat too much candy, my teeth will go bad.

565
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,458
Then just eat half.

566
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:00,166
It's really tasty.

567
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,916
I've never seen you before. Are you new here?

568
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:08,708
I...

569
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,875
Did your mom not want you either?

570
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:16,125
Don't be afraid, I can be your friend.

571
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,166
Okay.

572
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:18,916
But you can only be friends with me.

573
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:21,041
You can't be friends with the other kids.

574
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,083
Why?

575
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,375
If you don't want to, then forget it.

576
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:26,291
I want to.

577
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,958
Really? Then let's pinky swear.

578
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:28,625
Okay.

579
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:33,583
Pinky swear, hang it up, a hundred years, no change.
