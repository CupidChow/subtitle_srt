Chen Jing'an.

6
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,010
Stand up.

7
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,800
What did I just teach?

8
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,970
I'm sorry, Ms. Yu.

9
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,550
I wasn't paying attention.

10
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,550
Chen Jing'an,

11
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,970
learning requires long-term commitment.

12
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,960
Don't start slacking off

13
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,390
just because you did well last time.

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,800
Other students

15
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,720
could surpass you soon.

16
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:44,990
You've been distracted

17
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,300
since class started.

18
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,600
What's on your mind?

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,300
I'm sorry, Ms. Yu.

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,010
Don't apologize to me.

21
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,760
You're letting yourself down.

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,470
Not this once.

23
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,220
Sit down.

24
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,990
Class dismissed.

25
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,930
Stand up.

26
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,350
Goodbye, Ms. Yu.

27
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,730
Niannian,

28
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,350
why are you crying?

29
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,510
Being scolded isn't a big deal.

30
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,550
Just pay attention next time.

31
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,100
Shasha,

32
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,470
my mom is sick and hospitalized.

33
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,800
Don't cry.

34
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,550
She'll be fine.

35
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,800
After school,

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,350
I'll go with you to visit her, okay?

37
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,140
But right now,

38
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,060
I can't openly

39
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,050
go see her.

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:09,800
(Cardiology Department Director's Office)

41
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,890
Mom,

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,350
why are you here?

43
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,470
Not much homework today.

44
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,720
Chen Jing'an wanted to
visit you and Dad.

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,850
She bought this for you.

46
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,630
You've grown up.

47
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,520
So thoughtful.

48
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,390
By the way, Mom,

49
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,040
I heard

50
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,390
my classmate's mom is hospitalized.

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,470
I want to visit her too.

52
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,800
You mean Zhu Niannian's mom?

53
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,640
Sure, let's go together later.

54
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,970
I need to check on her anyway.

55
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,510
Is Niannian's mom seriously ill?

56
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,100
Not too serious,

57
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,350
but she might need minor surgery.

58
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,970
Surgery?

59
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,300
Yes, her arrhythmia

60
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,830
is mainly caused

61
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,470
by narrowed heart vessels.

62
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,390
Conservative treatment is okay,

63
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,720
but surgery works faster.

64
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,010
It's up to them.

65
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,600
Oh,

66
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,220
tell your classmate,

67
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,260
don't worry too much.

68
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,610
Minimally invasive surgery

69
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,390
is not very risky.

70
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,970
Niannian,

71
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,640
did you sleep in this morning?

72
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Did you eat breakfast?

73
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,550
Was the bus crowded?

74
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,850
It must be hard, right?

75
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,550
This morning,

76
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,720
I told your dad to go home,

77
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
make you breakfast,
and take you to school.

78
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
But he refused

79
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,100
and stayed to take care of me.

80
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,930
Niannian,

81
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,140
I can't look after you now.

82
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,350
Sorry, my girl.

83
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,350
Mom, I can take care of myself.

84
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,640
This morning,

85
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,720
I made myself fried eggs and toast.

86
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
It was delicious.

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,760
Don't worry about me.

88
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,800
Just rest well.

89
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,220
Rest assured.

90
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,970
You made breakfast? Really?

91
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,140
Dr. Zhang, hello.

92
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,100
How are you feeling?

93
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,340
Still dizzy or short of breath?

94
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,010
Much better. The medicine helped.

95
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,350
Mom, they're my friends I mentioned:

96
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,930
Chen Jing'an, Chen Changning.

97
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,850
Oh,

98
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,970
from the performance, right?

99
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,140
These are Dr. Zhang's kids.

100
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,060
I remember.

101
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,300
- I've met them.
- Ma'am,

102
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,380
Jing'an bought this for you.

103
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,050
Oh, you didn't have to.

104
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,260
So thoughtful. Thank you.

105
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,480
Ma'am,

106
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,010
is everything okay?

107
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,010
How are you feeling now?

108
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,850
Much better.

109
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,470
Mr. Zhu,

110
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,510
have you decided on the treatment?

111
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,720
Surgery

112
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,220
or medication?

113
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,550
I prefer conservative treatment,

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,890
but Huiru...

115
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,300
I think medication

116
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,390
is too slow.

117
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,640
Surgery is better,

118
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,480
right?

119
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,850
The risks
of this minimally invasive surgery

120
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,800
are almost negligible.

121
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,300
Our techniques

122
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,470
are quite mature,

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
so you don't need to worry.

124
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,890
Alright,

125
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
let's do the surgery.

126
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:52,890
How soon?

127
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,720
In two or three days. We'll hurry.

128
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,640
Thank you, Dr. Zhang.

129
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,810
You're welcome.

130
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,140
My pleasure.

131
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,140
By the way, take Niannian home later

132
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,720
and stay with her.

133
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,600
No.

134
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,800
If I go back, who will take care of you?

135
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,720
I can't let Niannian stay alone.

136
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,140
I'll be fine by myself.

137
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,560
Maybe we can...

138
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,470
ask a relative to stay with Niannian?

139
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,730
Ma'am,

140
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,680
how about Niannian stays at my place?

141
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,140
That way,

142
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,600
you won't have to worry

143
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,300
about her being alone.

144
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,980
Okay.

145
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,470
I can go to school with them.

146
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,050
Sir, ma'am,

147
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,220
don't worry.

148
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,220
That works.

149
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,720
She can stay with us for a few days.

150
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,720
My husband and I are busy lately

151
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,470
and can't take care of them anyway.

152
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,470
They can keep each other company.

153
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,560
Right?

154
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,970
Thank you.

155
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,220
You've solved a big problem for us.

156
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,220
Thank you.

157
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,640
You're welcome.

158
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,930
Niannian,

159
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,850
I can tell you're really happy.

160
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,560
Not really,

161
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,300
but I'm a little excited.

162
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,220
I just don't want to

163
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,110
trouble you and Mom

164
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,350
or make you worry.

165
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,970
You're getting more sensible.

166
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,560
When you arrive,

167
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,720
remember to be polite.

168
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,220
Help with cleaning if you have time.

169
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,300
Is Jing'an's brother

170
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
a senior in high school?

171
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,890
Don't disturb his studies.

172
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,720
I know, I won't bother him at all.

173
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,010
Hurry up.

174
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,850
Chen Jing'an will be here soon.

175
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,140
I'll go cut some fruit.

176
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,470
There's a pineapple.

177
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,730
No need.

178
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,220
She got hurt from eating pineapple as a kid.

179
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,970
She doesn't eat it anymore.

180
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,970
Then I'll see if there's anything else.

181
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,140
Don't worry about her.

182
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,140
Coke from the fridge is fine.

183
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,720
Okay.

184
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,390
Your dad didn't come up.

185
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,970
He went straight to the hospital.

(Cardiology Department)

187
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,390
Huiru,

188
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,310
have some water.

189
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,890
Is Niannian settled in?

190
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,720
Don't worry.

191
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,800
I drove her myself

192
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,260
to the Chen family's building.

193
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,470
Just downstairs?

194
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,200
You didn't take her up?

195
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,450
Niannian's old enough now.

196
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,760
She can climb stairs on her own.

197
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,260
Just rest early.

198
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,300
Don't overthink it.

199
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,140
Remember to call her tomorrow.

200
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,220
It's her first time not staying at home.

201
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,850
I'm really not at ease.

202
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,650
Okay, okay.

203
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,470
Get some sleep.

204
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,940
You need proper rest

205
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,470
before the surgery.

206
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,640
Who's hotter, Fu Hongxue or Ye Kai?

207
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,230
Both are.

208
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,850
Pick the hottest one.

209
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,850
Lu Xiaojia.

210
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,050
You like the one who bathed in public?

211
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,600
Chen Changning,

212
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,140
what book are you reading?

213
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,890
The Lady of the Camellias?

214
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,720
What's fun with a tea-selling girl?

215
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,970
Come watch hot guys with me.

216
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,970
Not a tea-selling girl.

217
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,970
It's a literary work by Dumas fils.

218
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,310
Dumb us?

219
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,100
Dumb us...

220
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,010
Then why isn't it called Dumb plus?

221
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,350
Because his father is Dumas père.

222
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,050
Oh, I see.

223
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,510
So what's the book about?

224
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,050
A love story
between a courtesan and a man.

225
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,550
A love story?

226
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,140
Chen Changning,

227
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,350
are you thinking of getting a girlfriend?

228
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,180
No.

229
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,390
Don't talk nonsense.

230
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,220
Nonsense? If you weren't,

231
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,300
why'd you read this?

232
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,970
It's not a romance novel.

233
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
Not a love story?

234
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,050
Then what's the ending?

235
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,720
The heroine is misunderstood
by the hero.

236
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,390
He regrets it too late,

237
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,140
and she dies of illness.

238
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,300
It reflects the society....

239
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,220
Misunderstanding?

240
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,890
Terminal illness...

241
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,720
You like this cliché drama?

242
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,350
Zhu Niannian,

243
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,010
can you let me finish?

244
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,730
Go on, then.

245
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,980
Come on.

246
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,600
Never mind.

247
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,680
I won't say more.

248
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,760
Come here.

249
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,550
You took so long in the shower,

250
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,050
so I had to awkwardly chat with him.

251
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,140
What did you talk about?

252
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,470
Listen, I asked him

253
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,390
who's hotter,

254
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,470
Fu Hongxue or Ye Kai?

255
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,890
He actually likes the one
who bathed in public.

256
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,220
I tried to get him to watch TV,

257
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,470
but he insisted on reading

258
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,430
that cliché romance novel. What is it?

259
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,300
(La Dame aux Camélias)

260
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,360
The Lady of the Camellias.

261
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,720
It is a literary classic,

262
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,970
not a cliché novel.

263
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,010
Not listening.

264
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,350
You showered so long.

265
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,720
I'm sorry then.

266
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,470
I'll shower faster next time.

267
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,800
You're forgiven.

268
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,050
Watch this.

269
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,600
I can shower in just fifteen minutes.

270
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
You can start timing me.

271
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,890
Then go shower quickly.

272
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,430
I'm still waiting in line.

273
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,390
Keep waiting then.

274
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,760
Niannian,

275
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,430
she's always been careless.

276
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,180
She didn't think before speaking.

277
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,390
Don't take it to heart.

278
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,930
I didn't.

279
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,050
I didn't take it to heart.

280
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
What I mean is,

281
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,850
she's just too excited

282
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,140
to be back home.

283
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,350
She might have forgotten

284
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,820
you're still worried about your mom.

285
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,030
So she didn't consider your feelings.

286
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,680
I apologize for her.

287
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,600
It's okay.

288
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,550
I know Jing'an.

289
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,930
Don't overthink it.

290
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,180
Rest early.

291
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,600
I'm sure your mom will recover soon.

292
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,640
Chen Changning,

293
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,390
thank you.

294
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,050
Am I dreaming?

295
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,470
Why are you three together?

296
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,220
My mom's sick, no one's home.

297
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,470
I stay at Chen Jing'an's place.

298
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,550
Why not ride bikes?

299
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,550
How can three people ride one bike?

300
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,720
We're heading

301
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,100
to the bus stop up ahead.

302
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,100
At this hour?

303
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,050
Buns would be overcooked on that bus.

304
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,050
It's torture.

305
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,510
It's still early.

306
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,470
I'll walk with you.

307
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,300
You have your own bike.

308
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,510
Why join us?

309
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,970
More people, more fun.

310
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,430
How does it feel to return

311
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,300
to your old nest in a new body?

312
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,680
East or west, my nest is best.

313
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,800
How did your home become a nest?

314
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,140
It's a joke, okay?

315
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,300
Sir, you wanted to see me?

316
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,270
Changning, come here.

317
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,560
I have good news.

318
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,220
I have a friend

319
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,970
who studies

320
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,300
obscure topics,

321
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,430
like

322
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,760
the I Ching

323
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,890
and Bagua divination.

324
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,550
But his main field is astrophysics.

325
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,550
He's the head
of an astrophysics association.

326
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,310
These are

327
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,300
his more...

328
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,890
mainstream

329
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,100
research papers.

330
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,720
Some touch on

331
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,300
memory swap.

332
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,600
Take a quick look.

333
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,470
Chen Changning,

334
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,810
wait.

335
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,470
What is it?

336
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,970
I've noticed

337
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,300
you're often with Niannian.

338
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,470
Do you need something from her?

339
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,930
No.

340
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,180
Don't lie.

341
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,800
It's obvious to everyone.

342
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,600
This is my final warning:

343
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Don't be a toad lusting after swan meat.

344
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,140
No improper thoughts about Niannian.

345
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,030
- And no…
- Okay.

346
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,850
What "okay"? I wasn't finished.

347
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,470
Then keep going.

348
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,100
And no…

349
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,050
No more "no's."

350
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,550
But you must promise me,

351
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,600
no improper thoughts

352
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,300
about Niannian.

353
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,640
I promise.

354
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,060
Anything else?

355
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,140
Don't rush me.

356
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,300
Let me think.

357
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,390
Take your time.

358
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,890
I'm leaving.

359
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,640
Chen Changning, you...

360
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,350
Explain one more problem for me.

361
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,800
Good.

362
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,850
Continue.

363
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,470
Remember,

364
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,600
right now, I am Zhu Niannian.

365
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,640
When Changning's around,

366
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,300
you need to act closer to Zhu Niannian.

367
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,220
Or we'll definitely get exposed.

368
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
You were the one who got close first.

369
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,890
Don't blame me.

370
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:15,930
Look at yourself,

371
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,500
so lively around Chen Changning

372
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,300
not at all like someone

373
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,300
whose mom's sick.

374
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,300
But look at Niannian,

375
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,850
so listless.

376
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,220
Changning will suspect, won't he?

377
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,430
You didn't remind me earlier.

378
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
This morning at home

379
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
I was bickering with him.

380
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,140
You weren't paying attention.
Don't blame me.

381
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,100
But...

382
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,890
don't you plan to

383
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,550
tell Changning the truth?

384
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,350
Keeping this going

385
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,430
isn't a solution.

386
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,720
At first we didn't dare say anything,

387
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,850
we thought we'd switch back
with the meteors.

388
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,050
Telling Changning seemed unnecessary.

389
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,100
But now the situation is

390
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,720
getting complicated.

391
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,350
I'm thinking whether to tell him.

392
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,720
If you're going to tell him,

393
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,050
do it now.

394
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,970
No delay any longer.

395
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,220
Changning's so smart,

396
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,430
and you're living with him now.

397
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,390
What if you slip up someday?

398
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,050
Without you,

399
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,550
he might not notice though.

400
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,600
Don't underestimate him.

401
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,800
Don't you know

402
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
how smart he is?

403
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,470
Besides,

404
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,600
he meddles in your business.

405
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,430
He knows you too well.

406
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,640
If we really slip up someday...

407
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,720
As the saying goes,

408
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
"Confession

409
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,050
gets leniency."

410
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,800
If you tell him now,

411
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,300
worst case is

412
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,910
some stern lecturing.

413
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,890
But...

414
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,390
if he finds out himself,

415
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,180
the consequences...

416
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,550
could be...

417
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,430
unimaginable.

418
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,300
Stop scaring me.

419
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,470
What can he do to me?

420
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,390
Have I ever been afraid of him?

421
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,350
You...

422
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,050
you dare say you've never feared him?

423
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,720
I'll tell him tonight!

424
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,140
There, happy?

425
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,300
That's more like it.

426
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,050
As the saying goes:

427
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
"The wind howls, the river chills..."

428
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,180
Oh, shut up.

429
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,800
Go away.

430
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,800
Let's go.

431
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,900
Go to the hospital first.

432
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,430
Why the hospital?

433
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Niannian, are you sick?

434
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,260
No, it's my mom.

435
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,140
What?

436
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,680
She is sick?

437
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,970
Let's go.

438
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,390
Bye, we're leaving now.

439
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,350
Wait, that's strange.

440
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,430
Niannian's mom is sick,

441
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,550
but why are Changning and Jing'an going?

442
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,680
Why are all three leaving together?

443
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,220
You didn't know?

444
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,300
Zhu Niannian's been staying

445
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,050
at Chen Jing'an's place recently.

446
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,890
So now those three

447
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,430
eat together,

448
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,310
go out together,

449
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,970
and live together.

450
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,890
Just accept it.

451
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,800
You can't force

452
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,930
matters of the heart.

453
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,550
Don't go home yet.

454
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,650
Come to the market with me.

455
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,720
Why would I go there?

456
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,670
To make chicken soup for the patient.

457
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,140
Niannian's mom is sick.

458
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,800
How can we do nothing?

459
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,930
Come on, let's go.

460
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,100
Alright, alright.

461
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,680
Jing'an,

462
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
thank you

463
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,140
for taking care of Niannian.

464
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,850
It's my pleasure.

465
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,850
Ma'am, you rest well.

466
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,050
Jing'an takes good care of herself,

467
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,470
so don't worry too much.

468
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,050
Here, have some fruit.

469
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,550
Thank you, sir.

470
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,800
This illness made me realize

471
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
our Niannian

472
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,930
has really grown up.

473
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,550
I used to think she was still a child,

474
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,550
needing me to take care of everything.

475
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,800
But this time I truly realized,

476
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,390
Niannian is much stronger

477
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,300
and more independent than I imagined.

478
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,180
Right?

479
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,560
Yes,

480
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,050
you're absolutely right.

481
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,680
Now

482
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,890
Niannian's no longer a child.

483
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,970
She can handle many things herself.

484
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,300
So you don't need to worry too much.

485
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,180
That's easy to say,

486
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,800
but actually letting go...

487
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,430
I still feel somewhat worried.

488
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,350
I wanted to

489
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,800
keep taking care of her
for a few more years.

490
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,680
Right?

491
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,970
Mom,

492
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,960
it's not that I don't need your care.

493
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,800
But if you handle everything,

494
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,100
you'll exhaust yourself.

495
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,300
How about we compromise?

496
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,550
You can worry about

497
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,550
big matters,

498
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,760
and I'll handle small things myself.

499
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,720
Alright, I'll listen to you.

500
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,050
Anything you want.

501
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,800
You eat it.
I don't want it.

502
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,430
Oh, stop it with this act.

503
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,140
Did you hear that?

504
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,650
Your mom changed so much for you.

505
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,800
She really loves you so much.

506
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,050
You're so lucky.

507
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,680
Thank you.

508
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,600
But the more she does this,

509
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,600
the guiltier I feel.

510
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Since childhood,

511
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,510
from...

512
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,220
what toothpaste I use

513
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,180
to which university I should attend,

514
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,050
Mom arranged everything for me.

515
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,050
I didn't understand
her good intentions before.

516
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,850
Now I do.

517
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,550
Yet here she is lying sick in bed,

518
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,930
and I can't do anything.

519
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,220
I can't even call her "Mom".

520
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,930
I've been such a failure

521
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,800
as a daughter.

522
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,300
I'll help take care of her.

523
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,850
What you can do now

524
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,550
is stay calm

525
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,640
and not overthink things.

526
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,310
Jing'an,

527
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,050
how can I not overthink?

528
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,470
You know, even minor surgeries

529
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,220
carry some risks.

530
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,220
I'm scared...

531
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,760
Don't say it.

532
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,850
Don't be scared.

533
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,640
Worrying now is useless.

534
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,850
The only thing you must do

535
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,800
is not lose your composure.

536
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,100
If your mom finds out

537
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,140
about our body swap,

538
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,010
wouldn't that worsen her condition?

539
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,470
When can we switch back?

540
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,510
I'm still figuring it out.

541
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,470
Don't panic.

542
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,800
You must stay strong.

543
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,070
Okay.

544
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,470
Changning probably went to see my mom.

545
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,970
As "Jing'an," you should visit too.

546
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,720
Act normal.

547
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,970
If I go abroad with Auntie,

548
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,970
can Jing'an go next year?

549
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,390
Changning,

550
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,140
your aunt arranged everything

551
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,720
for your study abroad.

552
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,890
You know

553
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,300
how she feels about Jing'an.

554
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,930
I'm afraid...

555
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,640
Changning,

556
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,640
though Jing'an was adopted,

557
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,760
you've seen how all these years

558
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,220
your father and I

559
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,720
tried our best

560
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,600
to treat you two equally.

561
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,470
We rarely interfered with your studies

562
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,550
or daily lives.

563
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,060
Why?

564
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,420
Too much interference

565
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,850
might create imbalance.

566
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,050
We didn't want her to feel uncomfortable.

567
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,560
Yes.

568
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,180
Changning,

569
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,010
you've always been decisive

570
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,760
and taken good care

571
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,550
of your sister.

572
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,970
That's why we let you

573
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,550
look after her.

574
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,050
Although

575
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,260
your mother and I

576
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,010
have tried our best

577
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,140
to treat you equally,

578
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,470
we can't

579
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,800
expect others

580
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,550
to do the same.

581
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,050
Changning,

582
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,640
we...

583
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,140
truly hope

584
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,890
you can understand us.

585
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,970
Changning,

586
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,850
your aunt

587
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,510
has always treated you as her own son.

588
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,300
For your study abroad,

589
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,760
she's really

590
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,220
put in a lot of effort.

591
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,100
Your father and I

592
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
actually hope

593
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,510
you can seize this opportunity.

594
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,850
Of course, towards Jing'an,

595
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,510
we also feel guilty.

596
00:25:59,010 --> 00:25:59,890
Because

597
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,010
there isn't much we can do

598
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,510
and we can't ask your aunt

599
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,760
to do anything more.

600
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,480
If...

601
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,890
you decide to go abroad,

602
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,390
then go with your aunt without worries.

603
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,010
Later, your father and I
will explain to her.

604
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,820
