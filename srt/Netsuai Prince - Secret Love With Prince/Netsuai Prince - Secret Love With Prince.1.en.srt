00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,680
(Amamiya Matsuri) *giggles* Hehe he he he... hehe~ hehe~

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,710
(Female Student) Matsuri! What are you doing looking so happy?

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,070
Ah~ Just chores. The teacher just asked me to do them.

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,430
Eh? Then why are you humming?

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,120
Hmm~? Just trying to raise my spirits.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,810
It's just a simple chore.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,840
Nii~. Here it comes. Nii~.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,200
Ahaha. Look ->

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,220
Life is about enjoying it, right?

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,270
Eh, isn't that a little too robust?
Eh? Is it robust?

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:43,270
Well, I've lived like that since I was little... I guess?

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
I'm home!~

13
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:11,850
・～

14
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,680
(Flashback)
If only I had a sibling…

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,680
I want a sibling~! 

16
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,410
Bro~

17
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,140
(Male) Hello.
(3 people) It's Signal 3!

18
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,170
(Male)
Let's start today with energy, ready...?

19
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,190
(3 people) "Yorimichi Cafe"!

20
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,230
(Male) Today, we are in Yokohama...cool~

21
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:55,380
~ ("My Only Princess")

22
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,070
Cool~.

23
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,800
~ ("My Only Princess")

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:09,860
Haruka-kun, Azusa-kun, Rihito-kun.

25
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,860
Thank you for being born.

26
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,990
(Manner mode)

27
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,010
Hello, Mom?

28
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,710
(Matsuri's mother) Ah, Matsuri? I have something to talk to you about.

29
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,400
Yeah. (Matsuri's mother) Mom is going to...

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,100
get remarried. Huh?

31
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,800
Huh? You're getting remarried?

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,830
(Matsuri's mother) So, your new father...

33
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,190
has a son, so Matsuri...

34
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,870
you're going to have an older brother!...

35
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,570
You've always said you wanted siblings, right?...

36
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,590
So, come home quickly.

37
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,590
Huh? W-wait a sec... (sound of phone disconnecting)

38
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,340
Eeeeh!?

39
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,050
(Inner voice) ≪I never dreamed of such a thing≫

40
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,090
≪Because I'm an only child, a latchkey kid...≫

41
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,820
≪Eh? A brother? Family?≫

42
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,190
≪I'm going to have a big brother!?≫

43
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:24,600
・～

44
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,300
(Haruka) Hello, cute little sister. →

45
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,660
It's your big brother.

46
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,680
Eh, eh...?

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:40,090
・～

48
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,450
(Voice of Amamiya Azusa) Nice to meet you.

49
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,160
<<That Terzetto is my big brother!?>>

50
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,850
Ehhh!?

51
00:03:48,850 --> 00:04:09,050
・～

52
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:18,150
・～

53
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:31,150
・～

54
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,350
・(Rihito) Matsuri-chan, it's time!

55
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,350
・Chirp chirp... (Bird sounds)

56
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Okay!

57
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,770
Bang!
Ouch! That hurt....

58
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,870
I'm sorry, I'm late.

59
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,620
<<So,
It's been a month since I became the younger sister of the big new idol, Terzetto.→

60
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,990
It's been a month since I became the younger sister of the big new idol, Terzetto.>>

61
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,010
<<I'll never get used to it...>>

62
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,010
(Matsunaga) Make sure to study
well until the 3rd period.

63
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,420
(Matsunaga) Do you understand?
(Haruka) Yes, I understand. →

64
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,780
You guys understand too, right?

65
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,470
(Rihito)
I understand, so don't act like my big brother.

66
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,170
My mental age is
higher than yours.

67
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:32,550
Ugh! What's with this gloomy, mean guy?

68
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,550
(Haruka) I want to see you
a million times more!

69
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,300
(Haruka) I'll knock you out, brat!

70
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,320
What's the big deal with just a few years difference!

71
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
You single-celled narcissist.

72
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,360
(Rihito) Should I let you
have me all to yourself for just one night?

73
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,740
Sigh... Here we go.

74
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,450
I'll make you realize
that I'm the real deal.

75
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,880
≪Everyone is so different from when they're idols...≫

76
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,240
Bang!
(Haruka) Hey, if I'm simple-minded, then→

77
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,260
You are too, we're brothers after all!

78
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,290
(Masato) Don't lump me in with him. Being Haruka's brother→

79
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,310
Is my only flaw.

80
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,000
<<Wow...>>

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,390
<<The close-knit brothers group, Terzetto!>>

82
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,420
(Matsunaga) Your younger sister's first day at her new school is today, isn't it?

83
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,120
Ah, yes. (Matsunaga) About Terzetto's sister...

84
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,480
Please don't let it get out. (Haruka) Seriously, you're always...

85
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,840
We're selling ourselves as three close siblings.

86
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,870
It would be a problem if people found out we have a sister.

87
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,870
Yes.

88
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa... Stop fighting!

89
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,300
(Matsunaga) Okay, let's go, to school!

90
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
Idol switch! *snap* (sound of snapping fingers)

91
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,390
(Haruka) You
You wore my T-shirt without permission, didn't you?

92
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,410
I'm home! (Haruka) Don't wear it without permission!

93
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,430
(Rihito) There's no way I would wear Haruka's clothes.

94
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,780
(Haruka) Besides, my clothes don't suit you anyway.

95
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,480
Don't even try to wear them! (Rihito) I told you, I'm not wearing them!

96
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,500
You delusional guy! (Haruka) Huh? Baka!

97
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,520
What... I'm not delusional! Baka, baka!

98
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Baka!
(Rihito) Baka, you say...

99
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,250
All lies...

100
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,320
Is that this month's?

101
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Azusa.

102
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,100
This is a scene that couldn't happen in reality, right?

103
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Well, I guess...

104
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,140
Couldn't happen, huh...

105
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,860
I wish I had this, being so close...

106
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,940
Huh?

107
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,940
Huh?

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,020
*Flapping sound*

109
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,720
Hey, wait a minute...

110
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,750
Was my voice... out loud?

111
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,790
Um... um...

112
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,490
Ugh... this is the worst.

113
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,190
Forget it. Sorry.

114
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,550
Hey!

115
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,550
Were there times when you got along?

116
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,290
In the past, yes. But now...

117
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,330
We don't do anything together outside of work.

118
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,700
We're brothers, after all, so I wish we could have more fun...

119
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,700
And spend our time laughing.

120
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,770
Sorry, Matsuri.

121
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,790
We're just full of lies.

122
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,830
・～

123
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,860
I've been thinking that too.

124
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,550
Since we finally have a big brother,→

125
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,260
I was hoping we could build a family that's always smiling together.

126
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,640
・～

127
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Well, I guess that's impossible….

128
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,730
*Gacha* (sound of door opening)

129
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,730
*Bang* (sound of door closing)

130
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,560
"Nice to meet you! Party"?

131
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,590
Attendance by everyone is a must!

132
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:35,380
・～

133
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,080
And Haruka-kun is... pancakes….

134
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:46,830
・～

135
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,830
Yeah, genius. Hehe.

136
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Whoa... I was asleep....

137
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,660
How embarrassing....

138
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
Thank you for everything, always.

139
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,710
Really.

140
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,160
What's wrong?
Ah, no....

141
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,520
As expected, that smile is just too much →

142
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
It makes my heart race...

143
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,590
This is troublesome....

144
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,610
I need to get used to it quickly....

145
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,320
・～

146
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Huh? That's right.

147
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,390
We're siblings, after all.

148
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Good night. Go to sleep early.

149
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,830
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

150
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,280
<<Huh!?>>

151
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,280
<<What was that just now...?>>

152
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,030
(Teacher) This is the staff room. Ahh....

153
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,390
(Teacher) When entering,
say your class and name at the entrance.

154
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,410
Yes.

155
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,780
(Teacher) Today, after school, should I have the student council
give you a tour of the clubs?

156
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,150
Ah, um... that would be nice, but...

157
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,180
Today,
I have a family event.

158
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,870
(Teacher) I see.
(Haruka) Sensei! →

159
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,220
We will show the new student around.

160
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,580
(Teacher) Oh, really?
(Haruka) Yes.

161
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,940
(Teacher) Then, I'll leave it to you.

162
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,290
Rattling... (Sound of door)

163
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,660
Rattling...
(Haruka) Don't get caught! →

164
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,680
Matsuri.
Eh?

165
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,700
Come on, hurry up.

166
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,720
(Haruka) Hey... hey!
Don't hold my hand!

167
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:31,140
・～

168
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,830
(Rihito) Oh, right. I already reserved a cake for Matsuri-chan.

169
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,860
Eh! I'm so happy!

170
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,230
(Haruka)・ Party
(Both)・ Party

171
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,250
(Woman) Isn't that Terzetto?
(Woman) Eh, no way!

172
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,620
(All 3)・ Party...
(Woman) Um... You're Terzetto, right?

173
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,980
We're huge fans!
(Haruka) Yeah, thank you.

174
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,350
(Rihito) Hello everyone.
Kyaa! It's Rihito.

175
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,700
Hey, Haruka, take a picture.
(Rihito) Sorry, Matsuri-chan →

176
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,730
Just wait a moment.
Yeah, no problem at all.

177
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,090
Click, click (camera shutter sound)
(Women) Thank you very much.

178
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,110
(Haruka) Thank you.
(Woman) So cool!

179
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,820
(Haruka) Yeah, of course. Let's take one.
(Woman) You look different in person.

180
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,840
(Women) Oh my god!
(Haruka, Rihito) Thank you.

181
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,210
...

182
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,210
...Tap, tap, tap... (Footsteps)

183
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,940
(Woman) Azusa-kun, can I take a picture with you?
Ah, sorry.

184
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
I have some business to take care of.

185
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,970
(Woman) Cool!

186
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,070
What's wrong? Are you okay?

187
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,440
Azusa-kun... Why?

188
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,790
Because you suddenly started running.

189
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,790
Ah... Sorry. No, that's not it.

190
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,550
I was just a little sulky.

191
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,550
Huh?

192
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,580
I was the only one having fun...

193
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,660
Everyone I saw outside...

194
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,660
Seemed like people I couldn't reach...

195
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,710
They seemed like strangers...

196
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,790
“Out of reach,” huh…

197
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,850
Huh? Thank you very much.

198
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,240
Why?

199
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,270
Because, honestly, I don't dislike it, right? →

200
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,270
Being thought of as someone out of reach for people.

201
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,700
But… →

202
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,080
But I'd be a little troubled if Matsuri continued to think of me that way.

203
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,450
・～

204
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,150
See? It arrives properly.

205
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:53,560
・～

206
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,250
Of course it will arrive.

207
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,940
Because Matsuri is →

208
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,940
The girl who is closest to me in the world.

209
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,020
Right?

210
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:13,420
・～

211
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,440
Let's go home.

212
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
We're having a party, right?

213
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,520
Yeah.

214
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,900
(Haruka, Azusa) Wow, looks delicious!

215
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,600
Eh, amazing! (Rihito) And then, and then... .

216
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,640
Eh?
(Rihito) Here we go... Ta-da!

217
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,670
Ooh.
Huh?

218
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,670
Hey,
You said you wanted a chocolate cake, right?

219
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,070
Eh... .
(Rihito) But the plate is this... .

220
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,420
Matsuri said she likes chocolate cake!

221
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,450
She loves shortcake too! It's not like she only likes chocolate... .

222
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,140
But you said chocolate!

223
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,500
(Rihito) Then don't leave it up to me.
I picked a cute one. →

224
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,190
What's wrong with it?
(Haruka) What's with that tone?

225
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,870
(Rihito) If you didn't pick a fight in the first place... (Haruka) If you had properly →

226
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,230
You should have just gotten a chocolate one!
(Rihito) Isn't it cute?

227
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,600
(Haruka) Huh? It's not about whether it's cute or not... .
You two, cut it out!

228
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,290
Huh!

229
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:10,650
You promised you'd cooperate just for today's festival, right!

230
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,010
(Haruka) If you hadn't asked him, this wouldn't have happened!

231
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,040
Don't get so angry! (Haruka) Huh? Shut up, idiot!

232
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,060
(Rihito) Because the plate is chocolate, it's already a chocolate cake.

233
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,080
(Haruka) What kind of logic is that? It's because... you messed up...

234
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,780
≪I don't want this...≫

235
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,490
≪I already know.
Magazines and TV→

236
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,870
I know it's all an illusion→

237
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,250
But still, I want the three of them to get along≫

238
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,940
I want them to be smiling≫

239
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,960
≪Because...≫

240
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,320
I told you to stop it!

241
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Splatter!

242
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,380
Huh?
(Haruka) Huh...? W-wait.... →

243
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Huh?
Ha?

244
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,140
(Haruka) Huh, no, ah....

245
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,860
Huh?

246
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,580
Thud (sound of falling)
(3 people) Matsuri!

247
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,580
Are you okay! Matsuri! (Rihito) Matsuri-chan? Are you okay?

248
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,700
(Haruka) Ah, Matsuri! (Rihito) Ah, I'm glad. →

249
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
She hasn't been sleeping lately.

250
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,760
They're all getting along so well...

251
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,460
(Rihito) Heh heh. (Haruka) That's your first reaction? Heh heh.

252
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,820
Ah, no, well... until just now...

253
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,180
You guys were having a fight that looked like it was about to turn into a brawl.

254
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,200
How did you make up...? (Haruka) Listen...

255
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,890
When Matsuri collapses, we can't be fighting.

256
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,250
That's obvious, right? We all...

257
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,280
care about Matsuri-chan.
At least...→

258
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
We are
Matsuri's older brothers.

259
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,020
Nii~.

260
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,730
・～

261
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,090
(3 people) Nii~.

262
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,110
Heh heh...

263
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:08,500
・～

264
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm sorry, Azusa-kun, I bumped into you....

265
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,560
It's okay. We were in the wrong too.

266
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,920
(Rihito) I'm sorry about the
homemade cream puffs, though.

267
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,620
(Haruka) Really, I'm sorry.
But, well...

268
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,660
・～

269
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,020
Then, let's call it even.

270
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,060
・～

271
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,760
A sign of reconciliation, as siblings.

272
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,110
(Haruka) There's no way that's true. That's weird, right?

273
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,130
No, no, I don't mean anything deep by it.

274
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,150
(Haruka) No cutting in line. (Rihito) Matsuri-chan →

275
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,860
Please step away. It's dangerous. H-hai.

276
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:48,230
(Rihito) Okay? Matsuri-chan is everyone's little sister. →

277
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,920
Then, I'll go get some drinks for our cute Matsuri-chan. →

278
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
I'll go get you a drink.

279
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,340
(Rihito) Don't touch her! Yes.

280
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,360
(Haruka) I'm going to quickly pick some flowers. →

281
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,720
Azusa, don't come near her. I understand.

282
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,720
・～

283
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,510
I'm sorry.

284
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:20,900
Ah, no... but, as expected, idols
are really powerful.

285
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,590
But it's okay.
I'll try to get used to it soon, so→

286
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,950
I'll do my best.

287
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,660
Well,
I'd be troubled if you got *too* used to it, though.

288
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,690
Huh?

289
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,050
I was prepared for a long game.

290
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,750
Huh?

291
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,750
It's just, I'm already...

292
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm going to use my weapons
without holding back.

293
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,560
So, realize it soon.

294
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Dense.

295
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,610
・(Haruka) I'm still worried! Gacha

296
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,000
(Haruka) I don't know what
Azusa will do →

297
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,030
Let's all sleep together tonight.

298
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,030
Huh?
(Rihito) I brought you water.

299
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,810
Ugh...

300
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,810
Ugh...

301
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Can't you sleep? I'm sorry.

302
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,620
Thanks, Matsuri.

303
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,680
Huh?

304
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,370
If Matsuri wasn't here...

305
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,400
I definitely couldn't have a party with
Haruka and Rihito outside of work.

306
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,770
It would've been impossible.

307
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,770
This sort of thing too.

308
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,160
I'm nothing... Just having you here is enough.

309
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,270
It's like, we can be a little more honest→

310
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,270
→just because we have Matsuri as a reason.

311
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:14,390
・～

312
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,770
I've been thinking a little bit, and...

313
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,790
The reason my heart races...

314
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,510
Isn't just because Azusa-kun is an idol...

315
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,510
It's because you're attractive as a person.

316
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:39,990
I'm sure that even if Azusa-kun wasn't an idol...

317
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,990
I would have become your fan anyway.

318
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,420
Eh? Eh, wait a bit... Eh, wha...

319
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:59,420

Sorry.
Was my voice maybe too loud?

322
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,980
Good night.

323
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,040
Good night...

326
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,150
≪It's too easy to reach...≫

327
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,900
(Coach) Okay, let's go with the count. Five, six, seven, eight. →

328
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,600
One, two, three, four... (Coach) Good. More.

≪…my brothers have been
intensely practicing…≫

≪…for the live performance.≫

333
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,810
≪They were so different,
so serious…≫

334
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,810
≪…that I couldn't help but
wince just watching them.≫

335
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,890
Excuse me.

336
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,300
Thump!
Oh! I'm sorry!

337
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
(Yamato) Are you okay?
Ah, yes!

338
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,740
(Yamato) What's wrong?

339
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,440
(Saionji Subaru)
I know her. This girl.

Ah~ No, no.

Ideal older brother... I guess?

344

Because Subaru-nii was
always with me, →

345
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:57,690
I think I wasn't lonely
when I was little.

346
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,300
I've come to
