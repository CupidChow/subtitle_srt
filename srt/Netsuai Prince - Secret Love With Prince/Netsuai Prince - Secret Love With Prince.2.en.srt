You came. Thank you.
(Amamiya Matsuri) Um... This→

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,260
A little something for you.
(Haruka) Huh? Seriously!?→

Wow, thanks!
Whoa, looks delicious.

Huh? Hey, where's Azusa?

(Haruka)
Huh? Oh, him? Not again.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,410
(Rihito) He always goes somewhere
he can be alone before a live show.

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,410
Yeah.

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,480

Here, a little something. Azusa's favorite
croissant sandwich.

(Azusa Amamiya) Matsuri... Thank you.

16
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,370
Maybe... are you too nervous to eat?

17
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,370
No...

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,820
You'll definitely succeed as always!

I, her sister, guarantee it!

21

Thank you, really, for today.

Why are you thanking us? We enjoyed it even more.

101
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,450
Then, instead of thank you, I'm sorry.

102
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,490
Huh? What... Why 'sorry'?

103
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,530
If I apologize honestly, will you forgive me?

104
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,530
Huh?

105
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:43,230
I'm sorry. I've fallen in love with Matsuri...

106
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,980
I can't see Matsuri as a little sister anymore.

107

I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

Ehhh!? (Haruka) Ehhh!?

114
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,030
Ah... Ah! Sorry, Haruka-kun.

115
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,400
I had a weird reaction. (Haruka) Hehe. What's wrong? Something troubling you?

116
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,090
Your big brother will listen.

117
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,090
Ah... I'm grateful, but there's no way I can say it...

118
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,170
(Rihito) Could it be love troubles?

119
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,870
(Haruka) Eh!? H-Hah!? What was that, you!

120
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,870
Spit it out. Who is it!

121
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,950
Okay, that's enough. (Haruka) Ooh! Ah...

122
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,980
Why don't you hurry up and get changed? You'll be late for school.

123
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
(Haruka) Ah, that's right. I-I'm in trouble!

124
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,120
Matsuri, you don't have to reply.

125
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,150
If you only think of me as a brother...

126
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,150
Then you don't have to worry about it.

127
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,240
No... even if you tell me not to worry about it...

128
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,940
Then, let's pretend that nothing happened with Azusa-kun.

129
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,970
And go back to being siblings like before...

130
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,000
What are you saying?

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,710
There's no way we can go back to the way things were.

132
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,740
Huh?

133
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,740
Even now, I want to hold you like this.

137
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,650
Does not being the same as before mean...
I'm no longer...→

138
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,340
...your little sister?

139

It's not like I'm going to stop being Matsuri's big brother.

141
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,800
Eh?

142
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
It's just that being siblings
isn't enough anymore.

143
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,590
So, it's okay.
I'll still be Matsuri's big brother→

144
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,590
I'll do it properly.

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,530
Come on, call me like you used to, Matsuri.

180
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,960
Subaru-nii?

181
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,980
Ehhh! Haha. It's been a while.

182
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,000
Ah, ah, w-wait... Please put me down, put me down...

183
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,370
What's with the formality? You used to be all "Subaru-nii, Subaru-nii" →

184
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,400
always clinging to me.

185
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,100
Um...?
And then →

186
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,790
Why are Rihito and Matsuri...?

187
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,140
(Rihito) She's our little sister. →

188
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,840
Matsuri-chan's mother and
our father remarried.

189
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,890
So now, Haruka, Azusa, and I
are Matsuri-chan's older brothers.

190
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,580
Heeh~...

191
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,940
Then,
can I borrow her for a bit?

192
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,940
Your little sister.

193
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,970
Huh?

194
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,950
How have you been? I can't believe it.

195
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,330
Subaru is... Subaru-nii.

196
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,330
And you even remember me.

197
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,080
You used to say that back then too.

198
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,100
Subaru-nii is everyone's prince, so...

199
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,790
Why do you bother with me?

200
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,160
Ah... Because Subaru-nii is...

201
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,200
Popular with everyone, and super rich, and...

202
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,610
You're from a different world, but you always paid attention to me.

203
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,970
You haven't changed at all.

204
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,970
You're the Matsuri I knew from back then.

205
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,100
Because Subaru-nii was always with me...

206
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,100
I don't think I was lonely when I was little.

207
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Those were good times...

208
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,960
The festival is mine.

209
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,730
The festival is mine.

210
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:59,500
...

211
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Um...

212
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,540
Good work.
Eh? What is it?

213
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,630
Subaru-nii,
you only said that when you were tired.

214
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,330
Saying, "Matsuri is mine!"

215
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,690
So, maybe...

216
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,690
Hehe...

217
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,790
Matsuri, say that line.

218
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,490
Huh? That line?

219
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,490
"I love Subaru-nii
the most in the world."

220
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,920
Eh? Ahh, no no no no...

221
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,310
Who do you love the most
in the world?

222
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,310
The most in the world... Suba...

223
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,700
I think I've fallen
for Matsuri...

224
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,450
Huh?

225
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,810
Huh... Wh-Why...

226
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,500
Matsuri, I'm going to

227
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,870
make my idol debut.

228
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,890
Huh?

229
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,260
From the same agency as Terzetto.

230
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,260
Idols are like princes, right?

231
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,010
Look forward to it.

232
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,390
Yeah.

233
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,910
See ya.
Yeah.

234
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,760
I'll become a real prince
and protect Matsuri.

235
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Really?
Yeah.

236
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,460
Hehe.

237
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Matsuri, do you remember? That promise.

238
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,280
(Haruka) Huh? What's for dinner today?

239
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,990
(Rihito) Apparently just white rice and salt.
(Haruka) Eh? White rice? Eh….

240
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,990
I see...

241
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:50,210
・～

242
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,210
I won't give her to anyone!

243
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,610
(Haruka, Rihito) Huh?!

244
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,650
Subaru, what are you doing...

245
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,650
That's the worst!

246
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,350
(Rihito) Matsuri-chan!
(Haruka) Matsuri!

247
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
Sorry, Azusa.

248
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,840
≪What's that?
What is it, Subaru-nii?≫

249
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,300
Ah, Azusa-kun!

250
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,670
Ah, are you going to use the washroom?
Haha, please, go ahead.

251
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,020
I just need to dry my hair.

252
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,060
That... can I do it?

253
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,060
Huh? That.

254
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,140
This?

255
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,140
Vroom... (Sound of a hairdryer)

256
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,550
Azusa-kun, I guess you can do the rest yourself...

257
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,270
Click (Sound of hairdryer switching off) I've been thinking about it the whole time.

258
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,630
How can I overwrite it?

259
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,660
Subaru-san's kiss.

260
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,660
Overwrite...

261
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,760
Don't worry.
I won't force you to do anything.

262
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,140
Because I don't want you to hate me.

263
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,520
So,
if you don't like it, tell me.

264
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,550
Then I'll stop.

265
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,590
Huh? What does that mean?

266
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:45,360
...

267
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,060
Is this okay?

268
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,080
Azusa-kun...

269
00:19:50,080 --> 00:20:03,210
...

270
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,230
Then, what about this?

271
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:10,280
...

272
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,650
Matsuri...→

273
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,010
If you don't like it, you have to
say so clearly.

274
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:23,070
...

275
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,770
Otherwise,
I might really kiss you, you know?

276
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:43,610
...

277
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,610
Too late.

278
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,040
Eeeeh!

279
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Eh... what should I have done...?

280
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,140
Haa...

281
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,210
Keen kon kan kon...
(Chime)

282
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,920
<<The only place of peace
is school anymore>>

283
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Matsuri-san, which one do you like?

284
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:23,670
Eh!? Th-This is... what is this?

285
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,380
(Female student) We're having a popularity contest right now, and it's super close.

286
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,740
Right now, this kind of thing is a little...

287
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,740
Which one do you think is the ideal prince?

288
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,360
Ah...

289
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,080
・～

290
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Did you drop this?

291
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,160
Ah!

292
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
You're such a klutz.

293
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,610
The truth is, I've wanted to see you all this time.

294
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,380
If I can be number one at the festival...

295
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,380
...I had given up on just being your brother forever...

296
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,420
...but if I'm about to have my brother's position taken too...

297
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,420
...I absolutely won't hold back anymore.

298
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,170
Both the ideal brother and the ideal prince...

299
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,170
...I'll make you say that's all me.

300
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,620
Because you're a good girl...

301
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,970
...hurry up and come back to me.

302
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:04,710
・～

303
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,410
I'm home! 
(Haruka) Hey, Matsuri→

304
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,100
What's your relationship
with that sparkly guy?

305
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,460
Ah, it's not like there's anything...
(Haruka) Eh? Don't tell me he's→

306
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Your first love or something, right?

307
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,850
(Rihito) I should put a mark
here→

308
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,540
So we won't be able to meet for a while, right?

309
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,240
A mark?
(Rihito) That's right. That Matsuri-chan is→

310
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,940
A mark that she's ours.

311
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,970
Ah... I'll pass!

312
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:37,710
・～

313
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,730
Azusa-kun.

314
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,110
Hey, Matsuri,
will you go on a date with me?

315
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,130
Huh?

316
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,170
・～

317
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,880
Is this the world
Azusa-kun and the others always see?

318
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,230
Let's play lovers.

319
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,590
Nice to meet you, our princess.

320
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,950
Did you remember that I'm
the one who loves you the most in the world?

321
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,450
I have to reach out to Azusa-kun.
