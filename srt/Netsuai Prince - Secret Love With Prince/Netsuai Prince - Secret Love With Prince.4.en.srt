1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,610
（Matsunaga) They're monsters, PRISM.
Unbelievable numbers.

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,430
（Haruka) No way...

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,460
（Matsunaga) Absolute ace, Subaru. →

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,160
Next to him is Yamato. And then, Maki and Kei.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,870
（Rihito) Moreover, they're releasing another new song next month... →

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,230
Their momentum...

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,290
（Matsunaga) Listen up, you guys have been idols for three years now. →

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,290
Show them the difference in class on tomorrow's music show.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:57,880
・～

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:18,410
・～

11
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,410
・～

12
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,560
・～ (My Prism)

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,930
・ The hands of the clock have started moving

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,300
・ I thought we'd never meet again

15
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,010
・ Please, please, let us stay as two

16
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,720
・ I want to start walking anew

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
・ My prism

18
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,750
・ Even if we can't go back

19
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,130
・ Sparkling and shining

20
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,190
・ Memories are just let it be

21
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,880
・ Embrace them

22
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,910
・ The town that saw off spring

23
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,930
・ Is dyed in summer

24
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,960
・ The scent of first love

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,320
・ Takes only you

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,340
・ Away

27
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,040
・ A faintly, lightly blurred station

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,090
・ The reborn me, next to you

29
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,120
・ Will hold your hand tightly

30
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,480
・ I love you

31
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,830
・ I love you

32
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,870
・ I will never

33
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,580
・ Let you go

34
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,940
(Amamiya Matsuri) Next is Terzetto.

35
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,630
(Staff) Subaru-kun and Yamato-kun also formed a group →

36
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,990
They've transformed, haven't they? Hehe. (Staff) Okay, that's a wrap!

37
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,350
(Staff) They're rookies, but already the king, PRISM.

38
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,350
(Staff) The presence is different. (Kisaragi) Thank you very much.

39
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,060
(Amamiya Azusa) It's okay.

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,130
The top is Terzetto. (Haruka) Me, Azusa, and Rihito →

41
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,160
Ever since we decided to become idols, we've only looked at the top.

42
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,180
Because Matsuri-chan's older brother is →

43
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,870
The coolest in the world. (Staff) Terzetto-san →

44
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,550
Please. (Haruka, Rihito, Azusa) Yes!

45
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,570
(Haruka) We're going now!

46
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:19,970
・Princess Koi wa Utakata
Because I don't want to let go

47
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,340
・Gyu tto Hug Hug Hug Hug let me say it…

48
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,370
Ah, a rival. (Saionji Subaru) Come with me for a bit.

49
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,730
Huh? Ah, wait a minute…

50
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,100
Hey, I heard you came to see Terzetto.

51
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,150
PRISM is the enemy!
Am I the enemy too? To Matsuri?

52
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,850
Ah, no, it's not that...

53
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,540
But Terzetto is family.

54
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,540
Boyfriend?

55
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,640
Stop it. If a scandal breaks out about you dating your sister →

56
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,640
She'll be finished as an idol.

57
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Huh?

58
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,410
Finished as an idol…

59
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,460
Come back to me, Matsuri.

60
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Huh…

61
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Just a minute…

62
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,250
Choose me instead of Azusa.

63
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,620
Subaru-nii… that's…

64
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,640
Do you hate me?

65
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,640
That's… of course I love you.

66
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,050
You were always the closest to me →

67
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,050
Subaru-nii was the one who always laughed with me.

68
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,470
I admired siblings because →

69
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,470
It was because Subaru-nii was there.

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,230
(Flashback)
Matsuri, until you're not lonely anymore →

71
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,230
I'll play with you.

72
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,310
Hey, Matsuri… →

73
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,310
Do you know why I became an idol?

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,400
Huh? Why?

75
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,400
・(Staff) Okay, that's a wrap!
Thank you very much!

76
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,780
It seems like Terzetto's stage is over.

77
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,490
Go.

78
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,550
Okay.

79
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:33,970
・～

80
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,330
Haaah...

81
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,360
This is getting me down.
(Kei) What is it?

82
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,390
I'm only seen as an older brother
and nothing else.

83
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,070
(Maki)
Don't you dare underestimate me, Subaru. →

84
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,430
I'm the almighty PRISM, you know.

85
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,450
(Yamato) But Subaru-kun, →

86
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,150
what's so good about
that little sister of yours? →

87
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,170
She's not particularly attractive, to say the least...

88
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,530
It's fine.

89
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,220
You guys don't need to understand.

90
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,580
Jeez, that Matsuri, what an idiot.

91
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,260
I'll definitely make her fall for me again.

92
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,280
(Kisaragi) Please give us your comments
one by one.

93
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,970
I'll go first. (Kisaragi) Please.

94
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:14,360
・～

95
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,060
I'm going to become the number one idol in Japan, →

96
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,060
the number one prince!

97
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,120
(Maki)
He's super motivated.

98
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
(Kei) What a attention seeker.

99
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,510
Haa... I'm tired.

100
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,930
Good work. PRISM is amazing.

101
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,290
We just finished performing too, but...

102
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,290
Everyone's just talking about PRISM.

103
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,040
I wonder... what about us?

104
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,410
What are we lacking?

105
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:56,120
You're so chill, consulting your love rival.

106
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Huh? I heard it from Matsuri.

107
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,890
It doesn't matter to me that you're my love rival.

108
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,930
I just want to humbly learn from where I can.

109
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,960
I can clearly separate my personal life from work, okay?

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Heh... don't try to act cool.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,020
It's annoying.

112
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:26,760
...

113
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,760
I'm not giving up on Matsuri.

114
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,530
If you underestimate me...

115
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,550
I'll really snatch her away.

116
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,550
...

117
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,640
(Reporter) A long-awaited idol debut...

118
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,330
Congratulations. Thank you very much.

119
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,370
(Reporter) Your debut song is themed around first love...

120
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,370
That's right...

121
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,820
My first love was my childhood friend.

122
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,860
But we got too close...

123
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,890
And became like siblings...

124
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,580
She said, "I wish I had an older brother like you."

125
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,580
So I got rejected.

126
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,660
In the end, I was never taken seriously.

127
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,350
(Rihito) Subaru's first love, could it be...

128
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,050
Matsuri-chan? Huh?

129
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,750
Ah, no, no, it's not... (Haruka) Hmm, is that so?...

130
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,450
Seriously, this guy has too many female childhood friends.

131
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,160
(Rihito) Getting rejected, the national treasure-level handsome actor...

132
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,180
Don't worry about it!

133
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,220
Makes you want to protect him, I guess.

134
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,910
(Reporter) If it's the current Subaru, what about your first love?

135
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,950
...

136
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,650
(Matsunaga) Ah~ No, no.
Special training starts today, so →

137
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,340
No entry. Not even the youngest.

138
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,370
Ah... This is a present.

139
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,060
I'll hand it over.

140
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,770
Your older brothers won't be able to come home for a while.

141
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,770
Huh...?
(Matsunaga) Hey, do you understand?

142
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,170
Terzetto is an idol. →

143
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,520
They're everyone's idols.

144
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,230
・～

145
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,280
(Inner voice) ≪Yeah, that's right, everyone's idols≫

146
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,980
≪It's obvious, so why am I
misunderstanding something?≫

147
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
・cough cough cough...。

148
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,050
Subaru-nii?

149
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,050
Matsuri.

150
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,780
What are you doing? In a place like this.

151
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,470
Ah, I was just dropping off a present.

152
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,470
Ah, I see.

153
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
I'm happy to see you.

154
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,590
See ya. Be careful going home.

155
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,610
Wait a minute!
Hm?

156
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,610
Can I talk to you for a sec?

157
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,030
Subaru-nii, do you have a fever?

158
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,030
Huh?

159
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
It's okay, you're not feeling well.
That's no good.

160
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,830
Hey, it's okay.
You need to keep warm.

161
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,830
Stay put until your fever goes down.

162
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,930
Beep beep beep...。

163
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,960
It's 38.8 degrees after all...

164
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,650
I'm fine.

165
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,650
I'll get some ice.

166
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,040
Can you eat something? Like rice porridge.

167
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,040
You have to take medicine.
Okay.

168
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,300
・Chirp chirp... (Birdsong)

169
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,030
Good morning.

170
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,050
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm much better.

171
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,420
Your fever's gone down.
Really?

172
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,450
Oh, that's great!.

173
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,490
Oh, I'm still preparing breakfast, so lie down a little longer.

174
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,490
Thank you.

175
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,900
(Manner mode)

176
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,650
Hello.
(Haruka) Oh, are you alright? →

177
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,350
I thought you might be crying from loneliness on your own.

178
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,350
(Rihito) Why can't you honestly say you wanted to hear her voice?

179
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,100
Oh, um, I'm sorry for telling you so late, but →

180
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,460
Yesterday, Subaru-nii caught a cold and stayed at my place.

181
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,480
(Haruka) Huh? What? Haaah!? Hey, you →

182
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,850
Nothing happened to you, did it? I'm coming to rescue you right now, so wait there!

183
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,870
(Matsunaga) I told you I still have lessons now.

184
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,890
(Haruka) Ouch! Ouch... (Rihito) Let's do the lesson for now.

185
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,910
(Haruka) There's no need to hit me! (Matsunaga) Okay, formation.

186
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,620
Hello.
Azusa-kun. →

187
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,650
Do your best in your lesson.

188
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,650
Matsuri, I'm lonely without seeing you.

189
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,080
Huh?
I want to see you now, and →

190
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,440
I'm thinking about holding you.

191
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,500
・～

192
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,190
Matsuri?

193
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,910
Hehe... I'm glad it's a phone call.

194
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,620
I'm making a face right now that I can't show anyone.

195
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,990
・～

196
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,360
Well, I'm going to go do my best now.
You do your best too, Matsuri.

197
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,720
Yeah.

198
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,410
Click (phone hangs up)

199
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,120
...

200
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,820
Don't make that face. You really like him, don't you?

201
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,170
Ah... well... no...

202
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,170
Well, whatever.

203
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
I won't give up that easily.

204
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,600
You won't give up...?

205
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
But Subaru-nii is...

206
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,030
You love Subaru-nii, but ->

207
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,030
You can't see him as a man?

208
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,440
Eh? Eh? Wait a minute...

209
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,150
Then forget about Subaru-nii already.

210
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,150
I'll make you fall for the me of now, from scratch.

211
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,930
I love you, Matsuri.

212
00:13:47,930 --> 00:14:07,800
...

213
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,850
Like I could force something like that...

214
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,210
I'm a wimp.

215
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,570
It's all just for show.

216
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,270
In the end, I'm...

217
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,270
Hopeless...

218
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,990
Subaru-nii isn't a wimp.

219
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:38,100
He's my beloved big brother ->

220
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Don't speak ill of him.

221
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,170
I'm better now, so I'm going home.

222
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Subaru-nii is loved, huh?

223
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,390
(Haruka) I'm home! Welcome back.

224
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,410
(Haruka) That fake prince didn't do anything weird to you, did he?

225
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,760
Ahaha, no. I had a cold.

226
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,470
(Rihito) That's strange. Idiots aren't supposed to catch colds.

227
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,510
Is your lesson over? (Haruka) Yeah, it's over. And... →

228
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,880
Let's go! The agency's having a hot springs trip for their staff.

229
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,250
Huh? You mean 'let's go' as in me too?

230
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,280
(Haruka) Of course! They said, 'Please come as a family.' →

231
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,300
All the artists from the agency are renting the whole place.

232
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,330
Wow! That's amazing! (Rihito) Then everyone →

233
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,330
Pack your bags and we're leaving in 30 minutes. (Haruka) Okay.

234
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm not that generous. Huh?

235
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,840
I'm getting super jealous. What's with the taking care of her?

236
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,840
That doesn't sound like you, Azusa-kun.

237
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,250
It's true.

238
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,290
I get pretty stressed before the festival.

239
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:13,730
・～

240
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,730
Matsuri, did Subaru do anything to you?

241
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,450
Ah, no, it's not like that...

242
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,170
(Maki) Oh? My sister came too.

243
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,870
Hello.

244
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,890
Ah, your brothers are →

245
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,250
At the chairman's place... they went there.

246
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,250
(Maki) I know. That's where I'm going too.

247
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,630
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,380
You came all the way here with your family, but →

249
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,380
You must be bored by yourself.

250
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,110
Should I bring out Terzetto?

251
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,480
No, it's okay. But →

252
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Thank you.

253
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,220
(Maki) By the way, did you hear about →

254
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,250
The open-air bath with a great view?

255
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,270
Huh? (Maki) It's supposed to be really good.

256
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,620
Why don't you go check it out?

257
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,980
Thank you.

258
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,350
・～(BGM in the building)

259
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,380
・　Hot spring, hot spring

260
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:44,380
・～(BGM in the building)

261
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,890
Huh?

262
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,240
Huh!?
No way~!!

263
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,600
Huh? Why, Azusa-kun….

264
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,620
Wait…
It's men's bath time right now!

265
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,320
Huh… no way!
Sorry, I'll get out!

266
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,690
・Rattling… (sound of door) Huh?

267
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,050
Huh? Here, hide.

268
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,080
Ah, okay.

269
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,110
I'll handle this,
so can you be a good boy for a little bit?

270
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,110
Okay.

271
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Oh? It's Azusa.
Subaru-san.

272
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,630
What? You skipping out too?

273
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,330
Yes….

274
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,700
Um… Subaru-san…. Azusa, you→

275
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,740
Are you sulking?
Huh?

276
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,740
You never skip out on things like this.

277
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,460
If it's because I said you were trying to be cool, I'm sorry.

278
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,220
No, Subaru-san is right→

279
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,220
The truth is, I'm
not cool or anything.

280
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:06,650
That's why
I'm super pissed.

281
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,650
That Subaru-san
gave Matsuri a hickey.

282
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,740
A hickey, huh….

283
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,430
You said you'd snatch her away, but I….

284
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,120
That guy…→

285
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,490
He likes the weak me from the past→

286
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,860
More than the cool me now.
Apparently.

287
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,220
He told me not to talk bad about the old me→

288
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,580
I got scolded.

289
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,290
So, I
have to beat the old me first→

290
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,290
Before I compete with you.

291
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,050
Azusa, I don't plan on giving up, and→

292
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,770
As long as Matsuri likes you,
I'll hate you, but→

293
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,790
But…→

294
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,500
I think you're a good rival
as an idol.

295
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,200
・～

296
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Nice to meet you, senpai.

297
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,610
Well then, I'm heading out first.

298
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:25,080
・～

299
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,110
Azusa-kun…

300
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:32,160
I think I understand a little bit why
Matsuri is so attached to Subaru-san.

301
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,520
I think I understand a little bit.

302
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,880
Huh?

303
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,600
Ah! Sorry... I got lightheaded.

304
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,290
This is bad…

305
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,290
Ehh~! Hey, wait a minute…

306
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,690
Are you okay?

307
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:57,410
I wanted to be on your lap
for a different reason.

308
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,100
Any reason is fine.

309
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,820
I'm so happy to spend this time with you, Azusa-kun.

310
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,870
Ahhh, I wish we could
take a bath together→

311
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,570
And just hug each other.

312
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,610
I'm annoyed by the hickey,
and his composed attitude…

313
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,640
I should have just punched him.

314
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,010
Hey, Azusa-kun…
We're not working right now→

315
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,720
It's okay if you're not cool, right?

316
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,080
Yeah.

317
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Hehe~.

318
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,460
I'm sorry.
Did I make you feel lonely?

319
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,210
No.

320
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,910
Because Terzetto is working hard→

321
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,280
Everyone loves Terzetto and is waiting for them.

322
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:58,700
・～

323
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,740
You know,
I love Azusa-kun when he's an idol.→

324
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,780
I love it.

325
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:12,500
He's so cool,
just hearing his voice makes me happy.

326
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:19,570
But as an idol Azusa-kun and me, his fan→

327
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,570
Our eyes won't meet…

328
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,650
But when we're together like this→

329
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,350
Azusa-kun always looks at me.

330
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:36,060
・～

331
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,780
So, just for that time→

332
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,820
I want to monopolize
Azusa-kun's gaze→

333
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,840
That's what I end up thinking…

334
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:53,230
・～

335
00:22:53,230 --> 00:23:00,300
・～

336
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,300
Don't go back to being an idol yet.

337
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,400
≪I know I can't monopolize→

338
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,120
Azusa-kun when he's an idol.≫

339
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,120
≪So, just for a little while…≫

340
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,230
Hey, Matsuri, does that mean→

341
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,230
It's okay for me to do things that I can't do as an idol?

342
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,940
Huh? Ah, wait a minute…

343
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,700
Give me just a little more.

344
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:48,700
・～

345
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,510
Monopolize?
The MVP prize for the sports festival→

346
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,210
Apparently, it's the right to monopolize
Terzetto for a day.

347
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,230
Because
even if you hate me→

348
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,850
I wanted to take it from you.
I won't give it to you.

349
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,550
Azusa-kun should stay there as an idol.
