1
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,980
(Matsunaga) According to the doctor, there will be pain for a while, but

2
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,270
he says it will be alright if you rest.

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,490
(Haruka) I'm glad it ended with just this.

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,150
(Rihito) I'm glad Matsuri-chan is safe too.

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,540
(Amamiya Matsuri) Yamato carried me here,

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,540
so I was able to get treatment right away.

7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,590
(Amamiya Azusa) I can do it.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,010
I'll definitely be at the awards.

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,370
No, I'll decline.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,060
Huh...?

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,100
PRISM will probably have to do two slots worth.

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,800
PRISM is also in the middle of a problem...

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,490
I refuse.

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,510
I'm definitely going to go and win the Grand Prix.

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,870
(Yamato) Don't say stupid things.

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,230
There's no way you can stand on stage like that.

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,280
・～

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,310
(Yamato) Just give up gracefully.

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,310
Don't show your fans a lame side of yourself.

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Sigh... *slam* (door sound)

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,450
When I stand on stage,

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,160
I play a cool and perfect version of myself.

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,850
That's what I am as an idol.

24
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,850
Just listen to Yamato and stay put.

25
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,890
Terzetto's performance is off.

26
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:57,800
・～

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:17,330
・～

28
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,330
・～

29
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
I'll put it here.

30
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,490
Well then.

31
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,490
Are you going home already?

32
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:45,610
I don't want to be by Azusa-kun's side anymore.

33
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,300
Huh?

34
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,340
I'm causing trouble and making you worry…

35
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,340
And on top of that, I made you get hurt…

36
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,730
I don't have the confidence to be by your side.

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Are you worrying about that now?

38
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,520
Huh?

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,520
If you're going to say that, I'm always causing you trouble too.

40
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,290
I'm not that reliable →

41
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,990
I try to help, but I end up getting hurt.

42
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,360
That's…
It's better to only show you my →

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,390
cool side on TV.

44
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:39,480
・～

45
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,860
But just being admired from afar is →

46
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,860
something I don't want anymore.

47
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,950
If you don't have confidence, then properly complete the stage →

48
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,320
I'll prove it.

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,320
That Matsuri's place is next to me.

50
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,060
But the injury… Matsuri.

51
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,110
Believe in us.

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,500
We'll be at the awards.

53
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,870
And we'll give the best performance →

54
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,890
and win the Grand Prix.

55
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:31,330
・～

56
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,330
Hey, Matsuri.

57
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,400
Don't you have any words for me yet?→

58
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,750
"I don't want to be by your side"?

59
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:47,160
・～

60
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
"Do your best."

61
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,220
Yeah.

62
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,280
・～

63
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,970
There's no way that's possible. (Haruka, Rihito) Please!

64
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,670
(Matsunaga) A person who is currently hospitalized→

65
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,360
can't possibly stand on stage the day after tomorrow. (Haruka) Please!→

66
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,380
Azusa is fine. With willpower....

67
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,740
(Kisaragi) This isn't amateur hour! PRISM will fill the void in Terzetto.

68
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,440
That's the decision.

69
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
(Saionji Subaru) From us too...→

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,490
Please.

71
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,180
(Kisaragi) You guys are fine. Focus on your lessons.→

72
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,210
This is your chance. (Kei) Terzetto is, to us,→

73
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,570
an important rival.
I want to fight fair and square.

74
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,270
(Kisaragi) You're not in a position to act cool.

75
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,310
You, who were thought to be an elegant and perfect prince,→

76
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,020
are now a selfish, willful,
self-centered man.

77
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,710
You guys are being forced to carry→

78
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,710
an incredible handicap.

79
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,450
(Haruka) Please.
(Matsunaga) Hey.

80
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,830
(Rihito)
We will never break the fans' dreams.

81
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,910
I also will never do anything→

82
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,940
that would disappoint you.
(Maki) Please→

83
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,980
let both of our teams participate. And→

84
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,030
let us seize the title of Japan's number one idol
with our own hands.

85
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,050
(All 5) Please!

86
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:29,180
・～

87
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,880
Will we make it in time? Formation change.

88
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,250
(Haruka) Of course. We're brothers.

89
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,270
(Masato) We can manage anything.

90
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:49,370
...

91
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,400
(Yamato) Should we do it too?

92
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,450
Let's be reborn from
a refined prince to a selfish and willful ->

93
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,500
Egotistical man.

94
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,200
Thanks.
(Kei) Of course. ->

95
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Aren't we comrades?

96
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,280
(Ken)
We're not brothers, but we're bound by fate.

97
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,640
(Yamato) Right.

98
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,660
Shall we do it?
(Yamato) Yeah.

99
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:37,190
...

100
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:57,390
...

101
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:17,590
...

102
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,940
Hmm...

103
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,300
Haa...

104
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,010
...

105
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,380
It's okay. We can do it.

106
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,380
...

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,380
...Knock knock. Yes?

108
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,800
Click (door sound) Oh, Matsuri.

109
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,260
You came. PRISM is ->

110
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,980
Our older brothers' rival, but thank you very much, so ->

111
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,980
Here's a little something. Thank you.

112
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,410
Oh, and...
Here's this for Subaru-nii.

113
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,450
Huh? A good luck charm.

114
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,480
Subaru-nii is
actually kinder and more ->

115
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,540
Sensitive than anyone else, so it will definitely get through.

116
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,260
Those articles are going to be okay.

117
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,970
If you're worried about me that much, then →

118
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,320
It wouldn't be so bad if an article came out about it.

119
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
What are you saying...? Huh?

120
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,430
Matsuri,
Once today's stage is over →

121
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,450
Become mine.

122
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:46,180
・～

123
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,550
Become mine.

124
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,910
He doesn't seem like Subaru-nii at all....

125
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,930
That's right.

126
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,950
Selfish and self-centered →

127
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,950
A totally self-important guy.

128
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,700
If I was a prince until now →

129
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,730
I guess... →

130
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,090
A king?

131
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,090
・(Yamato)
Subaru-kun~ Makeup time!

132
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,460
Well then, look forward to the stage, Matsuri.

133
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,210
Click

134
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
Ah.

135
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,330
Ah, would you like some coffee?

136
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,330
No, thank you.
Ah... this is a small gift.

137
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,100
See you.

138
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,800
(Yamato)
Hot! Ouch, I got burned....

139
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,160
Huh? Huh? No way! Are you okay?
Ah, are you okay?

140
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,520
Crap.
Ah~ um, um... →

141
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Ah, water! Water! Water! Here.

142
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,320
I don't dislike it.

143
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,680
That stupidly kind-hearted side of you.

144
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Huh...? Ah, just a little...

145
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,100
Can I have it?

146
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,460
Ha... have what?

147
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,480
The promise.

148
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:31,560
・～

149
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,920
Crunch…
Ouch!

150
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,920
Ah… ah, sorry. Did it hurt?

151
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,010
I can't believe this!

152
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,010
Hey, what are you going to do about this tooth mark!

153
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,750
Call it a ring.
It's a tooth mark!

154
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,440
This is ridiculous.

155
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,160
・～

156
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,190
I'm going to perform for you now.

157
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,570
・～

158
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,600
Come jump into my arms when it's over.

159
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,990
・～

160
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,990
Excuse me.

161
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,780
Ah…

162
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,150
Painkillers, please.

163
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,150
This is the last time I can prescribe them.

164
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,250
(Haruka) I think I'll eat Matsumoto's croissant sandwich.

165
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,270
(Rihito) Me too, me too.
(Haruka) Hey, you→

166
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,960
Take it from this side.
(Rihito) What's wrong with just one?

167
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,650
(Haruka) I want to eat everything I got from Matsumoto.

168
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,680
(Rihito) You're not going to eat all four, are you?
(Haruka) I'm going to eat all four!→

169
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,720
If anything, I'll eat six. All of them… I'll eat three.

170
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,740
Give it here.
(Haruka) You're going to eat three too?→

171
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,740
You're eating too much.
Hahaha.

172
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,160
Hey, Matsuri, today,
watch over me from the side of the stage.

173
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,850
Huh?
When Matsuri-chan is there, →

174
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,870
I feel energized.

175
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,910
Because I can be with you until right before.

176
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,260
Yeah.

177
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,630
(Woman)
Hey, what do you think of Subaru's article?

178
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,660
It's awful, right? I think I've cooled off.

179
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,350
Because,
acting like such a prince →

180

Okay, Matsuri, let's get married.
(Haruka) Huh? You, talking about marriage, →
