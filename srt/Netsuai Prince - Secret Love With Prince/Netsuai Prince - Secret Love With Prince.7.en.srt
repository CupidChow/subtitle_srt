1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,350
(Amamiya Azusa) I'll take off your bottoms too.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,350
You can get mad at me later.

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,060
I'd rather have something
wrong with Matsuri than be hated.

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:27,130
・～

5
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,130
Get well soon.

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,220
(Amamiya Matsuri's inner voice)
≪Like I could ever hate→

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,220
…≫

8
00:00:41,270 --> 00:01:01,800
・～

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:21,340
・～

10
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,340
・～

11
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,570
Huh? Big brother?

12
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,920
Tap, tap, tap…
(Sound of footsteps descending stairs)

13
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:54,660
・～

14
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,660
Azusa-kun?

15
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,400
You were originally
satisfied just watching us→

16
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,770
on TV, right? Just go back to that.

17
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,770
Bye-bye.

18
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,810
Bang

19
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,580
Sorry, did I wake you?

20
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,950
No.

21
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,320
I think your temperature has
mostly returned to normal.

22
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,880
What's wrong?

23
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,580
Don't leave me.

24
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,610
Please.

25
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,610
Don't go anywhere.

26
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,330
Don't… come to hate me.

27
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,430
I'll never hate you.

28
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,430
I love you.

29
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,510
Because…
Sorry.

30
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,220
I hate the me who was
Matsuri's boyfriend.

31
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,590
Huh?
What a small person I was, I got angry easily→

32
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,620
I have no composure, and besides…→

33
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,340
I become so possessive.

34
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,030
I want to tie you down so much.

35
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,400
・～

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,790
I have to concentrate properly on work
until the awards.

37
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,790
That's why
I asked you to let us go back to being siblings.

38
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,870
Sorry.

39
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,270
That's….

40
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,970
Right now, I have too little composure→

41
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,970
and I know I'm acting strange in many ways.

42
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,070
But I'll do my best.

43
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:21,470
・～

44
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,170
I'll definitely show Matsuri
the coolest prince→

45
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,170
in the world.

46
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,580
I'll absolutely be number one.

47
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:40,660
・～

48
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,390
So, please
watch me from the closest place.

49
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,430
・～

50
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,450
Okay.

51
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,160
・～

52
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Can I… kiss you?

53
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,580
No.
Why?

54
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,930
Why, you ask…
Absolutely not right now.

55
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,950
Why!
I said no!

56
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,980
Why!
Ugh~!

57
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,010
I'm trying hard not to touch you!

58
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,380
I told you.
Once I'm off stage,→

59
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
I'm just a normal high school student.

60
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,120
Yeah. I also→

61
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,500
want you to be normal with me
when it's just the two of us.

62
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,540
・～

63
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,580
Then, only at those times,→

64
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,630
can I have all of your Azusa-kun
to myself?

65
00:05:44,630 --> 00:06:00,120
・～

66
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,820
No kissing…

67
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,190
When Matsuri is feeling better,
can you say that line again?

68
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,220
When Matsuri is feeling better,
can you say that line again?

69
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,220
Then, let's continue this kiss.

70
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay.

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,030
Please eat a lot.
(Saionji Subaru) Thank you.

72
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,720
(Masato) Thank you.
(Maki) Don't leave your tomatoes.

73
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,080
(Yamato) I don't like tomatoes.
(Haruka) Someone like that →

74
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,110
Doesn't deserve to eat Matsuri's food. Spit it out! (Yamato) Huh?

75
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,460
Seconds.
(Yamato) Oh, me too!

76
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,490
(Haruka) You think I'll let you eat more!
(Kisaragi) Don't eat too much.

77
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,510
Especially Kei, you gain weight easily.

78
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,860
(Kei) Me? I'm getting unfairly targeted.

79
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,210
Everyone,
let's eat our meals quietly.

80
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,910
(Masato) Agreed. Huh?

81
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,610
We rarely agree, do we? Hehe.

82
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,630
It's delicious, Matsuri. (Haruka) I'm glad you like →

83
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,010
I'm glad you like our cooking. Yeah, it's very delicious.

84
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,700
(Yamato) Ugh, this is the worst! What is this!

85
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,400
(Haruka) Eat properly.
(Yamato) Huh? Ugh, geez...

86
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
・(Murmuring)

87
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,470
(Reporters) Ah! Subaru-san!
Subaru-san →

88
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,830
Is the content of the article true?
(Reporter) What's the truth?

89
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,860
(Reporter) Please say something.
Oh? You're the... his partner...

90
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,220
Huh?
(Reporter) It's been reported that you're a tyrant who →

91
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,240
Uses your lover in your debut PV.

92
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,260
(Matsunaga)
Understood. I'll deal with it later.

93
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,260
Please calm down for a moment.
Please don't take pictures.

94
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,330
That's wrong...

95
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,710
That's wrong.
This is completely different from the truth.

96
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,760
(Yamato)
First of all, I was the one who recommended him for the PV.

97
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,470
(Kisaragi) The truth doesn't matter. The article is out. →

98
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,500
It's a common tactic to bring down someone who's riding high.

99
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,540
It's a common tactic.
We'll discuss it at the office.

100
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,540
The training camp is canceled. Don't leave the house.

101
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,320
A tyrant is the last thing he is...

102
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:07,390
・～

103
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,410
Matsuri.

104
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,450
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

105
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:24,880
・～

106
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,260
<<That's not who he is.>>

107
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,260
<<That's not who he is...>>

108
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Do you feel like your head is full of Subaru?

109
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:45,090
I'm sorry... I understand you're worried and anxious, but→

110
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,090
Let's rest a bit.

111
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:53,180
It's okay. Subaru-nii is the one having a hard time.

112
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,230
Even so, my role is to worry about Matsuri.

113
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,230
Just listen to me. It's okay to think about Subaru.

114
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Thank you.

115
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,040
No, I actually hate it.

116
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,040
It's incredibly complicated.

117
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm sorry. But, Azusa-kun→

118
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,500
Isn't there something I can do to help?

119
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,220
What? I don't know, but...

120
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,910
What if I went to a weekly magazine and talked?

121
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,270
That's impossible. But→

122
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,300
They might write an article about it. That's no good.

123
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,660
But Subaru-nii is being written about, right?

124
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,680
That's what our job is!

125
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,680
That's not what our job is!

126
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,810
Matsuri...→

127
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,510
Me from Terzetto→

128
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,880
And Subaru from PRISM.

129
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Which one do you like?

130
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,300
What are you saying? That's...

131
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,990
It's definitely Azusa-kun... Then→

132
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,020
Me→

133
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,720
Or Subaru-nii, who you used to love?

134
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:30,470
・～

135
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,190
Isn't Subaru the one who truly makes Matsuri feel safe?

136
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,560
Isn't Subaru the one who truly makes Matsuri feel safe?

137
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,600
You were too close to notice, but→

138
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,640
Hasn't Subaru always been in love with Matsuri?

139
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,660
Hasn't Subaru always been in love with Matsuri?

140
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,710
・～

141
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,060
(Flashback) Matsuri

142
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:08,530
・～

143
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,210
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:18,210
・～

145
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,880
(Sound of door opening) (Matsuri, Yamato) Ah.

146
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,900
Yamato…

147
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,600
(Yamato) What are you doing, little sister?

148
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,280
Hey, where's Subaru, bro?

149
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,330
(Yamato) He's talking with the president. It looks like it'll take a while.

150
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,020
Then, I'll wait outside.

151
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,020
(Yamato) It's cold. Are you okay?

152
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,430
Eh, wait…

153
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,130
No way. The media is here.

154
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,830
I'm saying this because I'm worried. Got it?

155
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,190
You're too close.

156
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,560
Even though we once shared a kiss? Tap, tap... (Footsteps)

157
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,600
(Matsunaga) "Shared a kiss"?
Ah! →

158
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,290
Ah… Ah, no.

159
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,330
(Matsunaga) You're the one who recommended the youngest for the PV, right? →

160
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,370
Could it be that, actually, it's not Subaru,
but you who's with the youngest…

161
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,410
That's not true!
Yamato isn't like that.

162
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,410
There's absolutely no deeper meaning.

163
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,170
Swish... (Sound of rain)

164
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,570
Matsuri?

165
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,960
Why! You're wet.

166
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,990
Subaru, bro,
I'm going to the weekly magazine's place →

167
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,380
and tell them it's a misunderstanding.
Stop it. There's no need.

168
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,380
Don't do anything unnecessary. It's a nuisance.

169
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,140
I don't want to
get you involved, idiot.

170
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,920
But, as your childhood friend,
I can prove it, right?

171
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,620
That Saienji Subaru has always been
kind since way back →

172
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,980
and everyone's hero.

173
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,020
Subaru, bro,
the truth is, you're not good at →

174
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,060
relying on others or showing weakness, right?

175
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,090
Please. I want to help.

176
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:39,910
・～

177
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,910
I love you.

Don't go to the publisher.

It's okay.
I'll take back what was stolen myself.

Don't underestimate me. I'm an idol.

What for...?

192
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,020
For shaking off my hand and going to Subaru?

193
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,110
Or is there something else you feel guilty about?

194
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,110

You were worried about me, but I ran off.

Subaru-nii also stopped me, so...

So...

Huh? Of course he did.

If you do that, he'll cherish you...

208
