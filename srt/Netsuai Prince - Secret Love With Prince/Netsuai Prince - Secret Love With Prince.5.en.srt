1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,560
・～

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,560
(Azusa Amamiya)
I want to hold you tighter.

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,640
(Matsuri Amamiya)
W-wait a minute!

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,700
Haa... 30 seconds.
Please give me time to take a deep breath.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,700
Denied.
Ehh~!? 

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,420
Just kidding. Here.

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,840
I got to monopolize you
a lot, so →

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,840
Satisfied. I'll go buy a drink.

9
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,590
Thump!

10
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,590
Haa…

11
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,010
(Inner voice) <<Haa... How uncool...>>

12
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,010
<<Why am I so eager?>>

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:23,930
・～

14
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:33,030
・～

15
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:43,130
・～

16
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,130
・～

17
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:56,930
(Haruka) Ah~ I guess this relaxing time
won't be happening for a while...

18
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,300
Lessons start tomorrow.
That's tough…

19
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,010
But I'm looking forward to it.
(Haruka) Yeah.

20
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,030
I hope we can at least participate in the sports festival.

21
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,730
(Haruka) Definitely.
(Rihito) Huh? When is it?

22
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,750
Next weekend.

23
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,780
It's been a while since
I played basketball.

24
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,800
(Haruka) Definitely.
(Yamato) Little sister →

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,150
Can you even play sports?
You're so clumsy.

26
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,510
The devil's here!
(Haruka) Huh? Isn't PRISM →

27
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,530
supposed to be busy with
promotions for a while?

28
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,900
(Yamato) Yeah, that's why I came now. Being an idol is crazy, huh? →

29
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,940
There's too much to do.
It's completely different from when I was a dancer.

30
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,640
(Kei) I respect Terzetto
for continuing that.

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,330
(Haruka) Easy for you to say.
You guys keep breaking →

32
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,050
our debut records.
Our new song is on the same day, right? Give me a break.

33
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,760
At the sports festival, the siscon little sister has to do her best, right~.

34
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,120
The sports festival and siscon have nothing to do with each other, right?

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,490
Because apparently the MVP prize at the sports festival →

36
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,490
is the right to monopolize
Terzetto for a day.

37
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,540
(Matsuri, Azusa, Rihito, Haruka)
"The right to monopolize them"?

38
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,280
(The three of them)
Well, I guess it can't be helped…

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,650
(Kei) This cookie is delicious. <<Monopolize?>>

40
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:15,720
・～

41
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,720
<<Ehh~!?>>

42
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,800
Hey~ Are you okay?

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,490
Matsuri, if you want, I →

44
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,180
can tell the executive committee
to make them stop?

45
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,560
Ah... I'm okay.
It'll definitely be exciting.

46
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,560
As expected of Terzetto.
As expected of the number one idol.

47
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,960
<<It's not right for me
to make a face and trouble them.>>

48
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,410
(Female student) Pass!

49
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,770
MVP!
Hmm!

50
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,470
MVP! Hmm!

51
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,470
Ah... sorry.

52
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,220
Could you practice a little more seriously?

53
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,920
Well, since we're siblings,
you don't need to monopolize me, right?

54
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,950
Ah～
You're laughing at us for being so desperate, aren't you?

55
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,950
Aren't you?
No!

56
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,330
Clumsy!

57
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,430
Thud (sound of ball bouncing)
(Yamato) Sorry about that!

58
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,470
This girl is clumsy,
she can't catch that pass.

59
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,470
(Female students) Kyaa!

60
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,200
(Yamato) This girl seems to be holding everyone back,

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,560
so I'll have her practice somewhere else.
Eh?

62
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,580
(Yamato) Come on, little sister. Eh?

63
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,580
Are you going?
Um, can I practice with you too...?

64
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,330
Um....

65
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,330
Thank you.

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,730
If we're seen together,

67
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,770
I don't know what they'll say again...

68
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,770
See ya.

69
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,510
You...

70
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,510
are so boring.

71
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,570
Huh?
(Yamato) You even appeared in PRISM's PV,

72
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,270
but you're still whining.

73
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,300
It's annoying to watch.
Ugh.

74
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,990
Haa...

75
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,990
You're scared of being talked about behind your back.

76
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,400
Get a grip!

77
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Am I still your toy?

78
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,140
I don't intend to be a toy, but...

79
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,520
Are you that shocked
that your beloved Azusa-kun

80
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,560
is just spending a day with someone else?

81
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,920
Haa～, you're such a child～.

82
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,300
・～

83
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,300
MVP
Why don't you just take it?

84
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,380
Eh?
(Yamato) Instead of whining,

85
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,380
why don't you protect your brother yourself?

86
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,120
Work hard
and become worthy, right?

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Did you forget because you're too stupid?

88
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,550
That's right! Eh, that's right.

89
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,580
I'm going to aim for MVP!

90
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,620
Yamato, thank you!

91
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,680
Yamato says things other than mean stuff, huh～.

92
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,390
Alright! I'll do my best!

93
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,410
Haa....

94
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:42,780
I'm trying not to say those things...

95
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,800
Idiot.

96
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Bang (sound of door)

97
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,230
Sorry for calling you out, Azusa-kun.

98
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,600
Um... I'll be home late for a while.

99
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
The food is in the fridge.

100
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,380
Haa... Are you mad at me?

101
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,380
Not really. Just that you seem to have a lot of leeway.

102
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,140
Enough to skip class with Yamato.

103
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:22,190
I don't have leeway, really. That's why I'm practicing.

104
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,230
I want to be the MVP of the sports festival.

105
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,260
Wait, were you really upset?

106
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,280
Then should I go tell the committee...

107
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,310
I want to fight fair and square.

108
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,350
Azusa-kun, you just be there as an idol.

109
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,380
I'm going.

110
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,400
Eh, wait a minute...

111
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,110
・～

112
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,110
I'm quite popular as someone who isn't your brother.

113
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,190
Okay.

114
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:16,060
・～

115
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,770
I really want to, but I'll hold back until Matsuri wins me over.

116
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,790
I'll be patient.

117
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:28,790
・～

118
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,300
I'll be waiting.

119
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:47,700
・～

120
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Okay.

121
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,770
(Rihito) I'm off! (Haruka) Crap, I'm late!

122
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,800
Um...→

123
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,490
Okay!

124
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,490
Fuaah...

125
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,530
A cooking show?

126
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,280
・Chirp chirp... (bird sounds)

127
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:20,360
・～

128
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Alright!

129
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,820
Amamiya-san, I'm sorry to ask, but...

130
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,180
Could you put the ball away in the storage room when you leave?

131
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,200
Ah... Okay.

132
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,220
Thanks. See you later.

133
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,220
Let's do our best tomorrow. Bye-bye. (Female Student) Bye-byee.

134
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,620
Alright!

135
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,010
Alright! All that's left is the real thing!

136
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,780
Bang. Clang (sound of a lock)

137
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,140
Because you're getting close to Yamato-kun.

138
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,840
・(Female Student) I'll let you out after tomorrow's sports festival...

139
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,530
Be quiet.

140
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,890
Seriously, that guy is so dense. (Female Student) Ahaha.

141
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,910
・Knock, knock, knock! (Sound of knocking on the door)
・Hey!

142
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,280
Somebody! Hey!

143
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,980
Ugh... Just a bit... Huh?

144
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,670
(Yamato) Huh? Huh... What time is it now?

145
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,370
Ah! Ah, crap.
I skipped class and fell asleep~.

146
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,070
Hey, Yamato, Yamato, Yamato!
Your phone! Do you have your phone?

147
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,070
Huh? What? What? Your phone!

148
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,450
(Yamato) Ah... Ah, sorry. What?

149
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,540
The door's locked... I can't get out.

150
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,590
Knock, knock! Knock, knock, knock...
Hey! Somebody! Hey!

151
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,280
(Yamato) Hey, it's dangerous. Seriously!

152
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,310
Let's calm down for a second.
It's the ball game tournament!

153
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,670
I promised to be MVP!

154
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,360
Knock, knock, knock, knock!
Somebody~! Hey!

155
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,730
I understand, but!
Let go of me already...

156
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,730
Aah!

157
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,140
<<Huh?>>
<<Huh?>>

158
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,140
Eeeh!?

159
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,210
(Matsunaga) The new song rankings are out. →

160
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,610
It's 2nd place.
(Haruka) Huh? 2nd place?

161
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,610
(Matsunaga) 1st place is PRISM.

162
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,340
Wait, are you kidding me?

163
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,030
We're in our third year since debut, you know.

164
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:38,410
(Matsunaga) The agency is completely
starting to push PRISM. →

165
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,450
It might be a matter of resolve.
The members of PRISM are →

166
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,480
putting their entire lives and careers
on the line.

167
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,170
They're different from you guys. →

168
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,170
We've been completely replaced.

169
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,540
Terzetto is over.

170
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,610
Bang! (Sound of hitting the desk) It's not over! Terzetto is not.

171
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,610
Rumble, rumble... (Sound of thunder)

172
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,060
Calling for help until morning
might be really impossible~.

173
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:15,110
・～

174
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,480
Hey, are you listening?
Haah!

175
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,510
I'm seriously
thinking about how to escape, →

176
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,870
can you seriously stop
thinking about perverted things?

177
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,890
Huh? I'm not thinking about anything!

178
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,250
And why is Yamato so calm?

179
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,620
We... kissed...

180
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,660
It was just an accident. Well, it was an accident, but...

181
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,030
Just a simple accident, though... Yeah, an accident.

182
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,070
That was definitely an accident.
An accident... It was nothing but an accident...

183
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,760
This is so annoying~!

184
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,780
All over a single kiss.

185
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:55,180
・～

186
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,180
Huh?

187
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,580
Don't cross
this line anymore.

188
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,940
Who would...
There's no way I would.

189
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,970
Ah~, that's good. You're
great as a toy but →

190
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,670
you're too childish and boring as a lover~.

191
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,360
I know that!

192
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
・Pishan! (Thunder) Whoa!

193
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,440
・Pishan! Rumble rumble rumble...・Zaah... (Rain sound)

194
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,140
Huh?
Sorry.

195
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,520
I... I really hate thunder...

196
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
<<Ehhh!?>>

197
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,120
(Rihito) Even if you tell me to be prepared...
Prepared?

198
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
Click

199
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:45,210
I... but still, I don't want to lose to PRISM.

200
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,570
(Rihito) Azusa, you're really competitive, aren't you?

201
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,940
Of course,
I'm annoyed too...

202
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,970
But how...?

203
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,670
(Saiyonji Subaru) Yo.
(Haruka) Wow, speak of the devil.

204
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,360
I just had a meeting upstairs.

205
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,400
(Maki) What? He's not here.
Where did that slacker go?

206
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,090
(Kei) Yamato, do you know?

207
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,090
Matsuri and Yamato, we haven't been able to reach them since evening.

208
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,500
Huh?

209
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,520
・Zaah...

210
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Stop!
That's the line.

211
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,580
You crossed it earlier, Yamato.

212
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,610
Hmm... mine doesn't count.

213
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,300
Anyway, don't come any closer than that.

214
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,660
・Pishan! Eek! Ahh...

215
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,710
Haa... haa... haa... Ugh...

216
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,090
・Rumble rumble rumble...

217
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,090
I'll move away properly when the thunder stops.

218
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:50,190
Don't say such mean things like 'don't come near me'.

219
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,230
・～

220
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,270
It's not mean.

221
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,320
I was deliberately
keeping my distance from you.

222
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,680
Huh?

223
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,400
Because a kiss with me
would depress you even if it was an accident, right?→

224
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,100
Spending the whole morning
with a guy you hate like that→

225
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,120
I thought it would be pitiful...

226
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,510
・～

227
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,540
You're so stupid.

228
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,560
I don't want to hear that from you.

229
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,600
Someone like you who's scared of thunder
isn't scary at all...→

230
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,630
Achoo! Haa...

231
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,990
Sniff... Sniff... (sniffling)

232
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,380
・～

233
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,770
I'll warm you up. There, there... It's okay. It's alright.

234
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:55,850
I won't do anything.
No meanness or harassment.

235
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,850
So...
don't hate me that much.

236
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,580
(Haruka) Matsuri~! Where are you~!

237
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,340
Haruka!? Here! Over here!

238
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,360
(Haruka) Warehouse... It's a warehouse!

239
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,070
(Rihito) I figured, the GPS stopped at the school...

240
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,430
Huh?

241
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,790
It's the power of love.

242
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,810
Ugh!
Thump!

243
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,830
Matsuri!
(Haruka) It won't open!

244
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,200
Are you okay?
Haruka! Haruka, let me take over!

245
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
・Rattling!

246
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,230
Haa, haa... Huh?

247
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,310
Everyone...
(Subaru, Haruka) Matsuri!

248
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,330
(Haruka) Are you okay? Yeah.

249
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,360
(Rihito)
Matsuri-chan, are you okay?

250
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Matsuri. Water.

251
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,750
(Haruka) What? I said "Matsuri."

252
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,110
Thank you. (Yamato) Lucky that it didn't become a big deal.

253
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,470
We got lucky.

254
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,490
Just ended with me kissing your precious little sister.

255
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,520
Just ended with me kissing your precious little sister.

256
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,520
A kiss?
I'm going home~.

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,700
(Students cheering)

258
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,390
(Female student) Go, go, go!

259
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,390
Yes!
Matsuri-san!

260
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Haaah~!

261
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,160
(Students) Waaah!
Tweet! (Whistle)

262
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,200
(Teacher) Game over! Winner, 1-B!

263
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Yes!

264
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,910
Yes!

265
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,330
(Yamato)
Hmm, I'm looking forward to your game.

266
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,360
What? Don't bother me.
No being mean.

267
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,060
I won't. Because even if you hate me...

268
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,090
I've decided I want to steal you away.

269
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,810
・~

270
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,830
(Yamato)
It's fine. Just give your brother away.

271
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,830
Give your brother to someone.

272
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,580
Don't touch my sister anymore than you already have.

273
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,580
Can I talk to you for a sec?

274
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:32,750
Huh?
Are you going to punch me?

275
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,780
Heh...

276
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,470
Hey, Azusa-kun...

277
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,510
Give me your sister.

278
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,550
Yamato, I won't give her to you.

279
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,550
Matsuri is mine.

280
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,950
You're not calm, are you, Azusa-kun?

281
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,640
You don't seem like an idol.

282
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,340
Is that why you're losing to PRISM?

283
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:04,390
And soon, your sister might be...

284
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,090
Taken by me.

285
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,090
・Tweet! Oh, the game's starting~. See you.

286
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Tch! Haa...

287
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,540
Pass!
(Female Student) Nice, nice, nice.

288
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,930
Just 2 more points...

289
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,710
Hmph! You're persistent!
You should just give up!

290
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,730
I won't give up!

291
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,090
(Female Student) Ah!

292
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:53,090
...

293
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,860
Bee! (End buzzer)
(Teacher) Game over!

294
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,220
The winner is 1-B!

295
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,570
(Female Student) Amazing! We did it!

296
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,600
(Female Student) We won!
(Female Student) Yeah!

297
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,620
We did it!

298
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,320
(Teacher) This year's female MVP is...

299
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,030
1-B, Amamiya Matsuri.

300
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,390
Amamiya-san, please come up to the stage.

301
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,770
Amamiya-san? Amamiya Matsuri-san?

302
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,800
Amamiya-sa~n?

303
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,800
(Haruka) Sensei, excuse me for a moment.

304
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,890
Well~, the prize for MVP has been changed at her request.

305
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,600
(Students) Eh...
The prize has been declined.

306
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,290
Instead, for everyone...

307
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,980
A special live performance from us, Terzetto!

308
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,020
(Cheers)

309
00:20:53,020 --> 00:21:00,090
Princess - Koi wa Utakata
Because I don't want to let go

310
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,810
Gyuutto Hug Hug Hug Hug, let me say Lovin' you

311
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,510
Let me be your one and only prince

312
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:16,580
(Cheers)

313
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,610
A breeze blows through ordinary days

314
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,980
Your colorful smile shines

315
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,030
I thought I liked you, but

316
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,030
(Yamato) You thought this through.

317
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,080
(Yamato)
With this, you can protect your brother

318
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,440
And not cause a scandal?

319
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,460
Yamato...
(Yamato) You won, so

320
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,830
You should have proudly monopolized it.

321
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,520
Once again, everyone

322
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,230
Understood that they like Terzetto.

323
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,260
Before, Azusa-kun said

324
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:56,310
That the audience's smiles are the best view.

325
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:01,370
I don't want to get in the way of those smiles.

326
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,370
Hmph...

327
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,080
After all,
Terzetto is number one.

328
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:20,560
Huh? Did you forget? My love confession.

329
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Eh? But that was a joke, right?

330
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,340
Well, if you say something so cool about idols,

331
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,340
It's embarrassing to say, "I was serious about my confession."

332
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,110
Ah... Yamato, I...

333
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,110
Wait.

334
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,850
I don't need a rejection confirmation.

335
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,850
Besides, I haven't given up yet.

336
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,610
From now on, I'll try to be
a little more honest.

337
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:08,360
・～ ("My Only Princess")

338
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,740
I can't beat the prince
as a villain.

339
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:20,820
・～ ("My Only Princess")

340
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,840
Good work~. (Haruka) Thank you~.

341
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,860
Thank you so much. (Haruka) Yay~!

342
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,880
That was the best! (Rihito) Thank you.

343
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,910
Azusa-kun.

344
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,910
Thank you so much.

345
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,980
Sorry.
I'll go back to being siblings for a while.

346
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Huh?

347
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,400
I'm going to be doing
an idol award show.

348
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,320
Yo.
Why did I get→

349
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,580
rejected...
I'm the most→

350
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,070
important girl in the world, you know.
