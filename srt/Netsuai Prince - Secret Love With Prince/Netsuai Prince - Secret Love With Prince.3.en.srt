1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,380
（Amamiya Matsuri）Hey, don't you think
we should go home after all?

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,400
We'll get found out...
(Amamiya Azusa) I don't want to.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,400
It's our first date
with Matsuri after all.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,130
Besides, it's okay. Actually, this place →

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,820
I've been here for work before.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,840
He's saying to ask if anything happens.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:39,350
・～

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,350
Come on, Matsuri.

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:59,880
・～

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,900
That's great.
Amazing~.

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,930
So cute.
Cute.

12
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,930
Are there a lot of different kinds?

13
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,020
I saw the show here for the first time
when I was a kid.

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,710
Haruka and Masato were with me too.

15
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,080
Is that so? Yeah.

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,080
And I really admired it.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,140
Gathering the attention of
everyone in the audience →

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,520
The actors who entertained them were really cool.

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,210
Someday, I want to be on the side
that captivates someone like that →

20
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,210
That's what I thought...

21
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,630
That's...

22
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,320
That's probably →

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,320
The reason I wanted to become an idol.

24
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,060
Really~.

25
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,760
(Manager) Um... excuse me.
Yes.

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,450
(Manager)
It's very rude to consult you about this, but...

27
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,140
I know it's very rude to consult you about this...→

28
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,830
Actually,
the actor playing the prince, who is the main attraction of today's show, is feeling unwell. →

29
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,860
Actually, the actor playing the prince, who is the main attraction of today's show, is feeling unwell. →

30
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,550
And we can't seem to find a replacement... 

31
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,250
Ah, yes...

32
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,950
Huh...?

33
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,640
Ah... never mind, sorry.

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,000
It would be rude to Terzetto's Azusa-san. →

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,020
It's okay.

36
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,400
I'll do it, the prince.
If I'm okay with you.

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
(Manager) Really?

38
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,790
Want to see it? My prince role.

39
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:56,050
・～

40
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:16,580
・～

41
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,580
・～

42
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,990
Tap, tap... (Footsteps)

43
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,060
Cool!

44
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,460
Watch properly. If I'm going to do it, →

45
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,170
I'll show you the coolest prince in the world.

46
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,540
Okay.
I'm really sorry.

47
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,560
For taking up your precious time with your sister.

48
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,930
Um... well, in exchange for doing it, →

49
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,930
Can I make just one request?

50
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,000
・～

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,020
(Applause and cheers)

52
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,740
・～

53
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,740
No, no, no....

54
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,150
Let's go, Matsuri.

55
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,190
・～

56
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,230
Azusa-kun is fine, but I... I'm...

57
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:27,620
・～

58
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,340
(Applause and cheers)

59
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,360
Amazing!

60
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,420
・～

61
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,440
Look at that face.

62
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,470
Wow, Cinderella!

63
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,470
A prince and a princess!

64
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,870
Is this the world →

65
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,570
that Azusa-kun and the others always see?

66
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,930
・～

67
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,960
Yeah, I →

68
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,660
don't know any better view than this.

69
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:16,660
・～

70
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
I love you....

71
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,920
I, about Azusa-kun →

72
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,280
Not as a brother, but →

73
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,300
I'm in love with him....

74
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:45,400
・～

75
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:56,180
・～

76
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,560
Sorry.
I wanted to hear your confession to the end, but →

77
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,580
I couldn't wait.

78
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,970
・～

79
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,330
I… I like you.

80
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:21,430
・～

81
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:32,430
・～

82
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,940
・Chirp chirp… (bird sounds)

83
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,980
Flap! 
Haa! This is bad…

84
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,670
I just… said it.

85
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,670
I said something crazy…

86
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
And… huh!

87
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,470
Oh… no…!

88
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,470
Haa…! Eh?

89
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,580
Good morning.

90
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,600
Ah… good morning.

91
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,620
I'm going to school ahead of you.

92
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,660
・～

93
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,660
・Click, slam (door sound)

94
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Tap, tap, tap... (Footsteps)

95
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:24,320
...

96
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:35,100
...

97
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,800
Finally, he's getting closer.
Eh?

98
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,480
Azusa-kun, are you pretending to be asleep?

99
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,850
And that memo...

100
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,850
Why are you trying to run away?

101
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,240
But... at least the reason...

102
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,270
I can't do it normally.

103
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,290
Eh?

104
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,320
We're not idol and fan →

105
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,360
Nor brother and sister...

106
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,360
I don't know how to interact with you...

107
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,100
Matsuri became a fan of Terzetto →

108
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,780
For how long?

109
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,480
Eh?

110
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,530
Since our debut, so about three years, I guess.

111
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,530
It's been one month since we became siblings.

112
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,600
Yeah.

113
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,290
But lovers, it's day one.

114
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,680
So, like when we first became siblings a month ago →

115
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,680
Let's start again from a distance where we can hold hands.

116
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,110
...

117
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,150
There's no need to rush, Matsuri.

118
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,180
Nice to meet you again.

119
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,560
...

120
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
See?

121
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:10,390
...

122
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,750
It's okay to start from this kind of distance.

123
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:25,530
...

124
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,530
(Rihito) Matsuri-chan!

125
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,600
(Rihito) See ya!

126
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:42,600
...

127
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,750
Oh, I'm sorry.

128
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,750
Huh? That...

129
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,820
(Yamato) If you don't want to be
on the front page of a weekly magazine →

130
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,190
Won't you play with Yamato-oniisan,
little sister?

131
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,190
Little sister. Hehe.

132
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,590
Huh? That... →

133
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,630
You're Misuzu Yamato, the dancer
and idol, right?

134
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,650
How did you get that picture...?

135
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,350
I'm glad you know me. Nice to meet you, transfer student.

136
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,710
Please delete that picture.

137
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,710
Hehe, you're desperate.

138
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,800
Hee~ So, Terzetto's cool second son, Azusa, is →

139
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,170
With his little sister. Oh my, oh my...

140
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,890
That's not it! Azusa-kun is my brother.

141
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,920
Nothing more,
nothing less.

142
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Um... How do I get you to erase it?

143
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
Huh? Subaru, bro?

144
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,680
We're going to debut.

145
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,730
So what?

146
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,730
Subaru-kun...

147
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,480
You're in love with him, aren't you?

148
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,510
Huh? (Yamato) I'm interested. →

149
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,220
A girl who can captivate our absolute ace... →

150
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,220
I wonder what she's like.

151
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,290
Hey...

152
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,660
Ah, wait... Let's play boyfriend and girlfriend.

153
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
Huh? Let's go.

154
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,260
(Yamato) Is it fun? Is it fun...

155
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,280
I'm having fun. Do you need to go to the bathroom?

156
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,980
Ah, yes. Yamato-senpai.

157
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,340
Why that transfer student...? (Yamato) This girl? →

158
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,700
She's my girlfriend. (Both) Eh!? 

159
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,740
(Yamato) And Terzetto's little sister. (Both) Eh!

160
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,440
Hey, Yamato-kun! (Yamato) Ah, I messed up.

161
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,460
I said it, sorry. (Female student) The rumors were true.

162
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,810
(Female student) Eh? But aren't the genes too different?

163
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,830
(Female student) I heard they're step-siblings.

164
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,830
Honey. Hey, honey.

165
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:59,610
(Inner voice) ≪I was just about to make friends...≫

166
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,610
Haa... 
*Gacha*

167
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,350
So, you were here, honey.

168
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,370
The worst.

169
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,370
*Clip clop...*

170
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,770
Eh!?

171
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,790
Aren't we supposed to be lovers?

172
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,170
I don't think there's any merit
in playing lovers with me.

173
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,210
I guess so. →

174
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,240
Maybe it's not as fun as I thought. →

175
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,620
This is just killing time.
Seriously!

176
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,650
Hey, then just stop it already.
Delete the pictures too.

177
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,670
Because Subaru-kun would fall
for a girl like that. →

178
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,670
I was hoping you'd entertain me somehow.

179
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,440
Of course.

180
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,470
Entertaining a complete stranger
is not something you can do easily. →

181
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,840
It's not that easy.

182
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,870
But because you can do that →

183
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,230
You idols are amazing →

184
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,270
And special.

185
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,270
Only idols can do
something like that.

You know... →

After having my secret exposed
and being completely made fun of →

188
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,420
You can still praise me so well?

189
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,470
Huh?

190
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,520
(Yamato) Haa... Ahh~ But, careless. 

191
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,310
I got a little shy just now. →

192
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,710
I see, idols are special... →

193
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,710
Hmm... 

194
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,770
I don't care anymore.

Thank you.

197
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,240
I don't really understand, but...

198
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,620
Since we're on a roll with good things,
why don't we seize a chance?

199
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,640
Chance?

200
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,020
Hey, about our debut song's →

201
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,380
Won't you appear in the PV?

202
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,400
Eh... What are you talking about?

203
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:32,130
The director was looking for
a plain girl like you.

204
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,160
Shall I recommend you?

205
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,160
Eh?

206
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,210
Don't you want to get back at
everyone at school?

207
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,320
Even so,
why would that be... your...

208
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,030
It would be strange
if someone like me appeared.

209
00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:01,090
I'm sorry for exposing it,
but you know, right?

210
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,090
Know what?

211
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,820
The reason you're being gossiped about →

212
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,860
Is because you're surrounded by
lots of princes, but →

213
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,860
You're not a princess.

214
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,950
Give it a try, isn't it a chance?

215
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,100
・Click Bang

216
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,130
Being the co-star in PRISM's PV…

217
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,160
Yeah…
I'm okay.

218
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,190
I'll refuse Subaru-san on your behalf.

219
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:49,570
Actually, this isn't a request from Subaru-nii.

220
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:54,960
Huh?
Besides, I think I'll do it.

221
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,330
Why? There's no need to do it.

222
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,700
Is it because I'll just embarrass myself if I do it?

223
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,060
That's not it.

224
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,060
I feel like I can't stay the way I am now.

225
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,490
If I stay the way I am,
I'll only be Terzetto's sister, and I →

226
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,490
Realized I can't be proud of that.

Haaah….

228
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,300
Why do I think it has to be →

PRISM's PV of all things.

230
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:38,670
Besides, I've never thought of you as ordinary, Matsuri.

231
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:48,830
So, although it's against my will,
if that's what you think, Matsuri, →

232
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,830
Go all out.

233
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,910
Hehe.
Thank you.

234
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,940
(Haruka) Hey, what are you doing, sneaking off?

235
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,970
(Rihito) I heard about it. It's a big deal for my sister.

236
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,320

Ugh~ I'm so worried about my sister.

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,760
Hehe, why? I'll be fine.

It's not like I'm going to be eaten alive... No way!→

241
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,820
Those PRISM guys, who knows what they'll do.

242
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,860
Ugh~ I want to lock her up in her room and keep her there.

243
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,890
But, Matsuri, do your best.

244
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,890
Don't forget, you're already our precious sister.

There they are.
(Yamato) Seriously→

They're our opponents, you know?

253
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,270
Even though she's an amateur, she accepted the role.

254
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,960
Ehh...

255
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,660
Seriously, she's so easy.

Well, don't worry.

Ah, Subaru-nii. We'll take the lead, so→

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,890
Matsuri just needs to be there.

Thank you. But I'll do my best. Hehe.

264
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,980
Huh?

265
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,980
Did you remember that I'm the one you love most in the world?
