1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,250
(Amamiya Matsuri) Thanks for your hard work! (Haruka) Thank you.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,270
Thank you so much. (Haruka) Yay!

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,290
That was the best. (Rihito) Thank you.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,310
Azusa-kun.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,310
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,710
(Amamiya Azusa) Sorry.
Let me go back to being siblings for a while.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,430
Huh?

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,850
Bang!

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,630
・～

10
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,630
(Flashback) I won't give you Matsuri.
Matsuri is mine.

11
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,060
(Yamato) You seem stressed, Azusa-kun.

12
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,090
You don't seem like an idol.

13
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,450
That's why you're losing to PRISM, right?→

14
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,170
And soon, even my sister...→

15
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,190
Might get taken away.

16
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,550
(Matsunaga) It might be a matter of resolve.→

17
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,580
The members of PRISM are
staking their entire lives and careers→

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,620
on this. You guys are different.→

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,620
You've been completely replaced.

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,660
Terzetto is over.

21
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,070
Bang! (Sound of hitting the desk) It's not over! Terzetto will...

22
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,090
Don't say that.

23
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,780
Knock, knock, knock.

24
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,800
(Kisaragi) Good morning. (Rihito, Haruka) Good morning.

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,170
(Matsunaga) Kisaragi-san, about that matter we discussed...

26
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,200
(Kisaragi) Okay, I'll start. Listen up.

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,230
Our agency is hosting an idol award show that transcends agency boundaries.

28
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,260
It's called the "Luminous Prize Award."

29
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,630
"Luminous Prize Award"

30
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,650
(Haruka) Yes. The group that wins the Grand Prix will be the undisputed number one in Japan.

31
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:00,040
The group that wins the Grand Prix will be the undisputed number one in Japan.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,070
As an agency, of course, we want it to be us.

33
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,750
Terzetto will take it.

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,800
(Haruka) We will take back the top...

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,160
PRISM is a formidable opponent.

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,540
If you get angry so easily and show your weaknesses, it might be difficult.

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,540
Terzetto's cool guy, Azusa-kun.

38
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,950
(Saionji Subaru) Matsuri! (Haruka) Damn it... It won't open!

39
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:44,140
・～

40
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,140
I would give it to you even if you didn't buy it.

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,870
How precious the moment of buying a new song is to a fan.

42
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,230
How precious the moment of buying a new song is to a fan. Hehe.

43
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,230
It's a good song, isn't it? I quite like it too.

44
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll do my best too, and I'll definitely get MVP.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,030
Why so much?

46
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,030
Well... I want to monopolize Azusa-kun,

47
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,150
And I definitely don't want to lose in a battle over the number one idol, Terzetto.

48
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,510
And I definitely don't want to lose in a battle over the number one idol, Terzetto.

49
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:31,940
・～

50
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,640
(Inner voice) <<I'm not slacking off at all>>

51
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,020
<<But am I, as an idol,
really giving it my all right now?>>

52
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,040
Am I doing it with the will to die?>>

53
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,040
・～

54
00:03:48,450 --> 00:04:08,310
・～

55
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:28,510
・～

56
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,510
・～

57
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,570
・Thud (sound of door)
・Chirp chirp… (sound of birds chirping)

58
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,980
Good morning.
Good morning.

59
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,350
Where are those guys?
If you mean Haruka and the others, they're still sleeping.

60
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,040
Go wake them up right now.→

61
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,080
And you, the youngest, pack your things
and get in the car.→

62
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,110
You're on support duty.
Eh?

63
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,820
We're having a training camp until the awards show.

64
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:11,610
・～

65
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,650
Whoa… This is it, the training camp.

66
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,690
・～

67
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,390
(Rihito) We were confined here before our debut.

68
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,420
Huh….

69
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,440
(Haruka) Long time no see!.

70
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,140
・～

71
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,140
・(Haruka) Heave-ho… Hnn.

72
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,530
(Haruka) Eh….

73
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,920
Yo.
(Kei) You're late.

74
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,300
(Maki) Let's do our best. Yo!.

75
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,660
(Haruka) Eh, it's a joint camp?
Eh, it's a joint camp!

76
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,010
Smack!
(Haruka) Ouch! You should have told me→

77
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,390
sooner. Eh~! Joint….

78
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,420
Whack!
(Matsunaga) Listen up! Do it like you mean it!

79
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,450
(PRISM・Terzetto) Yes!
(Kisaragi) If you're an idol→

80
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,800
and you really
want to make your fans happy→

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,830
crawl through hell!
(PRISM・Terzetto) Yes!

82
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,830
There are tons of replacements for you guys.

83
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,870
(PRISM・Terzetto) Yes….

84
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,940
Terzetto.
(3 people) Yes!

85
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,290
(Matsunaga) Learn desperately from PRISM.

86
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,640
(3 people) Yes!
PRISM.

87
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,010
(Kei, Yamato, Subaru, Maki) Yes!
Just because Terzetto are our seniors →

88
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,370
Don't hold back. (4 people) Yes!

89
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,410
Becoming Japan's number one idol →

90
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,410
It's going to be one of you.

91
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:54,300
・～

92
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:14,830
・～

93
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:21,910
・～

94
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,610
(Coach) No, no, no! Totally no good. Weak. →

95
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,630
Azusa, stronger!
Yes!

96
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,650
(Coach) You think your feelings will get through like that?

97
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,670
(Haruka) No... One more time, please.

98
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,030
(3 people) Please!

99
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,050
(Coach) One more time.
From the chorus.

100
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,740
(Haruka) Okay. →

101
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,770
・　Let's go see

102
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,140
(Haruka) ・　My only Princess, love is sweet & sweet

103
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,500
(Haruka) Haa...
Good work.

104
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,180
(Haruka) Thank you.

105
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,180
Good work.
(Rihito) Thank you.

106
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,220
Azusa-kun...

107
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,380
・slam

108
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,450
(Yamato) Ah~ I'm so hungry.
(Maki) Sis, what's for dinner?

109
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,800
Ah, it's curry. (Maki) Oh~.

110
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,170
(Yamato)
Ugh~ I can't eat carrots.

111
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,870
Don't be picky.
(Yamato) Ugh...

112
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,230
What about Terzetto?
I heard they're working non-stop.

113
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,230
They'll collapse eventually.

114
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,010
Should I make some sandwiches
and deliver them?

115
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,700
Ah... yeah.

116
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Yeah.

117
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:55,180
・～

118
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,180
<<Seeing Terzetto like this
makes me want to cry with emotion>>

119
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,920
<<But at the same time,
it's just... painful...>>

120
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,360
<<Why did I
get dumped...?>>

121
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,730
(Coach) Okay, stop, stop!
Stop. →

122
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,110
Something's missing...
I wonder what it is.

123
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,470
(Haruka) What could it be...? (Coach) Ah, maybe →

124
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,500
Should we add some staging midway through? →

125
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,530
Um... like, involving
one of the audience members.

126
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,900
Snap! (Sound of snapping fingers)
(Coach) Good idea! And then, on the spot →

127
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,930
We'll woo them. Um... after Azusa's melody.

128
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,950
Okay. Can you do it?

129
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,970
Yes.
Let's try it.

130
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,670
(Haruka, Azusa, Rihito) Yes! Little sis.

131
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,670
Help me out for a bit.
Eh?

132
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Play the role of an audience member
and let Azusa flirt with you.

133
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Ah, just a little...
No way.

134
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,910
Don't look away.

135
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,910
Keep your eyes on me.

136
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,320
(Matsunaga) Sounds good. (Coach) Yeah, good.

137
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,340
Clap! (Sound of clapping hands)
(Coach) Alright! Let's go with this.

138
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,030
(Haruka, Rihito) Yes.
Matsuri →

139
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,390
Don't need to be so self-conscious about it.

140
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,410
We're siblings.

141
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:35,410
・～

142
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,070
Chirp chirp...

143
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,770
Whew, a change of pace!

144
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,460
Gaa... (Sound of skateboard) Ah.

145
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
(Yamato) Hoo!

146
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,860
(Man) You're amazing, even though you're famous. (Yamato) Thanks. →

147
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,230
Thanks for letting me borrow your board. (Man) Yeah. Let's do it again. 

148
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,600
Hey, wanna come over for breakfast? At my place.

149
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
(Yamato) Ahh, but...

150
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,340
Hey. You're totally obvious.

151
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,370
Eh? Eh... Just a sec...

152
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,400
My girlfriend came to pick me up, so see ya. →

153
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,750
Let's go.
Hey, wait a minute...

154
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,450
That girl is trouble!
(Yamato) Eh? Why?

155
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,810
Hey, seriously... Haa...

156
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,520
Ugh...
What are you even thinking, Yamato!

157
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,540
If some weird rumors start...

158
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,560
I don't care if rumors start.

159
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,250
Yes, you should!

160
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,270
More importantly, your little sister... →

161
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,980
Couldn't you be a little nicer to her?

162
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,670
Huh? Even after this? →

163
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,670
I'm...
I just got dumped...

164
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,780
Ah...

165
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,480
Sorry. Uh... um...

166
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,480
So easy. Hehehe.

167
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,880
Whatever! See ya.

168
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,910
Ah, wait.
I promise I won't be mean anymore.

169
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,940
Believe that? You always →

170
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,970
Easily lie and deceive, and →

171
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,660
Grip my weaknesses and threaten me.

172
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,380
Wow... I'm the worst.

173
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,420
But that's why...
Eh? Whoa, hey...

174
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,110
You're the first.

175
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,470
The first girl I've ever wanted →

176
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,180
To be nice to, even though I'm the worst.

177
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,870
Yamato, you're too close...

178
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,870
Of course.

179
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
I'm hitting on you right now.

180
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,690
I said, you're too close!

181
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,730
Haa... Tch... No good, huh.

182
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,780
Sorry, but
I like Azusa.

183
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,130
Tap, tap, tap, tap... (Footsteps)
Ah...

184
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,830
Haa...
Eh?

185
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,530
Haa...
Ah...

186
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,530
Azusa! It's not what it looks like...

187
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,730
Shhh...

188
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,810
(Haruka) Were you jogging? Ah.

189
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,840
(Haruka) I also overdid my muscle training, my arms are bursting.

190
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
(Rihito) We have no choice but to do our best today too.

191
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,250
(Haruka) How long are you going to sulk?

192
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,620
About what? Focus on being an idol for now.

193
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,980
Matsuri is fine. No, that's not it.

194
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,680
Azusa doesn't seem to have it. Confidence that Matsuri-chan→

195
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,370
likes him.→

196
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,730
Well, I don't have confidence, but rather certainty, you know?~

197
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,100
Idol, brother, man. In everything, Matsuri-chan→

198
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,790
likes me the most… Huh? That's→

199
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,150
supposed to be me. I'm going ahead.

200
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,150
(Haruka) Azusa!

201
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,200
It's okay, really. Don't rush.

202
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,920
As expected of Terzetto. As expected of the number one idol.

203
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,020
I'm rushing. Matsuri believes that we are→

204
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,050
the number one idols.

205
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,050
I want to live up to that.

206
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,480
We understand that too. Right?

207
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,520
Not just now, but from now on too, I want her to think→

208
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,220
that it's okay for her to always be by my side.

209
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,250
That's why I can't afford to lose my composure and→

210
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,310
be overwhelmed, you know? Me.

211
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,660
(Haruka) I know.

212
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,710
Me, Rihito,→

213
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,740
and Matsuri too.

214
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,760
Let's do our best.

215
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:58,760
・～

216
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,390
It's snowing.

217
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:17,800
...

218
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,160
What are you doing? Matsuri.

219
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,870
Ah... I was wondering if I could make a snowman.

220
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,560
Well, I guess it's not enough for that.

221
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,920
Hehe. If there was a snowman...

222
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,950
Everyone might feel a little better.

223
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,950
Then, if it snows a lot, how about we all have a snowball fight?

224
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,700
Nope.
I don't want to.

225
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,080
It's boring to have a snowball fight with Subaru-nii.

226
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,450
Don't say it's boring.
Because...

227
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,480
Subaru-nii never hits me with the snowballs.

228
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,840
He always lets me win on purpose.

229
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,520
I can't help it, you idiot.

230
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,550
I just couldn't bring myself to hit you.

231
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,580
With such cold snowballs.

232
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,940
Why not~?

233
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,940
Because I cherish you like a treasure.

234
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,080
I don't like my old self...

235
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,120
I was a crybaby and unreliable.

236
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,820
But I'm sure back then, I cherished you more.

237
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,170
I took care of you properly.

238
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:33,220
...

239
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,260
Matsuri, you'll catch a cold.

240
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:45,350
...

241
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:51,730
I'll cherish you even more from now on.

242
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,730
Subaru-nii... What's wrong?

243
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
No... nothing.

244
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,520
Is it Azusa?

245
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,230
...

246
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,930
Matsuri, don't forget.

247
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,970
You're the most important girl in the world.

248
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:22,710
...

249
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,710
Don't get too cold.

250
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,780
Thank you.

251
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:35,780
・～

252
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,860
Huh?

253
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,570
Eh? Whoa...

254
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,710
Ah~ I'm tired and hungry.

255
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,750
Matsuri-chan, it's over~. →

256
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,750
Huh? Matsuri-chan? →

257
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,500
She's not here. (Haruka) Hmm~ Shopping, maybe? →

258
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,860
Well then, I'll take a bath first.

259
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,860
(Rihito) Yeah.

260
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,270
Huh?

261
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,260
Flap flap flap... (Sound of bird flapping wings)

262
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,260
Whoosh... (Sound of wind)

263
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,010
Senses... Haa...

264
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,070
What are you doing!?

265
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,470
Azusa-kun. I'm going home now.

266
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,470
I can't go home! Huh?

267
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,880
If it snows again, I won't be able to find it anymore.

268
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,920
Find what? The bangle.

269
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,950
Because it was the first thing Azusa-kun ever gave me...

270
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,310
I don't need that anymore... Because that →

271
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:13,310
It's a charm to become someone worthy of Azusa-kun.

272
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,370
I know you didn't give it to me with that intention.

273
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,460
But you know, Azusa-kun is cool and →

274
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:30,520
When you go on stage, you become a special person, right?

275
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,210
So, at least, I →

276
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,900
I swore I wouldn't lose in just my feelings of love →

277
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,900
That's what I swore.

278
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,940
Eh!

279
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,000
It's nothing special.

280
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,370
Well, I'm an idol, but...

281
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,410
I'm just a normal high school boy.

282
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,450
...

283
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,160
Matsuri, I'm sorry for saying terrible things.

284
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:11,930
...

285
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,650
So cold... Matsuri, are you okay?

286
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,670
Huh? Ah...

287
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:23,710
Matsuri! Matsuri? Are you okay?

288
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,710
Hey, Matsuri.

289
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,610
You'll warm up soon. Okay?

290
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,670
...

291
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,690
I... I'm sorry...

292
00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:00,750
...

293
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,750
I'm okay... Huff... Huff...

294
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
I'm sorry...

295
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,900
More trouble again...

296
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,950
...

297
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,330
Matsuri, I promise you.

298
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,330
I will absolutely not assault you.

299
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,390
Eh?

300
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,100
...

301
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,120
Eh, wait a...

302
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,180
...

303
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,540
Eh...

304
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,560
I'll try not to look as much as possible.

305
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:55,640
...

306
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,660
Eh... Ah...

307
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,360
Hey... Azusa-kun...

308
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,770
...

309
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,120
I'll warm you up.

310
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:19,210
...

311
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:27,290
...

312
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:40,420
...

313
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,440
I'll take your bottoms off too.

314
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:49,940
...

315
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,040
Subaru-san,
Is the content of the article true?

316
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,230
He's not that kind of person.
Right now, I need to...

317
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,250
Become mine.
Don't worry.

318
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,270
Everyone is desperately
keeping a smile on their face!

319
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,300
I love you.
It's always been Matsuri that I've loved...

320
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Isn't it Subaru-san?
