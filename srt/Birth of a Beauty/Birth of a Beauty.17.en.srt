00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,450
Episode 17

2
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,540
Will Tae Hee Hyung be okay?

3
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,640
He may feel hurt after unnecessarily going to the airport.

4
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,120
We should stay close by him and take care of him.

5
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,760
Oh, I think he's here. Wait.

6
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,350
Oh, Hyung.

7
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,720
I was waiting to fix dinner.
I'll get it ready, Oppa.

8
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,110
No, no. Let's not do that and go out.

9
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,170
Why don't the three of us have a delicious meal
and a light drink, Hyung?

10
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,390
I want to be alone. You guys leave.

11
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,070
Oh! What in the world. What in the world!

12
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,180
Sara was Geum Ran?

13
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,800
I knew it. Every time I saw pretty women, I didn't like
them. But that wasn't the case with Sara.

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,030
It was because she was Geum Ran. She was Geum Ran.

15
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,000
This Geum Ran betrayed me.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,810
How could she fool me like that?!

17
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,270
But isn't it great that she is alive, Mother?!

18
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,970
Kyeong Joo, I can't get in touch
with Geum Ran right now.

19
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,740
She must be traumatized since
her marriage plans were broken.

20
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,520
I heard Han Tae Hee is the Winner Group heir.

21
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,130
Do you think marrying him would be easy?

22
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,280
Han Tae Hee is that great of a person?

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,470
Whether he's the Winner Group's heir or not, there was
a huge fuss in the media and on the Internet.

24
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,950
That's when I found out, too.

25
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,010
Yes, Mother.

26
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,240
Your daughter left for overseas today.

27
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,880
Alone?

28
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,450
I think it was because I'm lacking in many ways.

29
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,780
I am sorry.

30
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,830
It's not that I want to hear an apology.

31
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,810
Why did Geum Ran suddenly make that kind of decision?

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Geum Ran, don't crumble, no matter what.

33
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,920
Never.

34
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,400
If you are having hard time, I am also here.

35
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,450
Who is it?

36
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,480
Mom. I'm Geum Ran.

37
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,120
Geum Ran.

38
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,240
Oh, my daughter.

39
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,830
You're alive.

40
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,320
Thank you.

41
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,110
Hey! Sa Geum Ran.

42
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,110
Kyeong Joo.

43
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,040
How are you?

44
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,010
While I was pretending to go abroad,
I was just going to go back to our hometown,

45
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,160
so that I can hide in a place that nobody knows.

46
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,960
As I was about to, I heard your voice message.

47
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,860
You don't have to explain anything.

48
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,560
I won't ask you anything.

49
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,470
That's right. Get some rest, Geum Ran.
You've suffered so much, all this time.

50
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,490
I like the fact that I am your friend.

51
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,080
If we go around together, I think I'll walk around
with strength in my shoulders (proudly).

52
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:33,410
Mom. I am thinking about going back
to our hometown tomorrow.

53
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,360
I'll go with you.

54
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,800
Let's stay together, Geum Ran.

55
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,500
If I wake up from my sleep, Ajumma will be here.

56
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,380
This must be a dream. Right, Ajumma?

57
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,650
It was just yesterday that you announced your divorce. So, do
you think it's okay to have such a cheerful expression?

58
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,740
It's been a long time since I decided to divorce.
I wandered in darkness.

59
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,630
So, shall I say that I finally feel like I can see the light, now?

60
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,790
Staying here is only temporary, so don't worry.

61
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,650
You don't even have anywhere else to go.

62
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,660
I'm going to sell the building and look for a house.

63
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,640
Have you guys talked about it?

64
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,560
If you don't have Brother-in-law's consent,
you can't do what you want to with it.

65
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,710
I made an offer that Kang Joon can't refuse.

66
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,760
That ugly Chae Yeon hired someone and
pulled out all of her belongings.

67
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,060
Hey, make sure to take good care of the building.

68
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,130
Chae Yeon won't be up to any tricks, will she?

69
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,630
Even if she tries, the building is mine.

70
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,010
Who is it? Chae Yeon?

71
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,140
Is there still something left to talk about?

72
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,390
Let's talk face to face.

73
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,710
I'll go to your office.

74
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,640
Come in.

75
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,550
How is Sara? Did she arrive well?

76
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,570
I spoke to the employee who was
supposed to pick up Sara at the airport,

77
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,110
but he says that Sara wasn't on the plane.

78
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,500
Why? What happened?

79
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,610
I don't know for sure, either. Her
cell phone remains turned off.

80
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,550
Has the bus come?

81
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,130
I'll go look outside and be back. Stay here.

82
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,170
Missed Calls (16), Messages (4),
from Doctor

83
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,450
Ajumma, I'm at the airport. Even if you're going to leave
when it's time, see my face before you go.

84
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,630
Please turn on your phone.

85
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,980
Ajumma, at least listen to my voice before you go.

86
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,690
I'm still at the airport. Call me if you haven't left yet.

87
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,110
Ajumma, please. Please call me.

88
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,470
Han Min Hyeok

89
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,640
Yes, General Manager.

90
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,650
Sara, you've finally turned on your phone.

91
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,570
One of my employees, who is at Logan Airport
in Boston, says that you didn't get on the airplane.

92
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,210
I worried about you.

93
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,750
Truthfully, I had no intention of getting on
the plane from the start.

94
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,550
Please make it as if I'm overseas to everyone else.

95
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,220
I thought I had to do that, in order for no one to look for me.

96
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,000
I understand.

97
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,090
Call me as soon as you decide where you'll live.

98
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,630
The bus came. Let's go.

99
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:59,470
♫  What's wrong with my age, is there an age for love,  ♫

100
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,240
Doctor, it's the clam soup that you like,

101
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,470
and doenjang Jigae (beanpaste soup) for a broken heart.

102
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,330
And, I even put in my special sauce that you like.

103
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,740
The first stage of accepting separation.

104
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,600
Denial of reality.

105
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,660
I can't acknowledge that she left me.

106
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,840
How long has it been, Yeo Ok?
It's been about ten years, right?

107
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,540
I've been wondering why you don't visit.

108
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,330
I'm so glad to see you, so glad!

109
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,100
Can I ask you a favor?

110
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,340
I'm looking for a place to stay because
we came here suddenly.

111
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,540
Of course. Hey, there's plenty of space
in this restaurant.

112
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,730
Just think of this as your house, and
stay comfortably.

113
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,330
But, who is this young lady?

114
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,400
She's my daughter's friend.

115
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,200
Ajummoni,

116
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,860
"Kitchen Ajumma urgently wanted."
Can I do this?

117
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,970
Aigoo, a young lady who's this pretty

118
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,290
wants to be a kitchen worker. Aigoo.

119
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,750
I am really good at cleaning and cooking!

120
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,930
Please use me once, Ajummoni.

121
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,400
Oh Mom, there's water there.
You're going to slip!

122
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,460
- Aiyoo, it's okay
- Aigoo, give it to me!

123
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,380
Mom, you just rest like a princess.

124
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,770
Princess?

125
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,320
No, no, Mom. I'll do it.

126
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,140
Rest, Mom.

127
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,400
Broadcast Board of Directors Meeting . . . Notice to Appear?

128
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,360
CEO, they say that the Board of Directors'
disciplinary meeting will be tomorrow.

129
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,250
I think you're going to have to transfer
the Canvas building to me.

130
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,030
It's compensation for my ruined life,

131
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,770
which was destroyed by you and Sa Geum Ran.

132
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,550
You were the one who seduced me, a married man.

133
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,890
Who was the person who complained
about his loveless marriage?

134
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,870
I don't want to talk for too long.

135
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,310
Give me the building quietly

136
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,530
or this will be revealed.

137
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,970
It's the black box's memory card.

138
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,810
That night...

139
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,550
The scene where you murdered
Sa Geum Ran is recorded here.

140
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,870
Tomorrow is the Board of Director's Disciplinary meeting, right?

141
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,910
What would happen if I revealed this to the public?

142
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,680
It starts at ten o'clock, right?

143
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,260
Send me the building transfer papers by 9 am,

144
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,400
or I will participate in the board meeting.

145
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,100
Miss Sara?

146
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,480
Oh, yes. I'll come to the office now.

147
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,040
What is the name of the cooking school that Miss
Sara has gone to overseas? Where is she staying?

148
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,200
I, too, don't know up to that point.

149
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,820
Does it make sense for the PD in charge to not know the
whereabouts of the poster girl participant of the program?

150
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,260
It's something that happened at the headquarters of Winner Group,

151
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,340
so I'm not in a position to ask in detail. I'm sorry.

152
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,760
The headquarters of Winner Group?

153
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,750
Did you tell General Manager Han Min Hyeok about
the agenda of the Broadcast Board of Directors Meeting?

154
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,510
I wasn't able to tell him. He went down to a province.

155
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,410
Province? Why didn't Secretary Jung go with him?

156
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,750
He said he'll be going there by himself.

157
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,250
Miss Sara.

158
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,090
I'll find a suitable place for you to stay.

159
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,310
It's comfortable here.

160
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,740
I know the owner, and

161
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,110
there are not a lot of people
who recognize my face.

162
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,330
Even if they recognize you,
they'll doubt it.

163
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,730
Why would a person who appeared yesterday,
on TV, suddenly work at a restaurant?

164
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,860
Now, I think I know you a little more, Miss Sara.

165
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,040
I want to work with you, Miss Sara, but

166
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,760
you are not moved by money or fame.

167
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,560
Still, I need you, Miss Sara.

168
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,040
So let's look for another way.

169
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,470
Are you sleeping, Geum Ran?

170
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,810
It must be hard.

171
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,630
Alright.

172
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,620
If your body is tired, time will go by more quickly,

173
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,000
and you will eventually forget.

174
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:50,410
♫  I was the only one who didn't know, I thought that it will be forever  ♫

175
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:57,730
♫  I was the only one who didn't know, I thought that I will be happy  ♫

176
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:04,550
♫  I love you, the words that I can't say to you now.  ♫

177
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,800
What kind of card is this?

178
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,240
Oh!

179
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,780
Ajumma, you can't open it yet.

180
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,160
My wishes are written down on it.

181
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,000
If I write down my wishes, hang them on the tree,
and turn on the lights,

182
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,200
it is said that all my wishes will be fulfilled.

183
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,290
If I do this, then all my wishes will be granted.

184
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:26,530
♫  It is a very hard thing  ♫

185
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,840
♫  Living well without you  ♫

186
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,600
♫ Reluctantly I just survive.  ♫

187
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,750
Ajumma, you have to be happy.
♫ I live in regret. ♫

188
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,310
♫  Even if I know it's not so,  ♫

189
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,720
♫ Perhaps you will come back.  ♫

190
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:55,140
♫  I was the only one who didn't know,
I thought that it would be forever,  ♫

191
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:02,540
♫  I was the only one who didn't know,
I thought that we'd be happy,  ♫

192
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:11,290
♫  I love you, the words that I cannot say to you now, ♫

193
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,450
The second stage of separation

194
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,890
that comes to find you, after denying reality; anger.

195
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,680
I'm going to hate you, Ajumma.

196
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,720
I'm going to curse you until I die and
I will never forgive you.

197
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,660
Italy? You will never be able to be there comfortably.

198
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,850
You're going to regret it forever.

199
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,410
Oh, Ajumma.

200
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:53,610
♫  I believe that you will come. You told me to only look at you.  ♫

201
00:18:53,610 --> 00:19:02,770
♫  I trust what you said, you can't live without me  ♫

202
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,180
Tomorrow is CEO Lee Kang Joon's disciplinary hearing.

203
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,300
Your participation is needed.

204
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,940
Team Leader Choi, you participate for me, instead.

205
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,540
There should be enough files.

206
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,760
You already said that you would attend

207
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,880
so that you can reprimand him personally.

208
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,080
You do as you see fit. Also, don't
come looking for me for a while.

209
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,600
President!

210
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,090
- How is it?
- It's delicious. Isn't it, Unni?

211
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,370
What in the world did you put in this?

212
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,850
The way that I cook it results in something
that tastes completely different from yours.

213
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,490
It's natural seasoning.

214
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,470
I ground fermented beans and shiitake mushroom.

215
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,930
Then, I roasted it for ten hours, after adding dried pollock.

216
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,640
It brings the ingredients to life.

217
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,740
Oh, really?

218
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,160
Do you think it would be okay to put this
in the restaurant's food from now on?

219
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,060
Of course, Ajummoni.

220
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,840
From now on, put it in everything
on the menu.

221
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,450
There will be a ton of customers.

222
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,210
I know, right?

223
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,070
Oh, this is so fascinating!
So delicious!

224
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,770
Ajumma!

225
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,570
Can we have two bowls of hangover soup!

226
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,070
- Where are you going?
- I told you

227
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,690
to prepare the documents by 9 am, today.

228
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,990
There was no reply. So, I think
I'll participate in the board meeting.

229
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,580
I will transfer the building to your name, so go back.

230
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,200
Are you sure?

231
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,640
I will fill out the paperwork for you!

232
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,060
Then, have it ready by five o'clock.

233
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,130
HBS Emergency Board of Directors Meeting

234
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,480
The agenda for today's Broadcast Board of Directors Meeting is

235
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,400
regarding the one who handled the broadcast of
false information about Madame Park Man Deok.

236
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,490
The agenda is for the discipline of
HBS CEO/Director Lee Kang Joon.

237
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,400
I heard that the one who submitted him
for discipline, Han Tae Hee, cannot attend today.

238
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,280
Do we have to delay the meeting?

239
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,450
There's no need to delay it.

240
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,730
Position of HBS News With Respect to Park Man Doek's
Embezzlement and Breach of Fiduciary Duties in Broadcast

241
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,940
These are signed documents.

242
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,290
The report was fair.

243
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,610
Han Tae Hee was recently hurt in an accident.

244
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:08,940
Since we've confirmed that he has no intention of
participating in this Board Meeting, dismiss the matter.

245
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,940
These are additional documents concluding that he worked
diligently to damage Madam Park Man Deok's honor.

246
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,190
This is a magazine reporting on his marriage and divorce.

247
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:34,080
He has violated the regulations of the company.

248
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,300
All of these are materials that were personally
prepared by Han Tae Hee.

249
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,200
Announcer Gyo Chae Yeon announces her divorce.

250
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,930
I will announce the result of the meeting.

251
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,420
The unanimous decision by the Board of Directors,
from Lee Kang Joon's disciplinary hearing, is

252
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,390
that CEO Lee Kang Joon

253
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,380
is to be suspended for three months.

254
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,510
Tae Hee has let go of the Winner Food work?

255
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,450
Yes, Grandmother.

256
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,390
If Oppa wants to receive the recommendation
of the Board of Directors as the leader,

257
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,940
they say he has to have a track record.

258
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,200
There isn't much time, so I'm worried.

259
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,240
Is it because of Sara?

260
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,760
Aghhh, I pointlessly broke this.

261
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,680
No matter what I do, I can't get rid of my anger!

262
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,330
Ajumma. Ajumma.

263
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,490
- Why?
- I called you about a Winner Food matter.

264
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,560
The labor unions keep calling.

265
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,280
I'm sorry. I can't do anything right now.

266
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,630
Ajumma. There's no one who would come at this time.

267
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,410
Ajumma. Ajumma.

268
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,270
I heard that you let go of the Winner Food work?

269
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,980
You are the person who will take charge of Winner Food.

270
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,300
With the General Stockholders Meeting ahead,
at this most important time,

271
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,410
it's not right for you do this over a woman issue.

272
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,310
Tae Hee, only you are having a hard time.

273
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,450
Sara, that child, isn't like that.

274
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,840
What are you talking about?

275
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,400
Sara said first that she wanted to break up.

276
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,560
And, in the end, didn't she go to study abroad for herself?

277
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,720
Sara doesn't feel as you do.

278
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,420
You must accept that truth and find your place.

279
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,270
Why must you know where Sara is?

280
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,980
I have a bit of a personal situation.

281
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,850
I heard that you received a three-month suspension
by the Board of Directors.

282
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,680
You're becoming more and more
unfavorable in my eyes.

283
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,280
The fact that I received a suspension

284
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,870
is because of the coverage of Madam Park Man Deok.

285
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,880
I heard that Han Tae Hee even raised
the issue of your personal life.

286
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,150
So, why did you give them such an excuse?
Why did you handle your personal life in that manner?

287
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:23,520
And also, why should you, who has so many
unsavory rumors surrounding you, look for Sara?

288
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,830
It's a matter related to Birth of a Chef.

289
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,520
Sara's past life isn't important.

290
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,690
I'm thinking to directly decide on matters
related to Sara's future.

291
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,690
I'm even going to become Sara's guardian.

292
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,990
I'd like for you to have no further dealings
with Sara, in the future.

293
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,740
Leave.

294
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,750
Ajumma, you didn't feel like I did?

295
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,420
Is that right, Ajumma?

296
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,860
Was I the only one who loved you like a crazy person?

297
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,700
I was the only one who loved you
and the only one who is hurting.

298
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,190
What happened at the cooking competition?

299
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,400
Are you curious?

300
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,000
Of course I am.

301
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,310
If you're curious, look at the rebroadcast.

302
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,860
This beef soup . . .

303
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,870
With which the broth was made with mussels,
I'd like to praise the idea greatly.

304
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:50,930
The ingredients, seasoning, and taste have all married nicely.

305
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,660
The striking and sumptuous royal table
that Oh Kyung Hee has prepared,

306
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:58,560
no matter what family receives it,
I think they will be 100% satisfied.

307
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,580
Then, shall we look at Sara's cooking?

308
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,080
It's Doenjang Jigae (bean paste soup) and tuna.

309
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,160
The taste is amazingly harmonious.
But, why is it tuna?

310
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,750
I recently promised to marry the person I love.

311
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,010
Since it's a table to be prepared for one's family,

312
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,570
I thought of that person.

313
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:41,750
That person is a bit unwell right now,

314
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:46,130
so I prepared a table only for him, with
ingredients good for the heart.

315
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,800
I made a broth with the tuna bones
which can lower cholesterol,

316
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,340
so I used tuna as an ingredient.

317
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,480
The mixed rice, fried walnut anchovy, onion salad . . .

318
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,170
And, I tried making a Duck Bulgogi (sweet soy sauce marinated).

319
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,750
There are traditional flavors in the four side dishes.

320
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,790
I added some natural seasoning that
I created using a traditional method.

321
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:19,400
I think that the tasters will have to try it for themselves.

322
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,500
How Sara's natural seasoning was made,

323
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,900
I can only say that it's the best.

324
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,100
♫  My each and every single day without you,  ♫

325
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,450
♫  I couldn't think that it would be this hard,  ♫

326
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,560
Today at the cooking competition, for ingredients, seven points.

327
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,970
For creativity, four points, for health evaluation, five points,

328
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,260
and from the taste evaluation, the ten points previously . . .

329
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,950
It's Sara. You are the winner of the third round.

330
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:01,350
Thank you. Thank you.

331
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:06,770
♫ The way you speak, everything. Perhaps, ♫

332
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:11,470
♫ If you feel the same way that I do ♫

333
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:17,590
♫ If like me, perhaps, you're hurting very much ♫

334
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,950
♫ I will run ♫

335
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,040
That gaze can't be a lie. Definitely (not).
♫ I will be embraced in your arms ♫

336
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:32,410
♫ Without you, I am nothing. Because I love you. ♫

337
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,120
Team Leader Choi, where is Han Min Hyeok right now?

338
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:55,460
I've been hearing from here and there that Han Tae Hee
has been looking for me. Now, you show up in person.

339
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,650
What happened?

340
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,510
Tell me where you sent Sara.

341
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,850
Do you think I could hide Sara by my own will?

342
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,600
Sara left by her own will.

343
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,380
What happened to the Han Tae Hee
who was so proud that he had nothing to lose?

344
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,380
Did you approach Sara on purpose so that
you could show off to me?

345
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,740
The reason isn't important.
What's important is the outcome.

346
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:21,940
Han Tae Hee, in the end, you could not
protect your woman,

347
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,110
just like your father who passed away twenty years ago.

348
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,820
Han Min Hyeok.

349
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,800
Your car is ready.

350
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:59,070
Han Tae Hee gave up Winner Food completely?

351
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,010
He cares for Sara that much?

352
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,910
He's completely lost all reasoning.

353
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,000
Things have become easier.

354
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,460
If Han Tae Hee can't save Winner Foods,
I will be the only candidate for the Board of Directors.

355
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,330
I believe it will be easy to get a ruling for me.

356
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,310
All of Winner Group and Sara...

357
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,670
I will have it all.

358
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,560
Then, have it prepared by five o'clock.

359
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,860
In this kind of situation, how is it you are acting like this?

360
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,360
- I have been suspended from the Director position also.
- Is that right?

361
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,120
Let's compromise on the building.

362
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,360
Let's each have half.

363
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,720
In one hour, call your house.

364
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,660
What do you mean by that?

365
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,950
I'm Chae Yeon.

366
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,410
Why are you calling me?

367
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,820
Since you made Kang Joon into a bad person,
we can't even leave the house.

368
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:50,260
Right now, it's just the start,
so it's worrisome if you're already worn out.

369
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,650
Have you checked your email?

370
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,880
What?

371
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,500
What is it?

372
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,290
Chae Yeon told me to open my email.

373
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,910
This is the video from the black box of Kang Joon's car.

374
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,510
It shows him killing Sa Geum Ran.

375
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,400
What?

376
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,900
What is this?

377
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,610
Isn't that the car Geum Ran was driving
at the time of the accident?

378
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,190
Is he following Geum Ran?

379
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,370
Oh my, Kang Joon!

380
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,620
Oh my, oh my!

381
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:42,000
What? Then, K-Kang Joon killed her?!

382
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,880
It's true that he killed her?

383
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,610
Looking at the video, it's certain.

384
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,120
On the road that our Pig Sister-in-law died,

385
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,570
Oppa was driving at a really scary speed.

386
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,060
The date and the time matches.

387
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,990
Kang Joon?

388
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,910
There must be something to it, in order for
somebody to report him for murder

389
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,400
and for him to be arrested!

390
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,280
What should we do?

391
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,260
I'm getting goosebumps.

392
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,780
Oh my word.

393
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,040
What are you guys doing to all be gathered, like this?

394
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,480
Why are you like that?

395
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,350
Did you guys commit a sin?

396
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:27,680
No. How could we sin?

397
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,210
What happened?!!

398
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,460
Nothing happened, Honey.

399
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,030
I'm here.

400
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,650
Kang Joon, you brat!

401
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,960
Why did you do that?
What are you going to do?

402
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,560
If that's revealed, you'll really be ruined.

403
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,850
Your life will be completely over!

404
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,750
What are we going to do about this?

405
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,900
No, never.

406
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,860
Who would believe that?

407
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,070
Even if we say that it wasn't you,

408
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,610
imagine if people in the world see it!

409
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,740
You're completely finished.

410
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,260
What should we do about this?

411
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,210
Chae Yeon, filled with spite, manipulated the video.

412
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,300
Don't say anything to Father.

413
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,080
Tell Noona and Min Yeong to erase the email.

414
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,470
Our house is over.

415
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:32,880
Our household is totally over.

416
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,350
What should we do?

417
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,530
How is it? Did you change your mind?

418
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,410
- Where are you?
- Just listen first.

419
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:50,800
If you don't want to hand over the building,
there is no need for us to meet or know where I am.

420
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,320
You must not be ready yet.

421
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,380
Fine, then.

422
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:01,200
I am currently organizing the list of directors
in charge of the broadcasting company.

423
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,120
I'm thinking to send the black box video
to the personal emails of the directors.

424
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,790
Can't you stop?

425
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,740
Then are you ready?

426
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,100
To hand over the building.

427
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,420
Have you brought the transfer of ownership document?

428
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,920
Change of Ownership Application

429
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,710
Lee Kang Joon

430
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,080
There is nothing to feel unfairly wronged about.

431
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:05,170
Think of this as a punishment for
abandoning women too easily.

432
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,070
Why can't you look directly in my eyes
if it's not a big deal?

433
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,260
That's right.

434
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,010
My eyes are growing dim nowadays.

435
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,770
Of what are you guilty?!

436
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:24,500
Guilty? What do you mean?

437
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,810
Kang Joon and you, what are you guys
doing about the building?

438
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,150
It's been a while since we decided to give it back
to the in-law! Why aren't you saying anything?

439
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,940
Give me the files! I will take care of it.

440
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,580
Okay. I got it.

441
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,030
Kang Joon, Kang Joon!
I think your father found out!

442
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,820
He told me to bring the files for the building.
What did Chae Yeon say?

443
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,730
Calm down! Father is going to hear us at this rate.

444
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,580
I can't calm down!

445
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,220
What is going to happen, Kang Joon?

446
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,210
Is the building going to be taken away from us?

447
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,620
I'm not going to give up on the building.

448
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,630
Didn't you hand over the files?

449
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,940
How can you not give it up when
Chae Yeon is threatening you!

450
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,510
There is still one more method.

451
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,370
What method?

452
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,080
The more you try to endure,

453
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,800
the more dangerous it will be for Han Tae Hee.

454
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,200
You know me well,

455
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,630
what I did to Sa Geum Ran . . .

456
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,840
You need to give me time to think or prepare myself!

457
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,930
How can you say it so quickly, without a reason?
This isn't right, Ajumma.

458
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,950
The person you are trying to reach is not picking up
the phone. You will be directed to voicemail.

459
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:02,100
After the beep, you will be charged additionally.

460
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:07,010
Kyeong Joo, I was wondering
if Han Tae Hee called you.

461
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:11,590
If you are able to call him or meet him,
tell me if he's okay.

462
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,000
He was very sick recently.

463
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,540
And if he's eating.

464
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,970
What do you mean Sara's mother isn't here?
Where did she go?

465
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,920
She went down to the province because
she had something to do.

466
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,890
She isn't picking up my phone calls.

467
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,840
Her battery must have run out.

468
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,960
I need to know where Sara is.

469
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,200
I don't know!

470
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,840
I have to leave soon, so can you go?

471
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,680
Geum Ran

472
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,730
Geum Ran.

473
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,050
You know about Sara, right?

474
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,740
What is this number?

475
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,720
Isn't Sara overseas?

476
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,800
She's in this country?

477
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:08,240
A person that is very close to Mother has a restaurant.

478
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,000
Geum Ran is over there with her mother.

479
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,010
Ajumma...

480
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,780
CEO said that he is going to the province.

481
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,150
He is going alone today also.

482
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:54,750
It's Han Min Hyeok. I'm going to you right now.

483
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,310
I have something to talk to you about, about work.

484
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,500
Yes.

485
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,640
Can I have some more radish kimchi?

486
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,600
Yes, it's coming!

487
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,810
Eat well!

488
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,740
Thank you.

489
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,830
Who wanted more radish kimchi?

490
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,420
Here!

491
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,140
You must have been hungry.

492
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,430
Eat a lot!

493
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,310
Ajumma...

494
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,250
Eat well!

495
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,110
Han Tae Hee?

496
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:35,070
I was wondering if Sara is doing well.

497
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,750
She is doing well.

498
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,400
I'm not happy to see you.

499
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,130
I asked a favor of you

500
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,630
to not hurt Geum Ran again.

501
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,380
I am very resentful.

502
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,870
Is Sara really okay?

503
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:05,790
She's settled down a lot now.

504
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,760
I heard that you are the son of Winner Group.

505
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,780
Geum Ran is barely living with someone else's identity.

506
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:18,870
You two don't suit each other and look precarious.

507
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:22,300
Since you guys broke up, you should start anew.

508
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,310
I've decided to be the bad guy,

509
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:29,340
and I hope that you don't come back again.

510
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,460
How can the noodles be so chewy?

511
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,700
Can you tell me your secret? Huh?

512
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,140
The secret is the strength of determination.

513
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,740
That hand determination which can crush an apple in one try.

514
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,610
Anyway, you are so interesting.

515
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,980
If you go on TV, you will be successful.

516
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,530
You should go on one of those cooking competitions.

517
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,730
Cooking competition.

518
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,630
Even if it's just for me, go on the show.

519
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,170
And, if you are going, winning decisively
would be even better.

520
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,820
Kyeong Joo, did Han Tae Hee contact you?

521
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,380
Yes, he came.

522
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,560
I had no choice but to tell him where you were.

523
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,050
I think he was going to where you are.

524
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:50,280
♫ How can I forget you? How can I erase you? ♫

525
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,950
♫ I can't stand a single moment without you. ♫

526
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,350
Doctor.

527
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:05,880
♫ My heart hurts so much, I can't let you go like this.♫

528
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:12,020
♫ I'll wait for you until always. Even if it hurts, it's ok. ♫

529
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,800
Sara.

530
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:35,230
Sa Geum Ran, I see that you were hiding here.

531
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,140
Winner Food is going to declare bankruptcy?

532
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,340
Since you left, Tae Hee hasn't been
taking care of his company.

533
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,920
And, this isn't the only thing.

534
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,820
I think there will be more unpleasant things
happening to Tae Hee.

535
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,610
The labor union's reaction is not looking good.

536
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,570
Now, she has settled many things.

537
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,230
I don't think Sara feels the same way as you do.

538
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,630
Tae Hee, you are the only one who is suffering.

539
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:31,700
Recently, I promised to marry someone who I love.

540
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,010
You have been hurt badly.

541
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:36,770
I didn't think I was going to see you again.

542
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,920
If there is more news regarding Winner Food,
please let me know.

543
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,810
I understand.

544
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:14,600
But Sara, are you really going to be okay staying here?

545
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,360
I'm doing fine here, so don't worry.

546
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,900
I'll see you next time.

547
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,440
Ajumma.

548
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,540
You look good, Ajumma.

549
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,130
It's tolerable.

550
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,000
Are you doing okay, Doctor?

551
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,420
Are you eating regularly?

552
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,190
You said you were going to study abroad,

553
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,260
but why are you here?

554
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:55,620
I wanted live here quietly here, and plan things

555
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,830
and settle things around me.

556
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,810
I hear that Winner Food is in a dire situation.

557
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:11,130
It's an important time, so how can you neglect the work?

558
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:13,090
Because of you, Ajumma,

559
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,170
I became an idiot who can't do anything.

560
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:26,540
Because we broke up, you can't do anything?

561
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,720
That's just an excuse.

562
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,480
When married couples are separating everyday, what is
the big deal about a man and a woman breaking up?

563
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,650
I'm doing well. So you, too, go back to what you were doing,

564
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,500
and don't come to see me anymore.

565
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,930
To you Ajumma,

566
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,140
is that possible?

567
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,150
Wasn't it difficult for you?

568
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:05,300
You said that I was a woman with no emotions.

569
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:13,240
I am like that. If one only does housework,
one becomes realistic.

570
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:18,500
I just work, worry about what to eat, and mingle
comfortably with others.

571
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,050
You feel differently than I do.

572
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,300
I saw you laugh.

573
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:38,420
When I saw how well you were doing, I honestly hated you.

574
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,870
Yes, I should just let her be.
Let's just pretend that I didn't see her.

575
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,260
I thought that and was going back to Seoul.

576
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,250
But then, I turned my car around.

577
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,810
Why?

578
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,000
The reason is...

579
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,330
because I wanted to see you.

580
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,690
That's not the case for me.

581
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,800
If we ended, then it's the end.
Now, I don't want to see you anymore.

582
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,530
I like being alone.

583
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:37,540
I don't want to be attached to anyone anymore.

584
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,340
You like being alone, but you're in contact
with Han Min Yeok?

585
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,560
Why, of all people, does it have to be Han Min Hyeok?

586
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,370
We ended our relationship.

587
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:50,850
So, do I need to explain anything?

588
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,770
You are going way overboard, Ajumma.

589
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,400
It's too much.

590
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,500
So, don't have any lingering feelings.

591
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,740
Don't be concerned about me.

592
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:04,590
With that energy . . . Put that energy into your work.

593
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:24,730
♫ Because it's a fearless love. ♫

594
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:32,350
♫ Because love comes out before pain. ♫

595
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:38,700
♫  Even if contemplating is all I can do, ♫

596
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:45,640
♫  I can't throw you away. ♫

597
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:05,280
♫ Yesterday, and today. ♫

598
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:12,280
♫  You destroyed half of me and made me crazy  ♫

599
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:20,050
♫ The longing which can't be erased even though I tried very hard.  ♫

600
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,950
Geum, I am going to go the ajumma's house.
♫ Even if you don't love me ♫

601
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,280
I am going to get a blanket.

602
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,540
Geum Ran.

603
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,180
Mom, I'm going to go shopping for food.
♫  I am without fear.  ♫

604
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,960
All the food in storage for the restaurant has run out.

605
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:42,350
♫ I'll throw everything into this love. ♫

606
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:49,070
♫ Even if the ending isn't happy, ♫

607
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:56,160
♫ I will follow where my heart goes. ♫

608
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,120
♫  You're the reason that I live.  ♫

609
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,820
The last stage of separation.

610
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:06,550
Acceptance.

611
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:10,320
♫  Even if all I can do is think about you..  ♫

612
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:10,500
♫  It's a love that I can't let go of.  ♫

613
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:15,700
♫  Love is not something you can put in you hands. ♫

614
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,050
Get out.

615
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:58,980
This is a restaurant. I came here to eat too.

616
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,100
What do you want?

617
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,710
Chae Yeon threatened me and took my building.

618
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:12,960
Chae Yeon has the black-box recording
from the day of the car accident.

619
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,230
It recorded me, who pushed you over the cliff.

620
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,530
You need to save me.

621
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:26,980
It will be solved if you reveal that
you are Sa Geum Ran, not Sara.

622
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:32,610
The building belongs to you, so you should
reveal your identity and get it back.

623
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:36,920
And, you need to say that I didn't murder you.

624
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,000
Why would I do that?

625
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,780
If you don't do that,

626
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,770
I will come visit you everyday.

627
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,520
I did not become the CEO,

628
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,730
got divorced, and even had the building taken away.

629
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,400
What else do I have left?
All I can do is to hold onto you.

630
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,740
They say that fights between a couple
are like trying to slice water.

631
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,390
Why are you here?

632
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,570
How did you find out?

633
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:14,150
Are you okay?

634
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:20,000
Get out! Get out before I call the police.
Get out right now.

635
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:26,070
Now you must have found out her identity.

636
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:31,200
Honey, you are a good daughter.

637
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,370
You need to keep this happiness.

638
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:36,990
Go! Get away from my Geum Ran!

639
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:39,940
Think about my words carefully.

640
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,870
Out!

641
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:50,450
That disgusting rascal!
How can he even follow you here?

642
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:53,980
Let's move somewhere else.

643
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,680
Do you think that he won't find us, if we do that?

644
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,990
No matter whether you love or hate me, we're in the same boat,

645
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:11,410
so you should help me from now on.

646
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,050
When I become the head of Winner Group,
you will benefit as well.

647
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:22,020
This is the opportunity, since Han Tae Hee is weak.

648
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:25,540
I'm going to report Han Tae Hee to the police,
after fabricating the files.

649
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,670
I will take care of this.

650
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,500
My grandmother's trial...

651
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:39,130
Make sure that her sentence is finalized.

652
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,830
I'm trying to make it so that she spends
the rest of her live in jail.

653
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:46,990
This is something that you have to do.

654
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:59,150
Immediate Loan Application

655
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,930
What is this?

656
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,570
To slow down the bankruptcy of the company,

657
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:09,580
it is an application for a loan from the loan sharks.

658
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,860
He wanted to save the company,
but the method he used was wrong.

659
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,440
He gathered illegal bonds.

660
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,150
He made it seem like the Labor Union agreed with him.

661
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,920
If this is known to the officials,
it is a minimum of five years in jail.

662
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:28,740
Since the labor union agreed with him,
they committed the same sin.

663
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,280
Where is CEO Han Tae Hee?

664
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,240
After doing this, would he still be at the company?

665
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,600
It's been a while since he took
his hands off Winner Foods.

666
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:49,770
What? CEO made corporate bonds?

667
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,970
That's nonsense.

668
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,160
He said he would save the company.

669
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,840
Is deceiving people with corporate bonds
as a way to save the company?

670
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,020
We're not going to stay still on this.

671
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:09,840
CEO! CEO!

672
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:12,970
Something major has happened!

673
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:15,530
You can't be like this!

674
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:18,120
Please answer your phone!

675
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:27,710
Han Tae Hee is going to be prosecuted?

676
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:32,390
We can't contact him. At this rate,
something major will happen!

677
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:41,810
The labor union is going to sue Han Tae Hee.

678
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,800
The situation is going in our favor.

679
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,000
This was not meant to just prosecute him.

680
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:52,000
Sara is the objective.

681
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,540
General Manager Han Min Hyeok, it's Sara.

682
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,660
May I see you?

683
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,760
I'll head down.

684
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,020
Yes.

685
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:31,040
I heard that the labor union is
going to prosecute Han Tae Hee.

686
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,330
But Tae Hee isn't moving at all.

687
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:40,460
The reason why Han Tae Hee is like that
is because of me.

688
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,360
Just help him overcome this.

689
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:47,520
If he finishes cleaning up his feelings,
he will solve everything. He's that kind of person.

690
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,950
Help him. I beg you, General Manager.

691
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:56,840
Then, how about if we help each other with one thing?

692
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,790
I told you. I'm a businessman.

693
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:04,160
This seems like good timing.

694
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,860
I will put all my effort into saving Tae Hee. However,

695
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,730
you have to accept my offer.

696
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,280
The labor union is going to report me?

697
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,080
Yes, CEO. I fear that it's too late to stop anything.

698
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:27,570
Where are the representatives for the labor union?

699
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:30,980
They are having a meeting at the company.

700
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,800
Yes.

701
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,700
- You came?
- Are you ready?

702
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,530
I'm ready for the debate as well.

703
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:51,630
The spotlight for today is on you.

704
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,850
Since CEO Jung, from Han San Group,
wants you to present him,

705
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:58,750
it means he is thinks of you as the
future head of Winner Group.

706
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,380
Is that right?

707
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:07,400
- Let's go.
- Also, are you okay if I have one more person join us?

708
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:12,600
I know that you worked hard for this.
Of course you may.

709
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:22,950
Your car is here.

710
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,560
Sara.

711
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:40,330
♫ How can I forget you? How can I erase you? ♫

712
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:47,540
♫  I can't stand a single moment without you.  ♫

713
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:51,600
♫ My heart aches so much, I can't let you go like this. ♫
