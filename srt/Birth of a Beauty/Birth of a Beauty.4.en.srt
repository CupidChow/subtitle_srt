1
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,700
Episode 4

2
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,580
What did you say?

3
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,300
Repeat what you just said.

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,980
My death... there might be something else, Doctor.

5
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,190
What do you mean there is something to your death? What is it ?

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,600
A scary... conspiracy.

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,020
Conspiracy?

8
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,590
Conspiracy?

9
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,160
You mean someone wanted to kill you?

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,090
Yes, Doctor!

11
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,670
Did you take your delusion drug?

12
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,180
Did you forget to take it again while staying out all night?

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,270
I took it. I always make sure to take it, because I'm afraid
that I'll leak out some sideways path (if I don't).

14
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,230
Then it's a delusion of grandeur.

15
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,250
Psychologically, love is interpreted as a serious mental illness.

16
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,990
You, who have fallen in love with your husband,
are in a manic mental state.

17
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,730
It's an exaggeration of your imagination.

18
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,250
That's not it at all, Doctor!

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,470
Ahjumma, then where do you think this is?

20
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,150
It looks like a restaurant that's been closed.

21
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,900
Not a closed one...
But a restaurant that's about to be opened!

22
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,750
It was Chae Yeon's hope to have a restaurant
where families can come.

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,710
I want to make her hope a reality!

24
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,310
You and I should wrap things up here
and go our separate ways.

25
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,590
- Kang Joon really stayed out last night?
- Yup.

26
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,550
Lately, I think there's something
interesting going on with my brother.

27
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,560
With the wedding two weeks away,
would there be any issues?

28
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,840
Oh! Since I gave you the information you wanted,
the bracelet is my reward!

29
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,120
Did you already pack all your things?

30
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:26,520
Ahjumma, pack your things! Accident or not,
you two stayed out all night.

31
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,500
The wedding part of the plan is just ahead, now!

32
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,450
What if someone did mean to kill me?

33
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,230
Move on without knowing the truth?
How can I do that?

34
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,630
It's like fooling myself.

35
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,470
If anything happens to me, by any chance,
don't bother finding out what happened.

36
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,440
Knowing the truth is painful.

37
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,260
Remember my words.

38
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,300
Doctor!

39
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:29,720
Just like the horrible accident you endured...
I, too, have endured an enormous ordeal!

40
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:38,280
But that thing called the truth... Knowing it is painful!

41
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,430
So, I survived by ignoring it!

42
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,420
Whatever the truth is, Ahjumma...
You need to just move past it!

43
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,360
I died! How do I get past that?

44
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,710
There's a conspiracy behind my death!
How am I supposed to ignore that?

45
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,000
Lee Kang Joon

46
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,150
My husband is calling. He must be angry.

47
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,080
Are you going to give up when you've come this far?

48
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,690
Yes, Kang Joon.

49
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,650
Sara, what's happening?

50
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,250
Are you in Seoul?

51
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,230
He said he will come.

52
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,560
I want things to go well with my husband.
But I really must know what I can about this conspiracy!

53
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,380
That way, when my husband and I are married, I can rest easily.

54
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,080
- Are you sick?
- Article 34 of the Contract...

55
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,170
"Restrictive Movement Covenant: Per my instruction . . ."

56
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,220
"If Han Tae Hee says to live, you live. If he says to die,
you die."

57
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,290
In other words, do as you are told!

58
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,190
Conspiracy or not, if I tell you to forget about it...
You forget about it!

59
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,420
Get out.

60
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,580
Get out!

61
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,190
Yes.

62
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,860
Mom! Dad!

63
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:39,690
Even if something were to happen to me, don't try
to find out what happened. This way, you'll be safe.

64
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,000
Mom, Dad!

65
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,690
Mom! Dad!

66
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,400
Mom! Dad!

67
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,080
Dad!

68
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,410
Dad!

69
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,000
As you fell, you were cut by broken glass.

70
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,380
You're in the same shape as I was
when I went to the site of my accident.

71
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,520
Could it be because you hid the truth
and the heartache became an illness?

72
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,750
Do you think that it's okay?

73
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,760
Do you really think it's okay to hide the truth?

74
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,770
Ahjumma, it's your husband.

75
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,130
Just stay here. I won't let him come in.

76
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,700
Get some rest.

77
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,780
It's not okay.

78
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,370
- What?
- Hiding the truth. I said it's not okay.

79
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,470
Then...

80
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,570
Let's find the truth about your death together.

81
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
Really, Doctor? Okay, Doctor, I like it.

82
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,620
Doctor, if you were a fish, you would be the red tilefish. If you were beef, then you would be its live flesh. If you were tuna, then you would be its belly flesh.

83
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,730
Live flesh of the red tilefish?

84
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,010
What's that?

85
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,270
I'm saying you're the best of the best.

86
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,650
My husband!

87
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,540
There you go again! Going straight ahead without a plan.

88
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,340
Ahjumma, you took off at a very crucial moment without saying a word. So how do you plan to excuse and explain yourself?

89
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,690
Kang Joon...

90
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,950
Sara, what happened?

91
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,900
Did someone die?

92
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,470
A dog died.

93
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,600
A dog?

94
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,790
I lived alone with a dog,

95
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,370
so it was like my family.

96
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,830
After hearing that my dog was killed by a car,

97
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,260
I was so shocked and just came back here.

98
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,710
You should've told me. I was worried.

99
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,780
The dog's name was Pink.

100
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,270
It was a pretty dog that liked the color pink, just like me.

101
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,660
Pink!

102
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,810
I really liked Pink.

103
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,000
It's Gyo Chae Yeon.

104
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,100
A family meeting before the wedding?

105
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,870
Since it's a family party, she invited me to come.

106
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,830
Why would she invite me? I'm not her family or friend.

107
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,520
Do you not know? She is trying to mark her territory!

108
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,260
It's a mating ritual used by primates, such as gorillas
or monkeys. It's the practice to mark (its terrirtory.}

109
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:11,160
She is trying to show that Lee Kang Joon
is hers by bringing you to the house.

110
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,160
She is using the territorial marking method as a
mating ritual..? Chae Yeon really is something!

111
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,380
It's Chae Yeon.

112
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,010
Chae Yeon invited me, too.

113
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,010
That's good! We can go together
to your ex-in-laws and investigate.

114
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,570
Then, will you be revealing the conspiracy?

115
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,960
No.

116
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,250
You have to investigate.

117
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,330
LED magnifier, eye glass, spray, recorder,

118
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,300
finger printing powder kit.

119
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,470
Use what you need, and investigate.

120
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,290
You have to find the black box of your car.

121
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,040
However much the amount was, you must also
find out who took your money!

122
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,420
We have to find the person involved in the conspiracy.

123
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,290
From now on, you are the leader of the investigation unit.

124
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,290
I like being the lead investigator.

125
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,610
But if I investigate, what are you going to do?

126
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,770
I'm going to be the squad chief.

127
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,220
Investigator, squad chief.

128
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,810
Chief Investigator.

129
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,370
Sara, it's bothering me.

130
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,400
It would be better if you don't come.

131
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,980
Kang Joon, what are you doing not coming down?

132
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,240
Sara just came right now.

133
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,940
You have to flip it!

134
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,590
You are good at nothing.

135
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,110
What are you doing just standing there?

136
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,130
Sara, you seem to have some sort of destiny with our household.

137
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,030
I didn't know that you had some relation with Chae Yeon.

138
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,470
What are you doing?

139
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,180
Mom, you don't know what you are doing either.
Why are you so angry?

140
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,460
You wretch!

141
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,360
Be quiet!

142
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,960
There are pictures that were taken
during community service

143
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,450
and awards. You can look around.

144
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,200
Okay, Father.

145
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,610
Do you cook with your mouths?

146
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,820
Mother, the new picture is here!

147
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,890
Isn't it pretty? Which way? Like this?

148
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,680
No, like this?

149
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,210
Mother! I made some bean soup.

150
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,510
It tastes amazing.

151
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,730
What is all this? There is a lot of food.

152
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,930
What is all this, Mom?

153
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,460
Hello.

154
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,830
God of Restaurants!

155
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,190
We are a restaurant consulting company,

156
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,680
We are the employees of CEO Han Tae Hee.

157
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,400
We are here to help with the cooking.

158
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,840
I was about to die from cooking.

159
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,480
You guys saved us all!

160
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,450
Where is Han Tae Hee, the God of Restaurants?

161
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,640
Thank you for inviting me. I'm Han Tae Hee.

162
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:18,480
Welcome, I heard that you lived with Chae Yeon, like a family.

163
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,330
I was most impressed with the volunteer work
of your free meal service truck.

164
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,180
There is a saying that the most beautiful woman
in the world is a woman who cooks.

165
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,650
There was a reason behind those words!

166
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,790
Beautiful!

167
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,190
I welcome you.

168
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,130
Hello.

169
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,420
How do you like it?

170
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:00,330
Bravo! At this level, you are totally pros!

171
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,800
I'm not as good as I usually am.

172
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,670
Min Yeong, Shin Yeong, were you guys covering your ears?

173
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,420
No, Dad!

174
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,420
No, no, no, no. That's nonsense.

175
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,590
I heard from the judges at the audition

176
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,230
that you can hear better if you cover one ear.

177
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,920
That's why, right?

178
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,250
Of course, that's right. That's why we did it.

179
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,510
What Sister-In-Law is saying is correct, Dad.

180
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,490
Look at her sense of understanding.

181
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,780
Honey, when Chae Yeon comes into the house,
we wouldn't need to turn on the furnace.

182
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,440
She brings such a warm atmosphere.
Am I not right, Honey?

183
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,310
That's right. Please be part of our family.

184
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,280
Okay, Father-In-Law.

185
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,120
Then, to digest the food, I will take a walk around the garden.

186
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,240
Kang Joon, let's have a game of chess later.

187
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,410
But where is the garden?

188
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,280
- I will lead you.
- No, I will.

189
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,960
Hey, hey, hey! You guys should do the dishes.

190
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,720
I will lead you.

191
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,350
Well, then.

192
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,360
Can you let me look around the second floor?

193
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,400
A suicide note?

194
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,630
You mean the last note she left?

195
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,690
Yes, I heard that she left a suicide note.

196
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,790
In every picture, she is smiling brightly.

197
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,020
I was wondering what she said before she killed herself.

198
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,040
I don't know. She didn't really say anything special.

199
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,110
There was.

200
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,170
Is talking about money not anything special?

201
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,800
About money?

202
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,830
Sara, you are very curious.

203
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,390
Where is the suicide note? I want to see it.

204
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,750
The suicide note was an e-mail?

205
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,010
Yeah.

206
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,990
Sender: ID: SGR1234

207
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,290
This is my email.

208
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,760
How did they figure out my password?

209
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,850
This is a conspiracy.

210
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,250
Who would do this?

211
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,460
Father, Mother, please forgive me.

212
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,550
I feel like I'm useless.

213
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,140
I want to stop living.

214
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,030
I will let my husband be executor of my estate.

215
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,020
PROPERTY DEED TRANSFER FORM 
Reason and date of transfer:

216
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,950
- Where is Sara?
- She said she needed to use the bathroom.

217
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,750
What did you say?

218
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,830
You're saying that the Seochodong Canvas Building
belongs to Chae Yeon?

219
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,990
The building that's famous because Bill Weber designed it...

220
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,320
belongs to Chae Yeon?

221
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,300
Please don't hate just because it is Chae Yeon.
I'm putting in a lot of effort, too.

222
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:24,080
Why are you coming out? Stay inside,
I'll bring the juice. Just go back in.

223
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,730
Ouch, Unni!

224
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,210
You weren't in the bathroom?

225
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,010
Why are you coming from Kang Joon's Room?

226
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,760
Well, I..

227
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,470
You couldn't find where the bathroom was, right?

228
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,530
Go downstairs, it's there.

229
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,390
Yes, then.

230
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,450
The Canvas Building, it's Chae Yeon's?

231
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,990
Where did the money come from?

232
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,480
Why aren't you making a move?

233
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,680
Even though you're winning, you're very cautious.

234
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,210
Oppa Ji Hoon says that he's coming now that he's finished.

235
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,160
Oh, yeah.

236
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,300
Sara, let's go out for some fresh air.

237
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,510
Kang Joon, we'll just call it a tie. But in return,

238
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,390
let's make the next a deciding game.

239
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,370
The (suicide note)/will was sent by email?

240
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,910
Then whoever knows your password is the culprit!

241
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,420
Oh, that's right! Do you know the Canvas Building?
How much is Lee Kang Joon's fortune worth?

242
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,890
I don't know about that, but let's talk about the land first.

243
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,720
Since I'm the only child, my father left the land
to me as an inheritance.

244
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,890
Now, the title for it has been transferred.

245
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,480
If that's taken away, then my mom won't have any money.

246
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,140
Then, what will she live on? What should I do, Doctor?

247
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,350
Land?

248
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,620
Where is it? What kind of land is it ?

249
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,850
- It's the property in front of Seocho Municipal Court.
- In front of Seocho Federal Building?

250
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,270
In front of the Seocho Municipal Building...

251
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,380
The Canvas Building?!

252
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,740
Han Tae Hee?

253
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,900
What do we do?

254
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,320
What are you doing?

255
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,360
What to do. What to do ?

256
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,330
Jin Yeong?

257
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,640
Let's drink coffee together.

258
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,000
Get close, hug me tight!

259
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,150
Jin Yeong, stop!

260
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,550
Stop, please.

261
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,920
Why?

262
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,850
My pants zipper...

263
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,050
is broken.

264
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,890
And I was just fixing it right now.

265
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,560
Oh, your pants zipper?

266
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,890
Oh my, why there of all places?

267
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,440
I know, right? Why here?

268
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,620
What are we going to do?

269
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,760
But, Doctor.

270
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,530
Why is your heart beating so loudly? It's really loud.

271
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,550
It's because your forearms are too strong!
My heart is being squeezed!

272
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,370
Tae Hee, does it look like you can fix your pants zipper?

273
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,890
Should I help you?

274
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,310
No, no, I'll do it!

275
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,490
Then I'll wait over here.

276
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,030
If we're caught, forget about a criminal investigation.
We're the one's who will be investigated!

277
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:41,080
Of course, now what do we do?

278
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:47,770
- Ah, my arms hurt.
- What do we do?

279
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,650
Why can't I see it ?

280
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,760
Jin Yeong?

281
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,600
Can you please bring me a flashlight?

282
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,490
Sure, I'll do that for you, Tae Hee.

283
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,440
Get up!

284
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,470
Let's go.

285
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,900
Yes, where are you? Let's meet right now.

286
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:34,010
Tae Hee went home because his pants zipper was broken.

287
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,380
Oh my!

288
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,960
Oppa Ji Hoon says he can't come today
because something came up.

289
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:53,200
Sara went home because of bathroom problems.

290
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,180
What is this? She even left her coat.

291
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,400
Hey there... !
For some time, I've been...

292
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,320
Hypnosis investigation? What kind of nonsense is that, Hyung?

293
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,500
"Treating Obesity with Hypnosis."You wrote
your doctoral thesis on that and won a prize!

294
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,210
You're the best specialist in this field, kid.

295
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,420
That was in order to treat obesity.

296
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,780
But I haven't done it for any kind of investigating.

297
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,030
There's a first time for everyone, you rascal!

298
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:32,190
Okay, who is it that you want to investigate, and when?

299
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,680
Ah! Oh my...!

300
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,990
What is this?

301
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,010
It's a person. It's okay.

302
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,630
There's a really bad person out there.
And you have to catch him, Hyung.

303
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,760
Put that person under hypnosis and
make her remember the car accident,

304
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,880
so we can find the license plate number
of the car that caused the accident.

305
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,070
Let's start the hypnosis investigation.

306
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,290
Mong Shil died? Why would a healthy dog die?

307
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:26,070
Suddenly, he was foaming at the mouth and collapsed.

308
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,780
Secretary Son! Secretary Son!

309
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,120
Grandmother, what's the matter? What happened?

310
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,150
- You called me, Mother.
- Mong Shil died.

311
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,650
Mong Shil died? Wait, why?

312
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,320
I'm sorry, Mother. I didn't know.

313
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,390
Taking care of the dog is your responsibility.

314
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:58,760
Grandmother, control yourself.
I'll find out more information about it.

315
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,630
If you feel upset, it will also upset your health,
Grandmother. Bring some water!

316
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,490
Calm yourself.

317
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,070
Did you do it deliberately ? Did you give rat poison to the dog?

318
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,860
Yes. Now I feel refreshed.

319
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,100
Mother, weren't you going to stay quiet
until the shareholder's general meeting?

320
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,550
Surely they won't perform an autopsy
on a dog, right? No one will know.

321
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,880
She'll come to think that the dog's fate would be preferable.

322
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,090
The dog was sent off at once. But that old woman...

323
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,400
I will never send her off just as she is.

324
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,070
The bad feelings that have been piling up (in me)
for 35 years. In the exact same way...

325
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,130
I'm going to pay it back.

326
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,620
The car is black.

327
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,190
The license plate number is 814.

328
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,630
I need one more digit.

329
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,790
We honestly did all we could do. There is nothing else left.

330
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,180
We've been like this for 14 hours.

331
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,010
Aish.

332
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,560
38GO 814

333
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,580
Grandmother.

334
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,990
We had a funeral service for Mong Shil
and her ashes are resting at the memorial house.

335
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,270
Are you okay, Grandmother?

336
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,130
Go outside.

337
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,630
Yes, Grandmother.

338
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,790
A dinner with Brother-in-law?

339
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,880
He was the only one who didn't attend the family meeting.

340
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,110
That's okay, right?

341
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,090
Since yesterday, you've mentioned it twice already.

342
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:32,030
Why do I feel as though you're doing this on purpose?

343
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,040
You are sharp.

344
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,420
Let's go after you finish work.
Ji Hoon hasn't had a meal yet.

345
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,970
My husband is the one who killed me?

346
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,890
Why should I suspect my husband?
That's a false accusation.

347
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:06,260
You have 500 acres of land in Seochodong!
That's an enormous amount of money!

348
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,230
How are you going to explain why it went to his
possession? Your husband is the killer!

349
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,680
My husband can't even kill an ant.

350
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,340
The way I see it, I think it's Gyo Chae Yeon.

351
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,260
What?

352
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,230
I heard that she took over my land and built a building.
If that's the case, then, it's Gyo Chae Yeon.

353
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,470
You are blaming an innocent person. How
would Chae Yeon know your email's password?

354
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,020
You said that she is a smart woman.

355
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,590
[38-Go 8147]

356
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,560
That car...

357
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,030
I was like that car.

358
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,200
Are you okay?

359
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,190
Even the licence plate...

360
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,070
is the same.
 8147

361
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,720
Welcome, Brother-in-Law.

362
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,270
Oppa.

363
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,980
Ahjumma, Ahjumma!

364
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,990
- Go safely, President!
- Sure, work hard.

365
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,530
Yes!

366
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,140
Geung Joo!

367
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,430
Geum Ran's Mother! What brings you all the way here?

368
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,270
This. Look at this.

369
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,810
What kind of situation is this?

370
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:38,000
Fertility Clinic Application Form
 Patient's name: Sa Geum Ran

371
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,290
On the morning of Geum Ran's death,
she submitted an application at a fertility clinic.

372
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:45,170
The date of her death. It's the date of her death.

373
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,360
You're right. It is the same date.

374
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,350
That's the day she killed herself...

375
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,530
How would a girl, who applied at a fertility clinic
to get pregnant, kill herself?

376
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,860
Would that be reasonable?

377
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,950
This doesn't make sense. Isn't it weird?

378
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,180
Yes, Mother. It is weird.

379
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,760
Ahjumma, you became unconscious.

380
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,340
Where are you going? You can't move right now.

381
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,710
Let me get some air.

382
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,560
Mother! What do you think you're doing?!

383
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,830
Didn't you see what I did?

384
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,630
Fine, perhaps you will understand
once you get a bucket full of water.

385
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,980
Kids, bring me more water.

386
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,810
Yes, Mother.

387
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,010
In-law!

388
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:55,650
Fertility clinic? Are you saying that she didn't kill herself
just because she applied for something like this?

389
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,160
What kind of nonsense is this?!

390
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,060
You are trying to grab onto my son's ankle with this!

391
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:06,410
Why are you ripping it up? If Geum Ran didn't kill
herself, this is the evidence. Why did you rip it up?!

392
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,190
Oh, my goodness!

393
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,880
Evidence? What evidence?!

394
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,600
My son is my religion.

395
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,450
I've lived all my life this way.

396
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:23,200
- When Geum Ran died, I thought she was grabbing onto my son's ankle.
- Mom?

397
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,990
Now that my son's successful,
you are trying to grab onto his ankle!

398
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,920
If you dare harm my son,

399
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,880
I will send you a bucket full of fire, not water.

400
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,810
If your child is precious, you should know that
another person's child is precious too!

401
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,540
Geum Ran was my only daughter.

402
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,700
After my husband died, I lived relying on Geum Ran.

403
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,370
This is about something wrong with my only daughter's death.

404
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,680
Am I not even allowed to ask about it?

405
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,600
Once become twice, then twice becomes thrice!

406
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,090
Even if you tell me this multiple times,
nothing can be done.

407
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:05,190
Leave. I said leave.

408
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,640
Restrain yourself!

409
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,820
Mom!

410
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,170
What am I going to do about Geum Ran!

411
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,600
- In-law!
- It's Kang Joon.

412
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,440
In-law!

413
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,720
Geum Ran!

414
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,870
- Let go! Let go!
- What to do?

415
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:40,590
My poor child! What am I going to do about Geum Ran?

416
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,810
Geum Ran!

417
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:03,800
Clinic? Even if someone applies for something like that,
people who want to die will die.

418
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,070
Isn't that so, Kang Joon?

419
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:11,480
But doesn't it seem like those people
are going to cause trouble because of this?

420
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,960
The in-laws don't know that this is your second marriage.
If they find out, they are going to pass out.

421
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,710
If they find out that he cheated, the whole town will be in chaos.

422
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,670
Who sprayed water in front of the house?

423
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,870
Did a member of our family do that?

424
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,190
What's up? Is there something ?

425
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:38,840
No, I will clean it.

426
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,330
The people upstairs gave me some drink,
but I spilled it on my way.

427
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,560
What are you doing? Go and clean!

428
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,360
- Yes!
- Please, go in.

429
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,940
What happened to Sim Ryeo Wook?

430
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:08,710
She got kicked out this morning.
These are all of her belongings.

431
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,790
Kicked out? Why did she get kicked out?

432
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,540
Who are you to move all of her belongings?

433
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,420
Do you know Lee Kang Joon, her son-in-law?

434
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,320
That person recently bought this house. He is the owner.

435
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:28,550
I'm their housekeeper and he told me to live here for free!

436
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,080
What kind of luck is this?

437
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:52,700

Why would they kick out my mother?

441
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,730
I was fat and stupid

442
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,870
and was killed because I was unpleasant to have around.

443
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,840
What did my mother do?

444

Even when it snows or rains, or when we're happy
or sad, we swore that we would love each other.

452
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,630
I want to be his wife again.

453
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,580
Ahjumma, don't copy me.

454
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,930
You're not okay. Why do you act like
you're okay when you're not?

455
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,590

465
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,250
You look nervous. Did anything happen at the company?

466
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,860
No, that's not it.

467
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,520
Then why are you in such a rush?

468
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,770
Nothing happened, but something
has felt off for the past few days.

469
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,710
It's just a feeling, but something is not right.

470
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:42,540
I'll let you know after I check.

471
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,920
And it's good that we're done early.

472
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,640
You should enjoy some time with Chae Yeon.

473
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,170
Why would I worry?

474
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,800
This is already marriage number two for you.

475
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,370
So, you are in more relationships than me.

476
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:04,490
If somebody hears, they would think I'm a player.

477
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,820
Kang Joon...

478
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,240
You are a player.

479
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,530
I'm going. Relax.

480
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,950
Let's go.

481
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,940
Sara?

482
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,390
Were you waiting for me? The door was open.

483
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,390
Leave.

484
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,410
Sara...

485
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,360
I said leave.

486
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,690
Once is okay, but twice won't do.

487
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:35,120
Did you not hear what I said?

488
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,380
Leave!

489
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,080
What are you doing?

490
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,350
Good, I'll never look for you again.

491
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:53,920
This is the end.

492
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,180
Chae Yeon, where are you?

493
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,120
Today, be with me.

494
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,310
Why did I...

495
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:10,700
never suspect him?

496
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:20,990
On the day I died, I met my husband.

497
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:30,170
You are going to meet the reporters?

498
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,040
Yes, I'm going to tell them everything.

499
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,500
I'm going to tell people that you are
cheating on me with Gyo Chae Yeon.

500
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,680
I'm going to tell them that you abandoned your wife!

501
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,400
I can't end it like this.

502
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,550
I need to protect my marriage.

503
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,550
I have to do something!

504
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,410
Stop.

505
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,350
I said stop!

506
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,810
We fought,

507
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,740
and that person followed me.

508
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:53,800
Now that I think about it, there was a car next to me

509
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,300
going at a fast speed.

510
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:05,210
It was my husband. He was planning to kill me.

511
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,210
I'm going to tell everyone.

512
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:43,630
To everyone, I'm going to say that
you are cheating on me with Gyo Chae Yeon.

513
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,690
I'm going to tell them that you abandoned your wife.

514
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,300
I can't end it like this.

515
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,710
I need to protect my marriage.

516
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:18,690
I was blind...

517
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,620
Couldn't hear...

518
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,830
and was mute.

519
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,010
My love...

520
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,420
was too stupid.

521
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,490
You're curious, right?

522
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:22,280
Why I came all the way here.

523
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,930
You...

524
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:43,460
I know you formed an interest in Sara.

525
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,160
But, I was never afraid.

526
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,900
Do you want to know why?

527
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,370
I saw you here on that day.

528
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:20,140
The day your wife died.

529
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,320
I saw you and your wife fight.

530
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,940
You are going to see the reporters?

531
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,690
Yes. I'm going to tell everything.

532
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:45,000
To people, I'm going to say that you are
cheating on me with Gyo Chae Yeon.

533
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,150
I'm going to say that you abandoned your wife.

534
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,620
Stop.

535
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,390
I said to stop right there!

536
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:57,340
I was afraid that she would cause trouble, so

537
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,160
so I followed.

538
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,130
Don't worry,

539
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,800
because I have the same intentions.

540
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:23,340
Do you understand, Kang Joon?

541
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:28,840
We are meant to be together.

542
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:52,920
Help. Please find out the truth
about my daughter's unjust death

543
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:10,130
Please find out the truth about
my daughter's unjust death.

544
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,570
One person protest?

545
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:22,720
Sa Geum Ran's mother is determined.

546
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:33,750
Manager of Strategic Planning, Han Min Hyeok,
would like to see you.

547
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,520
What is the problem?

548
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,770
Kang Joon, it's an emergency.

549
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:51,990
I'm looking for Dong Gyul

550
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:54,300
I'm looking for Dong Gyul.

551
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:59,520
The elder must suspect something.
She's begun to look for her grandson.

552
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,140
I thought that the grandson is dead.

553
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:05,790
She must want to call up a ghost
to give him the Winner Group.

554
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,040
So, she is saying that she can't give it to me.

555
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,240
I had the staff turn away Geum Ran's mother,
but I think she will come back.

556
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,940
- Why now, of all times?
- Let's solve things, one by one.

557
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:40,350
We can just edit our plan.

558
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:43,510
I don't want to be bothered by one person's protest. So...

559
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,700
Let's have our wedding early.

560
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,120
Let's just make it private.

561
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:56,750
Eat some of this.

562
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,400
Ahjumma, you're going to die like this.

563
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:09,230
Since the situation is like this, there is something
that has to be done rather quickly.

564
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:11,240
Chae Yeon is in danger.

565
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,710
I'm going to let Chae Yeon know
the type of person Kang Joon is.

566
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:20,510
I'm going to do it in a way that
protects you and Chae Yeon.

567
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,690
Ji Hoon.

568
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,910
A surprise wedding?

569
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:46,720
How they did know to come here?

570
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,630
It's a mess.

571
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:51,820
Carefully watch if any paparazzi come.

572
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:55,630
See if there are reporters outside.
Make sure you look everywhere.

573
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:58,250
There are bodyguards everywhere!

574
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:01,530
Don't go overboard! Don't lose your pride.

575
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:04,000
Ah, I want to remarry too.

576
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,060
I want to marry at least once!

577
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,280
Hey.

578
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,500
Oh, they're coming.

579
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:13,310
Oh, there they come.

580
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,350
You came! Oh, my!

581
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:28,580
- How pretty.
- Right?

582
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:31,650
- So pretty.
- Congratulations.

583
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:48,360
We're all born innocent at birth.

584
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:53,350
But at some point,

585
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,640
some become evil.

586
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:04,080
Evilness even plagues good people,
turning them into monsters.

587
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:09,600
But I want to believe that, in the end,

588
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,960
the good will win.
