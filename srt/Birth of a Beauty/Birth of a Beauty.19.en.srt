1
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,650
Ajumma, why are you here?

2
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,520
Were you making these rice balls?

3
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,600
Because you were worried about me?

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,060
General Manager Han Min Hyeok sent me, so I came.

5
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,470
It was under the worst conditions,
but Han Tae Hee has accomplished it.

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,400
Sara helped him.

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,880
I want Sara more than anything else.

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,760
The one who dropped me into this crisis
is none other than you, Ajumma.

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,330
I can't believe it. Now we're strangers.

10
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,380
Winner Food was 100% Han Tae Hee's effort!

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,300
You secretly helped Han Tae Hee without my permission.

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,840
I was very offended.

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,710
Hurting Han Tae Hee, you said you didn't do it, right?

14
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,720
Han Min Hyeok did the deed and then framed me for it!

15
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,770
Sara.

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,970
Tae Hee or I will get Winner Group.

17
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,980
And I want you, Sara.

18
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,030
In order to accomplish that, I will do everything I can.

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,080
Let's go.

20
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,750
Episode 19

21
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,710
It's the day when I was elected as
the candidate for CEO/Director of Winner Group.

22
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,470
Yet, all the reporters were only interested in you, Sara.

23
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,320
Today's Board of Directors' Meeting was very gratifying.

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,140
It was all thanks to you, Sara.

25
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,280
Think about it carefully.

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,050
If Han Tae Hee disappeared, who would benefit most?

27
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,670
I have something to ask you.

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,680
Please speak.

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,180
Not long ago Han Tae Hee was hurt terribly.

30
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,420
The person who hurt Han Tae Hee, was it you General Manager?

31
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,740
Why do you suddenly think that?

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,180
Did you do it, General Manager?

33
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,430
Looking at your eyes,

34
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,010
it seems that you're already sure that I did it.

35
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,050
I won't waste your time.

36
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,580
Sara, the image of you making the rice balls for Tae Hee...

37
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,170
This thing called love is a good thing, right?

38
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm jealous.

39
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,670
End things with Han Tae Hee for certain.

40
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,650
Don't secretly help him or meet him without my knowing.

41
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,780
Don't deceive me again

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,070
or make me angry.

43
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,920
What is it?

44
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,430
The PR team has finalized Sara's schedule.

45
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,080
Proceed with it as before.

46
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,040
Our Sara will be sure to actively cooperate.

47
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,230
Chae Yeon. It's me.

48
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,790
Yes, Oppa Tae Hee?

49
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,550
I heard about the talk show. What happened?

50
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,240
I don't want to talk about that with you, Oppa.

51
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,950
I'm sorry, Oppa. If that's what you called
to talk about, I'm hanging up.

52
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,290
Chae Yeon! Where are you? I'll go and meet you.

53
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,900
You knew about Sara having plastic surgery?

54
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,360
Is Sara still that important to you?

55
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,420
Even after what you suffered at the Board of Directors Meeting?

56
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,110
Since when have you known?

57
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,390
It's been a long time.

58
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,410
I knew about it even before I divorced.

59
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,620
Sa Geum Ran's plastic surgery,

60
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,970
I know that you did it because you loved me.

61
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,070
I was very shocked. But I understood it to be an indication
of how much you wanted me, to have done it.

62
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,770
But in the end, Sara betrayed you and went to Han Min Hyeok.

63
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,110
It looks like you'll have Winner Group taken away also!

64
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,320
Winner Group is my problem.

65
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,700
Chae Yeon, there's no reason for you to step forward.

66
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,090
No, it's my problem too.

67
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,790
Do you think you're the only one who has it hard
because of what happened today?

68
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,400
I'm also having a hard time after suffering at Sara's hands.

69
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,090
This matter is also a problem between me and Sara.

70
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,140
Oppa, don't intrude.

71
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,510
You can't. The more we do this,
the more difficulty we'll have, so

72
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,400
let's end it here, Chae Yeon.

73
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,090
For all of us to go our separate ways,
at this point, is the best we can do.

74
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,500
My greetings are late, Grandmother.

75
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,040
At the Board of Directors Meeting this time, I was
elected the CEO/Director candidate of Winner Group.

76
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,870
I can understand how you feel.

77
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,610
I'll apologize for being dishonest with you, Grandmother.

78
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,010
Please understand my shortcomings.

79
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,150
I came because I had one thing to propose.

80
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,190
I will take care of your trial. Instead,

81
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,650
have Tae Hee remove his hands from Winner Group.

82
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,550
I can send you to prison and end Tae Hee like this.

83
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,480
But I don't want to go that far.

84
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,670
After all, aren't we family?

85
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,750
If Tae Hee doesn't come to the company
until the General Shareholders Meeting,

86
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,520
I will understand it as you being willing to see this end.

87
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,880
Please think about it carefully and give me a response.

88
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,610
Thank you for coming, fellow shareholders.

89
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,540
If you look at these materials, you'll be able
to confirm Han Min Hyeok's illegal activities.

90
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,070
General Manager Han Min Hyeok,
it's true that there are some bad rumors. However,

91
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,890
since he's become the official candidate,
chosen by the Board of Directors, there's no way.

92
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,110
It wouldn't be easy to change the result
at the General Shareholders Meeting.

93
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,780
I will meet each of the shareholders
individually and convince them.

94
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,910
It's the secretary from General Manager
Han Min Hyeok's office, again.

95
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,920
Sara continues not to answer her phone.

96
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,040
I think she's planning to not participate
in the businessmen's dinner.

97
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,090
Send a car to Sara's house and bring her yourself.

98
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,070
Yes, General Manager.

99
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,990
Sara's talk show is tomorrow?

100
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,810
I hear that it's to proceed as a live broadcast tomorrow.

101
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,120
Okay. You can leave.

102
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,650
Geum Ran! It's Han Tae Hee!

103
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,420
Doctor? It's me.

104
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,970
Is there something wrong?

105
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,710
I have something to tell you.
It won't take long.

106
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,950
It would be good to meet.

107
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,320
There's nothing wrong, is there?
Has something happened?

108
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,720
What?

109
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,220
No, I understand. Let's meet.

110
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,450
I have something to say to you too.

111
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,760
Doctor.

112
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,240
Why are you looking at me like that?

113
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,590
Sitting across from you like this,

114
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,710
it's the same as before.

115
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,400
But we've now become strangers.

116
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,410
A lot of things have happened.

117
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,630
Doctor, there's nothing wrong, right?

118
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,110
What?

119
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,050
Perhaps, in case there's someone trying to harm you

120
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,230
or following you. I was just wondering if that was the case.

121
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,280
There was the time you were hurt.

122
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,750
I thought that the same kind of thing
could suddenly happen again.

123
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,500
You seem really tense. Are you okay?

124
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,530
I'm okay.

125
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,580
End it with Han Tae Hee for certain.

126
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,080
Don't help him secretly or meet him without my knowing.

127
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,570
Don't deceive me again

128
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,660
or make me angry.

129
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,110
I asked to see you because I had something to say.

130
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,670
Yes. I do, too.

131
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,630
You start.

132
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,550
I...

133
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,940
Please forget me completely.

134
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,070
Even if we meet by coincidence,
pretend not to know me.

135
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,010
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

136
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,310
I'm going to be working regularly with
General Manager Han Min Hyeok.

137
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:42,260
I don't want to show General Manager Han Min Hyeok
that I'm meeting you or talking to you.

138
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,010
I don't want him to misunderstand pointlessly.

139
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,570
Is what Han Min Hyeok thinks so important?

140
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,510
Is it to this degree?

141
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,350
What is it you have to say?

142
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,070
Did you agree to go on the talk show tomorrow?

143
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,500
Yes.

144
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,050
Don't go.

145
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,780
Chae Yeon is thinking about exposing your identity.

146
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,320
The fact that you're Sa Geum Ran,

147
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,040
and that you had plastic surgery, Chae Yeon knows about it.

148
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,150
So don't ever go on the show.

149
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,530
You're

150
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,100
worrying about me?

151
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,540
I expect this to be the last time.

152
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,370
Like you said, I won't even pretend to know you.

153
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,080
For both our sakes.

154
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,970
No, truthfully, my sake.

155
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,770
Geum Ran, General Manager Han Min Hyeok sent a car for you.

156
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,430
The atmosphere was cold when I told them you weren't here.

157
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,600
Are you okay?

158
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,970
Not yet.

159
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,010
What does Han Tae Hee say? Did he ask you
why you did that at the Board Of Directors Meeting?

160
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,810
No. He is actually worried about me.

161
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,190
Even now?

162
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,400
I think we can open with this, right?

163
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,170
Hello.

164
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,820
CEO Han Tae Hee, what brings you here?

165
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,340
The talk show that Sara is to appear on,

166
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,470
is there perhaps any change?

167
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,230
What are you talking about?

168
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,920
I was curious as to whether there was a notice

169
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,740
informing you that Sara couldn't appear.

170
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,090
Oh, it's not a recording, but a live broadcast.
She can't do that.

171
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:33,300
Since this schedule is determined by the PR team, at headquarters,
it's not something that Sara can decide for herself.

172
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,210
Yes.

173
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,060
Han Tae Hee, who searched so dilligenty to find out about me,

174
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,350
you'll have me fall at the General Meeting of Shareholders?

175
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,490
Through emails, phone calls, and meetings,

176
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,740
he's actively making strategic moves.

177
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,180
Where is Sara?

178
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,300
I went to her house, but I didn't meet her.

179
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,170
Han Tae Hee is doing this, but she avoids me?

180
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,460
Then I have to make it so that she can't avoid me.

181
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,410
Tell Lee Kang Joon to come.

182
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,800
Yes.

183
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,960
Oh my word, it's coming to an end.
What are you doing here looking like this?

184
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,630
Kang Joon, what are you thinking to be like this?

185
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,790
Why are you breaking down like this?

186
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,000
Why did you come?

187
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,970
Your father won't be home for a few days, because of training,

188
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,480
so let's go home.

189
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,060
It's more comfortable here.

190
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,100
Kang Joon, you rascal. At this rate, you'll be ruined.

191
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,420
Secretary of the Office of Strategic Planning calling

192
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,850
Sara was a plastic surgery beauty?

193
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,050
Plastic surgery isn't everything.

194
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,430
Look at this.

195
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,070
Sara even deceived us about her identity.

196
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:20,600
It's not that she's only a plastic surgery beauty,
but she's a con artist who has deceived the entire nation.

197
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,720
It's an amazing case.

198
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,740
It seems like the backlash will be huge...

199
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,260
Sara is the Winner Group model.

200
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,040
HBS is an affiliate of Winner Group.

201
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,970
Let's say that there was a tip sent into the program.

202
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,110
Then they won't be able to say anything.

203
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,660
I can appreciate that you're active in this, but

204
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,720
for now, I think I'm going to have to report this to the Chief.

205
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,060
Kang Joon.

206
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,900
Yes.

207
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,990
From now on, for what I'm about to ask you,

208
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,830
don't lie and answer me properly.

209
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,210
What is the relationship between you, Sara,

210
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,060
and Han Tae Hee?

211
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,130
Answer me.

212
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,770
Come in.

213
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,690
Family Relations Certificate for Kim Deok Soon

214
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,270
Gyo Chae Yeon must have said that she

215
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,410
had something to reveal about Sara on the talk show.

216
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,030
Sara's identity is fake and she's a plastic surgery beauty.

217
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,580
What's the situation with the company?

218
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,410
You're going to meet Gyo Chae Yeon?

219
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,520
Tomorrow is the live broadcast.

220
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,100
I also have my own issues, but Han Tae Hee is the problem.

221
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,100
He can't be put in further difficulty because of me.

222
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,760
Calling Gyo Chae Yeon...

223
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,260
Sara, you even called me yourself.

224
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,020
What's the occasion?

225
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,920
Sara is Sa Geum Ran.

226
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,450
Kang Joon, your dead first wife.

227
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,570
You thought she was dead, but she had plastic surgery
and appeared as a different person.

228
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,900
It's something I couldn't even have imagined.

229
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,860
I was played too, General Manager.

230
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,920
What is Gyo Chae Yeon talking about exposing on the talk show?

231
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,350
Since we divorced because of Sara, she feels wronged.

232
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,930
Since she hates her, she's looking for revenge.

233
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,790
Then Han Tae Hee?

234
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,080
He's the very person who arranged for
Sa Geum Ran to have plastic surgery.

235
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,520
The fake identification, the illegal plastic surgery,

236
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,380
it's all Han Tae Hee's work.

237
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,040
It's all what Han Tae Hee did?

238
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,730
Firstly, the talk show is cancelled.

239
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,070
You had better make a move.

240
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,380
With this, let's catch Han Tae Hee.

241
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,470
I thought you wanted to meet because of the talk show,

242
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,130
but you look unconcerned. Aren't you scared?

243
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,820
I'm not afraid. At the very least, I'm not afraid of you.

244
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,370
Will you be able to say that after you have
the entire country pointing fingers at you?

245
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,070
Try pleading, so that I'll cancel the talk show.

246
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,360
I didn't come here for that.

247
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,540
Han Tae Hee is in danger right now.

248
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,450
There's someone targeting him. He could be hurt.

249
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,590
You shouldn't create a situation that
could be disadvantageous to Han Tae Hee right now.

250
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,820
If I am revealed, then things could
become difficult for Han Tae Hee too.

251
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,520
Gyo Chae Yeon, you don't want
Han Tae Hee to be in danger either.

252
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,050
Who do you think you're worrying about right now?

253
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,020
You betrayed Tae Hee Oppa.

254
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:52,440
At this time, I don't care about anything other than making you fall.

255
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,100
Han Tae Hee could be hurt. How can you be like this?

256
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,660
Don't you love Han Tae Hee?

257
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:05,070
Even though I said he's in danger,
you're not at all shocked or concerned.

258
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,720
You were just coveting the heir to the Winner Group.

259
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,380
That was the only reason.

260
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,040
Gyo Chae Yeon? It's me.

261
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,270
Sara's appearance on the talk show tomorrow
has been cancelled.

262
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,500
What do you mean, cancelled?

263
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,550
Who cancelled it?

264
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,830
Who is the higher up?

265
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,390
General Manager Han Min Hyeok?

266
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,450
Han Min Hyeok?

267
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,740
Did you ask Han Min Hyeok to cancel the talk show?

268
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,800
I can't believe it.

269
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,740
Fine, do what you want.

270
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:02,350
I'm going to reveal your identity... in the cruelest way possible.

271
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,350
General Manager Han Min Hyeok

272
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,070
Yes.

273
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,890
This is Han Min Hyeok.
I thought you'd take this call.

274
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,550
What do you mean?

275
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,570
I'm sure you know that the talk show
has been cancelled.

276
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,010
I'll see you in my office tomorrow morning at 9 am...

277
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,170
Sa Geum Ran.

278
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,980
No, we don't have to wait until tomorrow.
Let's meet today.

279
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,970
That's fine. I'm in my office.

280
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,520
Yes.

281
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,730
Starting now, collect evidence of Han Tae Hee's illegal activities.

282
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,730
I won't need to deal with Grandmother after all.

283
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:14,110
With just the information you bring me,
I can chase Han Tae Hee out of Winner Group.

284
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,690
If you do a good job this time,

285
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:22,120
I'll guarantee your reinstatement and your position at HBS.

286
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:31,720
Chae Yeon, this won't do since it's bothering me.
About the talk show...

287
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,510
Don't worry, the talk show was cancelled.

288
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,770
- Why?
- Sara has General Manager Han Min Hyeok on her side.

289
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,980
Han Min Hyeok forced the cancellation.

290
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,050
Did you come because you're scared, Sa Geum Ran?

291
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:09,360
It looks like you've also been caught by Han Min Hyeok.

292
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,380
Do you think you're different from me?

293
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,150
Look here, Sa Geum Ran.

294
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,640
Sa Geum Ran?

295
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,600
Lee Kang Joon also knows that Ajumma is Sa Geum Ran?

296
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,160
Soon, you'll think that it would have been
better to be confronted by me instead.

297
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,330
If you get caught by Han Min Hyeok, you won't be able to run away even if you want to.

298
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,860
You should just look after yourself.

299
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,580
Your concern for me is unwelcome.

300
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,900
Okay.

301
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,770
Ajumma.

302
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,720
I'll get straight to the point.

303
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,660
I'll cover up your story, so stay by my side.

304
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:22,100
You know that I'm Sa Geum Ran and Lee Kang Joon's wife.
What are your intentions?

305
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,610
I'm not asking you to stay forever...

306
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,820
Just for as long as I tell you to.

307
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,940
To me, the most important thing is the fact
that I stole Han Tae Hee's woman.

308
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,500
It's this week's statement.

309
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,080
I don't like to say the same thing twice.

310
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,320
Kang Joon is collecting evidence
of Han Tae Hee's illegal activities.

311
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:59,360
If I expose that, it will be Han Tae Hee's
death sentence as a businessman.

312
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,420
Han Min Hyeok knew also?

313
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,880
And he's using it to threaten you?

314
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,210
Oh, it's really a dilemma.

315
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,790
You can't do anything because
you're worried about Han Tae Hee.

316
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,980
Lee Kang Joon...

317
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,780
And, even Chae Yeon knows that she's Sa Geum Ran.

318
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:43,150
Just how much have you been struggling all this time, Ajumma?

319
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,040
Please forget me completely.

320
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,150
Even if we meet by chance, don't act like you know me.

321
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,310
I don't have anything to say.

322
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,760
When it's over, it's over.
I don't want to see you anymore.

323
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,910
I want to live my own life.

324
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,530
Break up with me.

325
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,060
Ajumma.

326
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,290
Ajumma, nothing's going on with you?

327
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,420
Is there really nothing going on?

328
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,190
There isn't.

329
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,910
Lee Kang Joon knows that you're Sa Geum Ran, doesn't he?

330
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:17,040
When did he find out? Did he threaten you?

331
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,940
No. That didn't happen.

332
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:26,520
Lee Kang Joon, and Chae Yeon too.
They know that you're Sa Geum Ran.

333
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,520
If that's so, then something definitely must have happened.

334
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,470
What could it be?

335
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,580
Also,

336
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,230
is that perhaps one of the reasons we broke up?

337
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,480
I suddenly had that thought.

338
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:02,510
Does Lee Kang Joon have something to do with our break up?

339
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,390
No, he doesn't.

340
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,380
Then does it have something to do
with Chae Yeon and Han Min Hyeok?

341
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,090
No.

342
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:16,010
If you can't tell me the truth, you must have some reason.

343
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,910
Then I'll do what I think is best.

344
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,090
What are you going to do?

345
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,120
I need to know who's harassing you.

346
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,340
- And if you find out?
- I won't leave them alone!

347
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,950
Even after everything you suffered because of me,
you're still worried about me?

348
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,270
Why?

349
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,140
I'll be going first.

350
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,900
Doctor.

351
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,380
Doctor, don't you even resent me?

352
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,940
Don't you regret meeting me?

353
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,690
You're always getting harmed because of me.

354
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:55,420
Aren't you sick and tired enough that you want to leave?

355
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,150
I've never resented you. Not even once.

356
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,960
What I've lost is nothing

357
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,900
compared to my memories of being happy after meeting you.

358
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,740
Although my memories of being happy with my parents were short,

359
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,590
I endured for twenty years on those memories.

360
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:38,880
Happy memories gave me the strength to live on.

361
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:46,060
Now I have precious memories with you.

362
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,600
You're the person who made these memories for me.

363
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,170
How could I regret meeting you...

364
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,140
or resent you?

365
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,570
I'll ask you one thing.

366
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,410
Have you ever resented me?

367
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,450
Have you ever resented me for having you get plastic surgery?

368
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,770
I, who instigated you to live with a false identity...

369
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,210
Haven't you ever blamed me?

370
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,460
Han Min Hyeok

371
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,320
You can answer it.

372
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:11,760
I thought I warned you about what I would do to Han Tae Hee.

373
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,980
I understand.

374
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,340
Are you okay?

375
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,240
I'm okay.

376
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,370
There's something urgent I need to do, so I'll be going first.

377
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,580
Han Tae Hee...

378
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,910
I told you not to meet him.

379
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,140
Don't make me look wretched anymore.

380
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:09,080
I am going to show you that the evidence proving
Han Tae Hee's illegal doings is nothing, in comparison..

381
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,000
Han Tae Hee...

382
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,450
I am going to destroy him.

383
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:33,430
Lee Kang Joon and Chae Yeon know that Ajumma is Sa Geum Ran.

384
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,060
The person who called me knew the truth about Ajumma's identity.

385
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,930
When we broke up,

386
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,980
what did Ajumma say to me?

387
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,040
Let's break up now.

388
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,340
I don't want to get married again.

389
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,520
Team Leader Choi, when I was in the hospital,
did Lee Kang Joon come visit?

390
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,840
No. I never saw him.

391
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Then when we were cooking the rice balls,

392
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,720
do you have the contact information
of the chef we were going to use?

393
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,010
Yes.

394
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,140
Don't make me look wretched any longer.

395
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,060
I am going to show you that the evidence proving
Han Tae Hee's illegal doings is nothing, in comparison.

396
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,740
I'm going to destroy him.

397
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,880
Hello, Reporter Choi.

398
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,890
It is I, Sara.

399
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,210
Ajumma!

400
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,210
Doctor...

401
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,060
How is it that you are you here?

402
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,940
Were you waiting for me?

403
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,240
Yesterday, what you asked me...

404
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,430
When you asked me if I ever regretted or blamed you,

405
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,950
I came to answer that question.

406
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:31,750
Are you still curious about the answer?

407
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,380
You hesitated,

408
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,060
so I thought that you regretted meeting me.

409
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,260
Meeting you, getting plastic surgery.

410
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,240
I never felt resentful about it. Not even once.

411
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:55,110
They were the happiest times of my life.

412
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:03,150
Disappointment, despair, happiness,

413
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,920
We went through it all together.
♫ It's not as if something happened. ♫

414
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,350
I wasn't happy because I became pretty.br>♫ It's not as if something happened. ♫

415
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,820
I was happy because we were together.
♫ It's not that I feel sad. ♫

416
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,860
♫  It hurts without a reason, it feels empty  ♫

417
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:25,150
They say that some memories
give you the strength to live your life.

418
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:28,070
It's the same for me.

419
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:32,480
We may not have ended up together,

420
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,510
but whenever I go through a difficult time,
I will remember the time when we were together.

421
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,460
When you gave me these kinds of memories,

422
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,950
how could I resent you?

423
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:51,500
Rather, I'm grateful that I met you.
♫ I couldn't imagine
that it would be this hard. ♫

424
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,100
I came to tell you this.
♫  I must have liked you a lot.  ♫

425
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,640
♫  I must have ♫

426
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,850
I'll go now.
♫ loved you a lot. ♫

427
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:08,740
♫  I long for you more than you can imagine  ♫

428
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,750
Ajumma!
♫  Your face, the way you talk, everything.  ♫

429
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,950
Yes?

430
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,990
Thank you for answering.
♫  Don't telll me even if you feel like me.♫

431
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:27,210
♫  Don't tell me ff you are hurting like me,  ♫

432
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:33,590
♫  I want to run and to be embraced by you  ♫

433
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:38,440
♫  Without you, I am not even anything,  ♫

434
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,320
♫  Because I love you  ♫

435
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,420
We need to collect evidence that Han Tae Hee
hid the fact that Sa Geum Ran got plastic surgery

436
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,600
and stole Kim Deok Soon's identity, illegally.

437
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,250
Find the real Kim Deok Soon.

438
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,650
If we have that woman, things will become easier.

439
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,500
I got it.

440
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,860
Sa Geum Ran.

441
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,330
I will show you that I'm different from you.

442
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,480
It will become hard for me,

443
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,140
but for you and Gyo Chae Yeon, it will be Hell from now on.

444
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,830
What are you saying?

445
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,900
You will find out soon.

446
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,620
Gyeong Joo, thank you.

447
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:56,550
No matter how I look, thank you for treating me the same.

448
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,980
That's what a friend is, you wench.

449
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,510
But are you going somewhere?
Why? Did something happen?

450
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,940
For the time being, please take care of my mother.

451
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,020
What happened?

452
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,340
I know that we asked you for the rice ball dish for Winner Food.

453
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,020
But I was wondering how it changed to Sara.

454
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,640
That...

455
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,700
You can tell me comfortably.

456
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,320
Is it General Manager Han Min Hyeok's doing?

457
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,530
General Manager Han Min Hyeok?
Who is that person?

458
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:41,460
Then why was it changed to Sara?

459
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,580
Sara wanted to do it.

460
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,030
Honestly, she wanted this to be a secret.

461
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:52,120
General Manager Han Min Hyeok didn't make her do it?

462
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,250
Doctor, nothing happened to you, right?

463
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,300
By any chance, no one is trying to hurt you

464
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,880
or following you or anything like that, right?

465
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,060
Ajumma is definitely being chased.

466
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,040
Who is she being chased by?

467
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:32,360
What is Geum Ran planning on doing?

468
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,010
How can she leave so suddenly?

469
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,600
There is definitely something up.

470
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,430
Hello. I am Sara.

471
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:01,560
I came here today because I have to tell you something.

472
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,840
Reporter Choi Byung Ho
Prime Hotel at 11 o'clock

473
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,050
Is this the car that you saw?

474
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,810
Yes, that's correct.

475
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,800
Can you magnify the license plate?

476
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,950
Yes.

477
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,040
Who drove this recklessly?

478
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,150
Where is President Han Tae Hee's office?

479
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,480
Excuse me, is Han Tae Hee here?
I have to see him right now!

480
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,770
What happened?

481
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:50,010
I have to tell him something about Sara. It's urgent!

482
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,670
The license plate is 1385.

483
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:57,520
Who is the owner of the car?
You can check that, right?

484
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,020
Yes.

485
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,040
Searching...

486
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:12,280
The owner of the car is General Manager Han Min Hyeok.

487
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,130
You will think that it's better to be hurt by me.

488
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:23,290
If you get caught by Han Min Hyeok,
even if you want to escape, you won't be able to.

489
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:27,370
I'm going to start working with General Manager
of Strategic Planning, Han Min Hyeok.

490
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,110
You were harmed before.

491
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:35,400
I suddenly thought that those things could happen again.

492
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,790
Ajumma wasn't on Han Min Hyeok's side.

493
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:42,720
She was threatened by him as well.

494
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,670
Yes, I got it.

495
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,290
Han Tae Hee!

496
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,120
Geum Ran was being threatened.

497
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,610
By General Manager Han Min Hyeok.

498
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,660
It started with Lee Kang Joon.

499
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,520
When you were hurt, Lee Kang Joon
came to the hospital and threatened her.

500
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,520
And, before the Board of Directors Meeting, even
General Manager Han Min Hyeok pressured Geum Ran.

501
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,690
Geum Ran was worried that
you would be harmed because of her.

502
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,180
She is holding a press conference. I'm worried

503
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,510
that she will reveal everything and give up on her life as Sara.

504
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,570
What is the press conference about?

505
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,600
It isn't about giving up her life.

506
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,600
Sara

507
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,760
is trying to protect me.

508
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,770
Sara is having a press conference?

509
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:07,730
Yes. It's starting at 11 o'clock.

510
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,020
Anyway, I'll see you later.

511
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:21,050
It's me. Did you hear about Sa Geum Ran's press conference?

512
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,600
Press conference? What kind of press conference?

513
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,250
What is it about?

514
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,080
I do not know what it is going to be about.

515
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,180
- Where is it?
- It's at Prime Hotel.

516
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,770
Can you guess what Sara is going to say?

517
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,140
Did something happen to her recently?

518
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,730
Tell me everything you know!

519
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,440
Perhaps,

520
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,290
would she talk about her past?

521
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,910
Stay still! I'm thinking right now.

522
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:01,120
I can't do this because I'm nervous. Call Sara.

523
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,580
For now, stop her!

524
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,550
Ajumma

525
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,650
Doctor.

526
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:35,450
Ajumma! You can't do a press conference. Stop.

527
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,480
Until I get there, wait.

528
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,950
How did you find out?

529
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,810
I found out everything.

530
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:47,440
I know that Han Min Hyeok used you, so stop there.

531
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,070
Do as I say.

532
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,660
No,

533
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,370
I thought that I haven't done anything for you.

534
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,980
So I was always sorry.

535
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:05,100
This is the last present that I can give to you.

536
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,710
It's time.

537
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,120
Doctor, I'll hang up now.

538
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,150
Ajumma, Ajumma!

539
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,980
After meeting you,

540
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,060
I was happy that I could love someone again.

541
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,710
Now, you should be completely free from me.

542
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:50,950
♫ Go. I have nothing else to hear  ♫

543
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:55,770
Celebrity Sara's press conference
♫ I don't want a woman like you.  ♫

544
00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:00,270
♫  I shouted for you to leave,  ♫

545
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,890
♫  Because I resented you,  ♫

546
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:06,950
Hello. I'm Sara.♫  who said that we should stop,  ♫

547
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,580
I came here today to tell you something.
♫  Because it was more unfair ♫

548
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:16,640
♫  You said it as if it were easy ♫

549
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,510
♫  As if it's not a big deal, ♫

550
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:26,050
I was originally a heavy person who weighed over 100 kilograms.
♫  It seems you could just break up. ♫

551
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,860
♫  Did I judge you wrong? ♫

552
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:35,260
And, I was a regular housewife
who had been married for eight years.
♫ It's as if you were someone else.  ♫

553
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,660
Because I wanted to become pretty,
♫  It was a lie.  ♫

554
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,510
And because I wanted to live as another person,
♫  Only I didn't know. ♫

555
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:46,650
I got plastic surgery.
♫  I thought we would last forever. ♫

556
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:52,660
The names Sara and Kim Deok Soon are fake.br>♫  Only I didn't know. I thought we would be happy.  ♫

557
00:49:52,660 --> 00:50:00,910
♫  I love you, the words I can't say to you now  ♫

558
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:08,010
♫  I didn't know that this is how a goodbye feels like  ♫

559
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:14,410
I thought that I would be
happy and successful if I became pretty,

560
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,500
but I've learned now that it isn't everything.

561
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:23,680
What I needed to find was not a pretty external appearance,

562
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,430
but my true self.

563
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,700
I am now revealing everything

564
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,320
and trying to find myself.

565
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,250
All of this started from my greed,

566
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,670
and was all planned by me.

567
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,190
I did wrong. Please forgive me.

568
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:46,840
Then what is your real name?

569
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,080
What is your reason for revealing everything?

570
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,250
What is your real age?

571
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,800
What's the reason you're revealing it now?

572
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,700
Why are you revealing the truth now?

573
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,430
Did you really plan this alone?

574
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:56,610
Tell me how you feel.

575
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,720
I have told you everything I can up to this point.

576
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,850
Sara! Sara!

577
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,930
Sara!

578
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:23,660
Sara!

579
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,070
Sara! What is your real name?

580
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:27,630
Sara!

581
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,030
Get her.

582
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,630
Yes.

583
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,740
Wait a moment, Sara!
What is your reason for revealing the truth?

584
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,770
Did you get plastic surgery to become a celebrity?

585
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:02,000
Then what is going to happen to you becoming a model?
Tell us, Sara!

586
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,020
Sara! Tell us your real name!

587
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,960
The person you are trying to reach...

588
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,770
She risked her life to start anew, and now

589
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,740
she confessed everything to protect Han Tae Hee?

590
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,840
Send someone to Sara's house.

591
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,090
Her family will know where she went.

592
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,630
Bring her here right now.

593
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,120
Yes.

594
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,270
Hello. I'm Sara.
 A shocking confession by Sara

595
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:16,070
Sa Geum Ran...

596
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,650
Are you crazy?

597
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:22,370
I came here

598
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:25,260
today to tell you something.

599
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,130
Sa Geum Ran...

600
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,250
I was originally a heavy person who weighed over 100 kilograms.
Sara got plastic surgery?!

601
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,930
A heavy person who weighed over 100 kilograms?

602
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,730
I was a regular housewife who had been married for eight years.

603
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:41,190
Housewife?

604
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,710
Because I wanted to become pretty,

605
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:47,850
Don't you have goosebumps?

606
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,350
That's right.

607
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,400
Why does it feel so cold?

608
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,540
Me too.

609
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,990
You too?

610
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,130
You are having the same thoughts as me?

611
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,260
Sara is Geum Ran?

612
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,360
Sara...

613
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,080
Is the Pig Sister-in-law?

614
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,850
Oh my!

615
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,500
Oh my!

616
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,100
Mom! Mom, mom!

617
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,680
- Daebak! Something freaky happened!
- What is it?

618
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,930
Right now, our backs have goosebumps.

619
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,110
Is it about Kang Joon?

620
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:26,530
It's not about Kang Joon.

621
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,320
-It's about Sara.
- Sara?

622
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,760
Sara? What about her?

623
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,010
I think Sara is Geum Ran!

624
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,170
Ajumma!

625
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,680
Where is Sara?

626
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,540
She can't come here because of the reporters.

627
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,150
Did she call?

628
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:15,010
I think she prepared for this.
She said that she isn't going to come back for a while.

629
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:19,540
There are many people who are talking badly about her
on the Internet, saying she tricked them.

630
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:23,150
If you see her, tell her not to come home.

631
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:26,330
The reporters are just going to bother Geum Ran.

632
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:30,200
I also think that, until everything is revealed,
Geum Ran shouldn't appear publicly.

633
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,200
Where are you, Ajumma?

634
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,010
I know very well about you, Ajumma.

635
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,690
Where would be a place you'd go?

636
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,610
A place where Ajumma would go.

637
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,420
Ajumma!

638
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:17,970
Ajumma, are you here?

639
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,140
Ajumma.

640
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,580
Ajumma!

641
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:49,150
It says that Sara was originally a full-time housewife.

642
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:52,330
What would her situation have been
that she had plastic surgery?

643
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:55,440
Who is her husband? What is Sara's original name?

644
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,800
I don't know.

645
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,570
Don't you think she must have an incredible story?

646
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:01,910
Look at this.

647
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,880
Sara is Geum Ran?

648
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,670
Is that true?

649
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:15,160
Oh my.

650
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,200
I was just thinking that it can't be,

651
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,780
Geum Ran was alive?

652
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,710
She was alive.

653
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:25,530
She was getting her revenge as Sara.

654
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,580
S-s-so

655
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:31,130
Sara frequented our house often,

656
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,250
and she treated me well,

657
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,260
and she divided you two...

658
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,280
Oh my word, it's so horrible.

659
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,640
She was Geum Ran?

660
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,390
Oh my.

661
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:49,270
All this time that Sara watched us,
how abominable must she have found us?

662
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:53,740
As soon as Geum Ran died,
we let Chae Yeon in and were even delighted.

663
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,200
How awful!

664
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,790
How awful! Oh my. How can there be something like this?

665
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,550
Aigoo. What should we do?

666
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,990
If your father finds out, he will faint!

667
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,410
The more serious problem is from now on.

668
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:12,180
What now? What else is there?

669
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,420
If she lets people know that I'm her husband,
it will be an even bigger problem.

670
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,280
If she even reveals the fact that I tried to kill Sa Geum Ran,

671
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,920
whether I'm reinstated or not, I'll have to go to prison.

672
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:34,100
Who is Sara's husband?

673
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:37,060
Her previous circumstances as a housewife . . .

674
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,950
It is I.

675
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:51,670
If we leave it like this, we're both done for. Let's meet.

676
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,040
Who is it?

677
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,690
Chae Yeon.

678
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,790
Chae Yeon? Why?

679
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,280
The day I killed Sa Geum Ran,

680
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,860
Chae Yeon also saw it all.

681
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,650
Aigoo.

682
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,360
Did Sa Geum Ran contact you?

683
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,920
Not at all. You?

684
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,540
Where in the world did she go?

685
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:26,570
I think she planned to reveal it all and hide...

686
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,470
What's the reason for doing the press conference?

687
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:33,990
Even at the time of the talk show she wasn't so self-confident.

688
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:37,500
During that time, did something happen?

689
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,860
General Manager Han Min Hyeok ordered me, so

690
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,720
I was gathering all the evidence of Han Tae Hee's illegal activities.

691
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,500
Then,

692
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:50,030
she purposefully had a press conference to save Oppa Tae Hee?

693
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,850
Sara wasn't finished with Oppa Tae Hee?

694
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,340
What's the reason for not revealing it all?

695
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:04,500
What is the reason that she didn't say your name and mine?

696
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,370
She said that

697
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:10,110
you and I will be in hell.

698
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:18,460
It's Sara.

699
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,170
Answer it.

700
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:26,180
It's me.

701
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:30,180
Now it's worked out that you don't even
have to put yourself out and do the talk show.

702
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,590
What are you trying to do?

703
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:33,810
You had hoped that I'd lose it all.

704
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:37,790
Fine. In the end, I did lose everything.

705
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:42,700
But, I also gain the chance to punish you both.

706
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:49,900
My story will steadily unravel from now on.

707
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:03,070
In-law, please forgive me just this once.

708
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:09,100
If Geum Ran tells the truth, our Kang Joon will die.

709
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:14,800
Please. Please, that matter...

710
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:17,940
Please make sure she doesn't say it, in-law.

711
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,820
That matter.

712
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,380
Yes, In-law?

713
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:28,230
Since the words that he killed Geum Ran
can't even come out of your mouth,

714
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:33,160
it seems like you do know that what a bad thing
that bastard, Lee Kang Joon, did?

715
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,560
I have done wrong, In-law.

716
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,910
I beg of you. Please, I beg of you.

717
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:42,890
Please forgive me just this once, In-law.

718
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:44,810
Having water thrown in my face,

719
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:48,350
being trapped at the wedding hall wasn't enough, but Lee Kang Joon, that bastard,

720
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:52,200
forcefully had me admitted to a Psychiatric Hospital.

721
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:56,240
He did all the bad things he possibly could and now

722
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,130
you're asking for him to be saved?

723
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:00,030
Yes, In-law.

724
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:03,050
Even if I had ten mouths, I have nothing to say.

725
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:06,500
Where is Geum Ran? I'll find Geum Ran and

726
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,820
I'll beg. I'll beg until my hands become feet, please In-law?

727
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,500
Do away with that word In-law!

728
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:19,510
I can't even reach Geum Ran right now. But even
if I could contact her, I wouldn't tell her to forgive you all.

729
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:25,200
Of course, you must pay the price for your sins.

730
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,180
Ahjumma, there are reporters waiting in front of the house.
Don't come home.

731
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,840
If you let me know where you are, I'll go and pick you up.

732
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:49,450
Ajumma, are you okay?

733
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,460
Don't worry, Doctor.

734
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,100
Now I've returned to the original me.

735
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,900
I don't know how long it's been since I was so relaxed.

736
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,970
Where did you go, Ajumma?

737
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,010
There should definitely be a hint as to where you went.

738
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:36,080
Meeting you

739
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:40,360
was the happiest time in my life.

740
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:44,690
Whenever I face a difficult moment I will remember that time.

741
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,520
When it's difficult

742
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,520
you will remember the moments when you were most happy.

743
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:57,850
The moment when Ajumma was the most happy.

744
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:10,040
♫  I hesitated for a long time and sighed endlessly.  ♫

745
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:17,160
♫ I hate myself for not being able to say anything and just turned away.  ♫

746
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:24,850
♫ How can I forget you? How can I erase you?  ♫

747
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:31,970
Ajumma! Ajumma!
♫  I can't even stand a single moment without you. ♫

748
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:35,700
Ajumma!
♫ My heart hurts so much. ♫

749
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:40,640
Ajumma!
♫  I can't let you go like this. ♫

750
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:46,540
Ajumma!
♫ I'll wait until always. Even if it hurts, it's okay. ♫

751
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,630
♫ I'm okay. ♫

752
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:19,180
Ajumma!

753
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,900
In the end, you'll meet the person you're supposed to meet.

754
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:45,400
We left each other like we won't return,

755
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,200
but ultimately. we're looking at each other again like this.
