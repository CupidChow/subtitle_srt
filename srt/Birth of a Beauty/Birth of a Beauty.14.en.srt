00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,920
Episode 14
In this place,

2
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,640
there are people whom I love.

3
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,500
Those people are the reason that I want to live.

4
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,960
By pouring in all my heart,

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,500
I want to give it to people whom I love.

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,700
Thank you for keeping and protecting my daughter.

7
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,920
I am more thankful toward your daughter.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Because of your daughter,
I became a man with everything.

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,780
Let's dance: Just the two of us.

10
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,820
What is going on here, Doctor?

11
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,200
You're Winner Food . . .

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,010
CEO?

13
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,570
Last night, I told you I was the one.

14
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,160
I said, in a special place with a special speech,

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,610
I was going to dance with you.

16
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,940
Ajumma.

17
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,790
Marry me.

18
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,050
What?

19
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:42,300
♫  I must have liked it a lot  ♫

20
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,820
♫  I must have loved you a lot  ♫

21
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,790
♫  Without any thought  ♫

22
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,530
Marry me.

23
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,740
♫  Your face, your speech, everything  ♫

24
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,080
Marry you?

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,560
Yes, marry me.

26
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,180
Marriage?

27
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,500
So, you are saying you and I should marry, right?

28
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,610
♫  I want to be hugged by you  ♫

29
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,920
It's okay. You don't have to answer me immediately.

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,460
♫  Because I love you  ♫

31
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,140
I'll wait for your answer.

32
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,870
How do they know each other, and
what is the relationship between the two?

33
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,050
Winner Food is launching

34
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,230
Sara's food item as a new product.

35
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,550
Marriage?

36
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,290
Me... marry?

37
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,750
Marry?

38
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,650
You with Tae Hee oppa?

39
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,180
You are not worthy enough to marry Tae Hee oppa.

40
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,410
Why are you the one determining my worth?

41
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,310
I'm Tae Hee's family.

42
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,800
I'm telling you as a younger sister.

43
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,370
Sara,

44
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,060
you can't.

45
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,340
Oh, younger sister.

46
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,500
You were a nuisance younger sister
who asked for tuition money to study abroad.

47
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,340
Then, you threw yourself at him, while still a married
woman, and now you're his younger sister again?

48
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,310
You're not a doll that changes clothes.

49
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,470
You are busy.

50
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,520
What?

51
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,450
There is no reason for me to feel less worthy
than you; a human being without conscience.

52
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,300
You have no right to complain
about whatever my worth is.

53
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,740
Can you handle it?

54
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,280
Tae Hee is the successor of Winner Group.

55
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,720
He is a person who will lead the whole Winner Group.

56
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,440
Give up on Tae Hee.

57
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,220
You know that

58
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,120
Winner Group and Tae Hee cannot be yours.

59
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,620
You can't even take care of yourself.

60
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,120
Why are you worrying about me?

61
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,520
Don't you know that what you should worry about is

62
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,400
whether you are going to divorce
Lee Kang Joon or live with him?

63
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,300
You are forever Sa Geum Ran,
Lee Kang Joon's wife, Sa Geum Ran.

64
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,340
You cannot marry anyone legally

65
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,780
because you are already married. Fine then.

66
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,340
I will make your husband, Lee Kang Joon, move.

67
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,540
CEO,

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,160
what about the ring?

69
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,850
It's a hidden card. The fun of
revealing things one by one.

70
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,310
This is still a pre-release.

71
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,710
Han Tae Hee!

72
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,290
Aigoo, you came!

73
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,870
Today is a good day,
so let's not crumple our faces.

74
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,920
I want to congratulate you, but I'm worried.

75
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,070
Winner Food is currently waiting for
adjudication of bankruptcy.

76
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,790
You can take the CEO position for now,

77
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,680
but you can't make decisions that
countradict Winner Group Headquarters.

78
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,960
I'm trying to save Winner Food.

79
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,200
It's not a decision that contradicts the group's headquarters.

80
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,780
Where is this confidence coming from?

81
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,280
What if you end up worse than where you started,
by jumping in so recklessly?

82
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,780
I already went to the bottom when I was ten years old.

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,340
When one has nothing to lose,
one is not afraid of anything.

84
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,230
You have nothing to lose?

85
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,930
Aigoo!

86
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,310
I have guests.

87
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,460
Find out what Han Tae Hee is preparing
to do with Winner Food.

88
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,040
Don't hesitate to use any means or method

89
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,260
to stop the selling of the new product.

90
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,840
Sara!

91
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,730
You also came here?

92
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,780
- My mother's first cooking class is tomorrow, right?
- Yes.

93
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,800
The chef already told me the address.
I will visit her tomorrow.

94
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,340
I will send a car over.

95
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,420
My mother likes you.

96
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,580
He's cool. He's handsome, and single.

97
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,480
He has everything!

98
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,180
- I heard that he has a good personality.
- He looks nice.

99
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,620
Should I talk to him?

100
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,500
Go say hi!

101
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,840
Here, doesn't it look good?

102
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,900
Answer it by saying yes!

103
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,300
Yes!

104
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,320
Just think that you are practicing the response of the proposal.

105
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,480
Yes! Yes!

106
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,260
No, I don't want to eat it.

107
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,840
Don't you see that I'm sucking my stomach in?

108
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,140
If I eat, my dress will burst.

109
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,420
But Doctor, I have something to ask.

110
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,940
What happened?

111
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,900
The thing with the CEO and the Winner Group.

112
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,560
You aren't saying it because you know it for sure, right?

113
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,540
It was exaggerated, right?

114
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,620
I will explain it to you at home.

115
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,800
So say yes!

116
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,740
Practice saying yes!

117
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,800
Yes!

118
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,300
Okay.

119
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,840
Drink this.

120
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,920
Say yes first.

121
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,720
Is it that hard? Yes!

122
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,140
Are you just going to stand still?

123
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,480
The test said that the person who wrote the letter is Sa Geum Ran.

124
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,200
In the end, Sa Geum Ran is alive.

125
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,940
Now, you should look for her in earnest.

126
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,540
Where is Sa Geum Ran?

127
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,880
I don't know yet.

128
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,080
I just guessed.

129
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,900
I was wondering if she's alive.

130
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,950
I think that Sa Geum Ran is close to us.

131
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,380
If we think about all the incidents that happened,

132
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,590
she is definitely watching us from somewhere.

133
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,320
When Kang Joon finds you,

134
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,540
something entertaining will happen.

135
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,530
You danced well, Ajumma.

136
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,610
Is this really your first time?

137
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,440
Did you possibly learn to dance
while pretending to be out shopping?

138
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,580
How about you? Are you from a player background?

139
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,240
How you pushed and pulled during the dance
proved that you are totally a professional.

140
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,820
People were watching you.

141
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,140
Especially girls.

142
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,460
Don't be jealous.

143
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,900
No matter how captivated the women are by me,
the woman that I proposed to

144
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,200
is Ajumma. You.

145
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:45,200
The first night of our newlywed life in this house.

146
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:58,300
♫  All that I have is all that you've given me,  ♫

147
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:06,030
♫  Did you never worry that I've come to depend on you?  ♫

148
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,530
♫  I gave you all the love I have in me,  ♫

149
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:22,650
♫  Now I find delight and I can't believe it's true,. ♫

150
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:28,550
♫  Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street.  ♫

151
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,360
♫  I see you across the street.  ♫

152
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:38,090
♫  I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on.  ♫

153
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:45,140
♫  You talk of love but you don't know how it feels.  ♫

154
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,030
Aish, that's very sweet.

155
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,780
Oh, I like it so much.

156
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,300
Marriage?

157
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,710
Is that kind of happiness

158
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,900
possible for me?

159
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,760
Ajumma! Let's drink some beer.

160
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,850
I prepared matching couple T-shirts.

161
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,840
Couple T-shirts?

162
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,360
Okay, I'm coming.

163
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,400
Why do you smile when we make eye contact?

164
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,130
No, this time I smiled while looking at your cheek.

165
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:44,390
Your cheeks are getting really red.
You're not even a monkey's bottom.

166
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,740
Doctor, your cheeks, for that matter, are a forest fire.

167
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,530
Oh, is that true?

168
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,360
- Since we drank alcohol, should we play the truth game?
- No.

169
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,890
When we've drunk alcohol, it's 'Talk Down Time'.

170
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,740
Talk Down Time?

171
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,390
Am I not the one who loses out a bit
with Talk Down Time?

172
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,800
Alright. I'll do it since today is a good day.

173
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,280
Hey, you punk!

174
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,520
- What?
- Why are you talking informally?

175
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,760
How old are you?

176
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,370
I . . .

177
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,700
was born in 1985.

178
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,580
I was born in 1982, you punk!

179
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,820
When you were in your fourth year of
elementary school, I was in already in middle school.

180
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,520
If I had married a little earlier, I'd
have a son your age, you punk!

181
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,760
No, that's... our good relationship...

182
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,010
How old am I?

183
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,700
- Miss Sara...
- Miss?

184
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,330
- Ms. Sara...
- Ms?

185
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,330
- Noona.
- Of course. You should call me noona.

186
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,110
No, but ... Noona ...

187
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,350
What are we even doing?

188
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,080
Do you have any complaints? If you do, just tell me.

189
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,260
Why did you not tell me?

190
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,590
Winner Food CEO/Director,
the talk regarding Winner Group,

191
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,330
Why didn't you tell me?

192
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,570
I felt so bewildered. Just who are you?

193
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,040
A plastic surgeon? The God of Restaurants?

194
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,560
Winner Group's successor?

195
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,270
I'll explain it. You already know more
about me than anyone.

196
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,080
I only didn't tell you about my parents' jobs.

197
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,200
I was going to explain everything about
that to you today anyway.

198
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,220
My grandmother, father,

199
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,610
mother, and then me.

200
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,270
Until I was ten years old, I lived at the
main house of Winner Group with them.

201
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,690
At the time of the accident, Father had me flee.

202
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,360
Only my life was saved.

203
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,540
From then on, I lived in secrecy.

204
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,840
After that, you ended up living in
Gyo Chae Yeon's house.

205
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:27,100
There's nothing that will change, Ajumma.
The Winner Group talk is talk about my parents.

206
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,880
Lean on my shoulder.

207
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,970
Like this.

208
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,580
From now on, I will gain a lot of popularity.

209
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,570
If I become famous, you will have
the fun of having me as yours.

210
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:02,030
So, you should have a lot of strength
in your shoulders and be bold.

211
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,620
Also, I would like it if you answer

212
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,800
"yes" to my proposal.

213
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:22,800
Why am I slowly becoming apprehensive?

214
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:31,910
Why is it so sad to be cleaning in Winter?

215
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,430
What are you eating?

216
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,790
Diet pills.

217
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,070
Sara takes these pills, so

218
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,570
I thought I could get skinnier if I took these too.

219
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,060
Is Sara here?

220
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,690
Oh my, what are you doing here, In-law?

221
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,670
You came here to meet Sara? Why?

222
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,720
The restaurant opens at eleven.

223
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,570
What is the matter?

224
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,350
I'll tell you simply.

225
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,240
I want you to reject Tae Hee's proposal.

226
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,430
You know best that you are responsible for

227
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,680
talk of a divorce between
Chae Yeon and Brother-in-law.

228
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,440
But now, you'll become Hyung Tae Hee's wife?

229
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,310
Is it because of Hyung Tae Hee's background?

230
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,000
Rather than Brother-in-law,
who is just the CEO of HBS,

231
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,610
does the successor of Winner Group look better?

232
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,740
Just because of your ambition,
please don't let Hyung Tae Hee lose his family.

233
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:54,940
Gyo Ji Hoon, the real expert at exchanging men
isn't me, but Gyo Chae Yeon.

234
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,760
You should ask the person directly involved
for the reason of the divorce.

235
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,540
Everyone thinks that what they see is everything.

236
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,380
But that's not everything,

237
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,440
I also didn't know that, so I was fooled by a man

238
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,750
for a very long time.

239
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,940
Gyo Ji Hoon, what you know isn't everything.

240
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,980
Please go back.

241
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,770
Tae Hee proposed to Sara?

242
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,280
Han Tae Hee is the successor to Winner Group?

243
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,620
Tada.

244
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,940
At important times, we can't let you lose your dignity.

245
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,610
Normally we'll hide this. But, when you want to see it,
we can take it out, like this, and look at it.

246
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,690
How is it?

247
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,120
Did you hear from Sara about the proposal, Sir?

248
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,920
"Yes?"

249
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,340
By any chance, did she say, "No"?

250
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,050
Aiyoo, so negative.

251
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,880
It's "yes," but she hasn't answered yet.

252
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,520
Oh, so you didn't get a reply.

253
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,950
Why is she like that?

254
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,270
Stay here. I'm going to go figure out the atmosphere and return.

255
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,810
You came, Producer?

256
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:46,660
I brought some ingredients. During the taping, the
ingredients become wilted, so I brought a large quantity.

257
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,460
I heard you danced with Han Tae Hee yesterday.

258
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,040
I heard that the picture 'killed'. It is all that
the entire female staff are talking about all day.

259
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,740
Are you guys dating?

260
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,610
Is he your fiancé?

261
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,340
A magazine interview request came in.
Because of you, I'm busy.

262
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:14,360
But if you, perhaps, become the Winner Group Madam,
I'm going to have future support, so I have to endure it.

263
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,340
Work hard.

264
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,350
Tae Hee is the successor for Winner Group.

265
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,940
Are you confident you can handle it?

266
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,600
Ajumma, you're alone.

267
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,990
What do you think about 'Beer Time' like yesterday?

268
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,610
A time for us to get to know one another.
Today, even the Truth Game.

269
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,850
I have to go be the cooking instructor
for the sponsor of the 'Birth of a Chef' program.

270
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,200
I think I'll be a bit late today.

271
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,450
Oh, is that so?

272
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,410
I'm kind of disappointed.

273
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,290
I'm not the only one who is disappointed, right?

274
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,990
Instead of smiling brightly like this,
her face was depressed?

275
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,790
Perhaps... She won't say, "no," will she?

276
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,380
Why do you keep saying "no" so negatively?

277
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,630
Are you hoping for a "no?"

278
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,640
It's not that!

279
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,270
From now on, all words that start with "no"
are absolutely forbidden.

280
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,680
Note, node, nose, north, they're all not okay.

281
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,730
Yes, I understand!

282
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:54,310
Hey, but what if she really says "no?"

283
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,290
Who can say...

284
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,120
Hey, by chance...?! It's not...! It's not!

285
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
Of course!

286
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,760
Right now, even if Sara's answer is "no,"

287
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,480
change it to "yes" with your magic.

288
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,220
Isn't that your style?

289
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,170
Change a "no" to a "yes."

290
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,640
Tae Hee proposed to Sara?

291
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,190
Yes, Grandmother.

292
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:32,490
Sara has such complicated man issues,
but I'm worried for Tae Hee who can't see it.

293
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,010
He doesn't even try to listen to the
words of his younger sister, me.

294
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,790
Elder.

295
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,420
Ah, Miss Gyo Chae Yeon.

296
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,720
You're here?

297
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,220
Would it be possible for me to go out?

298
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,880
It's because I want to meet Tae Hee.

299
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,470
I'll try to discuss it with the lawyer tonight. The courts
seem to be quiet, so I think it might be all right.

300
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,980
All right.

301
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,540
Is that right?!? He proposed?!?

302
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,900
That's right.

303
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,250
Why Kang Joon. Do you need something?

304
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,440
I wanted a drink of water.

305
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,660
Mom will take care of it for you.

306
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,420
Hey, Han Tae Hee proposed to Sara!
Did you know that would happen?

307
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,670
Sara must have been busy dating, so she hasn't been
around our house. I'm a bit disappointed.

308
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:25,630
But then, Sara must have been 'burned' badly
by a man in the past.

309
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,690
She said she was fooled for a long time by a man, right?

310
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,980
He must have been some bastard. Her face was
full of resentment when she talked about him.

311
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,520
Since she had so much pain, resentment must have filled her up.

312
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,140
It's such a waste for her to go to someone else.
Instead of Chae Yeon,

313
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,770
I had hoped for a daughter-in-law like Sara to come in.

314
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,220
Dang.

315
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,970
For a long time, she was fooled by a man?

316
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,910
Come in, Sara.

317
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,510
She is the new cooking instructor. Be sure that
you serve her well, so that she's not uncomfortable.

318
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,230
Hello, my name is Sara.

319
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,040
I'll give you a tour of the kitchen.

320
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,440
Mother!

321
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,460
Oh, you're here!

322
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,980
Sara, you've come?

323
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,170
Your household is filthy rich.

324
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,540
Cooking Lesson Calendar

325
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,710
You made all the menu items around Korean food.

326
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,690
Since I heard you are curious about serving the guests,
I centered the menu around Korean food.

327
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,420
I'll separately teach you Italian food, as special dishes .

328
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,260
You don't have to escort me all the way out. This is fine.

329
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,300
Being together during this time, it was good for me.

330
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,140
There's something I want to ask you.

331
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,250
I want to ask why you're so good to me?

332
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,800
It's because I like you.

333
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,450
I have a person I love.

334
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:18,100
I'm sorry. I would have told you sooner, if I had known.

335
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,990
For a beauty like Sara,

336
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,930
it would be weird not to have anyone beside her.

337
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:31,430
If it's not rude, is it okay to ask who is that person?

338
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,320
You were at the Winner Food event yesterday, right?

339
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,090
Do you possibly know CEO Han Tae Hee?

340
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:47,420
Is Han Tae Hee the person you love?

341
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,350
Yes.

342
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,620
Then, it is possible you will receive my congratulations later.

343
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,080
Don't feel uneasy and please continue being
the cooking instructor for my mother.

344
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,930
I'll continue to support you in the future, as a fan.

345
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,990
I'll accept the responsibility of making your mother the best chef.

346
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,460
Yes. Thank you.

347
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,610
What is it Min Hyeok? What is going on?

348
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,600
Han Tae Hee!

349
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,660
There is the worst fate between that bastard and me.

350
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,000
An evil fate where one person has to die for it to end.

351
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,750
I think you can go out tomorrow.

352
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,650
The injunction that Tae Hee submitted to the courthouse
is being seen favorably by the court.

353
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,210
Okay.

354
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,010
You've worked hard, Secretary Kim.

355
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,790
Is this Tae Hee?

356
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,190
Ajumma!

357
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,970
I am going to see Grandmother tomorrow.
Soon, you'll meet Grandmother, along with me, too.

358
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,060
And Ajumma, I have something to show you.

359
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,330
Surprise!

360
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,570
What is this?

361
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,510
The house we will live in.

362
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:01,110
It's a two story house and we have a yard.
In that yard, there is a small table.

363
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:06,570
And on the second floor, we'll escort your mother
and live there together.

364
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,350
My mother can live with us?

365
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,430
Yeah. It's great to gather the whole family and live cozily together.

366
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,070
Here.

367
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,870
Come and sit down, as you work.

368
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,270
And I think I want to be a doting husband.

369
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,490
I can be a good doting husband.

370
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:45,570
To really be a doting husband, it isn't enough
for you to just decide to become one.

371
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,760
Ajumma, you're caught red-handed. This must be it.

372
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,620
You have a distrust of me.

373
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,850
It's that you don't feel assured about my proposal.

374
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,050
It's like that, right?

375
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,770
No, it's not that, but...

376
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,740
I can read social cues too.

377
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,950
Give me two days,

378
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,320
I will change your mind.

379
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,750
Why two days?

380
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,000
Two days from now, it will be 200 days since we met.

381
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,850
On that day, please answer me whether or not
you'll choose me as your husband.

382
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,560
I'll be waiting at the restaurant at 7 PM.

383
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,680
All right.

384
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,990
I'll answer you then.

385
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:55,070
Since she was fooled by a man for a long time,
she's filled with resentment?

386
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:04,450
I'll make you and Gyo Chae Yeon divorce.

387
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,680
I also had a grandmother,

388
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,850
who had dementia.

389
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,990
Since I took care of her, she is a special person to me.

390
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:20,360
A grandmother with dementia . . .

391
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,720
What is this about?

392
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,190
You said you had a grandmother with dementia, right?

393
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,640
What is your grandmother's name?

394
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,340
Why are you asking that?

395
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,250
I am calling you as the TV station's CEO.

396
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,000
There are lot of questions from the magazine.

397
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,030
So, we want to have some marketing material ready.

398
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,630
Why? Is there a reason why you can't answer?

399
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,110
No, it's not like that.

400
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,550
What is your grandmother's name?

401
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,520
Tell me.

402
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,500
Kim

403
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,830
Kim Hee Jeong.

404
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,040
I've got it.

405
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,940
Get me Sara's family registry.

406
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,780
By early morning, also give me Sara's resume
which she submitted to the TV station.

407
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,330
Why Sara's resume?

408
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,400
That food contained peanuts and

409
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,530
you purposely had Sara eat it?

410
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,290
Why? To confirm what?

411
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:21,070
Why are you curious?

412
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,240
Is it possible that Sara...

413
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:34,170
No, I'm crazy to think that.

414
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,970
I'll tell you later.

415
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,490
You find out for yourself that Sara is Sa Geum Ran.

416
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:48,200
I'm curious what will happen when you two meet again.

417
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:58,200
Grandmother, you're doing well, right?

418
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,390
I heard about the Winner Food CEO position.

419
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,780
Tae Hee, I should be careful saying this, but

420
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:16,160
how about just concentrating on Winner Food?

421
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,880
What did you want to say?

422
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,560
I heard from Chae Yeon.

423
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,670
I heard you're thinking to marry Sara.

424
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,220
That's right, Grandmother.

425
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,450
Actually, I proposed.

426
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,590
I am waiting for her decision.

427
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:36,510
You must be discreet with marriage.

428
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:40,790
You know enough about Sara, right?

429
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:45,000
Of course! I know her better than anyone else.

430
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,570
She's a good person.

431
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,440
Soon, I'll meet you again, along with Sara.

432
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,740
All right. Let's do that then.

433
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,680
Find out more about Sara.

434
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,750
Tae Hee is a person who will do great things in the future.

435
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,200
One, who will be a family member, should be discreet.

436
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,110
Yes, Elder.

437
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,100
You are preparing for the meeting, right?

438
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,400
Yes, CEO. That person will come after finishing up
the magazine interview.

439
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,620
I made sure the place is spotless.

440
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,800
Can I afford to just sit and wait?!

441
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,960
I'm trying to appeal to her and get a "yes" for my proposal!

442
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,840
I have to go get her.

443
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,220
Wow, since you're being massaged by the camera,

444
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,400
you're becoming prettier.

445
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,570
Hello!

446
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,650
You've come, President!

447
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,300
After this, there is a Winner Food meeting,
so that's why he is here.

448
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,250
Let's wrap up here today and do it again later.

449
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,080
-Yes!
-No, no, it's all right!

450
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,420
It's because I'm a newbie CEO, I came here
since I have time to kill.

451
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,470
And, to see how the recording is done.

452
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,350
Team Leader Choi!

453
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,420
Sara is an important figure to Winner Group.

454
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,120
Please take care of her!

455
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,230
It's a bribe.

456
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,890
Oh, just a minute! For the women on diets, zero calorie
drinks and low calorie cookies are essential.

457
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,220
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

458
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,340
Thank you for treating us so comfortably.

459
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:35,570
You are so free spirited. Your popularity
has exploded with the female employees.

460
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,320
Please eat.

461
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:51,410
Here, one-person households, single, career people,
people preparing for employment,

462
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,190
plus the middle and high-schoolers who are
preparing for entrance examinations . . .

463
00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:00,760
The keyword that permeates all of these is 'survival'.

464
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,770
The image of a man actively working,

465
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:08,400
is strongly appealing and attractive to a woman,
who is afraid of marriage.

466
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,370
Next.

467
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,030
The marketing point for this new item from Winner Food.

468
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,310
The keyword is that, in this society, everyone is able to eat it.

469
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:21,390
At home, my mother, or my woman,

470
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,290
or as if my boyfriend cooked it, that cooking taste.

471
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:28,550
Also it's something where you can feel a sense of warmth.
It's this very image . . .

472
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,900
The image that women love best to see -
a hard working man.

473
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,730
Especially, so that seaweed soup can be eaten together with it, the pulverized form.

474
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,220
That the rice and soup can be eaten together, equally.

475
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,050
For that matter, I feel that this is a very
big competitive point for our new item.

476
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,490
Finally, and most importantly, for this new item . . .

477
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,940
Using the creator of the recipe, Sara, as the main model,

478
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:56,160
we expect for the item's advertising effect
to be huge. That is all.

479
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,470
I'm cool, right? You should say yes to my proposal.

480
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,300
Oh,

481
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,040
you've got that look in your eye,
as if you got the feeling. That's right.

482
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,500
There is no other man like me.

483
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:20,600
♬ It's enough for me that I have found the one heart which will easily be forever!♬

484
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,010
CEO, there's a problem that has developed
in regards to the new item production.

485
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,660
Right now, they say they're moving the entire supply
of Winner Food items without notice.

486
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,050
What?

487
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,780
This is Winner Food's food warehouse and
this is an emergency situation.

488
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,050
I will take care of this in a smart way,
so just feel my manly charisma.

489
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,680
- Take it all.
- Yes.

490
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,240
Stop.

491
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:02,200
You are Winner Food employees, right?
I'm glad to be meeting you.

492
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,710
I'm Han Tae Hee.

493
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,560
I came because I heard there was unauthorized removal of products.

494
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,940
So you're the completely green CEO. They said that a new Nakhasan (nepotistic appointment) was here. You've finally turned up.

495
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,470
I want you to know that we're going to sell these items here.

496
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,460
These are to revive Winner Food. How can you sell this off?

497
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,190
And also, by whose permission are you doing this?

498
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:39,510
- Lee Kang Joon, and we already agreed to sell this off to get our severance pay.- Kang Joon.

499
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,950
I heard it was approved by the top person at headquarters.

500
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,850
That can't happen.

501
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,650
I will revive this company.

502
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,930
Ignore him. Load it up and leave.

503
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,960
Yes, Sir.

504
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,790
Don't do this and listen to me.

505
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,790
Doctor, it's going to be a big issue.

506
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,270
Let's just go.

507
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:02,580
Don't worry. I'll figure everything out
in a cool way, so just watch.

508
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,100
But ... Why would you negotiate with headquarters
when I am the Winner Food's CEO?

509
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,330
- You shouldn't do this, please talk with me.
- Move, move! Get out of the way.

510
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:16,470
- Please talk with me.
- Get out of the way!

511
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,170
We can report them to the police.

512
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,800
Don't go easy on them.

513
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:58,510
They didn't do it on purpose either.

514
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,470
So I can just talk to the union leader.
Set up a meeting with them.

515
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,380
Yes, I understand.

516
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,130
It was ruined at the critical moment.

517
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,680
What do you mean?

518
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,200
I was going to show you my working man's charisma
and earn some brownie points.

519
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,830
Only my style was ruined.

520
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:33,130
You were acting foolishly all day long
to earn brownie points from me?

521
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,450
It wasn't acting foolishly for no reason, Ajumma.

522
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:41,220
Look at the reassuring side of me.
Am I not a great candidate for a husband?

523
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,930
How can I ever stop you?

524
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:53,630
But would it be a good thing for you if I

525
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,560
said yes to your proposal?

526
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,830
What are you saying?

527
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:04,670
Today's mess was made by Lee Kang Joon.

528
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,230
If we got married,

529
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,480
you would have to live a life where you are chased.

530
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,820
I am a married woman, with a hidden past.

531
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,200
So I'll live in fear and have to be careful
for the rest of my life.

532
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:26,010
Would that be a good thing for you?

533
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:30,870
I was okay when I was alone.

534
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,370
However, I don't know

535
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:39,290
whether getting you involved is the right thing.

536
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:44,400
So, is that why you didn't respond?

537
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:54,260
I was worried that you didn't like me.

538
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:59,640
So you were worried that I would come to harm, right?

539
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,150
Then it's all right.

540
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,550
Let's meet tomorrow night at 7pm as planned.
I'll await your answer.

541
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,640
The answer "yes."

542
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,550
Hey, Han Min Hyeok!

543
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,740
Because of you, my style has been a little 'cramped'.

544
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,590
Winner Group Headquarters General Manager
of Strategic Planning, Han Min Hyeok.

545
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,360
So, it's a collaboration with HBS' CEO Lee Kang Joon.

546
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:02,890
Han Min Hyeok, this only confirms one thing.

547
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,240
You can't overcome the complex that
you have about your birth.

548
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,530
Am I that scary?

549
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:14,800
Take it easy, will you?

550
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,410
Also, do you know why I am smiling so brightly
even though I'm all ruined like this?

551
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:26,370
It's because men become really happy when
they have someone they really love at their side.

552
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,020
If one has nothing to lose, one has nothing to fear.

553
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,780
There is nothing to lose?

554
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:17,100
I have to figure out about the contract between
Winner Food Han Tae Hee and Sara.

555
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,140
Set up a meeting with Sara for me.

556
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,620
Make it an official headquarter planning meeting.

557
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,080
Yes.

558
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,170
Family Registry

559
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,210
Kim Deuk Soon was an orphan.

560
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,130
Eun Women's University and there is no one
registered as her family.

561
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,550
She said she had a grandmother with dementia.

562
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,800
There is no grandmother with dementia.

563
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,960
Yes, Kang Joon.

564
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:07,660
Her saying she had a grandmother with dementia
was an unnecessary lie.

565
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,890
Why would she make up a lie like that?

566
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:18,690
It's one or the other. It's either a meaningless lie or

567
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,990
she really had a grandmother with dementia.

568
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:32,070
Is it possible that Sara is Sa Geum Ran?

569
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,490
Did she have plastic surgery?

570
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:46,430
Could it be like that? Is it like that, Kang Joon?

571
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,140
♫ What is wrong with my age?

572
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:58,930
♫ It's a perfect age to love.

573
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:06,230
♫ My heart is but one. My feeling is but one, too.

574
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:12,170
♫ You are the one real love of mine.

575
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:19,940
♫ I am tearing. What is wrong with my age?

576
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:26,560
♫ It's a perfect age for me to love.

577
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:33,570
♫ My heart is but one. My feeling is but one, too.

578
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,720
Hey! How many times do I have to tell you
not to cut into the middle of my song?!

579
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,490
You're making a fuss over that song again.

580
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,650
Where did Hongdan go? Hongdan?

581
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,200
Be quiet! Can't you stop playing play go-stop?!

582
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,090
Shh. Are you crazy?

583
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:52,220
♫ It's a perfect age to love.

584
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,520
That song...

585
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,930
That song...

586
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,630
It's the song Sa Geum Ran used to sing.

587
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,210
You said you had a grandmother with dementia, right?

588
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:30,410
Kim Deuk Soon didn't have a grandmother with dementia.

589
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:37,910
Peanut allergy. A grandmother with dementia.

590
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,350
That song.

591
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:47,490
And also, you were fooled by a man for many years.

592
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,460
Sa Geum Ran!

593
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:58,500
Sara, we're set up to go. In thirty minutes,
we'll be recording.

594
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:03,360
Sara! What are you doing?

595
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,400
I'll go wash my hands.

596
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,000
If I check, I will know

597
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,710
whether you are really Sa Geum Ran or Sara.

598
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,170
You have interview requests from eight magazines.

599
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,250
Did Oppa Tae Hee even propose to you?

600
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,110
It's like you're Cinderella.

601
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,480
Congratulations.

602
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,330
CEO, it's a document that needs authorization.

603
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:36,920
Later. I have something to think about. Leave.

604
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,380
Sara is Sa Geum Ran?

605
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,810
I'll give you a hair sample. I want you to run a DNA test.

606
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:05,360
One is from Sara and the other one is from
my previous wife, Sa Geum Ran.

607
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,150
Chae Yeon, why are you mum about the Canvas building?

608
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:24,340
How many times have I told you to give up that building?

609
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,100
I'll think wisely about the building matter.

610
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,980
What? Are you saying that's a proper thing
to say to me, right now?

611
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,490
Mother said she had no intention of giving the building back
to Sa Geum Ran. Why are you the only one acting like this?

612
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,880
What difference will it make to try to be
good to Sa Geum Ran now?

613
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,300
What is that?! Get over here!

614
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,960
And by the way, are you trying to lecture your Father-in-law?

615
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,100
What are you saying to me right now?

616
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,140
My goodness. When did I ever say that I had
no intention of giving back the building?

617
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,990
You're the one who doesn't want to give it back.

618
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,580
Ha. Right.

619
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:00,120
My goodness, look at her face.

620
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,530
They say that the cover is different than the insides.
I thought she was a gentle, neat daughter-in-law, but

621
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:06,110
where did this devil-like person come from?

622
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,880
Since you chased away Geum Ran
and is living in her bedroom,

623
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,960
you shouldn't be greedy about that building. Even now,

624
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,870
you have to make amends to Geum Ran.

625
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,870
Ah, is that right?

626
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:22,920
If I bring back that daughter-In-law you miss so much,
will you take her and live with her again?

627
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,230
How do you guys feel about that?

628
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:26,680
Ai...Ai...Aigoo, my head. Aigoo, my head!

629
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,170
That 'thing' (she) makes a person speechless.

630
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,030
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

631
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:33,900
All you guys talk about is Geum Ran and Geum Ran.

632
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:38,760
Since all you guys miss Geum Ran, I'm trying
to make your wish come true soon.

633
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,960
Oh my goodness!

634
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,050
Oh my goodness! What in the world?!

635
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:45,450
Hey, hey, hey! Come back here!

636
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,550
- Hey, won't you come back here!
- Dad. Dad.

637
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:30,030
Honey. Sa Geum Ran.

638
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,300
You dare to fool me?

639
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,390
All this time when you were fooling me, was it fun?

640
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:44,970
Now it's my turn.

641
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,250
Ajumma.

642
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,100
Ajumma!

643
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,610
What happened?

644
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:14,500
Lee Kang Joon. Lee Kang Joon came.

645
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,920
It's okay.

646
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,960
It was a dream. Okay?

647
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,710
While I'm next to you, there is no way
Lee Kang Joon can get in here.

648
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,280
It's okay.

649
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,550
It's okay, Ajumma.

650
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,050
It's okay.

651
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,090
Overseas?

652
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:50,070
As long as you're okay with it, we can
get married overseas. How about it?

653
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:53,250
What about Winner Group? What about your work?

654
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,590
You are just beginning to find your place.

655
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,980
That's not important.

656
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:04,830
I understand how you feel now. How were you supposed to
respond to my proposal when Lee Kang Joon was near you?

657
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,610
Let's get married overseas, and when you have
forgotten about him, then we'll come back.

658
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,010
It's a present for Sara!

659
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,080
Yeah.

660
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,530
I wanted to give it to her to wear on a date with Han Tae Hee.

661
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:26,950
To me they looked pretty, but I don't know if she will like it.

662
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:30,890
Since Sara has a good figure, no matter
what she wears, she will look pretty.

663
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,930
Just like we planned, let's meet at 7:00 PM tonight.

664
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:43,980
Also, respond to my proposal.

665
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,130
Is it possible

666
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:19,780
to be a wife of someone again?

667
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,360
Can I do it?

668
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,720
Look here, Miss! I have lots of pretty things!

669
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,090
Come and look!

670
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,360
I made all of these.

671
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,970
Oh, that is an Indian bracelet.

672
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,350
It symbolizes life-long destiny.

673
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:51,340
You and your partner will never break up
unless that bracelet falls apart.

674
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,500
Mother!

675
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:12,330
I wanted to buy you a warm meal.

676
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,960
It's been 200 days since the funeral.

677
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,800
I see.

678
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,400
Thank you. I will eat well.

679
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,730
I feel good

680
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,200
because I think happiness came to you.

681
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:43,130
In that person, Han Tae Hee's eyes, I saw sincerity.

682
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:48,610
Are the two of you sincere towards each other?

683
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:55,910
Actually, he wants to marry me.

684
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:03,510
But I don't know if I can accept him.

685
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:11,610
I never had a chance to tell my daughter that I love her

686
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,210
because I'm an old fogey who couldn't say those things.

687
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,050
I always thought I had nothing to do, but

688
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:25,150
I learned I should do all I can in a given day.
I learned that after I lost my daughter.

689
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:30,260
If I had a daughter now, I would tell her that I love her.

690
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:37,170
I want to say to you, Sara, not to lose your love.

691
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,970
You and your partner will never break up
unless that bracelet falls apart.

692
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,970
Doctor.

693
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:21,570
Ajumma.

694
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,580
I see.

695
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:33,540
Then, what is your answer?

696
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,670
Yes or no?

697
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,340
I want to say...

698
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,320
yes.

699
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:55,250
Is that right? I knew you were going to say it!

700
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,650
You knew I was going to say yes?

701
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:59,030
Of course, I expected it!

702
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,130
You know I always know everything.

703
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:04,130
I'm that genius, Han Tae Hee!

704
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:07,870
I'll see you later. Don't be late.

705
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:12,220
DNA: Genotype Test

706
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:16,250
It's a DNA test report on Sara and Sa Geum Ran.

707
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,530
The result of comparing the two DNA samples,

708
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:26,350
Sa Geum Ran and Sara are the same person.

709
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,120
Where is Sara?

710
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,080
What do you need her for?

711
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:11,230
They say if you wear this,
we will never break up ever.

712
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,410
Sa Geum Ran,

713
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:23,700
my wife is going to marry another man?

714
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:51,340
♫ How can I forget you? How can I erase you? ♫

715
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:58,440
♫ Not a moment, I can't last without you. ♫

716
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:02,110
♫My heart really hurts♫

717
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:07,000
♫ I can't let you go this way. ♫

718
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:14,610
♫ I'll wait no matter when. Even if it hurts, it's okay.  ♫

719
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:21,960
♫ Even as I cry out for you and look for you, ♫

720
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:29,100
♫  Even while knowing well that it's useless,  ♫

721
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,400
♫ As I see your back when you turn around, love... ♫
