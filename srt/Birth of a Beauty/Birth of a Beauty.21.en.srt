1
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,150
I remember the man who beat you up!

2
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:39,280
We should trick him. We need to make the one
who ordered this call us.

3
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,770
There is someone who found out that I beat up Han Tae Hee.

4
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,310
What happened? Who found out that I ordered the assault?

5
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,120
Why are you like that, Doctor?

6
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,410
It's a voice that I've heard before.

7
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,710
Perhaps...

8
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,330
I'm not sure. It's useless.

9
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:21,000
Who is the person that found out
I was the one who ordered the assault?

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,110
Why aren't you answering?

11
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,930
Final Episode

12
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,520
It's the PD.

13
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,590
Yes, it's Chae Yeon's brother, Gyo Ji Hoon.

14
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,950
Yes, Chae Yeon can't talk on the phone right now.

15
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,360
If you tell me instead, I will deliver your message to her.

16
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,830
I see. I understand.

17
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,990
Birth of a Chef as well?

18
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,510
You had to quit voluntarily anyway.

19
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,890
How am I going to live from now on?

20
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,900
You will experience harder things as you live.

21
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,580
You are still young and healthy.

22
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,940
Pull yourself together and think about how you can live.

23
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,790
Gyo Chae Yeon is quitting all of her programs!

24
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,720
Her life as a celebrity is completely over.

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,560
She cheated with a married man.

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,810
It was hard to see her act as if she hadn't.

27
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,390
And there aren't people who are
talking badly about Geum Ran anymore.

28
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,120
Then Geum Ran is okay?

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,320
Yes, there isn't a problem with Geum Ran now.

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,490
Rather, they're becoming enemies of Gyo Chae Yeon.

31
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,170
Then let's go see Geum Ran right away.

32
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,490
Yes, Mother, I'll call her.

33
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,170
What happened? Who found out that I ordered the assault?

34
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,380
Why aren't you answering?

35
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,420
This is the voice that I heard during
the explosion at the chemical factory.

36
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,320
This won't do. I need to go see Grandmother.

37
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,240
Okay.

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,080
Yes, Mom. I'm fine.

39
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,200
You are coming right now?

40
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,310
Mom, I will go (to you).

41
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,870
No, no. Tell her to come!
I didn't want to leave you alone anyway.

42
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,790
Mom, come with Gyeong Joo.

43
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,230
♫  Go. I have nothing else to hear from you  ♫

44
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:39,030
We should break up.
♫  Go. I have nothing else to hear from you. I don't like women like you.  ♫

45
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,940
♫  I shouted, telling you to leave  ♫

46
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,620
♫  I resented you,  ♫

47
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,530
♫  who said that we should break up ♫

48
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,190
♫  And because I felt wronged  ♫

49
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,400
♫  You said it as if it were easy ♫

50
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,170
♫  As if it's not a big deal, ♫

51
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,740
♫  You said that it's all over if we break up  ♫

52
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,450
♫  Did I judge you wrong? ♫

53
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,150
♫  You seem like an another person.  ♫

54
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,470
♫  It seems like everything was a dream. I was the only one.  ♫

55
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,080
I have an old Christmas wish.

56
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,650
I want to spend Christmas with my family.

57
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,330
Now, that wish has come true.
I will be marrying such a pretty bride.

58
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,260
♫  I thought that it would last forever  ♫

59
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:45,500
♫  The words, I love you, which I can't say to you anymore,  ♫

60
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:52,760
♫  I didn't know that this is what a goodbye feels like.  ♫

61
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,690
You did well, Geum Ran. You can put your mind at peace now.

62
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,910
That's right, the reporters in front of our house disappeared,

63
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,370
and everyone is talking badly about
Gyo Chae Yeon, instead of about you.

64
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,390
It's true that I also deceived people.

65
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,150
I can't expect them to forgive me completely.

66
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,340
How about Han Tae Hee?
I thought that I would be able to see his face.

67
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,370
Are you two going to restart your relationship?

68
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:29,210
Now, I don't know what I would do without him.

69
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,480
If you are happy, I'm fine with it.

70
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,700
Thank you, Mom.

71
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,450
I won't disappoint you now.

72
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,290
I've only received from Han Tae Hee.

73
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,510
Now, I want to give back to him, in return.

74
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:54,880
Oh. You must have a project that you've already planned.

75
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,470
What do you mean I shouldn't leave the house until the General Shareholders' Meeting? Why are you like that, Tae Hee?

76
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,850
I'm worried about you.

77
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,880
By any chance, do you know this watch?

78
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,270
What is this?

79
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,510
This is the watch of the employees in Winner Group.

80
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,190
Yes, this was a watch that we handed out
as a gift to the employees a long time ago.

81
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,070
We carved the initial of each employee.

82
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,960
J. Then, can I find out the owner of this watch?

83
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,790
There would have been dozens of people who received this.

84
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,220
Director Kim, this is your first time seeing Tae Hee, right?

85
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,820
I met you at the board meeting before,
but I didn't have a chance to talk to you.

86
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,080
I'm Director Kim Joon Cheol.

87
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,590
I don't know. It's useless.

88
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,870
What happened? Who found out that
I was the one who ordered the assault?

89
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,940
So, these are the files that we are going to submit in the trial.

90
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,200
- Yeah.
- Director, we've identified the owner of the phone.

91
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,460
It's Winner Group's Director Kim Joon Cheol.

92
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,380
Kim Joon Cheol...

93
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,240
What happened?

94
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,950
Ajumma

95
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,560
Yeah, Ajumma.

96
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,550
Where are you, Doctor? Are you going to be late?

97
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,370
I'm waiting for you.

98
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,360
I'll be there in about twenty minutes. I'll be right there soon.

99
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,720
Ajumma, I'm here!

100
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,350
♫  As if I forgot everything,  ♫

101
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,290
♫  I lived quietly.  ♫

102
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,110
♫  But a sudden thought of you

103
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,000
♫ comes crashing like waves ♫

104
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,040
♫  Even if I try to erase my memories with you  ♫

105
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,070
♫  We have too many deep-rooted memories.  ♫

106
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:48,320
♫  Tears fall again today.  ♫

107
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,950
♫  I miss you.  ♫

108
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:58,580
♫  Because the love is deep, I can't forget you ♫

109
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,380
The flower, statice, stands for "forever love."
♫  Like a habit ♫

110
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,400
♫  I miss you  ♫

111
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:12,020
I saw that you still have my wedding ring and dress.
♫ I miss you ♫

112
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,360
I've already failed once,
♫ Because I yearn for you so much. ♫

113
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,930
and I even asked you to break up with me.

114
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,060
So, it's true that I'm hesitant.
♫ Because I love you so much,  ♫

115
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:29,260
But still, I really want to ask you this.
♫ Like a habit, I miss you.  ♫

116
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,990
Shall we get married?

117
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,610
This time, I wanted to propose to you.

118
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,070
Then,

119
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,240
is it my turn to answer?

120
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,230
My answer is...

121
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,370
Yes.

122
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,910
♫  I miss you,  ♫

123
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,580
Let's get married.
♫  Because I yearn for you so much. ♫

124
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:36,990
♫  Because I love you too much. Oh Baby  ♫

125
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,010
♫  Like a habit,  ♫

126
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,140
Thank you.

127
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,170
♫  I miss you  ♫

128
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,620
We're home.

129
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,450
What about your Mom? What did the hospital say?

130
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,220
She was so shocked because of Kang Joon

131
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,420
that they said she had a panic attack.

132
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,430
They said she should be admitted for the time being.

133
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,980
What about Oppa?

134
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,680
He's a wanted person, but he hasn't been captured yet.

135
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,580
Sara is lawfully my wife.

136
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:14,600
Han Tae Hee, no matter how much you want Sara,
you can't marry her.

137
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,580
I'll give Sara her freedom, so let's negotiate.

138
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,370
It's me!

139
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,710
As a matter of fact, I was waiting for your call.

140
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,050
You must really be in a hurry to marry Sa Geum Ran.

141
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,320
What do you want?

142
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,200
I need a fake passport.

143
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,070
Since you've falsified ID's before,
you should be good at it.

144
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:47,250
Money also. If I'm going to reestablish myself overseas,
I'll need quite a bit, right?

145
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,610
- What about the divorce document?
- Bring it.

146
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,370
After I receive the money and the passport,
I'll sign it for you on the spot.

147
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,620
But Han Tae Hee, once this matter is finished,
you're going to have to die.

148
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,870
As a wanted person, how can you call me?

149
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,200
You want Han Tae Hee, right?
I'll call him out to a secret place.

150
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,700
In exchange, please grant me a favor.

151
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,120
I'm thinking of going to Iran.

152
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,160
Help me so that I can reestablish myself overseas.

153
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,370
Fine. In exchange, take care of him for good.

154
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,190
I'll decide on the time and location.

155
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,910
Okay.

156
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,090
Take care of Han Tae Hee before tomorrow's
General Shareholders' Meeting.

157
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,180
It won't be easy with the meeting coming up.

158
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,560
There are many eyes watching over the situation.

159
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,690
Han Tae Hee has a consistent weakness...

160
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,370
Sara.

161
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,480
Kang Joon will call out Han Tae Hee, using Sara as bait.

162
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,690
At that time, there will be a reenactment
of the chemical factory explosion.

163
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,860
From experience, an explosion is the most perfect accident.

164
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,680
Director Kim Joon Cheol, this is Han Tae Hee.

165
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,590
Oh, CEO Han Tae Hee.

166
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,410
Can I see you right now?

167
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,200
What is this?

168
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,590
It's the criminal's watch found at the location

169
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,280
of the chemical factory explosion twenty years ago.

170
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,840
It's yours, isn't it?

171
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,630
Back then, I may have been young,

172
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,100
but I clearly remember your voice.

173
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,630
My grandmother has regarded you as family all this time.

174
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,210
How could you do something like that?

175
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,480
You also know this man, don't you?

176
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,520
It's the person you hired to attack me, right?

177
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,090
The reason I'm not immediately reporting you to the police is

178
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,590
to find the true criminals behind the explosion accident.

179
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,930
Han Min Hyeok and Son Ji Sook.

180
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,660
Those two ordered it, isn't it so?

181
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,260
I don't know anything about it.

182
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,130
You wouldn't easily talk about it, of course.

183
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,720
Then I'll directly find out on my own.

184
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,260
It's me. We have to meet.

185
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,990
It's serious.

186
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:45,510
Han Tae Hee found out it was you?

187
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:50,130
He has my watch that I lost on the day of the accident.

188
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,650
You just have to insist that it isn't yours.

189
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,760
That's not all.

190
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,630
The employee I hired to attack Tae Hee
was captured by the police.

191
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:08,550
Also, Tae Hee asked me if the person who ordered
that accident was you or Min Hyeok.

192
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,450
Joon Cheol, hold out for just one day.

193
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,990
Tomorrow is the General Shareholders' Meeting.

194
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,250
Before the General Shareholders' Meeting,
get rid of Tae Hee and

195
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,430
make our Min Hyeok, CEO.

196
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:32,670
Then we're going to be one team forever.

197
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,720
That's enough.

198
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,830
In this situation, aren't you worried about me at all?

199
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,440
The chemical factory incident happened because of you.

200
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,740
We're in big trouble, Min Hyeok.

201
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,960
Director Kim Joon Cheol is anxious.
We can't control him.

202
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,110
I didn't figure that Han Tae Hee would find out this soon.

203
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,730
In any case, we just have to endure it for a day.

204
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:08,410
Tomorrow there will be an explosion
at Winner Foods' material warehouse.

205
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,630
Han Tae Hee is the target.

206
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,470
Instead of Director Kim, we can direct someone else do it.

207
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,680
What about that man who was captured by the police?

208
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,680
We have to get him a lawyer and bribe him to our side.

209
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,360
Then, Director Kim will become completely isolated.

210
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,800
I'm Kim Joon Cheol from Winner Group.

211
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,370
I came to appoint a lawyer for Kim Gwang Mo.

212
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,300
A lawyer has already been appointed.

213
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,320
It's a lawyer designated by Winner Group.

214
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,580
Winner Group? Min Hyeok has already...

215
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,680
You're going out?

216
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,900
I feel like I'm going crazy just staying at home.

217
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,050
Where do you plan to go? Just rest.

218
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,100
I'm going to Tae Hee Oppa.

219
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,190
Why Hyung Tae Hee?

220
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,200
I'm going to ask him to
pave a way for me to live, no matter what.

221
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,590
Tae Hee Oppa can't refuse.

222
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,720
Chae Yeon, now is the time for you to
reflect sincerely on your actions.

223
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,690
If you don't, you'll never get better.

224
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,520
For lunch, a delivery of "Lunch Boxes of Love."

225
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,200
I've just arrived at the broadcasting studio
and am in front of the elevator.

226
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,970
I'll go to your office.

227
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,640
Oppa Tae Hee?

228
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,440
I'm also going to meet Oppa Tae Hee.

229
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,070
You plan on hanging onto Han Tae Hee?

230
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,730
Gyo Chae Yeon, you haven't changed.

231
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,170
How are you so confident?

232
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,000
You also lied to people and did wrong.

233
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,060
Why are people lenient only towards you?

234
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,920
This is unfair.

235
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,000
They're not lenient only towards me.

236
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,390
I acknowledged my wrong doing
and sincerely asked for forgiveness.

237
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,880
Whether I can receive forgiveness or not
is not for me to decide.

238
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,090
All I'm doing is what I can do diligently.

239
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:36,550
However, you still can't even acknowledge your wrongdoings.

240
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,180
I've put my past behind me and moved forward.

241
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,680
You're still lingering in the past
because you can't acknowledge your wrongdoings.

242
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,450
That's the only difference between the two of us.

243
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,440
Wow.

244
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,080
Ajumma, how did you know that the dream of every man
is for their girlfriends to pack them lunch boxes?

245
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,810
I feel that I made a smart choice deciding to marry you.

246
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,450
Because of lunch boxes?

247
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,470
Have some.

248
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,830
Wow, as expected.

249
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,160
Yes.

250
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm in a meeting, so can you get straight to the point?

251
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,290
Come to Winner Foods materials warehouse
at 11 o'clock tomorrow.

252
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,610
I get it. I'll see you tomorrow.

253
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,570
Han Tae Hee decided to come
to the material warehouse tomorrow.

254
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,840
Then, how about the General Shareholders' Meeting?

255
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,450
Han Tae Hee will not be able to attend it tomorrow.

256
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,690
He won't be a person of this world by then.

257
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,140
Passport

258
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,540
Why does it have to be right before
the General Shareholders' Meeting?

259
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,780
He obviously must have some other motive.

260
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,660
Today is the General Shareholders' Meeting.

261
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,500
Wear this.

262
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,560
Since you are an Aquarius,
the color yellow symbolizes good luck.

263
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,920
Good things will happen.

264
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,860
Is your necktie crooked?

265
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,110
This feeling of a wife taking care of me... It's not bad.

266
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,970
Is this why people get married?

267
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,810
Where are you going to be today?

268
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,590
The completed product, Winner Food Natural Seasoning,
is coming out today.

269
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,380
I'm going to check on that.

270
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,430
- You're going to be alone?
- It is something I did alone anyway.

271
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,490
Go to Saewondang. I'd like you to be with Grandmother.

272
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,980
I'm going to the material warehouse, then to the
General Shareholders' Meeting, so I'm very busy.

273
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,420
You have to be at Saewondang for me to feel assured.

274
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:57,620
Also, I will give you a letter, so give it to my Grandmother.

275
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:09,640
Since your mother has dementia,
you must have a hard time.

276
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,780
They say that there aren't dutiful children, when it comes to a protracted illness, who will take care of a parent well.

277
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,470
I lost my family.

278
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:32,080
I'm jealous that you have a family that you can take care of.

279
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,380
Elder...

280
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,320
Elder

281
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,860
The person you are trying to reach is not available.

282
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,260
Really...

283
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,340
Are you sure that Director Kim Joon Cheol
didn't go to the General Shareholders' Meeting?

284
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,590
Yes. The secretary's office cannot reach him either.

285
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,550
Why isn't he answering his phone?

286
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,560
Grandmother!

287
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,190
You!

288
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,950
Han Tae Hee sent me here.

289
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,000
He told me to deliver a letter to you.

290
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,740
Give me the money and the passport first.
The divorce document comes afterward.

291
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,800
I filled it up as you told me.

292
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,160
This is the passport.

293
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,100
Park Gyeong Cheol

294
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,490
Now, sign the divorce document.

295
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,000
Sign it!

296
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,810
Fine.

297
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,580
I have to keep a promise.

298
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,670
With this, will Sa Geum Ran and I
no longer be a married couple?

299
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,160
I'm disappointed.

300
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,430
Tell Geum Ran to be happy.

301
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,400
I hope that I never see you again.

302
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,030
I'll hope for that also.

303
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,890
Hey!

304
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,420
I didn't plan this. Han Min Hyeok said that he can't let you live.

305
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,080
I'm sorry. I'll go first.

306
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:30,860
Grandmother, by the time you read this letter,
if you can't reach me,

307
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,720
contact Detective Oh Hyun Jae,
at Seongbok Police Station.

308
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,700
Director Kim Joon Cheol caused the explosion
twenty years ago, at the chemical factory.

309
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,460
The watch I showed you belongs to Kim Joon Cheol.

310
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,370
Where is Tae Hee?

311
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,730
He said that he is going to stop by the material warehouse
and then go to the General Shareholders' Meeting.

312
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,040
Kim Joon Cheol!

313
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,800
Elder.

314
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,620
Please kill me.

315
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,630
Tae Hee is in danger.

316
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,080
They are trying to re-create

317
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,240
the explosion from twenty years ago,
in the material warehouse.

318
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,550
Relax.

319
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,540
I will become the CEO without any calamity.

320
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:55,460
I'm nervous. A lot of the stockholders
have already turned their backs on us.

321
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,760
We don't know what Han Tae Hee is going to say
when he comes on scene either.

322
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,230
Han Tae Hee won't be able to come.

323
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:13,380
But we should still check on
what happened at the material warehouse.

324
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,410
What happened to Han Tae Hee?

325
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,710
It was successful.

326
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,250
- Grandmother!
- Let me go too.

327
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:19,310
No, you can't! Stay here. It's dangerous.
Director Kim, please take care of Grandmother.

328
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,080
No! I have to go.

329
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,760
You know how an explosion is. People will come soon.

330
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,930
You cannot go in there.

331
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,470
Sara, then, you should wait too.

332
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,330
It's an explosive accident. You can't just go inside!

333
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,750
If Han Tae Hee is inside, I have to go.
Please take care of her.

334
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,530
- Sara!
- No, Elder.

335
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,570
Then we will now start the 41st Winner Group

336
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,110
General Shareholders' Meeting.

337
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,910
The principal matter in today's shareholders' meeting

338
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,000
is to appoint the CEO/Director of Winner Group.

339
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,080
We will vote "yes" or "no."

340
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:04,230
The condition of appointment is gaining a vote of approval
of the majority of shareholders in attendance.

341
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,070
We will be introducing Winner Group's sole candidate, Han Min Hyeok,

342
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,310
General Manager of Strategic Planning.

343
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,390
Please welcome him with applause.

344
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,370
I'm Han Min Hyeok.

345
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,570
Today, if I am appointed as CEO,

346
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,710
I promise to put all of my passion

347
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,710
and time

348
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,320
toward the benefit of the stockholders.

349
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,170
Thank you.

350
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,730
Winner Foods materials warehouse?

351
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,390
Doctor!

352
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,590
The result is out. Now,

353
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:19,670
I will announce the result of the vote.

354
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,350
Of the available shares in attendance,
with sixty-seven percent of the votes against,

355
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:30,150
Han Min Hyeok's appointment as CEO has been voted down.

356
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,640
This makes no sense!

357
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,340
- This makes no sense...
- General Manager Han Min Hyeok!

358
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,780
You falsely accused the Foundation's Madame
Park Man Deok, didn't you?

359
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,710
She's not the kind of person who would do that.
We already saw the files in

360
00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:00,450
the materials which Han Tae Hee circulated.
You illegally manipulated the stocks too!

361
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,680
There is also an issue, at the Board of Directors' meeting,

362
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,950
that you took credit for what Director Han Tae Hee did.

363
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,490
We want a leader whom we can trust.

364
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,050
That's right!

365
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,550
A person has to have a conscience.

366
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,390
Shareholders,

367
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,580
there must be a misunderstanding.

368
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,870
As you already know, Han Tae Hee and I competed,

369
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:41,050
and through that process, Han Tae Hee
purposely tried to blame me for something I didn't do.

370
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,150
You must not believe him.

371
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,590
Rather than trivial things of the past, ultimately,

372
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,390
first think about who should become

373
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,830
Winner's CEO.

374
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,880
Right now the only person who can become
the CEO of Winner Group . . .

375
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,080
There's none other than I, Han Min Hyeok.

376
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,960
- There is CEO Han Tae Hee!
- That's right!

377
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,250
We want CEO Han Tae Hee.

378
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,770
Han Tae Hee

379
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,630
will not come.

380
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,710
What do you mean by that?

381
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,700
Already, he isn't here as it is.

382
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,470
He either does not plan to come...

383
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,150
or cannot come.

384
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,530
Han Min Hyeok,

385
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,840
the main hero of a story always appears at the very end.

386
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,890
Everyone,

387
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:02,480
Since Han Min Hyeok's election as CEO
has been voted down, right now,

388
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,680
I am calling for an emergency Board of Directors meeting.

389
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,230
And from all of you, the shareholders,

390
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,360
once more today,

391
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,050
I am asking you to take part in a "yes" or "no" vote
for the election of a candidate for CEO/ Director.

392
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,530
Han Min Hyeok.

393
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,640
And Son Ji Sook.

394
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,650
It's your turn to be played.

395
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,360
Twenty years ago,

396
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:48,950
I was only a little child. I could only run away.

397
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:51,310
But now, that's not the case.

398
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,590
It's your turn now.

399
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,090
Han Tae Hee...

400
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,250
How can you...?

401
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,800
I can't die.

402
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,460
I have to protect the woman I love.

403
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,440
We're ready.

404
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,090
Farewell, Han Tae Hee.

405
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,210
Stop right there!

406
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,390
Han Tae Hee, are you okay?
I came after getting your phone call.

407
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,150
Yes.

408
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:05,310
Son Ji Sook!

409
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:11,450
We are arresting you as the culprit of the explosion
at the chemical factory twenty years ago.

410
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,010
Han Min Hyeok,

411
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,500
we are arresting you for the attempted murder of Han Tae Hee.

412
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,910
Han Tae Hee, are you okay?
We came after getting your phone call.

413
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,550
Yes.

414
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,570
Doctor!

415
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,230
Ajumma!

416
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,790
Doctor!

417
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,370
- How can you just come here?
- I was worried that you would be hurt.

418
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,610
I was afraid that something like before
might have happened.

419
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,570
That wouldn't happen again. I promised you.

420
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,590
But why did you come to a place like this alone?

421
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:55,190
Then how about you? I told you to be with my Grandmother.

422
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,010
If I were in danger, what would you have done?

423
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,510
You accepted my proposal.

424
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:04,520
A married couple does everything together.

425
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,760
♫  I look at myself in the mirror countless times,  ♫

426
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,150
♫  I can't believe it  ♫

427
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,670
♫  I seem like a main character of a romance novel  ♫

428
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,450
I love you.

429
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,600
I love you too.

430
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:29,210
♫  This is my first time feeling this fluttering  ♫

431
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:33,880
♫  Oh new world,  ♫

432
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:39,650
♫ Oh new world,  ♫

433
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:46,090
♫  I want to start again,  ♫

434
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:51,030
♫  With my passionate heart,  ♫

435
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:59,670
General Manager Han Min Hyeok
and Son Ji Sook were arrested.

436
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,470
Then what happened to the problem regarding the new CEO?

437
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,330
As to the election of the Winner Group's CEO,

438
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,990
with Han Tae Hee as the sole candidate for CEO,

439
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,190
the result of the vote is out.

440
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:36,290
For the 41st session of the Winner Group
periodic shareholder's meeting,

441
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,650
I will reveal the results of the vote regarding the election of the CEO.

442
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,630
Concerning the CEO appointment of candidate Han Tae Hee,

443
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:48,020
in the result of the yes or no vote,

444
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:57,190
of the available shares in attendance,
with an eighty-one percent approval,

445
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:01,300
I declare that Han Tae Hee

446
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,010
has been appointed as the new CEO for Winner Group!

447
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,260
Congratulations!

448
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,860
Taxi! Taxi!

449
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,140
- Let's go to Incheon Port.
- Yes.

450
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,050
Ajumma! Ajumma!

451
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,120
I did it. I got it!

452
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,390
Doctor, you really did well!

453
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,540
I'm much happier than when I got into college. How can this be?

454
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,280
Things worked out well for you, but I'm even happier!
My heart is filled with pride!

455
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,800
That's precisely being a wife, Ajumma!

456
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,720
When you won first place on Birth of a Chef, that's how I felt.

457
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,690
Lee Kang Joon is on his way to Incheon Port.

458
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,060
Lee Kang Joon?

459
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:38,950
What's Lee Kang Joon's location? Is this the right way?

460
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,740
I think he's going towards Incheon.

461
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,750
He's still on the Kyung In Expressway.

462
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,480
But I think he'll arrive before us.

463
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,230
That's probably true, but you don't have to worry.

464
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,650
Location tracker.

465
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:00,110
Lee Kang Joon. Wherever you go,
I'm going to follow you to the very end.

466
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,960
From now on, since I'm going to be speeding,

467
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,020
- hold on tight.
- Yes, Doctor.

468
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:47,560
Please give me a ticket on the fastest way to Japan.

469
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,820
Are you Park Gyeong Cheol?

470
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,770
Then, the passport is a trap?

471
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,180
Yes.

472
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:28,740
If Lee Kang Joon presents that passport,
the police are immediately notified.

473
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,830
And the detective in charge has placed
a request for Coast Guard cooperation too.

474
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,630
Lee Kang Joon is in the area.

475
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,950
How did you...?

476
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,700
It's disappointing.

477
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,240
Still, I thought you'd say goodbye before leaving.

478
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,940
How is it that you showed up here?

479
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,850
Why? Do you want to run away with me or something?

480
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:12,690
We came so that you couldn't run away.

481
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,240
Han Tae Hee. You tricked me with the passport, right?

482
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,880
Of course. Did you think you could easily run away?

483
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,920
As if trying to kill me wasn't enough,

484
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,730
you also tried to kill Han Tae Hee?

485
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,750
You can't be forgiven.

486
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,520
Send me on my way. I signed the divorce document!

487
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,120
Turn yourself in and pay the price for your sins.
Then everything will come to an end.

488
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,780
That won't do. Why should I?

489
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:22,120
The black box clip of him trying to murder me
is in Gyo Chae Yeon's possession.

490
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,180
Yes. I understand.

491
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,450
They say you will be taken into custody for questioning.

492
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:57,100
Although our destiny as a married couple
ended with much heartache,

493
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,340
I hope that it was a process for a path towards a better life.

494
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,650
Kang Joon! Oppa!

495
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,680
Geum Ran.

496
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,340
I'm ashamed.

497
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,740
Child!

498
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:55,310
Geum Ran. It's a relief that you're alive.

499
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:02,060
My Kang Joon, I'm not going to leave you alone.

500
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:11,740
So, forget everything and live well.

501
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,430
I sincerely wish you

502
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,390
happiness.

503
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,680
It ended well.

504
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,700
One moment! Who are you?

505
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,850
Is Gyo Chae Yeon here?
We're from the Seongbok Police Station.

506
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,360
Gyo Chae Yeon?

507
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,480
Yes.

508
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,280
Lee Kang Joon has been captured.

509
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,090
You have the black box clip on the day
of Sa Geum Ran's accident, right?

510
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:26,100
I heard you threatened Lee Kang Joon with that.

511
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,730
You will have to agree to an investigation.

512
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:50,540
It's an important day for you because you were
confirmed as CEO. Is it okay to be with me?

513
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,420
People will be looking for you from everywhere.

514
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,710
What's a more important place than being together with family?

515
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,800
Blow out the candle.

516
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,890
It's the day you reclaimed your place.

517
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,640
Congratulations.

518
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,320
Just me?

519
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:13,120
It's an important day for you too because you've
wiped out the past and started a new life.

520
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,910
Congratulations.

521
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:22,570
Then, shall we blow it out together?

522
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:24,740
Sounds good.

523
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,890
Two, three!

524
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,580
Now all that's left is the wedding.

525
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:36,610
We're really becoming a married couple.

526
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:41,070
I have something to ask you.

527
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,970
Aren't you in the least bit scared about us
becoming a married couple?

528
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:53,000
I'm different from other women.

529
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,590
First off, I'm a plastic surgery beauty.

530
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:05,520
I don't know when I'll get delirium and lose
my memory or suffer from side effects of the surgery.

531
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,760
What else?

532
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,630
If we have a child,

533
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:14,530
it may not resemble how I am now.

534
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,810
What else?

535
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,850
Also,

536
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,720
if we argue or get tired of married life,

537
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,400
I may easily get scared

538
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,420
that I will fail again.

539
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:35,140
Are you able to be with me who's like that?

540
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:41,190
If delirium comes to you, I'm only going to
follow you around,

541
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,660
even if I'm grabbed and thrown.

542
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,910
Even if you become uglier due to side effects of surgery,

543
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:52,720
I'm always going to be by your side.

544
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:59,690
And also there's no reason that a child who resembles
both you and me wouldn't be lovable.

545
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,740
The weaknesses that you spoke of,
I'm already loving those weaknesses.

546
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:12,520
So, don't worry about needless things.

547
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:18,340
I heard about the world's sturdiest Baduk (game of go) board.

548
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:24,400
It might be hard to believe, but the sturdiest Baduk board
is made from wood that has been split before.

549
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:31,780
A tree that grows, after being cracked,
is strong enough to be difficult to cut with a saw.

550
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:36,190
The same goes for a person.

551
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,200
A person who has gotten up after being hurt is strong.

552
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:46,030
You're a strong person. And I, the person who
becomes your husband, will be a happy person.

553
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:05,220
According to the lawyer, because Sa Geum Ran
is alive, you can avoid legal responsibility.

554
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,990
It's a real relief that it's ending with only this.

555
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:19,420
I've readied all of the documents for
transfer of name on the building.

556
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,910
You, yourself, return it to Sara.

557
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,280
I don't have the courage to see Sara yet.

558
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,070
Oppa, please give it to her. I request this of you.

559
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,370
Take some time then.

560
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:44,530
With the thought of starting fresh,
it might be good to leave Korea for awhile.

561
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:51,010
If you're okay with it, I will make plans
for study or training abroad.

562
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:02,190
If this place reopens, there will probably be
a lot of customers who come to see you.

563
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:05,310
You know that Ajumma fans are no joke, right?

564
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:11,660
Since they like Sa Geum Ran, won't it mean that there are
many people who are having hardships like Sa Geum Ran?

565
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,380
That could be the case too.

566
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,300
These days, living is hard.

567
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,380
When the restaurant reopens,

568
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:22,140
once a week, I want to invite people who are
in difficulty and treat them free of charge.

569
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,250
Good. Good.

570
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:31,650
But with the wedding, reopening the restaurant,
and now even restarting your broadcasting activities,

571
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,740
you're going to be on a roll again.

572
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,480
That's right, the wedding . . .

573
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:44,240
But I have something to discuss with you.

574
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,100
What is it?

575
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,910
I'm thinking about doing total body plastic surgery too.
I want to change myself completely, like you.

576
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,690
Total body plastic surgery?

577
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:52,260
Yes!

578
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,360
What's this?

579
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,970
One year's worth of delirium medication.

580
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:12,550
Due to a side effect of the general anesthesia, I don't know
when the delirium will come, so I have to take medication.

581
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:18,330
I won't hurt my body with plastic surgery ever again.

582
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:23,830
What we need is the confidence to know
that the image we see in the mirror is pretty.

583
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:27,690
That's what we need. It's not that we need surgery.

584
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:33,890
You're pretty. Right now, you're the prettiest.

585
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,180
Hello.

586
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,540
Grandmother.

587
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:56,130
I saw you two at the material warehouse.

588
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:01,460
If you still love each other, after so many things happened,

589
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:07,650
there won't be anything in the future
that you won't be able to accomplish.

590
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:14,420
I'm sorry that I couldn't tell you
the truth about Sa Geum Ran sooner.

591
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:30,460
If you marry Tae Hee, I'm going to also
have a granddaughter-in-law.

592
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,680
Thank you.

593
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,620
I heard that you're planning to have a small wedding.

594
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:44,200
Don't do that, invite everyone who says that they'll come.

595
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:50,200
It would be nice for it to be a happy
wedding that a lot of people will bless.

596
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:57,030
People have accepted you into their hearts.

597
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,480
I did too.

598
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:07,020
Confidently show your accomplishment
of uniting as one to everyone.

599
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:27,270
Okay, shall we go?

600
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:30,750
Oppa, we have some time before the plane departs, right?

601
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,420
Yes, we have time.

602
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,540
Why? Did you forget something?

603
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:39,420
I was wondering what you thought about
stopping at Tae Hee Oppa's wedding on the way.

604
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,970
I want to congratulate him.

605
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:46,650
Oppa is a person who has done so much for us.

606
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,510
But I . . .

607
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,170
feel like I haven't repaid him even once.

608
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,920
I want to, at least, sincerely congratulate him.

609
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:13,600
CEO, you're the best groom.

610
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,120
The birth of a beau.

611
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:21,040
About only this much, what are you saying?
There's not even much difference from my usual (self).

612
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,950
I'm the same.

613
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:29,990
Team Leader Choi, I think I'll have to go see my pretty bride.

614
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,040
I have to see how pretty she is.

615
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:37,620
CEO, there's a saying that it's not good
to see a bride before the wedding.

616
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,710
We don't concern ourselves with those kind of things.

617
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:45,330
There's nothing I'm afraid of.

618
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,930
I understand.

619
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,660
You're so pretty.

620
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:17,630
Thank you to all the volunteers on the Beauty Team

621
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:22,690
Thank you to Channel Manager egzona

622
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:27,900
Thank you to segmenters:
AmyPun, bagy, mihaelagh, bjjohnsonwong, Dave06, gesti_lagi

623
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,630
Thank you to segmenters, cont.:
wanttogo, MrsDearTV, gifted_noona, rjadex, egzona, nanyfan81, and ukepoet

624
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:37,140
Thank you to Korean to English subtitlers:
gpark6642, leenlee91, changhuh, laughlovelive, impoliteness,

I took the world's most beautiful woman as my wife.

633
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:43,360
Because there isn't anyone as strong and mature as her,

634
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:47,890
I dare to say that she's the world's greatest beauty.

01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:56,920
I've taken the world's most amazing man as my husband.

Because there isn't anyone as sincere as him,

637
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:07,710
I dare to say that he's the world's best man.

♫  With our hearts,  ♫

641

No matter what our future holds,

642
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:31,560
we will always face it together.

643
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:47,060
♫  Oh, I'm in love with you, as if I'm matching up a puzzle,  ♫

644
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:51,920
♫  Oh, I'm in love with you, you're my ideal type,  ♫

645
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,750
♫  I like you because you're pretty,
I like you because you're comfortable,  ♫

646
01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:00,110
♫  My heart feels like it could stop,  ♫

647

♫  Was the sky that pretty and blue,  ♫

650
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:18,880
♫  Even if I watch a sad movie a laugh comes out,  ♫

651
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:23,230

657
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:51,520
♫  The long time of loneliness seems to be at an end,  ♫

658
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:55,800
♫  There is forever no parting between you and I,
Oh, happy ending,  ♫
