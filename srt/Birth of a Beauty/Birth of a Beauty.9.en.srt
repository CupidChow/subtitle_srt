1
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,213
From Oppa Ji Hoon, liposuction.

2
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:44,843
He secured plastic surgeons by specialties and had her have plastic surgery

3
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:47,373
so that no one recognizes her.

4
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:51,473
As I expected, it was Oppa Tae Hee.

5
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:05,433
Sa Geum Ran, since I found out everything, it's the end for you.

6
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:12,863
Episode 9

7
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:15,033
Doctor, how do I look?

8
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,383
Yes, I'm ready, Doctor.

9
00:01:24,603 --> 00:01:26,523
Doctor, how do I look?

10
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:30,053
Does the uniform suit me? Do I look like a school girl?

11
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:36,653
Let's take a look.

12
00:01:37,603 --> 00:01:41,703
See, the ribbon is crooked.

13
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:51,843
You really do look like a high school student dressed this way.

14
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:56,003
Did you go somewhere and get additional surgery to look younger without me knowing?

15
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:59,913
I'm always stuck by your side, so when do I have the time to get secret surgery?

16
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:02,443
Anyway, you're saying I look younger than my age, right?

17
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:06,163
Your mouth is going to rip.

18
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:08,143
Of course it might rip

19
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:12,353
This is the moment that Edmond Dantes is receiving the new identity of The Count of Monte Cristo.

20
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:15,733
Let's get started

21
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:18,903
Smile.

22
00:02:22,203 --> 00:02:24,183
Little bit to the left.

23
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:26,553
The killer smile.

24
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:30,153
Oh, that's good. Can you smile a bit more?

25
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,873
With this, let's launder your identity.

26
00:02:34,873 --> 00:02:37,453
You're becoming reborn as the daughter of your mother's friend...

27
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:40,403
and if you get famous, people will want to find your yearbook.

28
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:42,483
In preparation for that situation,

29
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:47,153
strong graduation pictures are a must.

30
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:50,693
There is more.

31
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:52,963
Here.

32
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:55,483
I got you Identification cards too.

33
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:59,253
ID card, driver's license, and even fitness ID.

34
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:01,643
Kim Deuk Soon?

35
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:05,723
I wanted get a prettier name but...

36
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:08,793
No, if you read it quickly it's Kim Ddeuk Soo.

37
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:10,413
It fits me perfectly.

38
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:12,893
Kim Deuk Soon. Kim Ddeuk Soo.

39
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,323
Do you know what your best charm is?

40
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:17,693
Your positive spirit and the desire to get something done.

41
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:21,423
Doctor, do you know what your image is telling me all that?

42
00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:24,713
Magician David Copperfield, the one with the best abilities.

43
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:26,003
Is that so?

44
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:32,133
Since I'm being complimented, it feels like something warm is welling up from the bottom of my heart.

45
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,303
Honey, it's me.

46
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:53,653
It's my imagination. If she was alive, she would have appeared.

47
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:55,843
There is no way she's alive.

48
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:02,053
Dear, I am looking at you from the car in front of you.

49
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:06,163
Then, who was it?

50
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:09,893
The day you killed me... Do you remember?

51
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:13,703
There is definitely somebody.

52
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:19,793
Who are you? I said who are you?

53
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:24,433
Where was Sara then?

54
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,523
Perhaps...

55
00:04:26,523 --> 00:04:27,923
Hot hot!

56
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:31,343
Hey, be quiet! Do it slowly.

57
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:34,723
Kang Joon, is he still not feeling well? Why is he still not coming down?

58
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:36,153
He said he was coming down.

59
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:38,313
Oh you're here! Kang Joon, sit down over here.

60
00:04:38,313 --> 00:04:40,163
Sit, sit.

61
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:42,753
Let's talk a bit.

62
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:44,843
What's all this about Geum Ran sending a message?

63
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:48,813
There's no way Geum Ran can send a message. Someone is probably playing a prank.

64
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:50,983
You were weak so you must have had a hallucination.

65
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:54,753
Hey, have some ginseng chicken soup.

66
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:00,263
Oppa!

67
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:03,013
Oppa, there's a call from the police station.

68
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:05,463
They say that they have to investigate you for something.

69
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:11,653
This is Lee Kang Joon.

70
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:14,273
This is Detective Oh Hyung Jae from Son Bok Police Station.

71
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:17,703
There was some information received accusing you of suspicion of murder with regards to Sa Geum Ran.

72
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:22,513
We have to investigate the facts, so please present yourself (to the police station).

73
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,133
I understand.

74
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,993
What's going on with you?

75
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:30,983
What's this about the police station?

76
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:35,563
I had a small fender bender. It was a simple car accident.

77
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:37,203
I'll get up first.

78
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:42,193
Eat this before you go.

79
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,953
HBS and Winner Group's Headquarters.

80
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:18,613
Are you nervous? In here there is Chae Yeon and Lee Kang Joon,

81
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:23,433
and Winner Group that controls HBS. There are some intimidating people here.

82
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:27,473
Now that you're here you must feel like shrinking back a bit.

83
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:28,953
No.

84
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:36,023
I have the ultimate beauty of Asia, the heart to fight, and you, the Genius Doctor.

85
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:37,523
I can do well.

86
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:40,173
Since, I'm pretty.

87
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:43,253
You're saying all the lines I was going to say.

88
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:47,043
Doctor, go save Grandmother.

89
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:50,803
I'll show you that I can do well without you.

90
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:09,663
Fighting!

91
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:28,423
Oh, Sara?

92
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:31,543
- It's so good to see you.
- Hello.

93
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:33,733
Oh, Sara is here.

94
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,403
I'll go see Sara and come back.

95
00:07:36,403 --> 00:07:38,163
You are really beautiful.

96
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:40,533
You're an amazing beauty. You're far prettier than in the video.

97
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:44,573
Thank you. I came because they said that there was a profile shoot.

98
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:55,243
- Reporter Kim.
- Omo, Producer.

99
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:57,733
This is Sara.

100
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,563
Hello, how are you?

101
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,453
Can you come on our program as a guest?

102
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:05,913
- Okay.
- May I take a picture with you?

103
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:12,123
Being an ajumma, she dares to debut as a celebrity?

104
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:16,713
Have fun, as much as you can, before it's all revealed.

105
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:23,463
This is Lawyer Kim Pil Ho of HBS's CEO Lee Kang Joon.

106
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:26,553
We cannot comply with your request to come to the police station.

107
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:28,723
Since he's in a high position, he can't be investigated?

108
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:35,833
I don't think this will go over easy.

109
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:50,273
We are going to make a scene to introduce you.

110
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:53,603
Sara, do you have a pose that you are confident with?

111
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,513
Eating and laughing.

112
00:08:56,513 --> 00:08:58,113
Show us.

113
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:02,423
Take it. Take it.

114
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:05,123
If there are other poses, please show us.

115
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,733
That's good!

116
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,313
Continue.

117
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,233
You can exaggerate. Even more.

118
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,423
♫  The sky is so pretty and blue like this,  ♫

119
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:20,823
♫  Even if I watch a sad movie,  ♫

120
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:24,683
♫  A laugh comes out,  ♫

121
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:34,083
Doctor, what happened to Grandmother?

122
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,413
I'm on rescue standby to review the legality of Grandmother's confinement.

123
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:38,783
Ajumma, are you doing well?

124
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:40,363
Of course.

125
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:43,303
I'll tell you what happened later in detail.

126
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:45,223
Do it properly.

127
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:57,553
Mmm... this sweet smell. There's a sweet sweet smell coming off of you.

128
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,043
Why would there be a sweet smell coming from the Courthouse?

129
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:03,093
That's why, CEO. By chance, are you dating?

130
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:04,233
With Ajumma?

131
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,853
What if someone hears you!

132
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:12,583
I'm not dating, but even if I were, why would I do it with Ahjumma?

133
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,053
I'm a single bachelor!

134
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:18,693
The people are looking. It's embarrassing. Totally embarrassing.

135
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:20,713
Just do your work.

136
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:28,253
I would like to submit Park Man Deok's request for review of the legality of her confinement.

137
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,873
By official request to the judicial advocate I've brought in the completed form.

138
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:41,443
Park Man Deok has already once applied for the review of legality of confinement.

139
00:10:41,443 --> 00:10:45,273
Because the Court has already refused it once, it's not possible to apply again.

140
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:49,253
Who is the lawyer in charge who is responsible for Park Man Deok?

141
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:51,533
What is the law firm association?

142
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:54,933
They are the legal representatives appointed by the Winner Group.

143
00:10:56,403 --> 00:10:58,643
The Winner Group directly appointed...

144
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:03,403
Sara came to the headquarters?

145
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:06,063
She came to HBS Big Hit program to debut.

146
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:09,273
We're taking her profile picture and advertisement shoots.

147
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:20,323
Hello.

148
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:22,003
We meet a fourth time.

149
00:11:24,353 --> 00:11:26,293
Hi!

150
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,593
I heard you had your first shoot today.

151
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:33,933
Congratulations.

152
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,023
Wow!

153
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:38,233
They're beautiful.

154
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:39,653
Thank you.

155
00:11:40,653 --> 00:11:41,983
By the way,

156
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:45,103
What do you do that you can come down here?

157
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:47,043
How did you get in?

158
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:48,713
This is a restricted section.

159
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:52,143
Uhhh, to tell you the truth,

160
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,363
I work here too.

161
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:54,493
Ahh,

162
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:56,823
you work here too.

163
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:58,553
By the way, be careful.

164
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:04,223
It's hard to find employment, so you should work hard to not get fired.

165
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,523
I should do well. I'll be careful.

166
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:09,633
Just remember, I'm your number one fan.

167
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,273
You're a fan of mine?

168
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:14,293
I am.

169
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:23,043
Solve that nurse-threatening case however you can. We need to gloss over it as quietly as possible.

170
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,973
Yes, I understand.

171
00:12:31,313 --> 00:12:33,253
Sara's much prettier in real life, isn't she?

172
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,623
Sara, I saw her. It's the birth of a beauty!

173
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:41,253
Sara?

174
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:45,323
We'll be taking a few more cuts in a different room.

175
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:46,923
You just need to fix your makeup in the waiting room.

176
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:48,463
Okay.

177
00:12:57,923 --> 00:12:59,223
Kang Joon!

178
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:10,423
It seems like you're not just pretty on the outside.

179
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:13,253
Yeah. I'm a big hit.

180
00:13:14,363 --> 00:13:18,483
But Kang Joon, are you okay from the fall that you took?

181
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:20,873
What happened?

182
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:34,823
That day...

183
00:13:34,823 --> 00:13:36,413
Where were you?

184
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:40,523
I went to the bathroom for a second, and when I came back you were gone.

185
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:41,623
I was so shocked.

186
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:46,323
And by the time I got there, I found you on the ground!

187
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:49,623
I was so surprised that it made me mad.

188
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:51,573
Who would do something like that?

189
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:54,223
We still don't know. We're looking into it.

190
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:56,353
That can't happen again.

191
00:13:58,023 --> 00:14:00,923
You look so tired, Kang Joon.

192
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:05,063
Thank you.

193
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:11,273
For worrying.

194
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:31,023
Your wife is here, Kang Joon.

195
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:55,223
We may be living separately,

196
00:14:55,223 --> 00:14:58,323
but we're still married, and this is our workplace.

197
00:14:58,323 --> 00:15:01,113
And you flirt so obviously? With Sara?

198
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:05,123
You may be the king of cheating like they say,

199
00:15:05,123 --> 00:15:07,023
but you should know your limits.

200
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:10,123
Sara...

201
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:12,413
I love her.

202
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,703
You're saying you love Sara?

203
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:18,953
It's the first time I've felt like this.

204
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:24,483
You're saying you never once loved me?

205
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,343
But you love Sara?

206
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:30,253
With her it's special.

207
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:33,323
When I'm with her...

208
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,143
it's comfortable.

209
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:52,773
You love... Sara?

210
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:56,323
Cut it out.

211
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,793
You love Sara...

212
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:01,823
You'll be so surprised once you realise who Sara is, you'll faint.

213
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:04,123
You don't even know who she is,

214
00:16:04,123 --> 00:16:07,063
but you love her?

215
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:14,023
Let's divorce.

216
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:17,823
What?

217
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:19,893
We didn't even file our marriage.

218
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:23,673
It's not necessary anymore. Let's end this.

219
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:31,313
It's not that we didn't file the papers, it's that we couldn't.

220
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:35,993
Since Sa Geum Ran is still under a 'missing' status, and you guys are legally married.

221
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:39,193
There's no need to be prideful. Let's divorce.

222
00:16:40,193 --> 00:16:43,083
Well, I guess there's nothing to be surprised about.

223
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:47,323
A man who abandoned his wife can always do it again.

224
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:51,523
I was such an idiot to trust an ingrate like you.

225
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:57,633
Give me back the building I gave you.
And leave with just your body.

226
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:00,923
Your first wife died...

227
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:05,023
...and you're going to chase our your second wife naked?

228
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,723
Watch your mouth. We're at my company!

229
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:09,413
Was I wrong?!

230
00:17:10,623 --> 00:17:11,853
You murderer.

231
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,023
What about you?

232
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:18,223
You think you'll be safe,

233
00:17:18,223 --> 00:17:19,923
even after acting as an accomplice to a murder?

234
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:29,153
I'm holding more cards than you think.

235
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:32,723
I know everything you don't know.

236
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:39,013
You're going to regret asking me for a divorce.

237
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:42,283
This two-timing of yours

238
00:17:42,283 --> 00:17:44,463
made me have a change of heart.

239
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:47,853
To become more cruel.

240
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:51,923
It's fine for me to not be human.

241
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:56,483
Like you said, we're done. However,

242
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:01,523
keep in mind that I'm the one who decides if we're going to break up or not.

243
00:18:25,623 --> 00:18:27,623
Sara, you did fantastic work!

244
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:31,073
Your judo moves were amazing.

245
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:32,353
You've done well.

246
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:34,883
You worked hard. Then, I'll see you during the recording.

247
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:36,663
Yes, all right.

248
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:38,233
I'll be going now!

249
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:50,763
You're happy, right?

250
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:55,603
You think you have everything, don't you?

251
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:04,383
Are you jealous?

252
00:19:06,263 --> 00:19:09,923
There's no rule saying Gyo Chae Yeon should be the only one famous.

253
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:15,453
Fine.

254
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,023
Climb up.

255
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:23,133
Climb all the way up to where I am.

256
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:25,123
I had the same thought.

257
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,933
Except,

258
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,423
there's one thing you're wrong about.

259
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:35,933
I'm not going to climb up to where you are, Gyo Chae Yeon.

260
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,813
I'll go up higher.

261
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,743
Compared to you,

262
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:44,183
much more higher.

263
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,763
Sa Geum Ran,

264
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,573
You fake.

265
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:05,423
I'm not going to leave you be.

266
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:09,793
Get off.

267
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:16,653
We're on the same page.

268
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:23,853
I'm not going to leave you alone either.

269
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:38,573
Fine. Try mocking me.

270
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:42,523
I'm not going to expose the fact that you're Sa Geum Ran now.

271
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:44,723
Climb up higher.

272
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,963
When you are at your happiest moment, I'll completely destroy you.

273
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:55,223
Mrs. Sim Yeo Ok? It's your medicine.

274
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,873
You took it well, so I'll let you meet your son-in-law soon!

275
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:07,963
Relax.

276
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:17,523
Open the door.

277
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,263
I need to use the phone, just a moment!

278
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:29,523
Yeah?

279
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,423
Kyung, Kyung!

280
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,423
It's me!

281
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:36,623
Geum Ran's mom? Where are you?

282
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:38,623
The hospital?!

283
00:21:38,623 --> 00:21:40,293
Ouch!

284
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:42,343
Try to hold still!

285
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:46,713
Just endure it a bit.

286
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:53,223
This rose thorn, really.

287
00:21:53,223 --> 00:21:54,923
Let me see your hand.

288
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:01,533
What were you doing, coming back with these rose thorns embedded?

289
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,403
I had an eye battle with Gyo Chae Yeon.

290
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:06,673
Really?

291
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:09,013
Gyo Chae Yeon was pretty ticked off.

292
00:22:09,013 --> 00:22:12,213
We are going to be together on "Birth of a Chef," but

293
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:15,613
I think we are going to go at each other when we meet at the broadcasting station.

294
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:19,753
So did you do well today?

295
00:22:19,753 --> 00:22:23,213
I didn't show signs of Sa Geum Ran. It was perfect

296
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:25,933
I got a fan too.

297
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:30,033
Now, you don't have to worry about me.

298
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:33,933
You say I don't have to worry about you, but you come back with three rose thorns embedded in your hand?

299
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:36,773
You're like a child playing near a river.

300
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:44,623
I also

301
00:22:44,623 --> 00:22:47,773
worried about you today.

302
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:53,113
What worries?

303
00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:57,043
The thought that we have to save grandmother.

304
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,713
Is that so?

305
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:05,773
We worried about each other, I guess.

306
00:23:35,663 --> 00:23:37,873
Eun Kyung Joo?

307
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:39,713
Hi, Team Leader Choi.

308
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:42,583
Yeah.

309
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,333
Oh, got it. I'll be there soon.

310
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:59,713
The person who reported Park Man Deok was Lee Kang Joon?

311
00:23:59,713 --> 00:24:01,053
Why would Lee Kang Joon?

312
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:03,323
HBS's Lee Kang Joon

313
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:06,543
and Winner Group's Han Min Hyeok are on one team.

314
00:24:06,543 --> 00:24:10,033
Lee Kang Joon is shooting the bullet for Han Min Hyeok. In other words,

315
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,013
they are the evil twins.

316
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:19,413
Han Min Hyeok is the late Chairman Han Myung Hoon's illegitimate child.

317
00:24:19,413 --> 00:24:22,883
His secretary Son Ji Sook fed him alcohol without him knowing and slept with him,

318
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:25,063
which resulted in this son.

319
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:29,253
No matter what, how can he send his own
grandmother to prison?

320
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:31,313
Isn't he too heartless?

321
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,653
Secretary Son...

322
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:39,893
Get out, Secretary Son. I said get out!

323
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:43,773
Can you not hear me saying get out?

324
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:48,043
Speaking quite frankly, Min Hyeok is the oldest grandchild.

325
00:24:48,043 --> 00:24:50,863
Please let Min Hyeok live in this house.

326
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:54,913
You really are determined to destroy my family.

327
00:24:54,913 --> 00:24:58,433
You wicked thing. Because you are crazy about money,

328
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:01,733
you had a child with a man you don't love.

329
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,533
I'll give you money.

330
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:08,913
Don't come near this house. Got it?

331
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:11,883
You're not leaving?

332
00:25:11,883 --> 00:25:14,973
- Shall I call people to come?
-No.

333
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,433
I will leave

334
00:25:17,393 --> 00:25:19,313
on my own.

335
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:32,903
Let's go, Min Hyeok.

336
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:39,133
Han Min Hyeok.

337
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:41,253
I remember who he is.

338
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:45,523
Han Min Hyeok is the Strategic Planning Department Head.

339
00:25:45,523 --> 00:25:48,133
He will become Winner Group's Chairman.

340
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,193
Ajumma where are you?

341
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,153
- Let's meet right now.
- Doctor,

342
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:06,683
I have to go to the hospital.
I found the hospital where my mom is.

343
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:09,273
- I'm going there now.
- What?

344
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:11,433
You're going there alone?

345
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:13,713
Which hospital? I'll go now.

346
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:15,813
Stay there!

347
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:24,563
Ajumma where are you? It's dangerous by yourself.
Tell me where you are quickly!

348
00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:29,393
I'm at the hospital, Doctor.

349
00:26:32,453 --> 00:26:33,873
Lee Kang Joon.

350
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:40,693
Sa Geum Ran's mother would know

351
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:44,273
who the person is who is avenging Sa Geum Ran.

352
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:46,913
Wait a minute, Doctor. I'll call you back.

353
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:49,293
Lee Kang Joon is here. You two can't run into each other!

354
00:26:49,293 --> 00:26:50,593
Hello?

355
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:55,373
Ah seriously.

356
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:58,033
I'm here to see Sim Yeo Ok.

357
00:27:02,073 --> 00:27:04,293
Why can't I see her?

358
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:26,273
I'm Sim Yeo Ok's guardian. I have to see her.

359
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:24,013
Why did you go to the hospital? Don't you know
you can't go there?

360
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:26,193
How can I not go when my mom is locked in there?

361
00:28:26,193 --> 00:28:28,273
You have to think! Think.

362
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,533
Even if you don't have any thought, you do have a brain, right?

363
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:33,953
What about having a brain? Did you use your brain
when you went to save your grandmother?

364
00:28:33,953 --> 00:28:35,473
You just went with it!

365
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:38,173
I'm also doing that to save my mom. Don't you know how I feel?

366
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:40,673
I'm not telling you to not save your mom.

367
00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:43,113
You're going to ruin your new life, Ajumma.

368
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:46,193
If you ran into Lee Kang Joon then your life would be over!

369
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:48,793
Is my life ending the important thing when my mom is like that?

370
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,673
- You could've just told me.
- What if I did tell you?

371
00:28:51,673 --> 00:28:54,133
- What if I told you?
- Then I'll go save her!

372
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,263
How long do I have to just wait for help?

373
00:28:56,263 --> 00:28:57,453
What?

374
00:28:57,453 --> 00:29:00,533
Doctor, you can't help me for the rest of my life.

375
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:03,583
We have to separate in the end, right? In the end,

376
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:06,863
I have to take care of myself properly, right?

377
00:29:12,223 --> 00:29:15,663
In the end, we are strangers.

378
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:24,933
Right.

379
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:28,613
Even though we haven't talked about it,

380
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:30,523
we've had something between us lately.

381
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:34,343
And there was that weird love result from the psychological analysis.

382
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:37,573
Okay.

383
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:39,153
I had some feelings for you, Ajumma,

384
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:42,163
but it was just something. In the end, we're just strangers.

385
00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:43,653
That's why I'm telling you to stop caring!

386
00:29:43,653 --> 00:29:46,053
I won't care now!

387
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:51,113
What are you looking at?

388
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:56,853
Don't you know the conditions of our contract? Lower your eyes!

389
00:30:03,123 --> 00:30:09,653
♫  I know my heart but for a long time it's also unfamiliar,  ♫

390
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:16,193
♫  I yearn so much for the place where your breath lingers,  ♫

391
00:30:16,193 --> 00:30:22,133
♫  I yearn so badly I hurt,  ♫

392
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:28,393
♫  I yearn so badly I hurt,  ♫

393
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:33,063
♫  For the someone who only puts into my eyes ... tears,  ♫

394
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:34,623
Aigoo!

395
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:38,633
Having his eyes wide open like that at me, he might just eat me up.

396
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:40,393
Use your head?

397
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:42,493
I'm not going to! Why?

398
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:47,353
If you're going to throw a fit then just throw one.
Why worry about me?

399
00:30:47,353 --> 00:30:50,043
Why is he worrying about me, even becoming angry?

400
00:30:51,113 --> 00:30:53,153
I am not the only nosy person.

401
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:55,473
Dang it! You are a nosy man!

402
00:30:55,473 --> 00:31:02,003
♫  Because love is without fear,  ♫

403
00:31:02,003 --> 00:31:09,573
♫  Because love left before the pain ♫

404
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:17,493
♫  Because even if hoping is my everything,  ♫

405
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:24,873
♫ Love is not something you can put into your hands. ♫

406
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:37,168
Doctor, eat your breakfast.

407
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:40,968
Are you still mad?

408
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:45,408
Why are you still mad, it's tacky.

409
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:50,018
Come out and eat something first!

410
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:54,318
Doctor?

411
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:16,208
I'll save your mom, so wait.

412
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,428
And,

413
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,528
lower your eyes!

414
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:26,698
Doctor.

415
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:39,478
Room number 303...

416
00:32:46,328 --> 00:32:50,638
He said his grandmother's name is Park Man Deok.

417
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:52,978
Where is she locked up?

418
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:55,518
There was a memo here.

419
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,298
Seoul Detention Center, Park Man Deok.

420
00:33:15,508 --> 00:33:16,738
[303: Sim Yeo Ok]

421
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,818
It's not time for the medicine yet.

422
00:33:25,818 --> 00:33:29,048
I'm not a nurse. I'm called Han Tae Hee.

423
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,718
I know your daughter very well.

424
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,838
- Geum Ran ?
- Yes.

425
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:36,248
First, we've to get out of here. Please, follow me.

426
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,198
Who are you ?

427
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:42,918
I'm not going. Where would you be taking me again?

428
00:33:42,918 --> 00:33:45,478
I also know what Lee Kang Joon did.

429
00:33:45,478 --> 00:33:47,938
I came after Eun Gyeong Joo contacted me.

430
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:52,008
Here, I even brought clothes for you to change into.

431
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:02,678
Hello, Grandmother.

432
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:04,758
It's nice to meet you.

433
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:07,518
I'm called Sara.

434
00:34:07,518 --> 00:34:09,498
This person is...

435
00:34:09,498 --> 00:34:12,358
This woman is Doctor's grandmother.

436
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:15,238
It's the first time I've heard of you

437
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:18,398
Why are you looking for me ?

438
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:21,318
Until he can say it himself,

439
00:34:21,318 --> 00:34:24,438
I can't tell you specifically. But

440
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:28,278
I came here because I wanted to tell you to be strong.

441
00:34:29,598 --> 00:34:33,008
There's someone who is helping you,

442
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:36,728
and that person is trying to get you out of this place.

443
00:34:36,728 --> 00:34:41,338
He is a person who gets things done when he is determined.

444
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:43,548
So you're going to definitely come out.

445
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:49,188
Until then, stay healthy and wait.

446
00:34:50,278 --> 00:34:52,318
Be strong, Grandmother.

447
00:35:09,068 --> 00:35:10,638
Yes, Doctor.

448
00:35:12,788 --> 00:35:14,928
My mom is out?

449
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:23,118
Mom.

450
00:35:30,518 --> 00:35:33,608
Eun Gyeong Joo's coming.

451
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:36,238
They say she has to be admitted to get treatment.

452
00:35:36,238 --> 00:35:38,518
After a couple of days,

453
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:40,678
bring her to our house.

454
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:42,878
Since she doesn't know my identity,

455
00:35:42,878 --> 00:35:45,738
she won't come with me.

456
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:48,378
I'll think of another way.

457
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:56,298
Thank you.

458
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:01,828
Sincerely.

459
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:45,358
Doctor.

460
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:49,558
Actually, today...

461
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:52,558
I went to see your grandmother.

462
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:56,948
You were worried about your grandmother.

463
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:00,378
I saw her instead.

464
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:04,118
Fortunately, she's in a good health.

465
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:10,048
I told her someone's supporting her and to cheer up.

466
00:37:10,048 --> 00:37:12,538
That's what I told her.

467
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:17,098
Grandmother.

468
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,678
Ajumma.

469
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:30,828
What is it, Doctor?

470
00:37:30,828 --> 00:37:35,118
I can't directly be involved in Grandmother's situation.

471
00:37:35,118 --> 00:37:37,478
So, Ajumma,

472
00:37:37,478 --> 00:37:42,598
you go meet Grandmother in my place.

473
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:44,458
Yes!

474
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:59,238
Doctor, describe the shape of the bread.

475
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:01,938
In order for Grandmother to believe in Dong Guel's existence,

476
00:38:01,938 --> 00:38:04,678
you said that the bread needs to be circular.

477
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:09,138
Is the batter ready?

478
00:38:09,138 --> 00:38:11,198
A little more mixing will do.

479
00:38:15,658 --> 00:38:19,678
Look at that sweat. Give me it. I'll do it.

480
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:23,978
No, I'll do it. I'm quite strong.

481
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:27,118
You're strong? I'm stronger!

482
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:28,938
I'll do it.

483
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:32,058
- No, I've to do things like this.
- I said I'll do it !

484
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:34,958
It's okay, it's okay.

485
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:40,968
Okay, let's do it together then. Together.

486
00:39:02,648 --> 00:39:06,658
♫  I have no strength right now  ♫

487
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:12,398
♫  My sorrow has returned  ♫

488
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:19,738
♫  I'm sick for no reason. Yeah we made up  ♫

489
00:39:21,238 --> 00:39:24,198
♫  So I have no clue why  ♫

490
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:27,768
♫  I'm a bit tired  ♫
Aigoo, move your face toward me.

491
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:30,438
♫  I'm a bit tired  ♫
You got some flour on you.

492
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:37,058
♫  I'm not amused anymore  ♫

493
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:41,448
♫  The days when you're not here with me  ♫

494
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:45,678
♫  Are so difficult. I can't even think  ♫

495
00:39:45,678 --> 00:39:48,118
♫  about those days  ♫
Doctor.

496
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:50,598
For saving my mom...

497
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,418
Thank you.

498
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,458
Also,

499
00:39:56,458 --> 00:40:00,738
I am sorry about slacking off yesterday.

500
00:40:03,158 --> 00:40:05,388
Okay.

501
00:40:05,388 --> 00:40:09,518
Why did you slack off? Don't go from now on.

502
00:40:11,898 --> 00:40:13,938
I'll keep my eyes down if you tell me the keep them down.

503
00:40:13,938 --> 00:40:18,998
♫ I must have liked what you said. ♫

504
00:40:18,998 --> 00:40:25,558
♫ My heart must have loved you. ♫

505
00:40:25,558 --> 00:40:30,838
♫ I miss you beyond my thoughts. ♫

506
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:36,538
♫ Everything from your face to your feet, everything. ♫

507
00:40:36,538 --> 00:40:43,078
♫ If your heart feels like mine does. ♫

508
00:40:43,078 --> 00:40:49,118
♫ If your heartaches like mine. ♫

509
00:40:49,118 --> 00:40:55,378
♫ I'll run to you and be embraced by you. ♫

510
00:40:55,378 --> 00:41:03,988
♫ Without you I am nothing because I love you. ♫

511
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:12,838
This is what I wanted. Even inside is well baked.

512
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,018
Okay, Doctor ?

513
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:24,458
You came again ?

514
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,698
Yes, Grandmother.

515
00:41:37,398 --> 00:41:39,218
Bread ?

516
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:44,338
Miss...

517
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:48,118
Are you, by chance, playing with me?

518
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:50,918
That's not it.

519
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:54,638
Look carefully at this bread.

520
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:57,418
Doesn't it make you think of something?

521
00:42:03,618 --> 00:42:07,258
On Dong Geul's birthday, you gave him bread, right?

522
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:11,238
I made exactly the same bread as that bread.

523
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:14,918
Miss, how do you know Dong Geul?

524
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:16,438
Also,

525
00:42:16,438 --> 00:42:20,158
how did you know I gave him that kind of bread for his birthday?

526
00:42:20,158 --> 00:42:23,878
Dong Geul is alive.

527
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:26,418
He's trying his best to save you.

528
00:42:30,078 --> 00:42:33,898
I'm telling you to say to Han Min Hyeok that Dong Geul has come.

529
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:36,688
Han Min Hyeok is waiting for me.

530
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:40,898
You need to go through the secretary in order to attend Han Min Hyeok's meeting.

531
00:42:40,898 --> 00:42:44,078
Is he the President or what?

532
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:46,158
Quickly contact him, will you ?

533
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:47,468
I'm sorry.

534
00:42:47,468 --> 00:42:49,838
I'm going crazy, really.

535
00:42:55,508 --> 00:42:57,428
There he comes.

536
00:43:02,088 --> 00:43:04,028
Mr. Han Min Hyeok.

537
00:43:08,758 --> 00:43:11,418
Eh, really.

538
00:43:13,498 --> 00:43:15,578
I'm Dong Geul.

539
00:43:23,998 --> 00:43:26,358
Huh ? Hey, Han Min Hyeok.

540
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:29,658
Won't you stop there! Hey!

541
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:32,148
If you knew who I was. You'll regret it later !

542
00:43:32,148 --> 00:43:34,678
Just know that you'll regret it later!

543
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,658
Oh?

544
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:39,298
Stop right there!

545
00:43:39,298 --> 00:43:40,588
It's true.

546
00:43:40,588 --> 00:43:41,658
It's true.

547
00:43:41,658 --> 00:43:45,918
Hasn't Dong Geul been smart since he was a child ?

548
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:50,148
I think he would have been a deep and nice child.

549
00:43:55,548 --> 00:43:57,718
That can't be.

550
00:43:58,528 --> 00:44:00,918
Dong Geul is dead.

551
00:44:00,918 --> 00:44:04,178
No, he's alive.

552
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:06,528
I heard about the accident.

553
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:10,968
Because of the trauma of the accident,
he can't appear in front of you.

554
00:44:10,968 --> 00:44:16,118
When he is reminded about the accident, he faints because of the trauma.

555
00:44:16,118 --> 00:44:18,468
That's why I come in his place.

556
00:44:33,468 --> 00:44:36,018
So, you guys are going to be like this to me, huh?

557
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:38,998
I'm the genius, Han Tae Hee.

558
00:44:50,558 --> 00:44:52,018
It's a fire alarm.

559
00:44:52,018 --> 00:44:54,348
Since we're not sure, it's best to use the emergency elevator.

560
00:45:12,038 --> 00:45:14,648
General Manager! General Manager!

561
00:45:14,648 --> 00:45:16,638
The other side. Run!

562
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:20,478
What is it?

563
00:45:23,218 --> 00:45:26,948
Wow, your poise kills.

564
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:39,268
If we keep talking, it will take too long, so straight to the point. Let Grandmother go.

565
00:45:39,268 --> 00:45:43,038
If you release her, I'll disappear quietly.

566
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:45,448
Grandmother?

567
00:45:45,448 --> 00:45:48,828
The person you framed
and had thrown in prison, Park Man Deok.

568
00:45:52,608 --> 00:45:54,468
Crazy idiot.

569
00:45:55,538 --> 00:45:58,108
Ah... really...

570
00:45:58,108 --> 00:46:01,768
It would be good to just finish off Lee Kang Joon.

571
00:46:01,768 --> 00:46:06,838
What is this bad premonition I'm getting
about a new character's appearance?

572
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:16,338
When you were 15 years old,
you came to my house at Saewondang.

573
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:20,218
I saw the hole in your sock.

574
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:24,228
I was the one hiding in the study.

575
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:26,568
Dong Geul.

576
00:46:35,558 --> 00:46:37,298
Release Grandmother.

577
00:46:38,018 --> 00:46:40,608
Then, I won't appear in front of you anymore.

578
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:44,338
I'll live quietly, like now.

579
00:46:50,498 --> 00:46:53,888
General Manager! General Manager!

580
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:18,688
General Manager, is there something wrong?

581
00:47:18,688 --> 00:47:21,658
Tomorrow, call an an interim shareholder's meeting.

582
00:47:21,658 --> 00:47:26,188
The agenda is to confirm the Winner Group's CEO.

583
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:29,088
I'll get ready for it.

584
00:47:32,948 --> 00:47:34,268
Shareholder's meeting?

585
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,768
Yes.

586
00:47:35,768 --> 00:47:41,138
Talking something about tomorrow's main agenda for the shareholder's meeting.

587
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:46,998
She said something like, "It's the day the villain will have a victory."

588
00:47:47,788 --> 00:47:49,858
She's telling me to prevent it.

589
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,998
I've lived as someone else until now.

590
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:02,958
It means I have to reveal my identity in public.

591
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:09,918
I'll think about it.

592
00:48:39,198 --> 00:48:46,138
Doctor, I don't know what kind of person you, are or what your family is like,

593
00:48:47,108 --> 00:48:51,948
but hiding doesn't suit you.

594
00:48:53,788 --> 00:48:58,848
You and I both have experienced almost dying,

595
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:02,768
so we know what fear is.

596
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:06,608
But, Ajumma,

597
00:49:08,998 --> 00:49:13,508
there is a more horrific thing than the death of one's self.

598
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:18,278
What's that?

599
00:49:21,228 --> 00:49:24,368
The fact that you could lose someone you love.

600
00:49:30,378 --> 00:49:33,148
My two parents passing away,

601
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:36,808
I saw it in front of my eyes.

602
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:43,888
My parents were receiving threats.

603
00:49:43,888 --> 00:49:49,408
If something by chance happens to Dad, don't try to find out.

604
00:49:49,408 --> 00:49:53,728
Sometimes, it can hurt if you try to find the truth.

605
00:49:53,728 --> 00:49:57,668
My father thought that my life would be in danger if I came close to knowing the truth.

606
00:49:57,668 --> 00:50:01,108
So he told me to live forgetting it.

607
00:50:03,078 --> 00:50:06,478
This is what the criminals who murdered my parents dropped.

608
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:11,418
It's a watch.

609
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:17,858
If I take my place, this man...

610
00:50:19,078 --> 00:50:21,858
and I'll probably face unbelievable secrets.

611
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,228
Me, of course.

612
00:50:28,978 --> 00:50:32,788
I have to be prepared for the people I love being at risk of getting hurt.

613
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:57,018
You've helped me up to this point, but it's my turn now.

614
00:50:58,108 --> 00:51:01,498
Don't be afraid, and let's 'go.'

615
00:51:02,848 --> 00:51:04,978
We've always succeeded when we've worked together.

616
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,238
♫ Oh I'm in love with you.♫

617
00:51:07,238 --> 00:51:11,578
♫ Oh I'm in love with you.♫

618
00:51:11,578 --> 00:51:16,418
♫ Oh I'm in love with you. I love you, I love you. ♫

619
00:51:16,418 --> 00:51:21,328
♫ The long loneliness must be finally coming to an end.  ♫

620
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:27,218
♫ Never breaking up. Oh, happy ending. ♫

621
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,668
Divorce? The brother-in-law wants to divorce?

622
00:51:31,668 --> 00:51:34,338
He wants the Canvas Building.

623
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:35,588
What?

624
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,688
I will never get kicked out like this.

625
00:51:38,688 --> 00:51:40,238
I'm not going to divorce.

626
00:51:40,908 --> 00:51:44,838
Anyway, I won't get a divorce until I get my portion.

627
00:51:44,838 --> 00:51:48,938
I'm going back into the in-laws'. I'm going to endure it.

628
00:51:51,558 --> 00:51:56,688
And I will not leave the woman who messed me up alone.

629
00:52:07,378 --> 00:52:08,978
Common law Marriage Certificate

630
00:52:08,978 --> 00:52:11,988
Common law marriage certificate?

631
00:52:11,988 --> 00:52:15,848
Although we didn't register our marriage, our relationship is lawful.

632
00:52:15,848 --> 00:52:19,368
Division of assets and the ability to sue for compensation.

633
00:52:19,368 --> 00:52:21,708
It's all possible.

634
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:23,798
Are you threatening me?

635
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:26,258
- Well, it's the same.
- What is it that you want?

636
00:52:26,258 --> 00:52:28,838
We won't divorce until I say so.

637
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:32,078
What difference does it make? We're living separately anyway.

638
00:52:32,078 --> 00:52:34,728
I'm going back to the in-laws'.

639
00:52:34,728 --> 00:52:39,798
I'm telling you clearly, I can never divorce, especially not before three weeks.

640
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:43,258
- Three weeks?
- Yes, three weeks.

641
00:52:43,258 --> 00:52:46,998
You two, I'm going to make you divorce

642
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:49,188
in three weeks.

643
00:52:49,188 --> 00:52:52,538
I'm going to have the building under my name and ruin Sara.

644
00:52:52,538 --> 00:52:55,558
And, if we divorce afterwards, I decide.

645
00:53:02,258 --> 00:53:06,048
It's a contract to give you the divorce you want after three weeks.

646
00:53:06,048 --> 00:53:09,338
So endure it for three weeks.

647
00:53:09,338 --> 00:53:12,188
Also, you must never meet Sara.

648
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:25,058
Why do you look so surprised? I just came to my house.

649
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:29,568
Hey! Is this a sauna where you can come and go as you please?

650
00:53:29,568 --> 00:53:32,018
You come in, then go.

651
00:53:32,018 --> 00:53:35,728
She came back, then left again. What are you doing?

652
00:53:35,728 --> 00:53:39,418
Do you not know how to fear your elders?

653
00:53:39,418 --> 00:53:41,068
What did you learn?

654
00:53:41,068 --> 00:53:45,368
Since her parents aren't alive, she has no manners.

655
00:53:45,368 --> 00:53:49,168
There's not a quiet day in this house.

656
00:53:49,168 --> 00:53:52,908
It's good for both of us that I return.

657
00:53:53,618 --> 00:53:55,468
What do you mean?

658
00:53:56,348 --> 00:54:00,098
You have two daughters-in-law. If one is dead and the other is divorced,

659
00:54:00,098 --> 00:54:03,878
are you going to let Kang Joon get married three times?

660
00:54:03,878 --> 00:54:06,908
- Oh my!
- What did you just say?

661
00:54:06,908 --> 00:54:11,958
In front of your father-in-law and mother-in-law, how can you be talking this way?

662
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,998
Goodness, this kind of rudeness.

663
00:54:13,998 --> 00:54:17,288
This is why they say that you have to experience people to know them.

664
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:20,028
How can you be so different from the outside?

665
00:54:20,028 --> 00:54:22,588
You're just doing as you please, aren't you?

666
00:54:22,588 --> 00:54:26,288
Geum Ran, not even once talked back to us.

667
00:54:26,288 --> 00:54:31,488
I don't know if it's because Geum Ran's birthday is coming up, but I'm missing her quite a lot.

668
00:54:31,488 --> 00:54:33,728
Do you miss Sa Geum Ran?

669
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:38,298
If Sa Geum Ran came back to life, would you have her as your daughter-in-law again?

670
00:54:38,298 --> 00:54:40,398
Wha... wha... what?

671
00:54:40,398 --> 00:54:43,418
You're sounding reckless.

672
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:46,268
- Why are you like this?
- What in the world? Listen to how she is talking.

673
00:54:46,268 --> 00:54:48,258
You come. Have a talk with me.

674
00:54:48,258 --> 00:54:49,958
Later.

675
00:54:50,918 --> 00:54:54,728
I'm sorry, Father-In-Law. I want to rest first.

676
00:54:55,868 --> 00:54:59,568
From now on I'll act comfortably.

677
00:55:03,108 --> 00:55:04,008
Mom!

678
00:55:04,008 --> 00:55:07,368
Hey, hey, is that really Gyo Chae Yeon?

679
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:10,808
She must be crazy !

680
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,398
You don't want to come now and...!

681
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:21,788
This is the evidence of Lee Kang Joon imprisoning your mother in the hospital. Instructions to conceal the murder.

682
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:26,998
If we submit this, it will be hard for Lee Kang Joon to avoid getting arrested.

683
00:55:26,998 --> 00:55:28,958
Let's report it now.

684
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:33,478
Then you block the villain's promotion and save your grandmother.

685
00:55:33,478 --> 00:55:34,958
I'll go with you.

686
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:41,018
We don't know when and where the Broken Heart syndrome will occur, so I'll stay close.

687
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:54,068
Sim Yeo Ok escaped?

688
00:55:54,068 --> 00:55:57,438
How in the world are you doing your work ?

689
00:55:57,438 --> 00:56:00,168
Today there is important work
at the company, so I can't go.

690
00:56:00,168 --> 00:56:02,308
I'm going tomorrow.

691
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:05,128
Mr. Lee Kang Joon?

692
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:08,768
I'm Detective Oh Hyung Jae who requested your appearance.

693
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:12,998
I am arresting you as a suspect for the murder of Sa Geum Ran.

694
00:56:14,098 --> 00:56:17,318
What's with you? Do you know who I am ?

695
00:56:17,318 --> 00:56:18,818
Let me go.

696
00:56:18,818 --> 00:56:21,648
Let go. LET GO!

697
00:56:21,648 --> 00:56:23,328
Won't you let go?

698
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:35,458
Second Interim Board of Directors Meeting

699
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:46,518
Lee Kang Joon, that man. Why isn't he coming ?

700
00:56:49,738 --> 00:56:52,798
Let me out. Let me out!

701
00:56:58,688 --> 00:57:02,658
Winner Group's Second Interim Board of Directors Meeting will now begin.

702
00:57:02,658 --> 00:57:09,668
Today, we will confirm the Winner Group CEO, who will be responsible for the next 100 years.

703
00:57:09,668 --> 00:57:14,148
Today's CEO/ Director elect is a person who acted as the CEO for the last ten years.

704
00:57:14,148 --> 00:57:16,668
He's the person who will change
the basic foundation of Winner Group.

705
00:57:16,668 --> 00:57:20,708
He will become a great hope of Winner Group.

706
00:57:22,988 --> 00:57:25,758
CEO Han Min Hyeok

707
00:57:42,238 --> 00:57:44,548
We are looking for Dong Geul

708
00:58:16,248 --> 00:58:20,498
Doctor. I'll go together with you.

709
00:58:32,728 --> 00:58:38,288
The only candidate for Winner Group's CEO is General Manager Han Min Hyeok.

710
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:58,708
I'm Han Min Hyeok.

711
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:04,778
For Winner Group becoming the 8th largest company in the country,

712
00:59:04,778 --> 00:59:09,148
those of you who are present here today were vital and had great influence in that distinction.

713
00:59:09,148 --> 00:59:13,248
Recently, because of the Winner Group slush fund issue,

714
00:59:13,248 --> 00:59:17,848
we had an unpleasant incident. We will take this incident as a lesson to

715
00:59:17,848 --> 00:59:22,038
make the company more transparent and clean, making the Winner Group better.

716
00:59:22,038 --> 00:59:24,808
I make this promise to every one of you.

717
00:59:24,808 --> 00:59:26,618
Thank you.

718
00:59:48,638 --> 00:59:52,268
Is this the place where the bad person is?

719
00:59:56,158 --> 00:59:59,688
Doctor, don't be afraid and, "Go!"

720
01:00:06,388 --> 01:00:08,238
Ajumma.

721
01:00:10,838 --> 01:00:12,668
Thank you.

722
01:00:23,768 --> 01:00:27,518
Due to the consensus of the Board of Directors,

723
01:00:27,518 --> 01:00:31,188
I am confirming Han Min Hyeok as the new CEO.

724
01:00:31,188 --> 01:00:32,958
Wait!

725
01:00:37,498 --> 01:00:39,708
Oppa Tae Hee?

726
01:00:51,258 --> 01:00:53,258
Hello.

727
01:00:53,258 --> 01:00:59,758
Winner Group's Board of Directors, I'm Dong Geul.

728
01:01:11,378 --> 01:01:12,878
Yes, yes, yes.

729
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:16,588
How surprised you all must be, since I'm taken aback as well.

730
01:01:16,588 --> 01:01:18,218
But I...

731
01:01:19,528 --> 01:01:22,208
It's correct that I am Dong Guel, otherwise known as Han Dong Hoon.

732
01:01:27,368 --> 01:01:30,138
This is my father, mother and grandmother.

733
01:01:31,018 --> 01:01:32,988
And also, me.

734
01:01:36,078 --> 01:01:38,138
Dong Geul, he says ?

735
01:01:38,138 --> 01:01:40,468
How can this be?

736
01:01:49,848 --> 01:01:53,488
Why are you guys so taken aback?

737
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:15,698
Ajumma! Ajumma! Ajumma!

738
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:25,478
How did it go? Was Heartbreak syndrome okay?

739
01:02:25,478 --> 01:02:27,568
You didn't faint?

740
01:02:29,008 --> 01:02:32,318
- You revealed that you're Grandmother's grandson right?
-Yes!

741
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:35,868
It's a relief.

742
01:02:35,868 --> 01:02:37,518
You know that this is all because of me, right?

743
01:02:37,518 --> 01:02:40,078
It was my idea to come here together.

744
01:02:40,078 --> 01:02:41,658
I used my brain.

745
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:44,508
From now on, don't tell me whether I'm not using my brain or not.

746
01:02:44,508 --> 01:02:48,008
Okay. I'll never say that again.

747
01:02:48,638 --> 01:02:50,688
I did a meal's worth, right?!

748
01:02:50,688 --> 01:02:55,218
Anyway, even if it's a little, it's a relief that I helped you.

749
01:02:55,218 --> 01:02:59,358
What do you mean, a little? It's not a little.

750
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,188
I said it's not a little...

751
01:03:09,268 --> 01:03:11,298
Ah... I...

752
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:24,538
I now can't be without you, Ajumma. I need you, Ajumma.

753
01:03:30,118 --> 01:03:34,518
Now, we can never be apart!

754
01:03:43,218 --> 01:03:47,598
♫ Oh, I’m in love with you, it’s like I completed a puzzle ♫

755
01:03:47,598 --> 01:03:52,498
♫ Oh, i'm in love with you, you're my dream girl ♫

756
01:03:53,988 --> 01:03:58,148
♫ It feels like my heart will stop ♫
There are so many things people can't do.

757
01:03:58,148 --> 01:04:02,078
♫ oh,I'm in love with you ♫
Like going over a wall you couldn't cross over for the past 20 years.

758
01:04:02,078 --> 01:04:05,578
Getting the confidence you didn't have for many years.

759
01:04:06,498 --> 01:04:10,888
The only strength that can make these things happen is love.

760
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,018
Birth of a Beauty
~Preview~

761
01:04:36,018 --> 01:04:40,078
When it passes midnight and becomes her birthday I'd like to be the first one to wish her a happy birthday.

762
01:04:40,078 --> 01:04:43,708
I'm a married woman. My heart shouldn't feel moved like this.

763
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:46,398
Think of me as Sa Geum Ran.

764
01:04:46,398 --> 01:04:48,648
Doctor, I'll clean a bit.

765
01:04:48,648 --> 01:04:50,318
You'll start disliking me.

766
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:53,008
There's a woman named Sara. Dig into her background.

767
01:04:53,008 --> 01:04:55,418
Tell me immediately if there's something that's off.

768
01:04:55,418 --> 01:04:58,758
I'm Sa Geum Ran, the ajumma who worries about the household.

769
01:04:58,758 --> 01:05:00,238
Do you not have any thoughts of becoming happy?

770
01:05:00,238 --> 01:05:02,478
Lust after the things that other women do for a change!

771
01:05:02,478 --> 01:05:06,588
Doctor is it Sara you like, or is it Ajumma Sa Geum Ran that you like?
