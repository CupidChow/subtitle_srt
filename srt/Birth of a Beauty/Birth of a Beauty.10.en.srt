Episode 10
-Wait!

2
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,550
Hello, shareholders of the Winner Group.

3
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,100
I am Dong Geul.

4
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,470
My mother, father, grandmother and me.
I am Dong Geul, Han Dong Hoon.

5
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,550
If that punk is really Dong Geul, the
shareholders' meeting was for nothing.

6
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,240
There was no one who survived the
explosion at Gwaha factory.

7
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,990
We found his hair and his backpack there.

8
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,580
Dong Geul died.

9
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,910
Han Tae Hee left this for you.

10
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,650
Winner Group, Petition Against the Election of
Han Min Hyeok to position of CEO.

11
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,010
A petition against Han Min Heok's election
to CEO, with signatures.

12
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,580
They've really decided.

13
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,370
He is saying he'll try to stop you from becoming the CEO.

14
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,520
Who is this Han Tae Hee?

15
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,890
He is the CEO of a restaurant consulting company.

16
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,590
A punk that used to run a corner store is saying
that he'll take a share through trickery.

17
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,690
Investigate more on Han Tae Hee.

18
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,020
His background, family, education, connections, surroundings,

19
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,910
Find out everything.

20
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,630
Oppa Tae Hee.

21
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,240
I am Dong Geul, Han Dong Hoon.

22
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,740
When did I first meet Oppa Han Tae Hee ?

23
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,680
Since Tae Hee was ten years old . . .

24
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,110
1994.

25
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,940
It's the date that the Winner Group
had an explosion incident.

26
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,590
It's right. It was the same year.

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,070
Oh, really!

28
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,750
I thought you had some serious things going on.

29
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,000
You want me to help plan your birthday?

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,500
I welcome this sort of thing the most.

31
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,740
But what's the occasion? You don't usually make
such a to-do about your own birthday.

32
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,690
It's not my birthday.

33
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,080
- Then whose is it?
- You don't need to know.

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,920
Her birthday is the day after tomorrow. But if we spend tomorrow together, after it passes midnight, it'll be her birthday.

35
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,640
And, it would be nice if the first one
to wish her a happy birthday were to be me.

36
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,280
Who is she?

37
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,220
AJM. That woman is my future sister-in-law, isn't she?

38
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,030
You've just been caught red handed.

39
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,400
That woman is the woman that you love and
the person to become my sister-in-law, right?

40
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,120
Hey, how can you say the word 'love' so easily?

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,090
You're not supposed to say
that kind of word so easily.

42
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,160
A man... keeps that kind of word inside his heart.

43
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,870
And while doing so, if it comes exploding out,
there's nothing to be done.

44
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,960
I thought that you were a tough guy, but

45
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,610
looking at you now, you're just a young boy
bursting with emotions.

46
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,830
Hey, are you making fun of me right now?

47
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,260
I will recommend a perfect date for you.

48
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,260
What women respect is the culture of the upper class.

49
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,300
Culture of the upper class?

50
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,840
I'm so excited. How long has it been
since I've been this excited?

51
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,700
One year, two years, three or four years...

52
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,570
Nine years.

53
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,720
There must be 1Kg of pent up frustration.
(Archaic term "Sari" used by the monks)

54
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:55,000
Now I can't do without you. I need you.

55
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,960
Ajumma, I'm home!

56
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,000
♫  A petite woman who laughs well,  ♫

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,160
♫  A woman whose face without makeup draws me in more,  ♫

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,770
♫  A woman whose cheeks grow red with one glass of alcohol,  ♫

59
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,060
Ajumma, are you sleeping?

60
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,810
♫  A woman with a beautiful smile ♫

61
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,800
♫ When I see you  ♫

62
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,380
What is with this sudden goosebump-inducing tone, so unlike myself?

63
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,580
♫  A hard to find girl like something rare.  ♫

64
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,180
♫ When you're laughing. ♫

65
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,350
Ajumma, are you sleeping?
♫  I want to cuddle you.  ♫

66
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,100
I came because I had something to tell you.

67
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,860
Ajumma, did you put on makeup?

68
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,700
Even wearing pajamas?

69
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,780
No!

70
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,900
What's this? If this isn't lipstick...

71
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,780
What, did you eat some seasoned chicken or something?

72
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,050
Why are you putting on makeup at night?

73
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,540
Is there someone you want to look good for?

74
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,460
From now on, get permission before you come in.

75
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,070
Why are you being like that?
You look good with makeup on.

76
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,450
What do you want to tell me?

77
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,640
There's somewhere you need to go with me tomorrow. Here.

78
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,900
Wear this and let's go on a date starting at 10 a.m.

79
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,890
♫  I look in the mirror unceasingly,  ♫

80
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,300
♫  I can't believe it, My image is

81
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,670
♫  the first time in my life, so dazzling that I can't look,  ♫

82
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,890
♫  I'm a beautiful girl,  ♫

83
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,500
♫  An inexplicable excitement,  ♫

84
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,470
A classic performance?

85
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,330
♫  Only one,  ♫

86
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,100
Here.

87
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,360
♫  Only one,  ♫

88
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:20,990
♫  The dark and sad memories are now,  ♫

89
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,870
♫  Oh my girl,  ♫

90
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,330
I slept so well.

91
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,820
It's been awhile since I slept that deeply.

92
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,940
Doctor, since the first act is done, let's run away.

93
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,320
My calves are hurting so much that I can't sit.

94
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,520
Ajumma, try enjoying these type of things.

95
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,190
The culture of the upper class is nice.

96
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,450
That's all luxury bullsh*t.

97
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,070
It's stuff that only people born with
gold spoons in their mouths do.

98
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,260
I have to cook, do laundry, and clean. When I have
so much to do, how can I come to places like this!

99
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,610
I can call for a housekeeper to do housework.

100
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,360
Does the money for a housekeeper come out
of the ground for free if you dig it up?

101
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,510
When my hands are free, why would you use
someone else for what I can do.

102
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,150
Aiyoo, this ajumma, seriously.

103
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,450
On days like this, throw away your kitchen-ready mindset.

104
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,000
Omo, omo, omo!

105
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,520
Luxury bullsh*t?

106
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,440
That kind of talk really came out of a young lady's mouth?

107
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,140
Hey... she's unique.

108
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,580
Then let's go for the more 'popular'.

109
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,710
It's something that any woman would hope for and like.

110
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,530
You know, a present.

111
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,500
Why, are you thinking to buy it?

112
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,570
We rented one to use for revenge.

113
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,520
That's a rental, not yours.

114
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,830
I'm going to buy you a new one for yourself.

115
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,680
Especially since tomorrow is your birthday.

116
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,930
How did you know that?

117
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,700
Ahjumma, did you think I wouldn't have done a background check on you when we first met?

118
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,340
Choose.

119
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,830
You said to date and whatnot
because it was my birthday.

120
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,200
Borrowed or bought, I can just wear it.
There's no sense in spending double the money.

121
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,210
You do a date like this.

122
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,740
Where are we going?

123
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,710
We're going to a buffet.

124
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,710
This is my regular buffet spot.
It's about time that you're hungry.

125
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,830
Doctor, you try some too.

126
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,520
Come on, you're not, perhaps, thinking to
take care of a meal with this, are you?

127
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,920
- Hurry up.
- Oh, seriously.

128
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,870
How is it?

129
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,800
It's delicious. I ate well.

130
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,780
There's dessert too. This way.

131
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,470
You must be coming from somewhere
since you're dressed up so beautifully.

132
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,180
You're looking so beautiful.

133
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,170
Here, here, here. We're having a special event!

134
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,940
A 1+1 event.

135
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,700
- Here, if you buy one...
- One plus one?

136
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,730
That... If you can get two for the same price as one,
it's practically free.

137
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,550
This is a special thing. Yes, thank you.

138
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,190
- Yes, please take one.
- Wow! This was such a good deal.

139
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,580
You took such care in dressing up. And, all you
managed to get out of it was a "Buy one, get one free?"

140
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,420
It's a waste of the dress!

141
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,770
I even wore this tuxedo, but you still want to bring back the "buy one, get one free?" You didn't really need to buy toilet paper, did you?

142
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:54,430
Once it was past midnight, while we were on our date, I was planning to celebrate your birthday.

143
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,390
It's ruined, it's all spoiled!

144
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,570
Why are you throwing such precious things?

145
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,150
Anyway, you're the one who's going to use
the toilet paper that was bought.

146
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,750
And you're the one who's going to live in
the clean house that I've cleaned.

147
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,860
You're also the one who's going to eat the food that's prepared here with these things. Why are you giving me a hard time?

148
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,670
Did I ever tell you to do proper housework?
I wanted to celebrate your birthday!

149
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,640
My birthday isn't important! The "buy one, get one free"
is more important than my birthday!

150
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,540
Why isn't it important? Don't you want to be happy?

151
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,470
When someone gives, you should receive and collect what's yours. You need to do that in order to find happiness, don't you?

152
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,870
Be like other women and just go after the things you want.

153
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,320
Other women, you say?

154
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,100
This is me.

155
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,740
I go crazy for "buy one, get one free" and get excited about what I'm going to buy before I go to the market. That's me.

156
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,510
It's because I'm an ajumma. I've never used a maid
and I've never been concerned about things like my birthday.

157
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:56,500
Even now, preparing your meals, checking if business at the restaurant is good, and making porridge to take to my mom at the hospital are more urgent.

158
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,750
A birthday date? What kind of nonsense is that?

159
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,410
I did things the way I always do,
so why are you angry at me?

160
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,850
I'm Sa Geum Ran.

161
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,340
I'm Sa Geum Ran, the ajumma who's worried about housework.

162
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,740
Did I say there's anything wrong with that?

163
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,370
I know better than anyone else that you're Sa Geum Ran!

164
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,520
Ah, is that so?

165
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,800
Do you really know that so well?

166
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,680
Well then, let me ask you one thing.

167
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,890
Do you like Sara, or is it the ajumma,
Sa Geum Ran, that you like?

168
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:41,210
You can't answer me, can you?
Do you think you're different?

169
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,860
Men like women with pretty faces and nice figures.

170
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,030
You're a doctor. There would be no way that you
would like a fat ajumma like Sa Geum Ran.

171
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,020
You like Sara. But since I keep acting like ajumma,
you got angry, right?

172
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,680
That's because you like Sara, not Sa Geum Ran.

173
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,090
But what can I do? Although my external looks
have changed, I'm still Sa Geum Ran.

174
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,250
Even if you put a dress on me, and even if
I have tens of thousands of surgeries done,

175
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,250
you can't fix how I feel.

176
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,160
I have Prosecutor Han Jee Hae's bribery ledger.

177
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,860
Send that to Prosecutor Han.

178
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,790
Tell him that I want to make a deal.

179
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,550
What I want is a stay of prosecution.
I have to get out of here.

180
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,300
Yes, CEO.

181
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,700
Gyo Chae Yeon, please tell me one more time.

182
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,340
You're saying that you know Han Tae Hee very well?

183
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,310
Yes. I know him very well.

184
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,220
How do you know Han Tae Hee, Chae Yeon?

185
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,330
We grew up together... in the same house.

186
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,560
I met Oppa Tae Hee for the first time on the way
to Grandmother's house with my dad.

187
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,800
It was a country road. He looked like
he had been wandering around somewhere lost.

188
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,960
How did he look on the outside?

189
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,350
It looked like he had been through a big accident.

190
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,950
His clothes were ruined, and his shoes were torn.

191
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,680
He looked terrified.

192
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,070
My father took in Oppa Tae Hee.

193
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,090
Where he came from, what his name was...
He didn't say one word for two whole years.

194
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,140
We became just an ordinary family.

195
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,540
But the year Oppa Tae Hee turned fifteen,
my Father passed away as well.

196
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,560
After that, Oppa Tae Hee became the head of the family,

197
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,220
and he looked after me and my brother for fifteen years.

198
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,000
Gyo Chae Yeon, when you first met Han Tae Hee,

199
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,500
exactly how old was that child?

200
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,570
He was ten years old. He said he was born in 1985.

201
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,850
Oppa Tae Hee is the heir to the Winner Group.
I'm sure of it.

202
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,820
Who are you?

203
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,240
I'm Lee Kang Joon's wife. Who are you?

204
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,600
You're Lee Kang Joon's father?

205
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,280
Yes. I verified that this phone number

206
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,880
against the phone number that asked
my son to present himself

207
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,720
belongs to this police station. That's why I'm here.

208
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,620
Lee Kang Joon is a suspect
in the Sa Geum Ran murder case.

209
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,730
He was arrested and is being held at the detention center.

210
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,240
Since he's being investigated,
visits are only allowed in the afternoon.

211
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,490
Murder case...

212
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,250
Excuse me?

213
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,690
Lee Kang Joon was arrested?

214
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,580
Geum Ran's murder case?

215
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,800
Kang Joon...

216
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,640
Hello, I-In...

217
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,380
In-law. Kang Joon...

218
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,290
Forcibly admitted you into the hospital?!

219
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:24,100
He was arguing about me threatening him.
He locked me up in a hospital.

220
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,600
What he did to Mother is false imprisonment.
Mother and I are preparing a lawsuit.

221
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,400
We're not going to leave that jerk, Lee Kang Joon, alone!

222
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,760
It must be a misunderstanding, Yeo Ok.
I'm sure that's not the case.

223
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,600
You don't know because he's your son. Think about it.

224
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,480
My daughter lost everything she had and died.

225
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,570
Even if you consider only this much, isn't it strange?

226
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,130
Mother, I brought porridge.

227
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,540
You know each other?

228
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,880
Since I couldn't get in contact with Mother,
I asked her to help me.

229
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,950
Sara knows Lee Kang Joon,
so I thought she would be helpful.

230
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,950
Tell me the truth.

231
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,900
Did you kill Geum Ran?

232
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,440
It's definitely not true, Father.

233
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,190
Then what's going on? Why have you been arrested?

234
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,770
And what happened to Geum Ran's mother?

235
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,020
They said that you had Geum Ran's mother
committed to the hospital.

236
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,460
It's all a misunderstanding.

237
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,890
If by the smallest possibility, this is true,
I won't leave you alone.

238
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,900
I will never forgive you.

239
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,090
Trust your son.

240
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,810
I will be set free soon.

241
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,160
How in the world did something like this happen?

242
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,860
In the hospital room, I couldn't look your mother-in-law, Geum Ran's friend, Sara, in the face.

243
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,950
I couldn't bring myself to say that you were a murder suspect.

244
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,160
Who did you say came to Geum Ran's mother's hospital room?

245
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,640
Sara came to visit.

246
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,860
Sara did?

247
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,830
Winner Group HBS

248
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,950
I'll be going now.

249
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,920
- You should sleep.
- Okay.

250
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,820
Thank you.

251
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,040
Tomorrow is Geum Ran's birthday.

252
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,500
If she were alive, I could at least
have celebrated her birthday.

253
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,310
Now who will take care of her?

254
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,790
That she died without receiving love...

255
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,510
I feel so heartbroken.

256
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,970
I'm sure she met someone nice in Heaven.

257
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,310
It's possible that someone remembered her birthday.

258
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,370
Do you think that's so?

259
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,000
Of course. Geum Ran always gave to other people.

260
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,760
Now, it's Geum Ran's turn to be happy.

261
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,730
Please.

262
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,960
Geum Ran.

263
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,810
At least starting now, you should be happy.

264
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,520
Okay?

265
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,430
Aigoo, this ajumma.

266
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:34,770
I tried to take care of her on her birthday and she
prepared my food. Everyday with the food, food.

267
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:42,420
Doctor, do you like Sara or the ajumma, Sa Geum Ran.

268
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,440
You can't answer, right?

269
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,590
Oh, man. Why couldn't I answer then?

270
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,030
From ajumma's viewpoint, it's worth getting angry over.

271
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,030
♫  It wasn't there,  ♫

272
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,790
♫  It's not sadness either,  ♫

273
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:13,400
♫  It hurts for no reason, and I feel empty,  ♫

274
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,240
♫  I don't know why,  ♫

275
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,210
♫  It feels like my heart has opened,  ♫

276
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,780
♫  Nothing is enjoyable,  ♫

277
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,700
Aiyoo, it's past time for ajumma to come home.
Why hasn't she return?

278
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,610
No matter how much she says she doesn't need it, it's her birthday.

279
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,940
I have to take care of it for her.

280
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,270
♫  I must have liked you,  ♫

281
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,970
Geum Ran,

282
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,610
even starting now, be happy.

283
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,880
Happiness.

284
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:07,890
♫ I know all parts of your face because I love you. ♫

285
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,400
We're meeting for the fifth time.

286
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,940
What's going on?

287
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,940
I took into account the possible rudeness
and still found out your address.

288
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,750
I congratulate you on your first broadcast tomorrow.

289
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,000
You're really a fan, knowing my schedule even.

290
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,050
It's an ocarina.

291
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:45,480
People of ancient times believed that if you blew on
this ocarina your wishes will come true.

292
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,220
I also made my wishes while touching that ocarina,
when I was young.

293
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,800
What kind of wish was it?

294
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,890
To be sure to ascend to the position
which I've made as my goal.

295
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,070
How can you give away an object
that has such memory for you to me?

296
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:06,720
It's my declaration that I will show you
myself accomplishing my goal.

297
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,020
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to live diligently,

298
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,880
so that I'm not fired from the company.

299
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,820
That's right. You can't be fired.

300
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,030
Yes, I'll do so.

301
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,090
What is this?

302
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,230
Who is she chatting with over there?

303
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,210
It must be nice to be so popular,
now that she's famous.

304
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,730
12:00

305
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,370
Aiyoo, it's her birthday!

306
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,780
Fighting!

307
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,200
I'm home!

308
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,060
Doctor!

309
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,890
Ajumma, you must like flowers too.

310
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,310
What are you doing?

311
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,920
Seaweed soup?

312
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,970
For my birthday?

313
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,670
It seemed like you were angry, but what's going on?

314
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,370
What birthday.

315
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,640
Today is the day I visit Grandmother.

316
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,980
I'm seeing her after twenty years. So do you think
I'm nervous or not?! Of course I would be!

317
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,940
The component in the seaweed helps
the blood to circulate well.

318
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,480
And I'm trying to eat it to relieve my nervousness. Why?

319
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,190
Is that right?

320
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,030
Then, since it has nothing to do with my birthday,
I won't thank you.

321
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,430
Let's try it.

322
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh, hey. It's delicious.

323
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,220
I've prepared meal tables for fifteen years already.
Come on now.

324
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,210
Try preparing one occasionally. It's nice to eat
what someone else has prepared once in a while.

325
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,220
Like you asked me, I'll ask you one thing.

326
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,160
Ajumma, what do you think of me?

327
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:11,360
If your conclusion is that I like Sara
and not Sa Geum Ran,

328
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,900
then, what do you feel? You put makeup on
at night because of me.

329
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,990
And there was something between us.

330
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,870
Tell me truthfully.

331
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,470
What's that? What is it all?!

332
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,210
I'm a married woman.

333
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,230
What?

334
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,760
Legally, Sa Geum Ran is Lee Kang Joon's wife.

335
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,720
Since I'm still listed as missing, they couldn't report me
as deceased and that's why everything is still valid.

336
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,410
So, how can a legally married woman think of you,
in terms of a man?

337
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,260
It's true that my heart was moved by you,

338
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,290
but I'm a married woman.

339
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,880
My heart shouldn't be moved.

340
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,490
Ajumma, your marriage is already shattered.

341
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,240
It's not shattered legally.

342
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,230
I will save you.

343
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:19,880
In this area, I'm the experienced one
who has experienced love and marriage, so

344
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,620
I'll give you one tip.

345
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:29,200
Change your thinking to my being Sa Geum Ran.

346
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,190
You'll probably come to dislike me.

347
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:41,200
You won't embrace or clean away the flour from my face.

348
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,280
You don't want to cook?!

349
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,120
Hey, you're the daughter-in-law and
we're the family you married into.

350
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,530
Then you're saying that you'll only eat and not cook?!

351
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,050
Yes, I don't have the time to cook or eat.

352
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,630
Hey!

353
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:13,010
If you were going to just do whatever you wanted,
why did you come back into this house?!

354
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,370
I told you.

355
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:22,020
I didn't come to act the proper daughter-in-law.
I came back because I couldn't divorce.

356
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,210
I have a lot of personal things that are
keeping me busy, especially today.

357
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,950
I'll leave for work.

358
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,750
Omo, omo, omo.

359
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,310
Omo, oh my word.

360
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,490
Omo, look at her.

361
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,430
Will you be okay, seeing Grandmother?

362
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,480
Should we delay it a bit?

363
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,130
No.

364
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,950
She'll want to see me. I have to see her.

365
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,840
You're going to stay next to me, right?

366
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,150
Of course. I'm going to save you this time also.

367
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,690
Hold it. I'll pay the proper cost of breakfast.

368
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,770
Grandmother.

369
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,650
Grandmother. I brought proof that I'm Dong Geul.

370
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,330
I'll do it.

371
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,280
No.

372
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,820
No, Dong Geul.

373
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:00,770
How could I not recognize you?

374
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,490
I recognize you.

375
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,910
I recognize you.

376
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:12,110
I recognize my grandson.

377
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,250
I'm sorry that I couldn't come to

378
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,870
find you all this time.

379
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:37,270
Okay, I'm okay. It's fine.

380
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:43,690
I thought that I'd have to die to get to see you, but
since I see you while I'm alive, my wish has come true.

381
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,640
It's fine.

382
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,290
I'm okay now.

383
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,460
I'll rescue you.

384
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,150
I will definitely get you out of here, no matter what.

385
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,690
Winner Group

386
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:36,250
It's correct that your Broken Heart syndrome was overcome today in front of your grandmother, right?

387
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,380
Yeah.

388
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,800
You did great. You really did a great job.

389
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,060
What if . . . I'm just saying . . .

390
00:34:53,350 --> 00:35:01,030
What if I see you in Sa Geum Ran's image and
said I like you, what would you do?

391
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:05,260
Yeah right, fat chance.

392
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,000
I said, what if.

393
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,640
If, by chance, I like Sa Geum Ran,

394
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,560
can you forget the fact that you are a married woman?

395
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:24,230
Also, think hard about whether you can forget about that.

396
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,870
Winner Group

397
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,940
What did Prosecutor Han say,
after looking at the bribery ledger?

398
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,970
He said he would look into your case.

399
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,670
There's one more job for you to do.
There's a woman named Sara.

400
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:15,280
She's the one on the "Big Hit: Birth of a Chef" program.
Look into her background.

401
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,320
If you find anything suspicious about her,
let me know immediately.

402
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,010
I understand.

403
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,090
Min Hyeok! Han Tae Hee is coming
to the Winner Group headquarters!

404
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,030
Also, he summoned the shareholders!

405
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,430
The ones who supported you as CEO, all of them!

406
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,650
If Han Tae Hee is really the heir,
the story changes, doesn't it?

407
00:36:54,650 --> 00:37:01,200
We have to be cautious. What's certain is that we have to postpone confirming General Manager Han Min Hyeok as the CEO.

408
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,510
I was wondering where everyone was gathered.
You were all here, right?

409
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:24,420
If Han Tae Hee is the heir, you will immediately take his side.

410
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,040
Then, I also shouldn't forget . . .

411
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,160
Which of you had no fear.

412
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,260
I didn't even call for you, yet you came on your own.

413
00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:01,420
Han Min Hyeok, even though I didn't invite you,
since you're already here, I should give you a gift.

414
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,640
Team leader Choi.

415
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,570
Yes, CEO.

416
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:12,960
My grandmother stored the DNA necklace in a bank's safe.

417
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:20,840
Arguing whether or not I'm Dong Geul is a waste of time.
So, in order to move on to the next step quickly,

418
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,620
I brought the results of the DNA test.

419
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:44,850
Han Dong Hoon and Han Tae Hee,
the STR DNA inside their samples...

420
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:55,330
The probability that Han Dong Hoon and
Han Tae Hee is the same individual is 99.99%.

421
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,710
What should we do?!

422
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:05,600
When he wanted to reclaim Winner Group,
I expected as much.

423
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:11,140
The largest shareholder is the Cultural Foundation (grandmother's share) and the second largest holder is me.

424
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,380
So, he's still just a beggar who officially has no shares.

425
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,580
I'll have to take action.

426
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,120
Ajumma, are you preparing well for the live broadcast?

427
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,570
Aren't you nervous?

428
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,160
Nervous? Why would I be nervous?
This is just a place to eat.

429
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,390
All I have to do is eat. I can do it even in my sleep.

430
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:44,260
Ajumma, you know what I said in the parking garage?

431
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:48,150
If my heart is the same, even if I see you
as Sa Geum Ran,

432
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:54,000
and if you can also forget the fact that
you're a married woman, later on at 10 pm,

433
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,420
let's meet at the Bridge of Wishes at Sky Park.

434
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,520
You mean the place where lovers have their
wishes come true if they wish it there?

435
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,510
What happens if we meet there?

436
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,250
What do you mean by what happens?

437
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,920
We are dating then.

438
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,670
Dating?

439
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,460
Do I have to say it again?!

440
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,030
That's right, dating. Let's date!

441
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:24,460
Anyway, think it over well also.

442
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,710
Alright, do well!

443
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,540
Dating? With Sara?

444
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:38,850
He knows that she's an ajumma
and Kang Joon's previous wife.

445
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,050
Is he saying that he's going to date ajumma even now?

446
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,350
Gosh, this ajumma.

447
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,970
There's nothing easy about her.

448
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,980
Chae Yeon.

449
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,760
Oh, Oppa!

450
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,580
Dating?

451
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,030
Does that make sense? Really dating?

452
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,460
You said it was a live broadcast.
So do you have time to talk?

453
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,960
You should go in.

454
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,350
Oppa, after you're finished today,
make some time for me.

455
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,120
Why?

456
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,720
I have a personal problem that I want to discuss with you.

457
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,680
I'm having a difficult time these days. I need you.

458
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,480
Oppa, that woman is an ajumma.

459
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,790
And Oppa, why didn't you tell me? About Winner Group?

460
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:55,680
It would have been nice if you had, at least,
told me beforehand. I was so surprised.

461
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,880
Chae Yeon, how about tomorrow?
I'll meet you with Ji Hoon.

462
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,450
Where the best cook is chosen, "Birth of a Chef".

463
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:13,730
Today's challenger is Lilac Hotel's head chef, Han Gook Jin.

464
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:23,980
With fifteen other members, the food blogger
who debuted on "Big Hit",

465
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,180
Internet "Eating Broadcaster" star, Sara.

466
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:37,710
Sara, how is Han Gook Jin's bibimbap?

467
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,920
To begin with, the chili paste has definitely
been made in the traditional way.

468
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,520
The way daikon and "GoenDooRi" matches,
it's a match made in heaven.

469
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,130
The fact that he made this into bibimbap is really the best!

470
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:00,280
Wow, you finished it all?

471
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:06,220
If one leaves leftovers, it's sinful.

472
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,600
You really eat well.

473
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,940
You've worked hard.

474
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,250
You've worked hard.

475
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,690
As soon as you went on air,
the response towards you was heated.

476
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,410
Everyone likes you for your good-natured ajumma style.

477
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,990
Ah, is that so? It worked out well.

478
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:35,020
See you again next week. Thank you for your trouble.

479
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:41,240
Sara, may I see you?

480
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,450
Han Tae Hee?

481
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,440
I know that you both live in the same house.

482
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,140
Is that so?

483
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,800
I'm also running a restaurant together with him.

484
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,010
Thanks to you, I was introduced to him
at a family meeting and we became close.

485
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,960
- Why?
- You liar.

486
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,860
Get off of Oppa Tae Hee.

487
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,960
Who are you to interfere like that?

488
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,910
The fate betweenTae Hee Oppa and me
is twenty years. We're family.

489
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,690
No, it means more than that.

490
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:25,990
I can't stand seeing a woman like you
hanging around Oppa Tae Hee.

491
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:32,160
Is this how much you worried about Han Tae Hee that you studied abroad with his money and seduced a married man?

492
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:38,430
But why are you, suddenly, worrying about Han Tae Hee?
I'm really curious about the reason.

493
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:43,560
You only used Han Tae Hee. What did you do for him?

494
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,300
Who are you to dare ask that question?

495
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,510
Don't give me any advice or warning.

496
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:53,180
No matter what you say, I won't be listening.

497
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,110
Didn't you want Kang Joon?
Why is it, suddenly, Oppa Tae Hee?

498
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:06,900
Speaking of which, why are you, suddenly, after Han Tae Hee? Something must've come up that you want to use him for.

499
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:12,400
I must have hit the mark.

500
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,260
I don't have the greed to become happy.

501
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,740
However, for bad people like you,

502
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,670
I have many thoughts of chasing you
to the very end and punishing you.

503
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,040
I never want to leave you alone.

504
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,170
Oh, Sara!

505
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,980
Is everything okay?

506
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,010
Yes, it's okay.

507
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,340
Doctor, the restaurant grand opening is at 5 o'clock,

508
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,880
so I'll rest a bit at home and then go.

509
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,980
What are you doing?

510
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,230
I'm in the middle of hypnotizing myself.

511
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,470
- What kind of hypnosis?
- Ajumma is

512
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,660
Sa Geum Ran.

513
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:23,230
I am... Sa Geum Ran?

514
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:25,380
I will soon open my eyes.

515
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,380
The woman in front of me isn't Sara.

516
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,380
It's Sa Geum Ran.

517
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,330
Is that so?

518
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,500
Try opening your eyes.

519
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,040
Okay.

520
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,220
I'm opening my eyes, Ajumma.

521
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:09,910
Do you really see me as Sa Geum Ran?

522
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,990
Oh! Oh, Ajumma.

523
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:16,090
I see Ajumma as Sa Geum Ran.

524
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:18,950
Really? How is it?

525
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,750
Are you okay?

526
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:26,000
Oh... I'm okay.

527
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,040
Wow.

528
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,870
So you really see me as Sa Geum Ran?

529
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,730
Doctor?

530
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,150
I'm going to do some cleaning.

531
00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:03,650
♫ Yaay, yaay, yaay, what's wrong with age? ♫

532
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:10,380
♫ Is there an age for love? ♫

533
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,750
Oh, really...

534
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,120
Don't come near me!

535
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,830
I said don't come near me!

536
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:39,700
Why, Doctor? Do you hate it
because I'm Sa Geum Ran?

537
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,410
But you liked it last time.

538
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,330
N-No! Not that I hate it.

539
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,990
I like it, that's why I'm saying don't come near me.

540
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:53,370
I'm worried about my instincts.
I might become a beast.

541
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,040
Really?

542
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,980
Then...

543
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:03,180
Try becoming a beast.

544
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:09,490
Why are you like this? Stop it.
Why are you being like this?

545
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:20,810
I shouldn't be this flustered. I'm a rational person!

546
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:25,900
When I see a woman's body, I'm not a single-celled
amoeba that shows a biological reaction!

547
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,280
Still, this is a horror that I never imagined.

548
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,020
Doctor.

549
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,890
I'm going to practice Kama Sutra.

550
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,820
Can you check my posture for me?

551
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,770
- Kama Sutra!
- Okay?

552
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:47,470
No way!

553
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:52,840
Don't come. I can't

554
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,020
I can do it. No, I can't!

555
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,270
Doctor, can you hold me?

556
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,630
I have to hold you?

557
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,680
Right, I have to hold you for your posture to be good.

558
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:21,060
Why? Does it wake you up from your dream?

559
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,910
No!

560
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:28,460
I'm different from the men Ajumma is thinking of.

561
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:53,740
Ajumma, I need the washroom. I'll be right back.

562
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:02,410
Doctor! Do you want to bake bread together?

563
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:10,740
Doctor?

564
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,430
I'm mixing the dough, but it's so tiring.

565
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:18,110
Can you help me mix it?

566
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,110
You can do it well by yourself though.

567
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:28,140
You did it for me before, didn't you?
Please help me a bit.

568
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,560
Is that so?

569
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,910
Okay, I'll do it.

570
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:39,950
You've come to your senses, right?

571
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:43,330
Because you're thinking of me as Sa Geum Ran.

572
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,980
Oh, well

573
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,180
it's not like I don't know you from before, Ajumma.

574
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:53,360
Is there anything from which I should suddenly
come to my senses? I'm just a bit surprised,

575
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,720
and slightly shocked.

576
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,870
It's okay, Doctor.

577
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,270
There's nothing for you to be sorry for.

578
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:05,570
I'm used to men not being charmed by me.

579
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:15,870
There was a reason why my husband
married me as soon as he liked me too.

580
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:18,580
When will this kind of opportunity come?

581
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:23,460
With those thoughts, I gave him the land
and settled on what I wanted to do.

582
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,820
I got married when I had the chance.

583
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,020
I was starved for love.

584
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,120
Doctor,

585
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:40,820
thank you for thinking about planning
something for my birthday.

586
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:45,630
Truthfully I felt sad for you, while watching you
plan my birthday.

587
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,310
Why sad?

588
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,890
Ajumma, is this a time for you to be
worrying about others?

589
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:56,330
You've never had anyone plan for your birthday, right?

590
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:59,350
You grew up in another family from the time you were ten.

591
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:03,740
And you became the head of the house
when you were fifteen.

592
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,700
Who would have planned something for your birthday?

593
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,240
Doctor,

594
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,990
you know how it hurts when nobody

595
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:22,100
plans for your birthday.

596
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,670
So you planning something for me,

597
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,040
and getting angry at me too.

598
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,700
I know that feeling more than anyone.

599
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,480
So I'm accepting your thoughts with gratitude.

600
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:53,850
You have flour on your face.

601
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:58,050
- Really?
- Come over

602
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,070
I'll wipe it for you.

603
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,960
There is a man living in Sara's house.

604
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,620
A man?

605
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,270
Sara had a man?

606
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:55,430
I want to be your woman.

607
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,810
I love you.

608
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,020
What's going on?

609
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,500
President,

610
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,560
Detective Hwang contacted me.

611
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,570
They say that your stay of prosecution
will soon be announced.

612
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,710
You will soon come out from this place.

613
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:22,590
If a man and woman stay together,
they can grow fond of each other.

614
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,460
But that's not love.

615
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,580
Kang Joon and now Tae Hee Oppa?

616
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:34,270
Sa Geum Ran, I can't allow a trivial woman
like you have anyone.

617
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,460
You're a fake.

618
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:41,790
Tae Hee Oppa will come if I call for him, at any time.

619
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,440
Ah, Ji Hoon.

620
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,030
Chae Yeon was hurt?

621
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:58,290
No, she says she didn't get hurt badly. But I think
she got scared because she is tender-hearted.

622
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:02,090
Hyung, I still have two surgeries left.
Can you go for me?

623
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:04,180
Tae Hee Oppa is coming?

624
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:07,210
Yeah. Okay, Oppa.

625
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:34,150
Although I don't know who you pressured,
this isn't the end for you.

626
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,720
There was a man hanging around Sara's house.

627
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,820
If you're involved in this, Sara, I'll not let you off.

628
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,230
Ajumma, it's me.

629
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,990
Later at 10 o'clock. Don't forget.

630
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:15,320
Doctor, what will you do?

631
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,870
Me?

632
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,620
I've already decided what I'm going to do at 10 o'clock.

633
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,530
You will come?

634
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:27,120
Yeah. I'm going to go. I know how I feel.

635
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:32,360
As you said, even though I saw you as
Sa Geum Ran, I wasn't liking only Sara.

636
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,260
Now, let's celebrate your birthday.

637
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:40,240
Anyway, since it's later at 10 o'clock, think it over
and decide whether you're showing up or not.

638
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:10,920
Chae Yeon! Chae Yeon!

639
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:16,920
Tae Hee Oppa.

640
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,700
I heard you got hurt. How much did you get hurt, huh?

641
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,320
It's gotten a whole lot better.

642
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,450
Thank you, Oppa, for coming out so far.

643
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:28,070
Give me the car keys. I'll drive you.

644
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,270
Just a little while later.

645
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:34,150
My stomach isn't feeling well since the
car accident a moment ago.

646
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,550
- Is that right?
- After being inside the car, I feel chilled.

647
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:42,180
Oppa, should we go to a cafe somewhere?

648
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,110
Buy me some coffee.

649
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,490
Chae Yeon, I have an appointment today.

650
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:53,080
Do you like Sa Geum Ran, Oppa? For real?

651
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,650
Since my car also has to go to Seoul,
I called Team leader Choi. He'll be here soon.

652
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,150
Just wait here for a little bit.

653
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,000
Alone?

654
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:05,140
Oppa, I don't want to do that.

655
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:33,130
I'm going to show up. I know how I feel.

656
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,870
Geum Ran.

657
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:40,720
Be happy from now on.

658
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,190
- Team leader Choi.
- Yes, CEO.

659
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:33,280
Please take care of Chae Yeon.

660
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,640
Chae Yeon, since I'm late for my appointment, I'll be going.

661
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:41,200
He's the best driver, so don't worry. I've leaving first.

662
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:44,480
Have a good trip.

663
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:55,240
Instead of CEO Han Tae Hee,
I'll escort you safely to Seoul.

664
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:26,640
Don't wait for Tae Hee because he's with me right now.

665
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,180
Aiyoo, this stupid battery, seriously.

666
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,710
It's already this late.

667
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,640
Ajumma, you have to wait.

668
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,430
Ajumma!

669
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,420
Ajumma!

670
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:07,300
Ajumma!

671
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,460
Ajumma!

672
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,080
Ajumma!

673
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,020
Ajumma.

674
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,270
Ajumma!

675
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:33,610
What is this? Ajumma, did you leave?

676
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:36,130
I ended up coming too late.

677
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:41,910
How can a legally married woman
think of you in terms of a man?

678
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,000
I'm a married woman.

679
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,950
I can't allow my heart to waver.

680
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,360
You didn't come, Ajumma.

681
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,670
Ajumma.

682
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:07,180
♫ Even if I am not happy in the end ♫

683
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:13,610
♫ My heart will follow going your way  ♫

684
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:14,940
Ajumma?

685
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,410
♫ You are the reason I am living ♫

686
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,120
Ajumma!

687
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:34,320
♫ Even if hoping is my everything ♫

688
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:41,080
♫ Love is not something you can put into your hands ♫

689
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:47,230
Ajumma, what are you doing here?!

690
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:49,860
How long have you been sitting here?!

691
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,150
What were you doing, waiting foolishly until now?!

692
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:02,350
Since you said you would come, I waited.

693
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:05,610
See? You came.

694
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:09,160
Aigo, this ajumma

695
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,180
Look at how cold your hands are.

696
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:17,760
I might end up dying trying to make
preparations for your birthday.

697
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,220
You're going to freeze to death!

698
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:30,350
It's okay about my birthday.

699
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:33,170
I can just live like I usually did.

700
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,850
What's so important about my birthday?

701
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,790
No.

702
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,470
From now, I'm going to take care of it.

703
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:55,220
Anyway, my birthday has passed.

704
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:59,820
For us, there is still a minute left
to celebrate your birthday.

705
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,250
Happy Birthday!

706
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,430
Sa Geum Ran.
