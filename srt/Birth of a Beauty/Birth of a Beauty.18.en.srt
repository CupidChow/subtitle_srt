00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,770
Episode 18

2
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,410
The car has arrived.

3
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,660
Please help me, Director.

4
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,560
Han Tae Hee is doing that because of me.

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,780
Just help him to overcome this crisis.

6
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,710
I will use all my power to save Tae Hee.

7
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,400
in exchange, you must accept my offer.

8
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,150
It's almost time for the event. Let's hurry.

9
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,950
Sara, let's go.

10
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,660
What happened? When did you come to Seoul?

11
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,200
Talk to me.

12
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,780
CEO Han Tae Hee, it's rude to delay someone
who has a prior appointment.

13
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,310
How about talking next time?

14
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,640
Sara, let's go.

15
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,080
Talk with me!

16
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,620
If you want, my mother and I will head out first.

17
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,660
No. Let's go together.

18
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,590
I have nothing to talk about.

19
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,610
♫ When I'm looking at you like this,  ♫

20
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:33,960
♫  My heart grows deaf as if it has fallen into a deep sleep, ♫

21
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,320
♫ I don't think I can let you go,  ♫

22
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:49,670
♫ I can do anything else, but that's the only thing I can't do.  ♫

23
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:56,520
♫ I hesitated for a long time; I sighed endlessly. ♫

24
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:03,730
♫ I hate myself who can't say anything and just turned away. ♫

25
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:11,410
♫ How can I forget you? How can I erase you? ♫

26
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:18,450
♫ I can't stand a single moment without you. ♫

27
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:27,090
♫ My heart hurts too much, I can't let you go like this ♫

28
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:34,470
♫ I'll wait for you always; though it hurts, it's okay.  ♫

29
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,550
It seems like President Jeong,
from Han Sang Group, has arrived.

30
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,260
I'll introduce you to him.

31
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,730
Yes, Mother.

32
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,110
At today's event, the spotlight will be focused upon you and Min Hyeok.

33
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,760
Please take care of our Min Hyeok well.

34
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,370
Your life will change because of this event.

35
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,860
You will receive the spotlight with me and start anew as a model.

36
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,690
General Manager . . .

37
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,610
The condition, under which I accepted your offer,
is for Han Tae Hee's safety.

38
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,770
The labor union reporting Han Tae Hee to the Prosecutor's Office is definitely going to be taken care of, right?

39
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,880
Secretary Jeong, make an appointment
with the leader of the labor union.

40
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,200
Yes.

41
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,510
Don't worry. Even more than our promise,
Tae Hee is my family.

42
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,400
Let's go.

43
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,030
Han Min Hyeok got Sara to accompany him
to the businessmen's dinner?

44
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,510
Who is he to accompany Sara?!

45
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,420
They say that she's the new model for
General Manager Han Min Hyeok's business.

46
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,010
Sara has signed the contract.

47
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,820
Yes, Labor Union Leader Jeong Yoon Cheul.

48
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,590
I like being alone.

49
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,990
You wanted to be alone, yet you contacted Han Min Hyeok?

50
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,040
Why him of all people?!

51
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,900
We're over.

52
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,770
So, is there a need for me to explain?

53
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,050
Geum Ran, your picture with
Director Han Min Hyeok is all over the Internet.

54
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,690
Han Tae Hee must have seen it too.

55
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,640
Actually, I met him at the company.

56
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,750
Oh, it must have been hard for you.

57
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,460
The further he is from me, the safer he is.

58
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,080
You've come home?

59
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,990
Geum Ran, how was it today?

60
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,740
Do you think something would've happened in one day?

61
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,520
I'm like this because of that Lee Kang Joon.

62
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,470
Fortunately, since people know who I am,
he won't be able to do anything for a while.

63
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,350
I'm going to confirm if Lee Kang Joon tried to kill Han Tae Hee.

64
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,280
If that's true, I need to make sure he is judged by the law.

65
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,290
You don't know what that jerk, Lee Kang Joon, might do to you!

66
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,560
That's right. Be careful, Geum Ran.

67
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,410
I've checked Sara's situation, as you've asked.

68
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,310
She's working as a model starting from today.

69
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,970
And, there's an employee
who claims to have seen her on the eighth floor.

70
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,700
I wanted to meet you because there's an offer I want to make.

71
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,780
I will cancel the application for bankruptcy for Winner Food,

72
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,250
if you don't report CEO Han Tae Hee
to the Prosecutor's Office.

73
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,540
Why are you saying something so different?

74
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,670
What are you telling us to do?

75
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,660
I will give three months worth of salary
to everyone in the labor union.

76
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,690
Also,

77
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,020
this is the compensation.

78
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,180
I have decided to save Winner Food.

79
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,160
Headquarters will support me, so just wait and trust me.

80
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,830
What happened, regarding the matter of
reporting Han Tae Hee for prosecution?

81
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,460
We decided not to report him for prosecution.

82
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,860
Please help Representative Han Tae Hee a lot.
He'll do well.

83
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,910
Do what well?

84
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,420
It's been a long time since he stopped working at the company.

85
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,920
To release a new product, he will try his hardest.

86
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,930
He doesn't even come to work and show himself,
much less get ready to release a new product.

87
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,200
This will let us put food in our mouths for now, but

88
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,020
I don't see any hope.

89
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,220
Do I have to go to Han Min Hyeok's office, in order to see you?

90
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,940
As you said, we're over, so I won't interfere.

91
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,330
But let me ask one thing.
What's the reason that it had to be Han Min Hyeok?

92
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,820
Have you given up on Winner Food?

93
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,210
Are you not doing anything in the company?

94
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,480
Just answer the questions I ask.
Why is it Han Min Hyeok?

95
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,210
Because he has ability.

96
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,630
I think he's the most capable of helping me achieve my goal.

97
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,780
Not me?

98
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,810
Look at yourself now.
What have you been doing at the company?

99
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,880
- Do it in moderation, Ajumma!
- Reality is reality.

100
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,880
I'm going to clean up my past and live a new life.

101
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,700
I'm only concerned about my future and nothing else.

102
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,390
That's why I need someone, like Han Min Hyeok, who has ability!

103
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,390
It's not you.

104
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,720
You only see people with ability, just to reach your goals?

105
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,370
I didn't know you were such a cold person.

106
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,650
I hope you'll achieve that great goal of yours.

107
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,120
Good luck with Han Min Hyeok.

108
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,950
Sara has showed up at Headquarters?

109
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,950
I think she'll come often.

110
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,310
For General Manager Han Min Hyeok's new business,
Sara is the model.

111
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,970
Han Min Hyeok has ability?

112
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,080
Oppa, Sara went to an event with
General Manager Han Min Hyeok?

113
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,750
How can she do this?

114
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,260
Even the studying abroad was a lie. We were all fooled!

115
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,570
If I'm so flustered like this, how must you feel?

116
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,540
It's hard, right?

117
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,960
You probably have a lot of things to do,
and you've been betrayed by Sara.

118
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,290
Chae Yeon,

119
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,890
don't talk about Sara in front of me.

120
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,330
I'm going to only focus on Winner Food from now on.

121
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,540
And tell Grandmother not to worry.

122
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,250
Sara has become Min Hyeok's business partner?

123
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,050
The person she chose, as soon as she and Oppa Tae Hee
broke up, was General Manager Han Min Hyeok.

124
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,460
That rude girl.

125
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,400
What does she take our family for?

126
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,390
Ever since Sara's return, some things
have gotten better, Grandmother.

127
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,650
It seems that Oppa Tae Hee has completely
given up on his feelings for Sara.

128
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,000
He said that he will focus only on Winner Foods from now on.

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,270
The Board of Director's meeting is coming up soon.

130
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,500
Tae Hee must be elected as the CEO candidate.

131
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,620
Until Tae Hee becomes the CEO,

132
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,410
you need to help him a lot, Chae Yeon.

133
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,960
Yes, Grandmother.

134
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,010
That's good.

135
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,240
What could Kang Joon be doing
that he's not answering his phone?

136
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,990
When I think of the black box footage of him
following Geum Ran, it makes me shudder.

137
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,470
While we're completely bewildered,
what is he off doing by himself?

138
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,810
Why don't you try calling Oppa's company?

139
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,640
Should I do that?

140
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,630
Yes, I'm calling from President Lee Kang Joon's home.

141
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,580
Is President Lee Kang Joon at work right now?

142
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,150
Excuse me? Kang Joon is...

143
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,160
receiving disciplinary action? Suspension?

144
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,790
Producer Kim, this is Gyo Chae Yeon.
Can we meet briefly tomorrow?

145
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,590
I have something to discuss with you
regarding the talk show guests.

146
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,620
There's someone I really want to recommend.

147
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,300
Yes, then I'll see you tomorrow to discuss it.

148
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,310
Sa Geum Ran, try to get to the highest point.

149
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,290
Making you fall from that point is the ultimate goal of my plan.

150
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,100
Kang Joon, how is it that you are suspended?
For goodness sake, what are you doing?

151
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,120
Things keep getting tangled up. I'm really frustrated too!

152
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,340
Then you need to plan countermeasures with your family.

153
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,190
What is it that you need to do that's making you run around?

154
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,930
It's because I can't talk about it with the family.

155
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,450
Sara is the key.

156
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,750
What are you saying? How is Sara involved?

157
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,330
Sara, birth of Winner Group's Cinderella?

158
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,080
Sara, birth of a Cinderella?

159
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,140
The lightning speed selection of
the model for Winner Group's new business.

160
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,320
Birth of Winner Group's Cinderella, who is Sara?

161
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,220
Secretary Jeong, this is Lee Kang Joon.

162
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,130
Do you, by chance, know Sara's schedule for tomorrow?

163
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,280
I have something to discuss with her
regarding Birth of a Chef. Yes.

164
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,410
I got it.

165
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,240
- You're going to do all of this?
- I'm only going to work from now on.

166
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,890
Work doesn't betray you like "somebody," and
work doesn't stab you in the back like "somebody," either.

167
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,230
Still, if you schedule this much work...

168
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,600
So what?

169
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,900
So that I don't have a chance to think about anything else,
I'm just going all-in with work for the foreseeable future

170
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,970
I'll accelerate the development of the new rice ball product
and devote myself to saving the company!

171
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,480
We don't have a chef,

172
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,480
since Sara can't help anymore.

173
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,180
We can hire another chef.
Anyway, I'm the one who'll be judging the taste.

174
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,370
Go find out how many employees of
Winner Food we can mobilize.

175
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,700
Yes.

176
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,740
Sara as a guest on our talk show?

177
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,870
She's Winner Group's billboard model and a Cinderella.

178
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,510
She's also beautiful.

179
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,130
Sara is a good choice, but the issue is the conversation topic.

180
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,260
Don't worry, I have a conversation topic.

181
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,910
First, I'll need to discuss it with the higher ups.

182
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,000
We are currently unable to receive assistance
from any of the divisions of Winner Food.

183
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,210
In a word, no one wants any part of it.

184
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:05,170
- What about the Development Team?
- The entire staff of the Development Team is uncooperative.

185
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,930
Sheesh, I could just make those rice balls, don't you think?

186
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,390
First, let's go to the Development Room.
We'll see if the new product launch is a possibility.

187
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,980
But CEO...

188
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,810
We'll need to obtain all the ingredients and cooking equipment.

189
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,460
Let me go!

190
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,660
Follow me.

191
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,200
What are you doing? Are you going to kidnap me?

192
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,060
That's fine too. You're not going anywhere today.

193
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,900
Follow me. Follow me!

194
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,590
Ah, let go!

195
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,800
General Manager Min Hyeok?

196
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,380
Do not allow reporters inside
when Sara is doing the pictorial shoot.

197
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,980
And report Sara's complete schedule to me first.

198
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,520
I understand.

199
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,160
Sara.

200
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,970
Winner Food

201
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,320
Sir, we can do well on our own, right?

202
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,570
Throw away any thoughts that we can't do it.

203
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,930
It's your first magazine shoot, so I should go with you.

204
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,180
Sara, please get in.

205
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,900
Are things going well at Winner Foods?

206
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,050
General Manager Han Min Hyeok.

207
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:15,260
I'm not sure if you're meddling in everything
because you have the ability,

208
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,390
but I wish you would stop concerning
yourself with Winner Food.

209
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,560
It's not at all welcome.

210
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,400
Someone once said, "Meddling is not a good thing."

211
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,980
The Board of Director's meeting is this coming Monday.

212
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:39,010
If you need anything, just tell me.
Headquarters will support you.

213
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,310
Sara, let's go.

214
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,230
Sara, you will be the main model for this brand.

215
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:28,690
When I was doing the merger and acquisition of Winner Fashion,
I was happy because I thought of you.

216
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,530
I felt that the image was a match with you.

217
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:34,320
Expanding by two subsidiaries,

218
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,740
is it under consideration at the Board Of Director's meeting?

219
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,820
Tae Hee is in charge of Winner Food,
and I'm working for Winner Fashion and Winner Food.

220
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,460
If we both appeal to them with our initiative,
one person will be picked by the Board of Directors.

221
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,670
The one person who is chosen will become Winner Group's CEO.

222
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:55,100
The well intentioned competition between Tae Hee
and myself will help Winner Group to grow.

223
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,800
The clothing for the magazine shoot is ready.

224
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,840
Would you like to check it?

225
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,250
There are no workers, and the lights went out?

226
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,030
It doesn't seem like the heating works either.

227
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,430
It's really chilly.

228
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,510
First, let's find a chef.

229
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,750
Bring me a list of the chefs who have been on Birth of a Chef.

230
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,730
We have to ask them for help until we release our new product.

231
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,920
Yes, I'll look into it right away.

232
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,570
Sara, give us a big smile.

233
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,900
Sara, give us a cute expression this time.
♫ I'm in love with you ♫

234
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,060
Good

235
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,810
♫ Was the sky always so pretty and blue? ♫

236
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:13,350
♫ Even when I watch a sad movie, I laugh. ♫

237
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,900
General Manager, this is Sara's itinerary
from the PR and Marketing teams.

238
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,620
She has interviews scheduled every day.

239
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,780
While making Sara a star,

240
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,740
our goal is to bring up our brand's image.

241
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,520
Sara, good work.

242
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,890
Good work.

243
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,960
Everyone has worked hard.

244
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,460
This is the first message.

245
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,050
Sa Geum Ran, you can't avoid me like this forever.

246
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,640
Answer the phone before I go looking for you again.

247
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,690
I'm sure you don't want Han Min Hyeok
to find out about our relationship either. Call me.

248
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,540
Sara.

249
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,440
You have a busy schedule following the magazine shoot.
You should check to confirm that it looks okay.

250
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,230
Excuse me, General Manager...

251
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,000
You asked me to tell you who hurt Han Tae Hee, right?

252
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,380
Why, do you know something?

253
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,280
It's difficult to say, but there's someone I suspect.

254
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,440
Who is it?

255
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,200
It's President Lee Kang Joon.

256
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,320
Oppa, you're looking for a chef from Birth of a Chef, right?

257
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,500
I'll recommend one for you. I know who cooks well.

258
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,410
She's shameless, don't you think?

259
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:07,130
After she used you, she wants to be successful by herself.

260
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,290
Let's go, Oppa. Just ignore it.

261
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,230
Hello, Producer and Writer.

262
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,270
I came to give my greetings.

263
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,030
Congratulations, it's good seeing that you are doing well.

264
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,050
It's all thanks to Birth of a Chef.

265
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,830
They gave me clothes because I'm the model,
so I brought you a few things.

266
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,830
My goodness!

267
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,800
Since Sara is so busy, Han Tae Hee requested something of me.

268
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,960
What?

269
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,280
The rice balls... Oh Kyung Hee will be making them instead.

270
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,360
What about the Winner Food employees?

271
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,260
The Winner Food employees won't cooperate,
so they don't have anyone to ask.

272
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,260
CEO Han Tae Hee is fighting single-handedly.

273
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,840
I'm also busy with my work at the hotel,
so this is a bit of a burden.

274
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,230
Wait a minute!

275
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,440
- Yes, Sara.
- About the making of the rice balls...

276
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,470
If its okay with you, is it okay if I try to make them?

277
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,960
Keep it a secret from Han Tae Hee.

278
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,050
Of course, I'd like that.

279
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,120
It's cold.

280
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,730
There's not a single thing that's been done properly.

281
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:46,220
If the Doctor came here, he would have suffered a lot.

282
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,420
Yes, Director.

283
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,830
You suspected President Lee Kang Joon
as the culprit in Tae Hee's assault, didn't you?

284
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,350
I investigated Lee Kang Joon's movements
on the day that Tae Hee was hurt.

285
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,740
I think you're correct that Lee Kang Joon did it.

286
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:14,260
While I figure this out, you should
keep a distance from Lee Kang Joon and Han Tae Hee.

287
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,980
Yes, Director. I understand. I'll do that.

288
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,970
I'll be sure to contact you.

289
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:27,080
General Manager, how can you place the blame on me?

290
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,990
Until the Boad of Directors' meeting,
the assault can't be mentioned.

291
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,880
Don't come to the company.

292
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,210
If everything goes well this time, I'll lift your suspension.

293
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,020
How can I trust what you say?

294
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,190
Aren't you trying to get rid of me?

295
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,080
You don't have a choice.

296
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,650
The chef went to the Development Room? By herself?

297
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,050
I'm sure she took someone with her.
She said that she'd call us when she was finished.

298
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,800
It's cold in there. There are no employees,
and the heating doesn't work.

299
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,570
I'm sure she'll do as she sees fit. Don't worry.

300
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,260
♫  I keep looking at myself in the mirror all the time,  ♫

301
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,360
♫ I can't believe it ♫

302
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,900
♫ How I look. I'm like the main character of an anime.
I'm so dazzling that I can't look. ♫

303
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,360
♫ I'm a beautiful girl ♫

304
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:31,690
♫ I can't explain this excitement
that I'm feeling for the first time. ♫

305
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,070
For the time being, Lee Kang Joon
won't be able to get close to the Doctor.

306
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,270
I'll make you the best rice balls,
so save the company, Doctor.

307
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:50,470
♬ I can erase all the dark sad memories now.
Oh new world.♬

308
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,880
You're going to the Cooking Development Room?

309
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,550
I can't just leave the chef to do everything on her own.

310
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,930
I have to help with something. So you can go home
after reporting to me the progress with the labor union.

311
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,580
Yes.

312
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,300
Is there anyone here?

313
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,150
I'm Winner Food's CEO, Han Tae Hee.

314
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,710
I thought you might be suffering in the cold,
so I bought you some coffee.

315
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,840
Is there anyone here?

316
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,420
Did she go somewhere?

317
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,790
How could she leave the fire lit when
there isn't anyone here? This is dangerous.

318
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,780
You can't!

319
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,930
Don't turn it off. It needs to stew more, a lot more.

320
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,680
Ajumma.

321
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,880
Ajumma, why are you here?

322
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,890
What are you doing?

323
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,630
I...

324
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,950
Were you making these rice balls?

325
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,090
Why?

326
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,460
Were you making the rice balls
because you were worried about me?

327
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,460
No.

328
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,890
General Manager Han Min Hyeok sent me, so I came.

329
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,720
Since Winner Foods needs to be saved,
he asked me to make the rice balls.

330
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,440
So I came.

331
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,170
You came because Han Min Hyeok sent you?

332
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:59,570
You don't have any desire to help me,
but you were forced to come because he asked you to?

333
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,320
Of course.

334
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,710
If that wasn't it, why else would I come?

335
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,170
I don't need your help. Take your things and leave.

336
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,980
I need to finish what I was doing.

337
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,080
Your and Han Min Hyeok's hypocrisy are the same.

338
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,150
You're not even helping with a sincere heart.
I'll take care of it.

339
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,410
It's true that Han Min Hyeok is helping Winner Foods.

340
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,240
He's helping you without you knowing.

341
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,860
Is that what he said?

342
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,890
- Han Min Hyeok is just putting on a show.
- That's not true.

343
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,840
Have you ever thought that he's playing a fixed game?

344
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,350
Why do you think you're always right?

345
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,930
Forget it. Just forget it.

346
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,850
I can't trust you or Han Min Hyeok.

347
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,610
I understand.

348
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,870
Whether you believe it or not,
we'll discuss it after you see the result.

349
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,640
Taste it, and if it doesn't taste good,
choose someone else.

350
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,120
Since I already started it, I'll finish it before I leave.

351
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,290
Please leave so that you don't disturb me while I'm cooking.

352
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,150
I'm the CEO of Winner Foods.

353
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,820
This is my company's Cooking Development Room,
and no one can tell me to leave.

354
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,760
Then stay over there,
since you'll get in the way while I'm cooking.

355
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,850
I don't want to. I'm going to stay where I want to.

356
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,370
What are you trying to do?

357
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,780
- I'm going to watch over you from here.
- Why?

358
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,640
I have to make sure that you're not
putting anything weird into the rice balls,

359
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,050
since these rice balls are important to me.

360
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,860
After Sara is done with work, she said
that she would come to my office.

361
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,650
She's in the Cooking Development Room at Winner Foods.

362
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,230
- Why?
- I think she's helping Han Tae Hee.

363
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,130
♫ It's not as if something happened. ♫

364
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,630
♫ It's not that I feel sad. ♫

365
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:18,890
♫ It hurts for no reason.
It just feels like something's missing. ♫

366
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,830
♫ I don't know what it is. ♫

367
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:29,970
♫ My heart feels empty ♫

368
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,610
♫ Nothing feels joyful ♫

369
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,990
Taste it.
♫ Nothing feels joyful ♫

370
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:40,590
♫ Each day without you ♫

371
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:48,230
♫ I couldn't imagine that it would be this hard. ♫

372
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,540
How does it taste?

373
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,740
I made the rice with beef broth. They should taste amazing.
♫Itseems I liked you a lot.♫

374
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,040
It's my exclusive recipe.

375
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,700
♬It seems I loved you a lot.♬

376
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,780
♫ I long for you more than you could imagine. ♫

377
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,730
Well, it's okay.
♬ Your face, the way you talk, eveything♬

378
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,710
Is that all?

379
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,800
How could I be moved with food made by Han Min Hyeok's spy?
♬ It seems I liked you a lot. ♬

380
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,360
In cooking, what's important
is the sincerity of the person making it.

381
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,170
That's what you said.

382
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:27,330
There's no affection, just duty. What can cooking
made with that kind of heart taste like?

383
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,970
Yes, I understand. This is the best I can do.

384
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,000
If it's not to your liking,
then call another chef to make it again.

385
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,370
I'll be going.

386
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:41,640
♬Don't telll me even if you feel like me.♬

387
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:47,860
What's wrong?
♬ Don't tell me if you are hurting a lot like me ♬

388
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,420
♬ I'll run. ♬

389
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,300
How can you lift this without putting on gloves?
♬ I want to be embraced by you ♬

390
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,480
How hot must it be after stewing for so many hours?!
♬ Without you, I'm nothing.♬

391
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,080
Ah, seriously.
♬ Because I love you. ♬

392
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,440
Keep it wrapped in a wet towel like this.

393
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,210
It's really nothing.

394
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:26,320
Keep it wrapped! It's red.

395
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,540
This Ajumma...

396
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:51,290
Chae Yeon isn't answering her phone again.

397
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,010
Why isn't she answering my phone calls?

398
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:58,320
Even still, we were classmates. She should
answer my phone calls, shouldn't she?

399
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,620
Seeing that she isn't answering your phone calls,
she has made up her mind.

400
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:07,090
Hey, what did Chae Yeon say?
Did you tell her to come to our house?

401
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:11,070
She isn't picking up my calls either.
I think she is planning to end things completely with us.

402
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,450
That's why she even threatened us.

403
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,320
She's already submitted
the change of ownership request for the building.

404
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,940
Kang Joon said that the registry office called
to confirm if the transfer of names was correct.

405
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,110
He agreed.

406
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,920
- Aiyoo, really.
- Really.

407
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,330
We can't even say anything against her
and let her take everything away?

408
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,520
Why isn't there anyone coming out to greet
when someone has come in?

409
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,140
What's that smell?

410
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,960
What are you guys doing?
What will you do if there's a fire?!

411
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,500
Look! Isn't anybody here?!

412
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,850
Killing his wife?

413
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,670
What was he thinking when he did that?

414
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,130
How could he think of killing someone?

415
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,170
Can we cover it up?

416
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,730
Wouldn't things like this get uncovered someday?

417
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,250
Since Geum Ran died,

418
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,920
if we just stop Chae Yeon's mouth, won't it work out?

419
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,420
What about the black box?

420
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,110
What are you talking about?!

421
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,780
Black box?

422
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,720
Is there evidence?

423
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,860
But, then... Our Kang Joon...

424
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:39,250
Kang Joon really murdered her?

425
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,360
I'm back.

426
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,420
Oh!

427
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,940
Why did you do that?

428
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,320
Is it true?!

429
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,500
You! How can you do that to Geum Ran?!

430
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,810
You bastard that can't be even considered a beast.

431
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:24,060
Are you a person? Are you?!

432
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:32,050
Get out. Get out of this house.

433
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,050
That black box was a set up by Chae Yeon!

434
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:40,240
Set up? Call Chae Yeon right now!

435
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,450
What's the point of studying well or getting a doctorate?

436
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,120
You have to be a human!

437
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,640
Geum Ran was a girl who was married into our family.

438
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,420
Is marriage something you can abandon
if you begin to dislike her?

439
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,510
A couple can grow apart. But they are still a family.

440
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:07,120
So you fight through it and overcome it. However,

441
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,950
you fell for another woman, and to your wife...!

442
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:20,700
I can't stay under the same roof with a man like you.

443
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,420
Get out.

444
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,620
Don't ever come back again, you bastard!

445
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,740
Winner Group

446
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,490
What happened,Tae Hee Oppa?
These rice balls are amazing.

447
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,660
Yes, they are better than the ones before.

448
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,920
Was Oh Kyung Hee, from Birth of a Chef,
this good at cooking?

449
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,060
I don't think we need to worry about Winner Food.

450
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,620
If we do a promotion, we can be successful,
as a dark horse, just by word-of-mouth.

451
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,080
Winner Food's revival is a sure thing.

452
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,780
Team Leader Choi.

453
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,870
Let's start giving out free samples
targeting the large supermarkets.

454
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,710
If the labor union is not going to participate,
get part-time workers.

455
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,550
Yes, I understand.

456
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,780
Winner Food developed a new product?

457
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,950
Yes. They gave out samples

458
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,520
to the union workers and the workers in the company.
They say the response was very positive.

459
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,820
Since Sara quit, they wouldn't have even had a chef.

460
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,220
Anyway, that's a relief.

461
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,620
Isn't that good for you?

462
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,230
You said that you wanted to help Winner Food.

463
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,560
Of course.

464
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,880
Do you know the schedule for the promotion?

465
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,360
It starts tomorrow. They say that they're
starting with advance tastings at the supermarkets.

466
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,850
New Product

467
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,670
Noonims (respective form of multiple Noonas),
come over here! Come over here!

468
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,390
What is this?

469
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,350
Come quickly!
Noonims, everyone come over here!

470
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,900
Why are you guys hesitating! Come here!

471
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,780
Everyone, come here!

472
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:54,220
These are the rice balls, where if two people eat them and one dies, the other one won't know because the rice balls are too delicious!

473
00:40:54,220 --> 00:41:00,200
If you go home and say that you made these yourselves,
your husbands will come running so fast!

474
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,190
You guys should try it first. You guys will collapse.

475
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,620
It's a relief, Doctor.

476
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,520
CEO, it's awesome.

477
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,030
It's delicious.

478
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,620
Of course! It's a rice ball made of beef!

479
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,790
Labor Union Leader.

480
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,270
I talked with the employees. The rice balls are excellent.

481
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,360
We will help.

482
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,120
We will help, starting from today, and the other workers have
agreed to begin their regular shifts, starting tomorrow.

483
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,550
Thank you. Thank you.

484
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,740
Then let's continue with this tasting promotion.

485
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,150
Yes.

486
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,650
Oppa, the tasting reactions are awesome.

487
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,400
As I was coming in, there were women
who were talking about the rice balls as they left.

488
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,830
Congratulations, Oppa. It worked out well.

489
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,500
Thanks.

490
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,980
Please try one. It's delicious.

491
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,390
- Please try one.
- Eat it deliciously.

492
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,360
Yes.

493
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,040
Try the rice balls.

494
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,200
They're delicious!

495
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,260
I've never eaten such delicious rice balls before.

496
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,020
I saw the promotion; the atmosphere looked good.

497
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,030
You are a snail bride. Han Tae Hee's snail bride.
(from Korean folktale)

498
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,910
Mother! You have a call!

499
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,080
Lee Jeong Sik?

500
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,680
Isn't this Geum Ran's father-in-law?

501
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,830
What is it?

502
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,100
I can't lift up my head.

503
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,060
Even if I have ten mouths, I have nothing to say.

504
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,010
Does he admit his wrongdoings?

505
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:18,960
Kang Joon said that it isn't true.

506
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,150
Of course, I hope he's saying the truth.

507
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:29,910
I came here because I felt like I've committed a sin,
even just hearing something like that.

508
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:32,700
It's true that that rascal hurt Geum Ran.

509
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,380
I hope that that isn't true.

510
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,610
I'm sorry. It's because I'm his father.

511
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:42,220
How did you find out the truth?

512
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,680
Chae Yeon is threatening Kang Joon.

513
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,120
Chae Yeon thinks that Kang Joon hurt Geum Ran.

514
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,680
What does Gyo Chae Yeon gain by threatening him?

515
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,230
She stole Geum Ran's building and land.

516
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,020
I tried to give it back to you . . .

517
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,800
The building...

518
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,820
Gyo Chae Yeon!

519
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:22,090
After the divorce, you are looking better and better.

520
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,690
How can you be like this?

521
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,800
I am happier since I got divorced.

522
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,440
I feel gratified for taking Lee Kang Joon's building,

523
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,290
and I like supporting Tae Hee.

524
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,070
What is it between you and Tae Hee?

525
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,770
If Tae Hee becomes the CEO of Winner Group,
I want to be next to him

526
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,020
as Tae Hee's woman.

527
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,680
Why would Gyo Chae Yeon take away the building?

528
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,310
Geum Ran inherited the land
from her father.

529
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:01,440
You can't leave her alone.
It won't be right.

530
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,080
I won't ever let it get taken away, Mom. Ever.

531
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,350
Sa Geum Ran.

532
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,660
The building... It doesn't belong to either of you,
so who are you to take it or give it away?

533
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,360
Did the building get taken away because I wanted it to?
I'm going crazy.

534
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:42,060
I heard that Gyo Chae Yeon is threatening you
because she knows that you killed me.

535
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,090
I will make a suggestion.

536
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:49,340
Gyo Chae Yeon aided and abetted the murderer.

537
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:54,070
If I step forward, you and Gyo Chae Yeon
are both in the same situation.

538
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:58,840
I'll catch Gyo Chae Yeon,
so pay for what you've done to Han Tae Hee

539
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,530
and never approach him again.

540
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,820
Han Tae Hee. I didn't do anything to him.

541
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,440
Are you going to insist to the end?

542
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,930
Really, it's not me.

543
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,820
Also, how are you going to
catch Gyo Chae Yeon?

544
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:20,030
I have a recorded tape of her
admitting to being an accomplice to the murder.

545
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,490
If you can do it, try it.

546
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,370
Gyo Chae Yeon has the black box,
and she's threatening me with it.

547
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:33,860
Also, the fact that you're Sa Geum Ran, she already knows that.

548
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:38,570
If you act too rashly, your identity will be revealed to everyone.

549
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:43,270
Gyo Chae Yeon knows that
I'm Sa Geum Ran?

550
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,480
Are you crazy?

551
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,200
Sa Geum Ran is here, Gyo Chae Yeon.

552
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,060
I heard you already knew.

553
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,600
I was the first person to realize it.

554
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,990
You knew, but you kept it to yourself...

555
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,720
Why? Because of the building?

556
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,010
Would it be only because of that?

557
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:19,790
Thanks to you, I had an excuse to get a divorce.

558
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:24,100
Also, right now, I'm right by Oppa Tae Hee's side.

559
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:29,660
It won't go as you wish.

560
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,820
So? The truth

561
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,890
that you're Sa Geum Ran... Will you be able to reveal
my actions without revealing your secrets?

562
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:41,280
If everything is revealed, you will be in bigger trouble.

563
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,840
How about leaving now?

564
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,020
You can gain something too.

565
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,350
Sara... your beauty.

566
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:56,420
It's fake. But right, you're still pretty.

567
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,790
It's to the level that Sa Geum Ran could never have dreamed of.

568
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:05,430
Do you think when Sa Geum Ran became Sara
the only thing gained was beauty?

569
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:10,140
I found my identity.

570
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,240
I'm no longer just an ajumma that sacrifices herself.

571
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,030
I will not ever be stepped on.

572
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:20,460
I won't lose against a mean girl
with whom my husband cheated.

573
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,340
You're just a fake.

574
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:27,450
My beauty may be fake, but what you have inside is also fake.

575
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:28,730
What?

576
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:32,270
On the outside, you pretend to be an intelligent announcer,

577
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:37,160
but you're an adulterer, who aided and
abetted a murder and even stole a building.

578
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,260
Which life is more fake?

579
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:47,040
When it is found out that my appearance
is fake and that your inside is fake,

580
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,810
who will people point their fingers at more? Let's wait and see.

581
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,390
New Product Tasting Overall Satisfaction

582
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,630
The rice balls that Tae Hee made are a success?

583
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:08,210
If it's like this during a promotion,
we won't have to worry about selling the product.

584
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,580
Tae Hee has done it.

585
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,020
Now it's done.

586
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:18,080
Tae Hee overcame a big crisis.

587
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,800
And Elder, the day of the trial is finalized.

588
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,540
I'm worried. But if Tae Hee becomes the CEO/Director,

589
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,770
the fact that Min Hyeok slandered me will be exposed.

590
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:42,170
And Min Hyeok will be forced to
lower his head in front of Tae Hee.

591
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,900
It's all up to Tae Hee.

592
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:55,030
At the Board of Directors meeting, use your strength so that
Tae Hee can win over Min Hyeok and become the candidate.

593
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,370
I understand, Elder.

594
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:22,230
After hearing about Director Kim,
I came here because I was surprised.

595
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:26,370
It was under the worst conditions,
but Han Tae Hee has accomplished it.

596
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:33,330
The evaluation from the tasting promotion
got near-perfect marks.

597
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,550
Just look at the scores by Dae Young Mart. It's explosive.

598
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,300
If it's this much, it could appeal to the Board of Directors.

599
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,830
Sara helped him.

600
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:48,040
Sara?

601
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,160
I'm envious of Han Tae Hee.

602
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:58,260
You don't have to do that.
Just get Winner Group under your control.

603
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,920
Then you will get everything you want.

604
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,590
No.

605
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:10,030
I want Sara more than anything else.

606
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:13,200
I want to make her regret it.

607
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,040
I am going to make her regret and beg for not recognizing me.

608
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:25,910
Don't worry about the Board of Directors' Meeting,
since I have a backup plan.

609
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:04,040
Today the main agenda of the Board of Directors Meeting
concerns the participants for the next General Meeting

610
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,470
of the Shareholders and electing the
CEO/Director candidate of Winner Group.

611
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:12,050
We will now hear the Directors' personal statements
recommending the CEO candidate.

612
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:16,520
I nominate Han Tae Hee of Winner Food as CEO/Director.

613
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:33,120
I nominate General Manager of Strategic Planning Han Min Hyeok.

614
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:47,460
We will take some time now for the two candidates
to explain their accomplishments up to now

615
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:51,380
and present their blueprints for the future of Winner Group.

616
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,960
First, Nominee Han Tae Hee will speak.

617
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:03,200
They say that even getting a beating
first is better. I will go first.

618
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,830
Since I'm older. Will that be okay?

619
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:21,110
Recently, I started a fashion and a chain restaurant business.

620
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:26,690
First of all, I will talk about the two new businesses with you.

621
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,300
I'll be going into the meeting?

622
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,120
- Why?
- The General Manager requested it.

623
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:47,980
Next, I will present the performance of Winner Food,
which is the highlight.

624
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:59,600
I will bring in someone who was a big help to Winner Food.

625
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,490
Sara? Can you come in for a moment?

626
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,190
She is the main model of my new business,

627
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:50,690
and she's a first place contributor of merit that has in one day surpassed ten records for preorders. The developer of the rice ball recipe,

628
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,440
Sara.

629
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:58,990
The new item of Winner Food, Love's Rice Balls,
has surpassed all former premarket preorders.

630
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,990
I will tell you guys

631
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,850
how this was possible.

632
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:11,580
First, in order to convince the labor union for Winner Foods,
I held many meetings.

633
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:19,140
This is the agreement by the labor union to not strike

634
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:23,890
for a period of three years, until the company is back to normal.

635
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,950
I earned the trust of the labor union,
and after canceling the application for bankruptcy,

636
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:37,380
I gave strength to Han Tae Hee.

637
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,070
The main reason why I could save Winner Food

638
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:44,160
was thanks to Sara's recipe.

639
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,100
Sara is acting as a main model for my new business,

640
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:53,560
and at my request, helped with the development of Winner Food's new product.

641
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:58,930
The success of Winner Food's newest product
was a joint project by Sara and me.

642
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,480
Sara and I will invest all our time and passion

643
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,860
for the future of Winner Group.

644
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,920
Thank you!

645
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,610
General Manager Han Min Hyeok
took all the credit for your hard work.

646
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,080
The one who took the lead was Sara, right?

647
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,580
The Rice Balls, did Sara make them?

648
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,280
Is that right, Oppa?

649
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,030
It was a trap.

650
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:58,170
It was a trap where General Manager Han Min Hyeok
sent Sara to Winner Food and took the credit.

651
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:06,650
Where is Sara?

652
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:09,190
She's here to see you.

653
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,050
Is this why you came to make the Rice Balls?

654
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,340
To participate in Han Min Hyeok's plan?

655
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,750
I didn't know it would turn out like this.
What do I have to do?

656
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,480
If there's something I can do before
the Directors vote, please tell me.

657
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,220
It's the same as if the outcome has been decided.

658
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,610
It will be unanimously Han Min Hyeok.

659
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,880
But, what makes me crazier is you.

660
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,800
The one who dropped me into this crisis
is no other than you, Ajumma.

661
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,610
I can't believe it.

662
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,660
It happened as you wished it.

663
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,190
Now we're

664
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,440
strangers.

665
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:46,120
The Board of Directors chose General Manager
Han Min Hyeok as the candidate for CEO/Director.

666
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,480
If this happens, doesn't everything become serious?

667
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,690
The trial is the immediate concern.

668
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:55,500
I think that you bowing your head once to

669
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,850
Min Hyeok and asking for help is one method.

670
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:01,940
But...

671
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,800
Sara has ruined Tae Hee Oppa's future.

672
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,320
How could she do such a thing?

673
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,640
Sara.

674
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,710
I'm not going to leave her alone.

675
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:28,060
Grandmother, Sara is fake.

676
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,550
Fake? What are you talking about?

677
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,340
Sara is shortly going to appear on a talk show that I host.

678
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,680
I'm going to tell everyone what kind of woman Sara is.

679
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,520
I want to make it so she can't raise her head and live!

680
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,050
I can't leave her be like this. Never.

681
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,950
Grandmother will be very worried.

682
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,880
I'd better go to the family home.

683
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,270
How could you take matters to this state?

684
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:06,070
Winner Food was 100% Han Tae Hee's effort!

685
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,420
Didn't you also promise to

686
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:12,030
keep your distance from Lee Kang Joon and Han Tae Hee?

687
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:16,940
How did you know that I made the Rice Balls?

688
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,910
I saw it with my own two eyes.

689
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:25,770
Sara, you agreed to work with me, but you
secretly helped Han Tae Hee, without my permission.

690
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,430
I was very offended.

691
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:34,890
Why your identity is fake, what your bad fate is
with CEO Lee Kang Joon,

692
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:37,670
aren't you curious as to the reason I don't ask?

693
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:40,910
I'm a businessman.

694
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:44,310
In order to get what I want, I mobilize all methods.

695
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:47,160
The reasons aren't important.

696
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,260
That is business.

697
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,750
Either Tae Hee or I will get Winner Group.

698
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:01,100
Also, I want you, Sara. Toward that end,
I'm going to everything I can.

699
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:14,060
General Manager, there will be a press conference
shortly, regarding the elected candidate.

700
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,630
Sara, you'll have to go with me.

701
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:22,150
You helped me win against Tae Hee.
You should be with me at such an important place.

702
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:33,140
I can't show my face.

703
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,880
I lost at the Board of Directors' Meeting.

704
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:40,210
How is that your fault?

705
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:43,160
You were caught in a trap.

706
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:49,720
Sara, that child. I can't ever forgive her.

707
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,970
That child, I heard she's a fake.

708
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,760
Her age, her name. I heard she lied about everything.

709
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,540
Even worse, her beauty.

710
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,990
Did she have plastic surgery?

711
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,410
How did you find that out?

712
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,320
Chae Yeon told me.

713
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:18,740
She said that she'd go out on her talk show
and tell everything about Sara.

714
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:21,070
I'm in agreement, too.

715
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:26,540
I can't leave that kind of con artist to ruin our family.

716
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:36,470
Why your identity is fake,

717
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:39,630
what your bad fate is with CEO Lee Kang Joon,

718
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,310
aren't you curious as to the reason I don't ask?

719
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:46,110
I'm a businessman.

720
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:49,480
In order to get what I want, I mobilize all methods.

721
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,360
The reason doesn't matter at all.

722
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,500
That is business.

723
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,110
I have something to ask you.

724
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,670
Would I have the wits to say anything right now?

725
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:12,380
Look at my position right now.

726
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:16,260
Hurting Han Tae Hee, you said you didn't do it, right?

727
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,330
Who was it?

728
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,230
Who did it then?

729
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:27,320
If I answer, what will you give me?

730
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:32,820
When I'm living domestically, I can't just tell you anything.

731
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:36,610
Is it all right to tell the press that you hurt Han Tae Hee?

732
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,470
It's not me.

733
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:39,990
I told you it's not me!

734
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:42,040
Then, who is it?

735
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,950
How could I touch the heir of Winner Group?!

736
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:48,610
Someone greater than me must have done it.

737
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:53,880
Think about it carefully.
If Han Tae Hee disappeared, who would benefit most?

738
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:57,430
General Manager Han Min Hyeok.

739
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:01,330
I only said one thing to Han Min Hyeok.

740
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,110
Han Tae Hee has a weakness.

741
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:08,030
Han Tae Hee forged Sara's identity.

742
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:11,620
After that, there was a threatening call to Han Tae Hee.

743
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:16,750
Han Min Hyeok did the deed and then framed me for it!

744
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:25,650
General Manager Han Min Hyeok...

745
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:28,800
He's the worst fate of worst fates.

746
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,910
He's staking his life on obstructing my work.

747
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,560
Tae Hee or I will get Winner Group.

748
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,530
Also, I want you, Sara.

749
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:39,760
In order to accomplish that I will do everything I can.

750
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:44,540
Doctor.

751
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,410
Sara.

752
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,110
Talk Show...

753
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,500
Ajumma.

754
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:39,070
♫  I didn't know, I thought we'd be forever,  ♫

755
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:44,800
♫  Only I didn't know, I thought we'd be happy,  ♫

756
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,640
Sara's identity is fake and she's a plastic surgery beauty.

757
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,380
Let's catch Han Tae Hee with this.

758
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:51,700
Try begging me to cancel the talk show.

759
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,370
Han Tae Hee is in a dangerous situation right now.

760
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:55,980
If my matter is revealed,
Han Tae Hee will be in a difficult position.

761
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,390
Take good care of Mom.

762
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:58,680
What's going on?

763
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,930
After meeting you, if there was any time I regretted or resented you,

764
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:03,600
I came to answer that question.

765
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,200
I have made this place because I have something to tell you.

766
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,070
I have never resented having met you.

767
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,440
Not even once.

768
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,980
Ajumma, you can't go to the press conference.

769
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,640
Stop. Wait until I get there.

770
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,960
Tomorrow night at 9:55pm...
