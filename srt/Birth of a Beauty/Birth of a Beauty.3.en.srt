1
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,730
Honey.

2
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,060
Episode 3

3
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,490
Ever since Chae Yeon came to our house,
our house seems brighter.

4
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,770
Isn't that so, Honey?

5
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,360
Chae Yeon, after you're married (into the family),

6
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,520
let's go out to eat, go to the movies
and go shopping together.

7
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,950
I have so many things I want to do with you.

8
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,790
Me too, Mother-In-Law.

9
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,910
It's a dream of mine to go around with
our arms linked together, Mother-in-law!

10
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,220
Is that so? Aren't you going overboard?

11
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,320
If someone saw you, they would think
you're the one marrying her.

12
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,370
Kang Joon said he was going for a walk,
but why isn't he back yet?

13
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,230
Chae Yeon is here. Why don't you give him a call.

14
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,230
- I'm home
- Kang Joon come here, Chae Yeon is here.

15
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,060
Gyo Chae Yeon saw me, but she's just going to leave it alone?

16
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,880
Shouldn't she be thinking, "Why are they both together?
Is he cheating on me? Why would he leave me alone?"

17
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,790
Chae Yeon is

18
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,250
one step above you.

19
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,200
Ja-jang!

20
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,030
These are our wedding rings.

21
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,680
They came earlier than expected,
so I ran here to show them to you.

22
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,070
And I wanted to see you one more time!

23
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,110
Men don't like women who nag!

24
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,480
Chae Yeon knows that.

25
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,500
Then, what will Gyo Chae Yeon do?

26
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,210
Well, I suppose she'll do what she must to steal his heart...

27
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,910
with her cuteness!

28
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,420
Give me your hands, Honey.

29
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,810
Honey?

30
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,200
It's a perfect fit, Honey.

31
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,520
Honey.

32
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,500
You also try saying it.

33
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,250
I have cuteness, too!

34
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,760
You call this cuteness? Ahjumma, this is violence!

35
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,160
Doctor, this won't work. Lend me more money.

36
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,630
For tomorrow's date, I'll need to wear clothes
that are prettier than Gyo Chae Yeon's.

37
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,650
Documentation of Debt Details

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,360
The dress you got for HBS event, $500.

39
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,590
The cost of training clothes, $135.
The health fitness membership, $350.

40
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,240
The medication for delusion was

41
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,600
$1,200.

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,130
Organic make up, cellulite message, $1,300.

43
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,810
Stockings and intimate underwear, $270.

44
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,360
Let's say that the $100,000 donation is not included here.

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,220
The amount that I spent on you in five days is $3,620.

46
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,880
This is all money you have to pay back!

47
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,130
You know that this isn't everything, don't you?

48
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,210
Never mind the cost of the umpteen cosmetic surgeries
and the liposuction at $8,000.

49
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,910
The amount of monthly rent at $1,800.

50
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,240
The contract spelled it out in section 38.

51
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,300
You should know that the interest on the money
you borrow from me goes up by 1% every day.

52
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,890
Shall I continue?

53
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,280
No.

54
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,520
Pawn Shop

55
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,350
It's my wedding ring.

56
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,830
- Please give a lot of money for it.
- Let's see this.

57
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,950
You said you'd die before you gave up your wedding ring.

58
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,670
When he and I get married again, I'll come back for it.

59
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,550
Wait a minute.

60
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,240
And to think, you're giving up your wedding ring
just to buy some new clothes?

61
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,280
Do you think that'll even be enough?

62
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,310
Then what? What more do I need?

63
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,000
One night stand?

64
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,470
Maybe you should lower your voice.

65
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,610
Up to this point, our goal has been to cause a scandal,

66
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,290
but now the goal has changed to you
and Lee Kang Joon getting married.

67
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,280
The only thing that can defeat Chae Yeon in one shot

68
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,930
is this...

69
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,690
Yes. Great!

70
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,190
I'll be sleeping with my husband. I like it!

71
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,560
- You like it?
- Of course.

72
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,670
I haven't slept with him for seven years.

73
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,360
Since I've kept myself pure for so long,
it feels like my body is going to lose it.

74
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,070
I want to sleep with my husband! Immediately!

75
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,610
Ahjumma!

76
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,010
What if someone hears you? Then, what will you do?

77
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,860
So what if they do? He and I are a couple.

78
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,370
Even so,

79
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,350
talking about private matters between a man and a woman!

80
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,930
The color of your face hasn't even changed... and it's such an taboo topic!

81
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,170
You're embarrassed, aren't you?

82
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,950
I get it, I get it! It's because you are a bachelor!

83
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,120
Doctor, for a one-night stand, what do I need?

84
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,450
Never mind! What would a bachelor know?
Ahjumma knows better!

85
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,570
I love it!

86
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,790
Aiyoo!

87
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,750
One,

88
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,300
two, three.

89
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,200
In the Kama Sutra...

90
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,480
The posture to seduce...

91
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,900
And then...

92
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,480
The posture that gets him, the jar posture.

93
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,740
Oh really, that...

94
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,900
In the Kama Sutra...

95
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,810
Cat pose. Meow!

96
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,740
Meow

97
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,810
Meow!

98
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,620
Doctor, are you feeling hot?

99
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,990
Hot? Who's feeling hot?

100
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,630
Why is the chicken so spicy? What did you put in this?

101
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,690
That's weird. It wasn't spicy.

102
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,140
Doctor, if you're done eating,
will you come and help me with my pose?

103
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,180
In order to stretch properly,
I need you to help me hold my pose.

104
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,190
You're doing the Kama Sutra...
No, why should I? I don't want to!

105
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,290
Why don't you want to? When it was about exercising,
you pushed me to do it!

106
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,480
Doctor...

107
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,150
are you by chance...

108
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,300
thinking naughty thoughts?

109
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,950
What pose is it? Let's do it!

110
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,150
Okay!

111
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,620
Doctor, pull harder!

112
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,090
There!

113
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,890
Awww, Doctor... pull me closer!

114
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,710
Closer?

115
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,140
There you go!

116
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,950
Ah!

117
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,370
Owww! Doctor!

118
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,500
How could you suddenly let go like that?

119
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,850
Owww, owww! My back!

120
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,600
Ow, my back! Ow, ow my back!

121
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,690
Doctor!

122
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,810
.

123
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,500
Was I just aroused by that ahjumma?

124
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,140
I saw so much fat come out of the body of that ahjumma!

125
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,860
I even touched her squishy, distended belly!

126
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,250
That woman's a fake, a fake!
Why would I, a genius,

127
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,830
be seduced by a fake and be taken over by instinct?

128
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,600
That makes no sense... no sense!

129
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,540
It's because I've been single for too long. I've been single
for so long that it's the lustful devil.

130
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,840
Besides, being affected by pheromones is for ordinary people.

131
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,380
It doesn't suit a genius like me!

132
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,850
Doctor! What are you doing?
Will you come out here and help me with my pose?

133
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,870
Please?

134
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,590
Doctor...

135
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,400
Meow!

136
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,720
Meow! Meow! Meow!

137
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,150
That's right.

138
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,160
Dress warmly when you go out...

139
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,510
Mom... Gyeong Joo...

140
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,370
To Mrs. Shim Yeo Ok...
Mother, I am a friend of Geum Ran's.

141
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,530
Even though Geum Ran is no longer here,
you need to take good care of your health!

142
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,750
A friend of Geum Ran?

143
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,800
- Who could it be?
- That's what I want to know.

144
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,480
I think it's a lunchbox.

145
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,750
I'm sorry for making things so hard on you, Mom.

146
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,550
When he and I are a couple again, I will visit you.

147
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,030
Just wait for a little while, Mom.

148
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,740
You've practiced your Kama Sutra
until your nose bled, so enough of that!

149
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,110
Oh, that's nice! All you have to do on
tomorrow's date is smile at this angle.

150
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,510
Is that all? If I do this, will I be
able to sleep with my husband?

151
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,330
Leave the rest up to me! I'll make your wish
to sleep with your husband come true!

152
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,450
I'd like that so much!

153
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,850
You have a beautiful smile!

154
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,100
Thank...

155
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,330
you!

156
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,310
But Kang Joon, are you hot? You're sweating!

157
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,430
Yeah, I wonder why I'm the only one who's hot.

158
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,050
If it's all right, I think I will take off my jacket.

159
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,080
When are we going to the hotel room?
And, why haven't I seen the doctor yet?

160
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,980
Hello. Our restaurant does an event on its anniversary.

161
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,390
We choose the most chic couple and give them gifts.

162
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,250
You guys are the most perfect couple for the event.

163
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,360
Because the lady is beautiful, I'm also enjoying good luck.

164
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,650
Thank you.

165
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,400
There's one more thing.

166
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,100
♫ Kiss me darling, kiss me, kiss me tonight ♫

167
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,180
♫Kiss me darling, kiss and you'll be alright ♫

168
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,900
♫ Kiss me darling, kiss, your kiss is so wonderful ♫

169
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,750
♫My love, you'll always be♫

170
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,900
♫My love, you'll always♫

171
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,700
It's kiss time.

172
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,680
Pardon? Kiss?

173
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:55,410
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

174
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:02,350
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

175
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:10,710
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

176
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:18,640
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

177
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:27,070
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

178
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:34,590
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

179
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,770
Kiss! Kiss!

180
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:04,300
She's dying of happiness. Do you like it that much?

181
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,790
Honey! How long has it been?

182
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,400
CEO.

183
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,210
The couple

184
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,910
- has checked into a room on the 9th floor
of this building, the Verine Hotel!

185
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,620
It's a success?!

186
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,900
Everyone, you've worked hard!

187
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,260
CEO Tae Hee, aren't you going to work?

188
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,520
What's up with the three-month vacation?
And, you're not even traveling overseas.

189
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,790
That's right! He's a total Hong Gil Dong! (John Doe)

190
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:30,170
Our consultant from the restaurant is all riled
about our "crepe and collaboration."

191
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:34,410
But you have to be present to discuss it.
For starters, please come to work!

192
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,140
Alright! Alright! This guy's popularity is just...

193
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,270
I'll come to work soon, so until then just have fun, okay?

194
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,180
Yes!

195
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,360
Honey.

196
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,050
Even though I turned and turned to get here,

197
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,660
I'm okay.

198
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,740
Even if it's like this,

199
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,170
it's all right if we become a couple again.

200
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,490
Sara.

201
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,800
Yes.

202
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,390
Yes.

203
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,220
What's the matter?

204
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,760
Sorry.

205
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,090
Let's stop here.

206
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,880
Was it because I cried? It was because
I ruined the moment, right?

207
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,800
It's because I want to cherish you.

208
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,230
Cherish me? What do you mean by cherish?

209
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,340
By cherishing me, you'll become poop. Don't cherish me!

210
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,930
When I brought you to this hotel,

211
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,660
I thought we were fated for one night.

212
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,340
But seeing the true you,

213
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,700
it changed my mind.

214
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,830
I'll think about it for one more day.

215
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,070
And if our hearts are still the same by then,

216
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,090
I'll meet you tomorrow.

217
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,310
At that time, like you,

218
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,810
I'm saying that I'll become serious.

219
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,760
He just left? Without anything happening?

220
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,820
We put in so many things good for virility
into Lee Kang Joon's food.

221
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,010
Doesn't Lee Kang Joon, that bastard,
have something physically wrong with him?

222
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,410
No!

223
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,290
He said he'd think it over one more day
and asked to become more serious.

224
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,410
That punk, upon seeing you cry,

225
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:43,350
thought that it would become tiresome getting entangled
with you, and he stopped because he was shocked!

226
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,040
That crazy... Getting serious? Getting serious, my ass!

227
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,190
If he was just playing around, then he won't have
made an appointment for tomorrow.

228
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,040
It's true he wanted to become serious.

229
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,280
Gosh damn it. He's putting on a show. Seriously.

230
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,930
He really wants to play around, so he wants to sample first.

231
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,530
He is playing around between you and Chae Yeon!

232
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,700
Lee Kang Joon, that bastard, is really set on making infidelity an art.

233
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,280
He should be considered the best in the world of cheating.

234
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,820
Are you disappointed?

235
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,360
I just have to endure it one more day...

236
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,290
Ahjumma. Don't you think of Lee Kang Joon,
that bastard, as a bad person?

237
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,080
He's a womanizer!

238
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,510
He threw you away, and he was going to throw Chae Yeon away.

239
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,960
My husband is just a romanticist.

240
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,960
You also want to love, right? With Chae Yeon?

241
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,840
So you're saying that Lee Kang Joon isn't a bastard here?

242
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,070
How can someone be so blind?!
It's to the point of being foolish!

243
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,280
Whether it rained or was sunny, if I was sad or happy,
I swore that I would love him.

244
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,350
It's not being foolish. That's a marriage vow.
You don't know because you're a bachelor!

245
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,580
If your conviction is that strong, then fine.

246
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,730
I will hope that conviction lasts you for the rest of your life!

247
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,010
Kang Joon. Try winning every once in a while.

248
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,720
It may look like you are losing on purpose.

249
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,060
What are you saying? I tried my best.

250
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,830
Are you trying to kill me twice?

251
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,900
Let's go.

252
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,590
How is the HBS labor union situation going?

253
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,310
Don't worry about HBS. Just clamp down
on Winner Group's headquarters.

254
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,600
I will make sure that the labor union problem
will be solved before they make petitions.

255
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,430
With all of the powerful representative directors, including
the director of strategic planning, attending,

256
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,540
I will take care of it so that they don't overreach.

257
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,160
The Director of Strategic Planning.

258
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,260
You have to have strategy and have good plans,
in order to be the Director of Strategic Planning.

259
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,290
What is a Director of Strategic Planning
who can't even block one labor union?

260
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,360
He'd be useless.

261
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,230
Isn't that right, Kang Joon?

262
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,490
Labor unions.

263
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,260
I will wait for the call that they've been completely disbanded.

264
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,250
I'll give you two hours.

265
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,200
Yes.

266
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,180
The next game is this Friday.

267
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,000
On that day, try winning.

268
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,500
Yes, Chairman.

269
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,700
I told you to call me Hyung.

270
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,380
I'm going.

271
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,330
♫  Oh I'm in love with you, it's like I completed a puzzle ♫

272
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,920
♫ Oh I'm in love with you, ♫

273
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,280
Blazing Red.
♫you're my ideal♫

274
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,290
♫ I like you because you're pretty---no, I like you because you're comfortable ♫

275
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,650
The meaning of deep red color is...

276
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,700
There is a research that says that it heightens men's desire.

277
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,670
That's why women apply the color red.

278
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,290
If you apply this on your lips,

279
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:25,460
Lee Kang Joon will want to

280
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,420
kiss you.

281
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,410
Is that right, Doctor? Do you suddenly want to kiss me?

282
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,590
This lustful devil!

283
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,860
A genius must be smart. He cannot be taken over by his instinct.

284
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,560
Ahjumma!

285
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,570
What's wrong?

286
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,650
- Am I not pretty?
- You're pretty.

287
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,110
But why are you getting mad?

288
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,840
The reason is...

289
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,340
because I'm afraid that you'll be late,
so I'm frustrated that I'm angry.

290
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,540
Hurry up.

291
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,450
Yes, Doctor.

292
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,260
Next is,

293
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,470
blush.

294
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:22,160
♫ In the end, with no goodbyes, you and I will have ♫

295
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,260
♫ a happy ending. ♫

296
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,200
You can't, you said?

297
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,260
I thought we were going to decide the necessary menu together.

298
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,570
Aside from the boat race, you don't have any other plans.

299
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,790
An appointment came up.

300
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:45,170
Then, I'll see you after that appointment.

301
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,540
I might be late, so let's postpone it.

302
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,550
A few days ago,

303
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:01,790
I saw you and Sara together.

304
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,400
The fact that scene is coming to mind at this moment...

305
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,880
Am I being sensitive

306
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,450
or perceptive?

307
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,800
Gyo Chae Yeon

308
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,080
Gyo Chae Yeon's calling you.

309
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:00,140
This is Gyo Chae Yeon. Can I meet you for a second?

310
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,260
Ahjumma, Ahjumma!

311
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:12,110
You're going out to meet Chae Yeon. Are you
going out to a battlefield? Are you going hunting?

312
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,650
- Why are you like this, so scarily?
- If he meets Gyo Chae Yeon, I won't stand still for it.

313
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,260
What are you going to do if you're not going to stand still for it?

314
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,760
You just touch one hair on Chae Yeon's head. I'll follow and...

315
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,150
Wait right here. Huh? Wait here.

316
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,910
When I feel as if I could die, who is it? Ji Hoon?

317
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,200
Ahjumma!

318
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,990
Yes, Ji Hoon.

319
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,020
Hyung. Hyung, there's big trouble.

320
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,490
There's a mouse, a mouse!
There's a mouse in the house, right now!

321
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,040
All right. Wait a little while. I'll be right there.

322
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,440
Man, seriously.

323
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,730
What did you think of my acting, Nurse Kim?

324
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,910
Daebak! I was almost fooled, Doctor.

325
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:06,690
If not for this method, I wouldn't be able to get
my family members to gather together in one house.

326
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,790
This time I'd better try calling Chae Yeon.

327
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,400
I'm going to glare at her.

328
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,360
Do you even look

329
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,370
in the mirror?

330
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:27,430
If she comes at me, I'll twist, strike her and

331
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,240
throw her with an arm lock hold.

332
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,860
But still if she continues to come at me, I'll strike her

333
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,690
and squeeze.

334
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,460
Twist strike, arm lock hold...

335
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,490
There was a woman called Sa Geum Ran.

336
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,830
Sa Geum Ran? What's this suddenly about Sa Geum Ran?

337
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,160
No, who is Sa Geum Ran?

338
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,270
She's Kang Joon's previous wife,

339
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,220
but she committed suicide.

340
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,660
They had her funeral without even a body and
they finished it in an unpleasant manner.

341
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:31,840
Kang Joon even threw away a wife
who took care of his parents.

342
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,190
We aren't a normal couple.

343
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,180
What are you, Sara? Something something?
A one night stand?

344
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,160
You're not anything.

345
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,820
It's obvious what the conclusion is.

346
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,800
It's a text message from Kang Joon.
It's a cancellation notice of your date.

347
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,950
So you don't need to check it.

348
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,560
Then I'll get going.

349
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:37,550
Oh, Oppa Ji Hoon. I was just meeting someone.

350
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,800
Oppa Tae Hee is coming?

351
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,990
Of course Kang Joon has to come together with me.

352
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,030
Ji Hoon! Ji Hoon! Where's the mouse?

353
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,900
I'll catch it for you.

354
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,630
I'll just...

355
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,570
Chae Yeon.

356
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,000
Oppa Tae Hee.

357
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,450
You're too much, even going into hiding for three months.

358
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:16,940
Oh, Kang Joon. On this side is Oppa Tae Hee. Han Tae Hee.

359
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,020
He had a situation when he was young,
so he grew up with us in the same house.

360
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,510
I heard a lot about you.

361
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,920
I heard that you're the same as family.

362
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,340
You know he's called the God of Restaurants, right?

363
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,280
Restaurant consulting company?

364
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,700
Tae Hee Oppa's company. He gathered a few people
together and proceeded to make a company.

365
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,240
Within a year, he had risen to the top.
He's a skillful businessman.

366
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,540
You're all here.

367
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,150
Hyung Tae Hee! Hey...

368
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,860
Now we're all gathered here. He's the spare brother-in-law.

369
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:58,060
This hyung is a mystic so it's hard to see his face.
I had to deceived him slightly to call him here.

370
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,890
I'm Lee Kang Joon.

371
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,180
I'm Han Tae Hee.

372
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,930
What should I call you?

373
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,220
As you like.

374
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,370
I heard that this is a remarriage for you.

375
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,410
Oh, yes.

376
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,910
Since you're not biological siblings . . .

377
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,110
I'll have to call you Tae Hee and not Brother-in-law.

378
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,720
Then I'll have to call you Kang Joon. Right, Kang Joon?

379
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,240
Yes, Tae Hee.

380
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,980
Oh, Kang Joon. Help me pour the wine...

381
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,940
Hey Hyung, this is heavy. Help me with it.

382
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,670
It's all pranks. I was raised being mindful of
people's notice in someone else's house.

383
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,700
So whenever I get the chance, it's pranks and hijinks.

384
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,820
- Yes.
- Ji Hoon, Ji Hoon.

385
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,390
Of all days, I happen to have previous plans.
I'll see you later.

386
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,830
Kang Joon.

387
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,580
Let's see each other again.

388
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,920
I... Hyung Tae Hee, Hyung Tae Hee.

389
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,400
Where are you, Ahjumma?

390
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,130
Where are you, Doctor? I called you a hundred times.

391
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,630
Where are you?

392
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,190
- Lee Kang Joon is a terrible bastard!
- Gyo Chae Yeon is a terrible woman!

393
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,520
Lee Kang Joon even went with you to a hotel.

394
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,950
Yet, today, he showed up at her older brother's house
saying he was meeting his new brother-in-law.

395
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,490
Two timer, if that's not a terrible bastard, who is?

396
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,380
Gyo Chae Yeon disrespected me, saying that
my funeral (was conducted) without even the body.

397
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,550
And she bragged that Kang Joon threw away
his wife and chose her.

398
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,760
There's no reason to talk badly of Chae Yeon.
Lee Kang Joon is the problem.

399
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,910
- Gyo Chae Yeon, that woman, is the problem!
- Are you saying that you're going to start something or what?

400
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,330
What? Do you think I couldn't?!

401
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,550
Where do you get off with your eyes...
Won't you drop your eyes!

402
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,920
This isn't the time for us to be doing this.

403
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,620
That's what I'm saying.

404
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,190
The more it's like this, the more we have to
come together and combine our strength!

405
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,800
Of course.

406
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,270
Let's save the date that was ruined.
Even the dying flame of a furnace

407
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,030
can burn a coffin, if you save it.

408
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,380
There is a saying in game of "Go-Stop" that you can
change your move to catch your opponent off guard.

409
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,160
I'm saying that we should have a last-minute reversal.

410
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,080
Let's push forward with Lee Kang Joon. Since we live
right in front of his nose, we'll just push you at him.

411
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,190
In the middle of the night, stickily,
let's make a plan and throw you at him.

412
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,540
I can do well. Looking at today,
I'm prettier than Gyo Chae Yeon.

413
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,640
Of course. The perfect combination of beauty and genius.

414
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,700
We can do it. We can do it!

415
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:24,830
Lee Kang Joon, that bastard. Beauty! He's dead.

416
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,620
Where, Sara? Where's the mouse?

417
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,070
Looking at your attire, I have to ask you.

418
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,030
Did a mouse really come out?

419
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,540
No, I wanted to see you,

420
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,890
so I made it up.

421
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:23,930
You wore this on purpose to show me?

422
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,510
Do you want to go see the ocean?

423
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,220
Right now?

424
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:50,100
Then could we go to a place

425
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,130
that has a special meaning for me?

426
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,370
Don't worry about the mouse since you're already caught.

427
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,620
The rat in the trap is you, Lee Kang Joon.

428
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,070
It's where we went on our honeymoon.

429
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,670
You remember, right, Honey?

430
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:03,680
The power is off. After the beep, you'll be directed to voice mail.

431
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,890
His phone is off?

432
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,660
Kang Joon..

433
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,440
This is a famous driving course.

434
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,450
Since it has slope and the cliff is high up, it's a sight to see.

435
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,920
Let's drive a while longer, along the beach.

436
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,180
Sara?

437
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:19,730
Love's Rice Truck

438
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,770
Damn it...

439
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,850
Hey! There aren't enough volunteers to help out,
so why isn't your mom coming?!

440
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:42,310
Mom! Dad said to come out.
It's not the time to have fun.

441
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:46,880
It's been a long time since I went hiking with my elementary
school classmates. It's going to be a problem if I cancel.

442
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,360
What do you mean long time?
Just because you're into President Park...

443
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,110
Be quiet!

444
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:02,160
Honey, I couldn't pick up the phone quickly
because I was constipated.

445
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,470
Aren't you going to come out quickly?!!

446
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,180
Are you okay?

447
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,150
Yes.

448
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:36,130
You said it was a place with the memory of your first love,
so I wanted to introduce you to a good road to drive there.

449
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,880
What a pity.

450
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,020
Was it a big accident?

451
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,560
Yes.

452
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,190
Was it a serious accident?

453
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,610
Something serious must have happened.

454
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,460
Shall I give you some advice?

455
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:13,270
Don't try to avoid the moment of the accident. Instead, face it.

456
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:17,210
Instead... face it?

457
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,710
When a memory of the accident appears, don't avoid it.

458
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:24,610
Then, you'll see the things you couldn't see before.

459
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:29,180
And, once you see the overall picture,
the trauma will disappear.

460
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,350
Knowing everything gives you a sense of safety.

461
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:44,560
Face the accident?

462
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:19,630
Among the people I have seen, you are the most beautiful.

463
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,890
Sara, are you okay?

464
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,250
You seem to have a mild fever. I'll bring some medicine.

465
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:19,780
Geum Ran gave up on the challenge and committed suicide.

466
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,400
There was a woman named Sa Geum Ran.

467
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,110
It was Kang Joon's previous wife. She committed suicide.

468
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:33,930
A funeral was held without the body. It ended badly.

469
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,570
Suicide? Why is it a suicide?

470
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,870
Not an accident?

471
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:17,590
Grandma, move your car. Where do you think
this is that you're parking your car here?

472
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,910
What is here?

473
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,350
The house of Winner Group's CEO.

474
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:24,080
Before the 'higher ups' come, hurry and move your car.

475
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,370
Ha, this grandma is really...

476
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,610
Have you come, Madam?

477
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,930
You always make such a fuss.
I'm scared to leave the house and return.

478
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,710
Madam, it's his first day as a guard.

479
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,490
Don't be scared. It doesn't matter
if you've been marked by me.

480
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:45,870
I have no wish to live long and will live a short life.
So you can take me lightly.

481
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,390
Grandma, you're saying that again.

482
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,440
Please don't say that you'll die.

483
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,370
I'll make it clear that you can't, without my permission. Ok?

484
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,120
My grandson is scarier than the Grim Reaper.

485
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,430
- Let's go in.
- Yes, it's cold. Come in.

486
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,750
Grandma, next time take me with you, too.

487
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,440
You're here, Mother-In-Law.

488
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,830
Did you feed Mongshiri, who's in the yard?

489
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,680
I fed him this morning, Mother-In-Law.

490
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,890
Feed him more.

491
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,210
The dog is still hungry!

492
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,070
Ahjumma?

493
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:55,490
Ahjumma, I'm going to come in. Ahjumma...

494
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,590
Ahjumma, did you perhaps... stay out all night?

495
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,920
As I expected, she's not in the bathroom.

496
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,770
Not in the kitchen, either.

497
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,660
I don't know if I might stay out all night,
so I prepared breakfast ahead of time.

498
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,360
Yes. Yes.

499
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,150
It's a success. One-night stand was a success.

500
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,540
Good job.

501
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:55,340
You're too good for Lee Kang Joon,
but what can I do if you want it?

502
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,670
You worked hard. Congratulations.

503
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,460
Good job.

504
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:13,360
Sara, I bought the medicine.

505
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,990
Mother.

506
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,670
What are you going to do if Grandma hears you?

507
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,500
A new employee just came in, but Secretary Sohn. Secretary Sohn!

508
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,950
I've been her daughter-in-law for decades and I'm still Secretary Sohn!

509
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:55,490
She's deliberately raising a dog
so she can order me to feed it!

510
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:59,700
Dog! Dog food! That's all she has to say to me!

511
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,950
Wicked old bat!

512
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:05,790
You've held it in well, all this time.
Why are you doing this now?

513
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,790
If the shareholders' general meeting goes according to plan,

514
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,170
Winner Group become ours.

515
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:13,840
When I think that not many days are left,

516
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,290
day by day, it makes me crazy.

517
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:20,020
Every time I hear that old bat's voice, I feel like throwing up!

518
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:24,580
When I take over the company, I will let you
have your revenge for your grudge.

519
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:28,390
I will let you get rid of that annoying elder.

520
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,270
So, be careful until the shareholder meeting.

521
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,730
You know, right, Mother?

522
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,490
My dear grandson...

523
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:15,010
What was so urgent that even you left?

524
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,930
If you were alive,

525
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,630
Winner Group would have been yours.

526
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,170
I must die

527
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,680
so I can see your face, right?

528
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:19,650
Sara

529
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:30,940
The phone is turned off. You will be sent directly to voicemail.

530
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:49,170
Who is it?

531
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:51,800
Hello. I'm called Sara.

532
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,820
Excuse me, but is CEO Lee Jeong Shik or Madam there?

533
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,200
It's Unni Sara!

534
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,530
If Geum Ran were here during these times, it would
have been perfect to be able to order her around.

535
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,890
Oh! Sara!

536
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:20,430
Honey. Honey. Honey, Sara is here!

537
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,730
People who complain about it being
difficult and tiring while volunteering,

538
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,880
I don't understand them.

539
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:12,310
Volunteering is something that fills my heart.

540
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,870
Do you know what I mean?

541
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,830
Yes.

542
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:20,340
I like helping others.

543
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:23,660
It makes me feel useful.

544
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:28,120
It's unexpected of a beautiful young lady.

545
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:32,060
It's the first time hearing that from someone
aside from my daughter-in-law.

546
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,140
Uhm... CEO,

547
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,850
since you're talking about your daughter-in-law...

548
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:48,490
I heard she committed suicide.

549
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:53,270
The workers told me.

550
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,780
That's right.

551
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,900
My daughter-in-law fell into the ocean.

552
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:05,020
It's not a good story.

553
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:13,120
I heard you couldn't find the body.

554
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,800
The speed of the current was too fast,
so we couldn't recover her.

555
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,020
The car was also all wrecked.

556
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:23,210
It was horrible.

557
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:27,040
There was an accident and there was no body.

558
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,420
Why do you think it was a suicide?

559
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,570
Is it something that can't be known?

560
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,750
There was a suicide note.

561
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,270
What was that?

562
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:43,160
My daughter left a suicide note.

563
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,250
A suicide note?

564
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:55,100
Doctor, where are you?

565
00:59:56,910 --> 01:00:00,480
Ahjumma. Did you have fun last night?

566
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,240
We need to meet right now.

567
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,330
We cannot connect you..

568
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,020
What exactly happened?

569
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:39,840
Whenever I come here, I only have bad memories.

570
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,880
What did you say?

571
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,620
Repeat what you just said.

572
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:08,670
My death...

573
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:11,200
There might be something else.

574
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,170
What do you mean by, "There is something else,"
regarding your death?

575
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,200
What is there?

576
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,210
A scary

577
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:24,260
conspiracy.

578
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,650
Conspiracy?

579
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:34,400
When happiness appears before people's eyes, they feel something ominous.

580
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,120
They hope that their feelings will be wrong because they want to be happy

581
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,460
Pitifully, ominous feelings are always

582
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,350
correct.

583
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:52,980
♫ Oh I'm in love with you. It feels like I've matched a puzzle ♫

584
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:57,580
♫ Oh I'm in love with you. You are my ideal ♫

585
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:03,080
♫ Was that sky so pretty and blue♫

586
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,100
I died. How can I just ignore it?

587
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,670
You're in a manic (hyper-excited) mental state.

588
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:08,800
- You're over-imagining things.
- It's Gyo Chae Yeon.

589
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,160
- A family gathering before the marriage?
- They told me to come to my in-law's house.

590
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,110
Lee Kang Joon is mine! Let's find
the mastermind behind the conspiracy!

591
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,700
- Yes, Doctor.
- Beautiful!

592
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,350
Thank you for the invitation.

593
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,360
Where is the suicide note? Please show it to me.

594
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,300
Unni Sara, you have a lot of curiosity.

595
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,410
That building is Chae Yeon's, you say?

596
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:25,530
That is Kang Joon's room.
Why are you coming out from there?

597
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:29,190
It's not a suicide? You're trying to
hold my son down right now!

598
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:32,960
I wasn't anxious when I knew you were
interested in that woman, Sara.

599
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,570
Why do you think I have never even once been suspicious?

600
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:37,500
I saw Kang Joon here that day.

601
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,210
- Sara?
- I told you to get out. Get out!!

602
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:42,830
It's time for you and I to go our separate ways.

603
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:45,300
It's a real emergency.
She is taking action to find her grandson.

604
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,680
- Isn't her grandson dead?
- Are you hurt somewhere?

605
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,890
Mom!

606
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:51,730
Dad!

607
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:54,310
It's because I suspect what happened.

608
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:56,780
If Tae Hee tells me to live, I will live.
And, if he tells me to die, I will die.

609
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:59,760
Conspiracy or not, just forget it if I tell you to!
