1
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,510
Who called me out?

2
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,050
Come out!

3
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,090
Han Tae Hee,

4
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,010
Call him out about Sara's identity.
Then he will have to come out.

5
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,670
I'm worried about CEO Han Tae Hee.

6
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,390
Please just save him.

7
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,520
If I have to leave him, I will.

8
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,050
If you just save him,

9
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,000
I will do anything.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,970
Just save him.

11
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,810
Episode 16

12
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,290
What happened to Sara? Is she still not
picking up her phone?

13
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,910
She was at the broadcast station
until a few moments ago.

14
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,610
What might have happened?

15
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,990
If we had known in advance,
we could have been prepared.

16
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,950
Sara is so irresponsible.

17
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,150
Seriously! I'm going crazy. Call her again.

18
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,770
Okay.

19
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,910
Team Leader Choi! Tae Hee will be okay, right?

20
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,970
Tae Hee! Tae Hee! What happened?

21
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,790
Tae Hee!

22
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,510
He is unconscious at present.

23
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,060
There is no problem according to the CT scan,
so we think that he has "diffuse axonal" injury.

24
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,050
(Brain damage where CT or MRI show no abnormality,
but brain cells are damaged over a widespread area.)

25
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,780
For now, we're not certain when he will wake up.
(The main symptom is lack of consciousness.)

26
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,290
- Monitor his vitals every ten minutes.
- Yes.

27
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,750
Tae Hee.

28
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,930
Who was it? Who made him like that?

29
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,520
We are trying to find out.

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,880
It's all because of you.

31
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,740
This definitely happened because of you!

32
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,840
As soon as I found about your problem,
I should have stopped you from going near Tae Hee.

33
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,210
Get out of here.

34
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,490
Get away from Tae Hee immediately!

35
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,570
Tae Hee is unconscious. I can't just leave him.

36
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,290
Let me stay next to him.
I ask this of you, Grandmother.

37
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,190
Secretary Kim!

38
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,830
Get this girl out of here.

39
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,650
Don't let her near Tae Hee's hospital room.

40
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,300
I ask this of you, Grandmother.

41
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,810
What is this?

42
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,850
He's developed an additional arrhythmia.
Supplement his IV fluids and start an anti-arrythmic.

43
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,290
Doctor!

44
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,670
His situation has worsened compared to earlier.

45
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,150
Tae Hee!

46
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,000
Grandmother!

47
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,140
They say that Han Tae Hee is unconscious.

48
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,610
Because of arrhythmia, his heart rate is quickening.
His condition has worsened.

49
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,490
Does Han Tae Hee have a chronic illness by chance?

50
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,430
Yes. He sometimes had hypotensive shock,
as a symptom of Broken Heart syndrome.

51
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,670
His brain damage is not severe, but his unique
psychological situation is worsening his condition.

52
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,850
Oh my...

53
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,590
Please just save him.

54
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,330
Please, just save him.

55
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,710
All we can do is wait.

56
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,090
It's important to make a comfortable atmosphere

57
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,280
in order for the patient to not have any
unnecessary stimulation. Then ...

58
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,110
Elder, I will be here, so go back in.

59
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,250
Chae Yeon, escort the elder to her house.

60
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,750
Let's do that, Grandmother.

61
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:11,340
Timing and Subtitles brought to you

62
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,550
Grandmother, are you okay?

63
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,930
Mother, how about Tae Hee?

64
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,830
He remains unconscious.

65
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,930
Go in and rest for now.

66
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,330
Escort her to her room.

67
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,660
It's over here, Grandmother.

68
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,550
You should go inside.

69
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,570
I'm against you,

70
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,680
but I think the person that Tae Hee
will want to see the most right now

71
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,090
is you, Sara.

72
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,310
Thank you. Thank you.

73
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,110
When we come back here, we will be a married couple.

74
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,130
You will not be Ajumma, but Darling.

75
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,310
Does Tae Hee getting hurt have anything to do with you?

76
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,150
- Han Tae Hee got hurt?
- He is unconscious.

77
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,220
His condition is severe.

78
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,740
Han Tae Hee has a weakness. Sara's identity.

79
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,010
She may have stolen someone's identity.
But Han Tae Hee is the one who led her to do it.

80
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,210
It turned out well then, since Han Tae Hee
reported me to the Board of Directors.

81
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,260
Now I don't have to worry about him.

82
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,850
Then, ultimately, has the marriage been canceled?

83
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,490
- You!
- I didn't do it.

84
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,610
Does it have to do with General Manager Han Min Hyeok?

85
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,620
I told you to stop Sara and Tae Hee's marriage.

86
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,570
- Did I tell you to put Tae Hee into that condition?!
- Why are you so upset?

87
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,690
Oh,

88
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,710
you wanted to do something with Han Tae Hee,

89
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,740
but things have turned out to be unfortunate.

90
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,090
If Han Tae Hee dies, Sara won't have anywhere to go.

91
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,270
She is my wife whether I love or hate her,

92
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,790
so I'll have to take care of her.

93
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,530
It would be a different story if
she were still Sa Geum Ran.

94
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,940
But if she's Sara,

95
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,610
I could live with her.

96
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,770
Isn't that right?

97
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:47,680
♫When I'm looking at you like this. ♫

98
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:55,390
♫ My heart grows deaf as if it has fallen into a deep sleep. ♫

99
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:02,500
♫ I guess I can't do it, letting you go. ♫

100
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:10,870
♫ I can do everything else, but that's the only thing I can't. ♫

101
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:17,750
♫I hesitated for a long time, I sighed endlessly. ♫

102
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:24,830
♫  But I couldn't say anything and just turned away. I hate myself for that. ♫

103
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,670
♫  How can I forget you?♫

104
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,580
♫How can I erase you?♫

105
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:39,670
♫ I can't stand a single moment without you. ♫

106
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,430
♫  My heart aches so much.  ♫

107
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,300
♫  I can't let you go like this. ♫

108
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,880
♫ I'll wait for you until always. Although it hurts, it's ok. ♫

109
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,280
Sara is beside him?

110
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,130
That can't happen. Oppa, you have to separate them.

111
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,160
I'll go, right now.

112
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,520
Why are you here?

113
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,950
Didn't you hear what Grandma said?!

114
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,150
Keep it down.

115
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,730
Doctor just moved his fingers!

116
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,350
Han Tae Hee?

117
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,430
Han Tae Hee? If you can hear me, blink once.

118
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,270
Lift your left hand once.

119
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,460
Grandma, Tae Hee Oppa has regained consciousness.

120
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,930
Okay. Tae Hee.

121
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,180
I have something to speak to you about.

122
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,570
In a case like Han Tae Hee's, it's important to
maintain a comfortable environment for the patient.

123
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,950
When the woman that nursed him yesterday
was there, the patient seemed more stable.

124
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,270
Who?

125
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,000
Is it perhaps . . . Sara?

126
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,680
Han Tae Hee's psychological stability is
also important, as a patient.

127
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,270
There is a need for the woman who nursed him yesterday
to stay at his side for the time being.

128
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,880
You can nurse Tae Hee until he is discharged.

129
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,370
Thank you.

130
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,030
Provided, it's only until he is discharged.

131
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,700
It's because Tae Hee's health comes first.

132
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,810
I had a bad dream.

133
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,950
A dream where the bracelet was broken.

134
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,140
It wasn't a dream.

135
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,820
You were really hurt.

136
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,890
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you anymore.

137
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:22,420
You'll have to buy me a new bracelet, one that doesn't break.

138
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,990
It's only that the wedding has been a bit delayed.

139
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,930
Right?

140
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,750
First, quickly get better.

141
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,430
Like this, can the groom safely get to the altar?

142
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,610
Can't you just give me a piggyback ride down the aisle?

143
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,600
I missed you.

144
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,370
Even while I was sleeping.

145
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,790
Wasn't it your style to bite once and see it to the end?

146
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,870
What are you going to do if the old woman finds out
and reports it to the police?

147
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,770
Once Han Tae Hee is discharged, won't
they try to catch whoever did this?

148
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,670
She can't even imagine who would have
done that to Tae Hee.

149
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,460
She thinks it's because of Sara.

150
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,300
The entire world knows that I'm in a successor
fight with Han Tae Hee.

151
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,960
Who would they suspect when Han Tae Hee is in that condition?

152
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,990
I'll have to make a preemptive move first.

153
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,710
CEO Han Tae Hee is my younger brother.

154
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:12,750
Thankfully, his condition is greatly improved,
but it's still distressing.

155
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,610
Just who, exactly, would do something like this?

156
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,190
For my family, I, the eldest, am thinking to step forward.

157
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:25,090
Anyone who knows anything about
Han Tae Hee's accident, report it.

158
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:28,040
I will find the culprit with my own hands.

159
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,180
Allow me to request this of you.

160
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,500
I saw the interview.

161
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,390
Will you be alright with that much?

162
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,350
I'm wondering if you might be suspected.

163
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm going to use this to my advantage.

164
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,780
Thinking about it, there was more to be gained than lost.

165
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,780
By striving earnestly for my brother's sake,

166
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,800
Grandmother will be forced to give me brownie points.

167
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,070
Han Tae Hee has collapsed and can't do anything right now.

168
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,470
I'll take this chance to crush Winner Food's first item.

169
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,070
While he's collapsed, I'm thinking to take it all away,

170
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,620
including Sara.

171
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,240
The PD from Birth of a Chef called.

172
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,610
Speak to her.

173
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,290
Yes PD-nim.

174
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,830
What happened with the recording of Birth of a Chef?

175
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,440
We couldn't do the recording and delayed it.
Now, it will be tomorrow!

176
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,750
I'm sorry.

177
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,860
That's enough. Make sure to participate
in the recording without fail!

178
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,220
Can you promise?

179
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,180
Yes, I got it.

180
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,880
The PD sounds really mad.

181
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,270
I can hear it all.

182
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,990
I'll tell them about you getting hurt.

183
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,420
So, you are going to forfeit?

184
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,770
Think about it.

185
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:44,510
While I'm lying here, what is it that I need?

186
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,430
It's good news that will give me strength.

187
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:53,140
Ajumma, if you give up on the cooking competition,
I don't know if my Broken Heart syndrome may come back,

188
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,120
so go out even for my sake.

189
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,700
If you're going to do it, you might as well win.

190
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,990
Tae Hee Oppa regained consciousness.

191
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,680
What?

192
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,030
Then the Board of Directors meeting hasn't been cancelled?

193
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,170
Of course it hasn't been cancelled.

194
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:30,990
The Board of Directors meeting is the Board of Directors
meeting. But, your wife is nursing another man right now.

195
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,000
She's the very person who saved Tae Hee
Oppa's life. What can we do?

196
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,850
The two of them seem like they will never be separated.

197
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,080
She says that she's even going to participate in the cooking competition, as previously planned.

198
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,450
What, exactly, have you done?

199
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,690
Today's main theme, on Birth of a Chef,

200
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,070
is a meal that one would want to make for their family.

201
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,650
What will the challenger, Oh Kyeong Hee, prepare?

202
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,130
I, with the purpose of providing
the best meal for families,

203
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,930
will make the twelve side dishes
that were often served to kings.

204
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,930
Sara, what kind of dish will you prepare?

205
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,710
I will make four side dishes along with doenjang stew.
(Doenjang- fermented bean paste)

206
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,450
Last time, you made rice balls that
were the opposite of a fancy dish.

207
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,610
Are you perhaps also thinking to win points today
with a surprise show?

208
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,010
It's not a surprise show.

209
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,910
It's the dish that popped into my mind
as soon as I received the theme of family.

210
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,510
I wanted to share
my love through cooking.

211
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,050
My family...

212
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,110
As I imagine my family happily eating my food,

213
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,670
I will do my very best.

214
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,110
Then, for the food they wish to prepare for their families,

215
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,450
the competition will start now!

216
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,130
♫ I keep examining myself in the mirror,
without caring about the place or time.♫

217
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,390
♫  I can't believe how I look.  ♫

218
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:36,690
♫It's the first time I've felt this explicable heart fluttering. ♫

219
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,980
Doctor, please watch over me.

220
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,130
Doctor, you are already family to me.

221
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,960
Whether or not we will have our happy ending,

222
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,830
I don't know. But right now. . .

223
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,650
Just the fact that we're together, right now,

224
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,350
I'm happy.

225
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,770
I will cook for you, Doctor,

226
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,980
by doing my best.

227
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,100
♫ Oh, my dream ♫

228
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:12,810
♫I will start new again with a passionate heart. ♫

229
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,990
After the recording, will it be possible to see Sara?

230
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,830
Yes, I'll inform her as soon as she's done.

231
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,210
Study abroad?

232
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,530
We will provide support for you to study abroad.

233
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,710
It's the condition to becoming the main model
for the Winner Group Corporation.

234
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,580
Although you spoke about becoming the Headquarters' main model last time,

235
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,600
why overseas?

236
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,110
I am searching for the person
who hurt Tae Hee.

237
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,610
That's how I found out.

238
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,650
Sara,

239
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,130
is your identity phony?

240
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,590
The man, who hurt Tae Hee,

241
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,250
also threatened him using
your phony identity.

242
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,030
Tae Hee was hurt in place of you, Sara.

243
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,430
As a member of Tae Hee's family, I'm suggesting
this to you out of my concern.

244
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,970
As long as you're at Tae Hee's side,

245
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,620
he may continue to be in danger.

246
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,490
Where is Sara?

247
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,770
Why?

248
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,230
Are you finally thinking
that you should find your wife?

249
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,920
- Tell me where she is.
- She's

250
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,750
at the hospital to nurse Tae Hee Oppa.

251
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,290
To Sara,

252
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,930
you don't mean anything.

253
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,190
The person who called Han Tae Hee
was Kim Deok Soon's older brother?

254
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,090
Please answer me.

255
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,860
The man who called

256
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:34,340
said that he knew you had a fake identity.

257
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,650
The CEO said he would directly handle it
and told me never to tell you about it.

258
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,410
Please don't tell him that I know about this.

259
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,920
Right now, helping Tae Hee recover is the top priority.

260
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,670
Yes.

261
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:03,290
Due to your identity issues, I heard Tae Hee
may be in trouble. Is that also true?

262
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:08,550
I don't care what happens to you.
Because of you, Tae Hee Oppa will get hurt.

263
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,250
It was because of me.

264
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:25,230
Timing and Subtitles brought to you

265
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,290
Have you still not given up on Han Tae Hee?

266
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:42,090
You can't leave him even though he's in that condition?

267
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,790
Will he have to die for you to come to your senses?

268
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,360
Han Tae Hee getting hurt,

269
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,620
did you do it?

270
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,840
The only person who knows that my identity is fake is you,

271
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,500
and you recently threatened me.

272
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,760
It's you, right?

273
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,730
Is it?

274
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,170
If it's related...

275
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,460
If Han Tae Hee is hurt because of you,

276
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,960
I won't leave you alone.

277
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,930
Even if Han Tae Hee dies and wakes up again,

278
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,370
you're still my wife.

279
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,010
You won't be able to go to anyone.

280
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,810
The more you obsess over Han Tae Hee,

281
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,770
the more I won't leave him alone. Understand?

282
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,010
What is it that you want?

283
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,750
When you've gotten so pretty like this,

284
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,290
you're way different from Sa Geum Ran.

285
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,930
Your personality has also changed.

286
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,440
I feel something new.

287
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,640
I think I can live well with Sara.

288
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,220
Let's live together.

289
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,690
The more you refuse,

290
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,210
the more dangerous it'll be for Han Tae Hee.

291
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,840
You know me well,

292
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,860
what I did to Sa Geum Ran.

293
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,360
How did it go with the cooking competition?

294
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,550
- Are you curious?
- Of course!

295
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,290
Did you win?

296
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,420
Did you lose?

297
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,450
If you're curious, watch the rebroadcast.

298
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,830
Are you also trying to sell the rebroadcast to me too?

299
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,150
Looking at your condition, you should be
released from the hospital.

300
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,140
- Already?
- Yes.

301
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,890
Since I didn't hear the status update from
Dr. Jo Chae Hee today, I'll go to see him and return.

302
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:22,790
You're going so soon after you just arrived?
I was waiting all day for you, Ajumma.

303
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,550
Why? Does it hurt?

304
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,590
Y-yeah. The back of my hand hurts.

305
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,870
Oh, what shall I do? I'll call the nurse.

306
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,740
No, Ajumma!

307
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,350
The best treatment

308
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,570
is the warm, healing hands of a loved one.

309
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,720
If you touch me, Ajumma,
endorphins will be released

310
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,330
and the pain will subside.

311
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,230
I think my forehead hurts too.

312
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,810
I think the areas where it hurts
are slowly moving up.

313
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,660
My cheek doesn't feel well either.

314
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,690
To you Ajumma, which seems worse, the forehead or cheek?

315
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,610
You choose, then doctor me, Ajumma.

316
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,910
Make sure Han Tae Hee
doesn't say anything useless.

317
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,290
Yes. I understand.

318
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,110
The more you refuse,

319
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,250
the more dangerous it will be for Han Tae Hee.

320
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,870
Nurse,

321
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,390
will you please come here?

322
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:25,420
The man, who injured Tae Hee, threatened him
with his knowledge of your identity.

323
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,000
Tae Hee met with an accident while
being involved, in place of you.

324
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:38,920
As long as you stay near Tae Hee,
he may continue to be in danger.

325
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,910
Why are you staying so uncomfortably?

326
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,430
You're awake?

327
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,190
Come in here.

328
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,080
When I lived alone, after my parents passed away . . .

329
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,200
Even though I was young,

330
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,850
and my parents weren't even around,
I still wondered why I had to live alone.

331
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,920
At least, that's what I thought.

332
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,930
But this time, I thought that I definitely had to live,

333
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,110
because I have you, Ajumma.

334
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:32,620
You've become my reason for living.

335
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,740
I think we will have to separate.

336
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,360
The results of the examination show that
you should be able to be discharged tomorrow.

337
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,920
However, while resting at home,
please still receive necessary treatment.

338
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,590
Let's go to Sae Won Dang (the family home).

339
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,590
My house is comfortable.

340
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,730
Grandmother, come to my house. It's livable.

341
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,630
Please continue your discussion.

342
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:34,320
Oh, by the way, you also owe Sara thanks.

343
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,370
Not only while he was unconscious, but

344
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:40,970
Han Tae Hee's recovery is due to Sara's nursing.

345
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,530
You heard that, right, Grandmother?

346
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:03,110
Although I want to take him to Sae Won Dang,
Tae Hee doesn't want it.

347
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:08,790
The two of you being together, after
Tae Hee is discharged, is not possible.

348
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,810
Am I the only one thinking that you are
putting Tae Hee in danger?

349
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,270
Why aren't you answering?

350
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,450
Yes. I will leave him.

351
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,610
It would be good if you left while Tae Hee
was still in the hospital. Today.

352
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,940
Please give me some time.

353
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,530
You're going to be leaving him anyway.
What's the good of postponing it?

354
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,410
I'm not prepared yet.

355
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:50,440
If I leave suddenly, Han Tae Hee
will also have a difficult time.

356
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,750
I'd like to do something for him, so that
he will be able to do well without me.

357
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,050
I beg of you.

358
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,820
Yes Sara, please speak.

359
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,920
May I see you for a moment?

360
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,650
No, I will go to your office.

361
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,610
Please sit.

362
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:47,780
If I accept the modeling contract, is it possible
to study abroad as soon as possible?

363
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,500
How quickly are you talking about?

364
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,310
As soon as possible.

365
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,520
I'd like to leave as soon as possible.

366
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,700
I understand.

367
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:06,230
Also, can you keep where I'm going a secret?

368
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,480
I'd like to live without anyone knowing.

369
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,370
What is the reason?

370
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,920
That's how

371
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,610
I think Han Tae Hee will be safe.

372
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,900
I understand.

373
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,430
I'll be the only one who knows your whereabouts.

374
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,930
It's me. Meet with me right now.

375
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,180
Have you organized your thoughts?

376
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,120
If it were only about me, I wouldn't be afraid.

377
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,450
However, due to a person I love, I know about
stepping away, even if I don't want to.

378
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:17,170
You and Gyo Chae Yeon won't know about this heart,

379
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:22,140
because you two haven't ever sincerely loved anyone.

380
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:31,260
Just as you said, Han Tae Hee and I will separate.

381
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:37,090
So can we return to being a married couple?

382
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,890
Married couple?

383
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,840
I'm going to see this to the end with you.

384
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,470
You, me and Gyo Chae Yeon.

385
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,960
The three of us aren't finished yet.

386
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,510
Ah! The smell of my house.

387
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:25,900
You have to leave the house to know how precious it is.
I missed this house so much!

388
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,900
Oh! The lights came on, Ajumma! What happened?

389
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,640
I fixed it.

390
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,140
So your wish will come true.

391
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,620
I will unpack your luggage.

392
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,500
Take your time! There's no one chasing after you.

393
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,400
Ajumma! Let's eat.

394
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,230
You know I'm looking forward to home cooking, right?

395
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,860
What are you doing, Ajumma?

396
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,130
Organizing things so you can find them easily.

397
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:33,330
It's not something urgent, so do things like
this slowly. Let's eat something first.

398
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,090
Doctor,

399
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:59,570
if I left and weren't here, would you
keep living in this house?

400
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,460
What?

401
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:08,320
If you're left alone without me,
find another house aside from this one.

402
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,430
I think that would be good for you.

403
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,470
What's up with you? You're suddenly
talking as if you were going somewhere far.

404
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,750
I ate well.

405
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,620
Ajumma, that was really good.

406
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,390
I'll take care of the dishes.

407
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,100
Doctor,

408
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,080
I have something to say.

409
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,260
What is it?

410
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:59,210
Let's break up.

411
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,270
I have a contract with Winner Group Corporation.

412
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,810
If I'm the corporate model, they said they would
send me overseas to a cooking school.

413
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,670
I don't really understand what you're saying.

414
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,730
I hurt my head.

415
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:35,020
They mentioned that my mental processes
may be delayed. Could this be a side effect?

416
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,070
My comprehension is slow.

417
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,390
Talk more easily.

418
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,500
I don't want to marry again.

419
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,680
I realized it when you were hurt.

420
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:53,590
If we get married, I will end up losing my own identity
by becoming tied to a husband.

421
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,720
I want to live my own life.

422
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,400
You can live your life. I will accommodate you well!

423
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,610
When you were hurt, Ajumma, I even helped
you practice, and you won first place.

424
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,970
After we marry, everything will change.

425
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,260
I've married before.

426
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,600
It wasn't like that for
Sa Geum Ran at first, either.

427
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:21,850
Ajumma...

428
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,400
I'm sorry.

429
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,700
It's hard for me to say these words, too.

430
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,470
Ajumma, I won't disturb you.

431
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,520
I won't become any kind of bother to your life.

432
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,570
Please break up with me.

433
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,020
All right. I understand.

434
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,270
All right... then...

435
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:58,410
Tell me everything you want to do. I'll follow it all!

436
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,340
I'll match everything to you. Just don't
say that you want to break up with me.

437
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:05,650
We don't have to marry, and we can just
stay like this. So there's no need to break up.

438
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,440
I can't do that.

439
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,810
How can I treat you in the usual manner
after breaking up our marriage plans?

440
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,560
We can't have a good relationship, like back then.

441
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,890
- I said I'll try!
- I want to live differently.

442
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,890
I want to live by my own will.

443
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:22,060
With this beauty that you created, I want to live a chic life.

444
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,190
I'm sorry.

445
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,370
And... I'm grateful.

446
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,770
What are you talking about?

447
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,300
Think about it again, okay?

448
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,700
Aren't you being too much?

449
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,840
You have to give me time to
think about it or at least prepare!

450
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,280
How can you be so one-sided?

451
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,330
What did I do so wrong that you're doing this?

452
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:05,450
I was just discharged. I'm not even in my
right mind right now. I'm in a defenseless state.

453
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:07,640
Can't you consider my situation?

454
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,890
So suddenly, so thoughtlessly.
This isn't right, Ajumma!

455
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,790
- I'm sorry.
- Please, would you stop with the apologizing?!

456
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,780
It's good for farewells to be brief,
since it's hard for both of us.

457
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,150
I'm sorry.

458
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:35,900
♫ I'm the only one who didn't know.
I thought it would last forever. ♫

459
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:43,220
♫  I'm the only one who didn't know.
I thought we would be happy.  ♫

460
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:51,550
♫  I love you, now they are words I can't say to you. ♫

461
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:57,650
♫  I didn't know if this is what a break up felt like.  ♫

462
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,170
♫  Why do we have to break up? ♫

463
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:05,900
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
♫  I don't want to break up. What should I do? ♫

464
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,050
I'm sorry!
♫  Don't do this, no, please. ♫

465
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:17,700
♫  How could you do this to me? Why are you doing this? ♫

466
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:25,560
♫  I can't live without you. ♫

467
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:32,920
♫  I can't break up like others do.  ♫

468
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:40,260
♫  I can't turn around like others do. ♫

469
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:52,460
♫  So I believe that you'll come back to me.  ♫

470
00:47:52,460 --> 00:48:02,020

All right.

Are you still with Tae Hee?

474
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:14,550
I have decided to break up with Han Tae Hee.

475
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,190
We talked about it also.

476

Where will you go?

477
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,970
I've decided to go overseas.

Good, then. I'll trust your word.

479
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:31,850
I wish someone would take care of Han Tae Hee.

480

Since it's a house where we lived together,
if one person isn't here,

481
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,600
the house will feel very lonely.

482
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,490
I will look after Tae Hee. You don't have
to worry about him.

Have you seen Sara?

489
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,240
Why are you looking for Sara here?

490
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,840
I thought the two of you were getting married.

491
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,310
What happened, Mr. Han Tae Hee?

492
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,920
Sara... She's going to study overseas?

493
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,930
I heard she left the house as of today.

494

Tae Hee is going to have a hard time right now.

495

Will you and Doctor Joon look in on Tae Hee often?

496
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:07,360
Times like this are when family is needed.

Yes Grandmother.

Why are you packing? Did you have a fight?

499

Are you separating again?

500
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,530
This time we're not separating.

Then?

It wasn't easy to announce my divorce.

503
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,970
I did my best to protect my family, but

504
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:08,000
I really couldn't do it with my own strength.

What is the reason, Gyo Chae Yeon?

507
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,700
He has . . . a woman.

508
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,120
- Who is the woman?
- A celebrity?

509

She's a famous person.

510
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:32,140
But I won't reveal her name.
I don't want to go that far.

Okay, let's do it!

then exacted revenge on her husband.

The whole nation will be in an uproar.

So, live your life quietly with your mouth shut.

630
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:31,660
♫  A cold wind blows. ♫

631
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:38,020
♫  And like a habit, I worry about you again. ♫

632
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:46,370
♫  You're next to someone else right now.  ♫

633
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:53,560
♫  Although you're probably happy, there's no place for me.  ♫

634
01:02:54,660 --> 01:03:01,600
♫  My friends beg me to stop.  ♫

635
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:08,670
♫  But I can't, I can't do it, that's me.  ♫

636
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:10,550
♫ How can I forget you? ♫

637
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,920
I'm looking for a passenger on flight PJ301.
♫ How can I erase you? ♫

638
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,750
Can I request a broadcast? It's an emergency.

639
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:19,840
PJ301 already took off.
♫ I can't stand a single moment- ♫

640
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,660
♫ How can I forget you? ♫

641
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:42,720
♫  How much more do I have to hurt to let you go? ♫

642
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:46,500
♫ My heart is aching so. ♫

643
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:51,360
♫ I can't let you go like this. ♫

644
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:57,110
♫  Even if I have to wait forever, even if it hurts, it's okay.  ♫

645
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:04,490
♫  While both crying and shouting, no matter how I search for you  ♫

646
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:13,500
♫  While knowing there's no use.♫

647
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,590
♫  I'l say I love you I love you to your back as you turn away.  ♫

648
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:19,540
Is that it Ajumma? Was I the one who liked you like a crazy fool? Was I the only one who liked you and the only one who is like this?

649
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:25,230
Either you quietly give me the building, or I will reveal this.
It contains the footage of you murdering Sa Geum Ran.

650
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:29,720
Tae Hee gave up working at Winner Food? Is it because of Sara?

651
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:34,070
It's our chance since Han Tae Hee is weak. I'm going to falsify
documents and report Han Tae Hee to the prosecutor.

652
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,550
Han Tae Hee might be reported to the police?

653
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:40,830
In the end, you couldn't protect your woman. Just like
your father who passed away twenty years ago.

654
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:43,580
Tell me where you've sent Sara.
