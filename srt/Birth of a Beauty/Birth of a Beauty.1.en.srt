00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
[Episode 1]

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,800
[Have you heard of the Plastic Surgery Wave?]

3
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,000
[In many Asian countries, people are coming to Korea to get plastic surgery.]

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,360
[Because of the Hallyu plastic surgery wave, one hundred plastic surgeons]

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,180
[presented the ideal representation of a beautiful face in Asia from Face Research.]

6
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,800
[The presented beauty was not merely a beautiful face,]

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,690
[but also with a mysterious aura and nice features.]

8
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,920
Wow! Were there this many shops here?

9
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,840
It changed a lot.

10
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,250
You've returned from living abroad, huh?

11
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,330
You're of a different cut.

12
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,500
Ah, yes.

13
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,730
I worked at ABC in America, but returned to
Korea after signing with HBS.

14
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,350
Manager, I'll get off here, ok?

15
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,750
I'm going to look around first and then go, so let's
meet directly at the event site.

16
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:08,030
- Doesn't it seem like I should fix my eyes bigger?
- Your eyes are way bigger than mine.

17
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,950
Ew, this is a computerised beauty.

18
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,820
How can this kind of beauty exist in real life?

19
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,320
Huh?

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,820
There it is.

21
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,700
- She's beautiful.
- Really beautiful.

22
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,800
Wow, she's definitely my style.

23
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,610
So pretty!

24
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,110
♫ A petite woman who smiles often  ♫

25
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,230
♫  A woman who looks prettier without makeup ♫

26
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,900
♫  A woman whose cheeks flush with only a sip of wine  ♫

27
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,910
♫  A woman whose smiling eyes are beautiful.  ♫

28
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,560
♫  When I see you, you are like that. My heart leaps.  ♫

29
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,810
♫  Finding a rare woman like you is hard ♫

30
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,840
♫  When you smile, I want to cuddle you ...  ♫

31
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,410
Woah! She is so pretty!

32
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,840
Look over there!

33
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,390
♫ Oh I'm in love with you. It feels like we fit like a puzzle. ♫

34
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,760
♫  Oh, I'm in love with you. You are my ideal type.  ♫

35
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,750
♫ I like it because she's really beautiful.
No, I like it more because it's relaxing.  ♫

36
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,280
♫ My heart feels like it's going to stop.  ♫

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,150
Perfect proportions to the upper and lower body.

38
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,400
1:1.618. It's the golden ratio.

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,210
She is a goddess!

40
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:36,270
♫  Was the sky this pretty and blue?  ♫

41
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,660
♫  Even if I see a sad movie, I still smile.  ♫

42
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,330
Is she a celebrity?

43
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,400
Thank you.

44
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,930
Are you a celebrity?

45
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,580
Yes, I started a program on HBS recently.

46
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,560
Is that right?

47
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,720
I have never seen such a face.

48
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,910
Me?

49
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,620
How is it?

50
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,800
You have a face of a beauty that may or may not emerge once in a hundred years,

51
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,280
like Cleopatra or Hwang Jini.

52
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,570
But it's strange.

53
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,100
You also have the face of a general like
Yi Sun Sin (Immortal Admiral).

54
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,590
A beauty with a face of a general?

55
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,060
You have a face that will save the nation.

56
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,510
Korea will focus on you!

57
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,000
But you are too sympathetic. The problem is
that you're too meddlesome.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,190
Many men follow you around. That's obvious since you are pretty.

59
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,100
The problem is if a bad man becomes entangled.

60
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,500
You have to be careful of your compassion and bad men.

61
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,800
If you just keep wary of those two things, you will succeed in life.

62
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,260
Look over here!

63
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,100
Stop right there!

64
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,130
You are mine!

65
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,930
What in the world.

66
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,040
It seems like celebrities are born that way. How is she so pretty?

67
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,460
Her face is the size of my fist. I'm so jealous.

68
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,590
I'm going to get C cup for these colors.

69
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,000
That's right. They're really big, aren't they?
Hurry up and get them.

70
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,330
What? 'Pretty'?

71
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Pink is the best.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,300
Pink, pink!

73
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,700
Stop right there!

74
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,650
You are mine!

75
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,990
Did you follow me?

76
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,770
Stalker?

77
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,670
Be careful of your compassion and bad men.

78
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,600
Bad men...

79
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,940
Now, it's just us two.

80
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,670
I caught you.

81
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,100
Who are you? What are you doing?

82
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,920
Let's discuss why I'm like this.

83
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,190
Hey!

84
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,560
He's a stalker! He followed me!

85
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,050
Even if you run, Bucheon is the size of my palm.

86
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,640
Move.

87
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,780
Come over here.

88
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,190
I said to come here!

89
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,100
Aigoo, my back.

90
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,100
Did I do that?

91
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,200
I don't know what came over me.

92
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,780
I suddenly got a surge of strength!

93
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,980
Hold on. Ajumma!

94
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,020
- You must have been surprised. Are you all right?
- Ajumma!

95
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,350
Ah, yes.

96
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,040
- A little softer now.
- Wow!

97
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,580
The department store's public relations department will send someone, and the security team will come also.

98
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,250
Can you wait fifteen minutes?

99
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,430
Yes, I'll do that.

100
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,350
Thank you.

101
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,180
You guys are looking at Sa Geum Ran's story.

102
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,970
It is really a tragic story.

103
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,730
You came?

104
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,750
How much is it?

105
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,290
Ajumma,

106
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,640
- what is this?
- It's a program called, Change.

107
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,390
Oh, Change!

108
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,690
It's the program that gives people a full-body makeover, right?

109
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,540
I know that!

110
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,280
It's really fun.

111
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,100
Come again!

112
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,980
Yes, sell a lot!

113
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,420
- Hello!
- Oh, you came!

114
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,290
She seems familiar...

115
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,100
Is that someone I know?

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,100
I have fresh crabs. They're delicious!

117
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,430
- Hello!
- Welcome.

118
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,120
It has to be a female since it's for the memorial table.

119
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,810
This one looks like a male.

120
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,660
Then look at it. You can tell if it's a female or male
by just looking at it.

121
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,000
Should I?

122
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,300
Oh, gosh.

123
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,690
What should I do?

124
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,340
Are you okay?

125
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,370
I'm okay. I'm okay.

126
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,970
I'm okay. I'm okay.

127
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,380
I'm okay. I'm okay.

128
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,900
I want to lose weight.

129
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,000
Because if you are fat,

130
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
your body will suffer,

131
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
and there is an another thing.

132
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,400
Ahjussi!

133
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Ahjussi, stop!

134
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,500
Ahjussi!

135
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,100
Ahjussi!

136
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
Thank you.

137
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,170
Thank you.

138
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,600
Ow!

139
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,600
Ahjussi, you didn't call me, right?

140
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,300
Ugh. Just pick it up!

141
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,400
Yes.

142
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,700
Oh my!

143
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,000
I know that nobody will help me.

144
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
I hope that you guys would laugh instead.

145
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,100
Being belittled is better than being pitied.

146
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,500
If you are fat, your body suffers.

147
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,700
But honestly, the hardest thing is that your heart hurts.

148
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,830
Mmm... It's delicious.

149
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,610
I'm back!

150
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,930
Sister-in-law is back.

151
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,550
Let's stop eating. Do you want to end up like that?

152
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,980
That's right. I'll gain weight.

153
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,960
The crisis is readily apparent.

154
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,490
- Sister-in-law, eat all of this.
- Okay.

155
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,060
After you eat clean the boxes and get rid of the smell.

156
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,130
You know it's big trouble if we get caught having
eaten junk food?

157
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:13,100
Yes, Miss. I'll eat it all, rest well!

158
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,920
- Geum Ran.
- Grandmother.

159
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,130
I'm hungry. Let's mix rice and eat it together.

160
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,210
Yes, Grandmother. Should we eat bibimbap together?

161
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,190
Rest for a bit.

162
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,280
Dear.

163
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,920
My life is overflowing with the luck of eating well.

164
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,050
Now, I'd like to refuse that kind of luck.

165
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,520
I want to lose weight.

166
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,580
How many in-laws does she have? It looks difficult.

167
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,520
Of course, of course. After handling the housework of a family of that size,

168
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,870
100 kilograms is a breeze. You don't have time to take care of yourself.

169
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,200
Has the husband come out yet? Do they live together?

170
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,530
He's overseas handling a business.
They have been living apart for seven years.

171
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:39,840
She manages her in-laws' household alone and takes care of a sick grandmother.

172
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,250
Hello. We heard there was an accident.

173
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,160
We are speechless.

174
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,170
Me?
 Well, Sa Geum Ran ...

175
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,230
Me? That's right. Look at my mind.

176
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,860
I was looking at that ajumma, and I forgot.
What happened to the man?

177
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,630
We handed him over to the police,
so you can relax.

178
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,560
Let's go.

179
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,510
Can she become the focus of a Perfect Makeover?

180
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,400
That's too bad. I wanted to watch a little bit more.

181
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,430
- There's "Watch it again."
- Ohh.

182
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,690
"Watch it again?"

183
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,180
Did you come? I was just going to leave.

184
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,400
Ajumma, there was a stalker at the store today.

185
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,550
He's a punk whose eyes were as venomous looking
as a crocodile's, but it was so frightening.

186
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,590
You never know. Please lock all the windows
and close the curtains before you leave.

187
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,770
I should change the front door code also.

188
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,700
Please enter your new code.

189
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,090
I wonder what happened to the Ajumma Sa Geum Ran?

190
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,210
She looks familiar the more I see her.

191
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,490
Honey. Hi.

192
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,750
Honey, how is this dress? I made it.

193
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,670
This hair pin too.

194
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,910
It matches the clothing, perfectly.

195
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,190
I'm sorry I couldn't film a video yesterday.

196
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,180
It was Grandfather's memorial, so I couldn't film it
because I was too busy.

197
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,730
You must be really busy there too.

198
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,790
Seeing as how it's been months since you were even able to check your Kakao Talk (instant messenger app),

199
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:58,430
you must be busy. It's not like business in the United States is easy, right?

200
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,050
Miss.

201
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,950
What is it sister-in-law? Continue, continue.

202
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,360
It's fun to watch. Go ahead.

203
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,420
She's got that flower in her hair trying to act feminine.

204
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,990
She must be crazy. What a shock!

205
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,120
She's been living alone for seven years since Kang Joon went to America.

206
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,750
It's about time for her to lose it.

207
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,550
Geum Ran, let's eat these rice balls.

208
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,040
It's delicious, eat it.

209
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,640
I want to lose weight.

210
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,160
I understand. I understand.

211
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,580
I wish that you could win 'Change' and have the surgery.

212
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,790
She has to live happily with her husband.

213
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,700
Now I will reveal...

214
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,820
Change. Episode 45.

215
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,430
Who will receive a complete surgical makeover?

216
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,490
Housewife of 8 years, Sa Geum Ran, or

217
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,940
Lee So Hee who has been unemployed for five years!

218
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,060
Between these two, who will be the winner today?

219
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,630
Who is it? Who?

220
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,890
Change's 45th episode, today's winner...

221
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,340
The main character is!

222
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,430
Lee So Hee! Congratulations!

223
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,540
It's very unfortunate for Sa Geum Ran.

224
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,510
Eliminated?! How can she be eliminated?

225
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,880
You're killing her again. It's pitiful!

226
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,850
No matter how much I think of it, this is too pitiful. It can't be.

227
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,530
Alright. It's proper to help someone at times like this.

228
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,730
You're the producer in charge of 'Change,' right? This is a precious viewer.

229
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,050
The 45th contestant Sa Geum Ran,

230
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,120
you know that she lives without her husband while watching over his grandma with dementia.

231
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,420
How can you give a nice person a wound?

232
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,230
Everyone who watched your TV program
rooted for Sa Geum Ran!

233
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,230
Pick Sa Geum Ran as the winner.

234
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,560
If you don't I'm going to put up a civil complaint on the homepage of the Blue House!

235
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,500
What?

236
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,500
Sa Geum Ran...she gave up the surgery?

237
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,300
Why?

238
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,300
Sa Geum Ran Eliminated

239
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,700
Yes. To tell you in details, we can't give you any information.

240
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,940
You'll see the rest of the story if you go on the Viewer's Bulletin Board.

241
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,700
Change.

242
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,000
Viewer's Bulletin Board.

243
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,600
19,326 comments.

244
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,900
Eun Gyeong Joo.

245
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,300
My pitiful friend, solve Geum Ran's injustice.

246
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,800
I am Geum Ran's friend, Eun Gyeong Joo.

247
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,900
I am so angry that I am uploading Geum Ran's story.

248
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,300
Why are you answering my husband's phone? Are you also in America?

249
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,400
You are in Seoul?

250
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,780
Is my husband in Seoul?

251
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,060
He came back? He didn't come home.

252
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,790
Where is he right now?

253
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,100
Honey! It's me.

254
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,460
Are you here?

255
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,300
Hello.

256
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,800
Honey... It's you.

257
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,300
What happened?

258
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,390
Kang Joon, are you going to keep teasing me?

259
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,400
You're unstoppable, seriously.

260
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,860
What is this? I can't move.

261
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,500
I'm sorry that you found out like this.

262
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I didn't want to hurt you, Unni.

263
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,800
Unni...

264
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,500
Hurt me?

265
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,100
I was wondering how I should call you.

266
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,900
"You" seemed arrogant and "Mrs." seems aggressive.

267
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,000
I know that no matter what I say, you won't feel better.

268
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,240
I worried about even the details of this meeting.

269
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,070
I sincerely feel bad for you.

270
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,970
About what?

271
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,100
All of it.

272
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,470
Yes, then please break up with my husband.

273
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,070
Break it off with him.

274
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,800
I waited for my husband to come back for seven years.
While taking care of his family, seven years!

275
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,700
Gyo Chae Yeon, you are young and pretty.

276
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,350
You can meet other men. It has to be him for me.

277
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,950
Everyday, I only thought about him.

278
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,200
To me, he is my first and last love.

279
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,350
He is my life's everything.

280
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,800
If I leave him,

281
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,500
do you think that you two will be able to live as
a married couple?

282
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,160
Why can't we? We are still a married couple.

283
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,500
In the beginning, I felt bad for you, Unni.

284
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,040
Now that I've met you, Unni, I feel bad for him now.

285
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,600
What do you mean by that?

286
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,120
When you two married, I know that you guys
were a normal couple.

287
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,870
I know that he left to study abroad due
to your dedicated support also.

288
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,130
Kang Joon thinks of that thankfully too.

289
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:47,020
However, after he left for America, many things changed.

290
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,230
You should know that he succeeded enough to be mentioned in Newsweek.

291
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:56,120
He was officially appointed as the director of HBS.

292
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,330
Do you think that you, Unni,

293
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,700
are suitable for him?

294
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,250
Do you even

295
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,000
look at the mirror?

296
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,600
I can't let her go like this.

297
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,900
Gyo Chae Yeon!

298
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,000
Promise me that you will break up with my husband. Before you do that, I can't leave.

299
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,360
Let me go! I finished what I had to say.

300
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,370
Gyo Chae Yeon, please!

301
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,800
Gyo Chae Yeon! You are okay, right?

302
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,000
Get up! Gyo Chae Yeon! Gyo Chae Yeon!

303
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,200
- Gyo Chae Yeon!
- You can't come in.

304
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,100
I am Gyo Chae Yeon's manager.

305
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,440
- So what?
- Since you assaulted a celebrity, I came with a detective.

306
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,800
Assault? It's not assault. Why would I assault someone?

307
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,930
You pushed Chae Yeon! There are many people that saw you. What are you talking about?

308
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,770
I'm Detective Kim from the Gangnam Police Station.

309
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,240
I have a few things to ask you.

310
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,200
I didn't do anything! I just asked her to speak to me!

311
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,290
Come this way.

312
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,300
- Let's hurry up and go!
-No.

313
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,070
- Hurry up, and let's go!
- No, really, I didn't!

314
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,010
Let go of her arm!

315
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,600
I am HBS's Lee Kang Joon. This is my wife.

316
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,500
I guarantee her identity. Since there is no worry of her running away, let her go.

317
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,880
If you send us a subpoena, I'll allow you to investigate her accompanied by a lawyer.

318
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,700
I was really scared.

319
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,350
You don't know how happy I am that you came.

320
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,190
Honey, I really missed you.

321
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,730
As a husband, this is the last time I'm going to protect you.

322
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
Our marriage has ended.

323
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,760
Honey,

324
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,290
I will do better.

325
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,870
If there are any parts that you don't like, I will fix it.

326
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,440
I will take care of your family and grandmother.

327
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,120
I will be nicer to your sisters.

328
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,140
Come back home. I will give you food and iron your shirts.

329
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,930
I will even support you well in your company work.

330
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,300
It's not that.

331
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,100
You just...

332
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,700
want to love.

333
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,100
Yes, Mother.

334
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm at the hospital. Chae Yeon is okay.

335
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,500
My wife is with me right now.

336
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,680
Mother-in-law, did you already know?

337
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,150
That he came back to Korea and that he has a woman?

338
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,620
Did you know?

339
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,100
Hey, the makeup under your eyes is smeared.

340
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,800
What is up with your hair? And what is up with your appearance, seriously?

341
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Our Kang Joon is not confirmed to be the director of HBS.

342
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,520
You're going around showing the worst of yourself!

343
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,880
- Mother-in-law!
- Floundering and poking around.

344
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:31,070
Anyway, you are so unsophisticated!

345
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:35,920
How can you do this? How can you fool a person like this?

346
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,590
You should have told me!

347
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,590
Honestly, how can we possibly tell you?

348
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,030
You sent Kang Joon videos and threw yourself at him on a daily basis (by video).

349
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,970
When we saw that, how could we possibly tell you?

350
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,360
It was a difficult situation for us also.

351
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,450
We also understood our Oppa's feelings.

352
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,690
So all of you knew already?

353
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,250
Everything?!

354
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,420
Chae Yeon is my high school classmate.

355
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,540
How could I possibly not know?

356
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:13,360
You can't be like this to me! At least one person
needs to help me!

357
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,330
Hey, don't cry. It's not pleasant to look at.

358
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,450
When our citizen movement sent a food truck to be thrifty and cut spending,

359
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:26,050
even the homeless from Yougsangu came.
The food truck was a success.

360
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,740
It's been three years since we founded the civil group,

361
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,090
it's better than it was in Shim Woo Won's day.

362
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,200
But anyway why is everyone gathered around? Is something wrong in the house?

363
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,410
No, what do you mean? We were just about to go back to our rooms.

364
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,930
Hey, what are you guys doing? Go and clean your rooms quickly.

365
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,220
We're going in Dad.

366
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,300
Why are you like this?

367
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,800
Did you cry? Did your mother-in-law scold you?

368
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:02,070
To someone who just accomplished something big outside, must I see your face like this as I soon as I cross the threshold?

369
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:06,170
Don't make me worried. Take care of your business by yourself.

370
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,400
Go in, right now.

371
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,200
Do you not look at the mirror at all?

372
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,500
Our Geum Ran is looking pretty.

373
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,860
I'll make you look pretty.

374
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,890
Like this, your husband will like it.

375
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,480
What do I do?

376
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,900
Ajumma is so pitiful.

377
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,100
Are you crying? What is the matter?

378
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,390
There's a pitiful ajumma, but

379
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,600
nobody finds her pitiful.

380
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
My heart really hurts.

381
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,800
This was in your mailbox.

382
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,900
I will make it possible for you to meet Sa Geum Ran.

383
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Come to this place.

384
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,200
What did you say? What happened to Sa Geum Ran?

385
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,120
Geum Ran passed away.

386
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,600
She is not a person in this world anymore.

387
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,800
We are having a 49th day memorial ceremony for Geum Ran.

388
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,260
When?

389
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,890
Geum Ran gave up on the show

390
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,700
and killed herself.

391
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,100
Geum Ran saw a scene that she shouldn't have seen again.

392
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,600
She visited her husband's family's house to
try to pull herself together,

393
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,660
but as if they would wait until she left, they invited that woman with whom he was cheating.

394
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,650
When she saw that, she just couldn't look at her in-laws anymore.

395
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:21,340
♫  There is nothing I can hear again. I don't like women like me  ♫

396
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,700
♫  I shouted for you to go away. ♫

397
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:34,400
♫  I hated you who wanted to stop , and I felt angry  ♫.

398
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,940
♫  You said it like it wasn't a big deal.  ♫

399
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:48,070
♫ When we break up it's always the same phrase, "didn't you see it wrong?" ♫

400
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:52,440
♫ It seems like a different person. It's all like lies ♫

401
00:38:52,440 --> 00:39:04,590
♫  I didn't know...I thought our marriage will last forever ♫

402
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:18,440
♫ Only I didn't know. I didn't know happiness ♫

403
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,220
She said that nobody looked for her.

404
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,500
♫  Now, the words that I can't say to you ♫

405
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,530
♫ I didn't know that things like this are breaking up ♫

406
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:34,140
Geum Ran had nowhere to go.

407
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:45,980
♫ I don't want to break up. What should I do,
please don't do this. ♫

408
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:52,810
♫  How can you do this to me? Why are you like that? ♫

409
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:55,530
The car that Geum Ran was riding.

410
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,630
was found in the ocean.

411
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,260
What to do!? I don't know anymore.

412
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,410
My heart hurts because she left with no happy memories.

413
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:22,230
But how can she die? The ones who cheated on her
will be living happily!

414
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,570
You have to be quiet.

415
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,900
That is Geum Ran's mother. She doesn't know anything.

416
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,760
Her son-in-law didn't even come to the 49th day memorial ceremony.

417
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,510
If she knew there was an affair, she won't be able to live.

418
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,170
Mother shouldn't know.

419
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,550
I'll go now. I have to take care of Geum Ran's mother.

420
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:53,120
♫  Like other people, I couldn't say goodbye.  ♫

421
00:40:53,120 --> 00:41:00,330
♫ Like other people, I can't turn back. ♫

422
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:12,230
♫ I won't ever believe again that you will return. ♫

423
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:23,790
♫  Even if I knew that saying goodbye will be like this.  ♫

424
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:36,100
Even though it was like that ajumma, you shouldn't have died.

425
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:40,400
It's only unfair to the person who died.

426
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,800
A psychopathic man in his 30's

427
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,200
viciously murdered the woman he had stalked for eight years. Her corpse was defiled.

428
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,470
This man has stalked woman since middle school.

429
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,070
When he couldn't suddenly contact her, he stabbed her multiple times

430
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:29,800
with a weapon he had prepared and killed her.

431
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,400
Another case of a stalking, turned kidnapping, has turned up.

432
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:46,500
On the 5th, the perpetrator attempted and failed to assault sexually a victim whom he knew.

433
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:52,050
It has been revealed that the victim was strangled to death and the body dismembered with a saw.

434
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,710
He chopped up her body and left the remains in the mountains.

435
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,670
This stalker follows his victims for a long time prior to giving them a drugged beverage.

436
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,300
He kidnaps the woman.

437
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,350
Agh, this ajumma is running again. Stop right there!

438
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,740
Ajumma! Stop right there! Ajumma!

439
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,700
Someone help me!

440
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,300
Ajumma! Stop right there!

441
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,260
Leg-sweeping!

442
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,500
Stop!

443
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,090
Arm lock!

444
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,140
My arm is going to break, you psycho!

445
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,780
Who are you to call me a psycho when you're a stalking murderer?

446
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:33,480
You're the nut for wanting to go meet yourself, you crazy lady!

447
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,950
You're Sa Geum Ran!

448
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,800
I am Sa Geum Ran?

449
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,020
That's right. You are Sa Geum Ran.

450
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,910
You didn't die. You were so unfairly wronged that you couldn't die.

451
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,680
That ocean was rumored for sharks to even fall and drown in, but you survived on your strong will.

452
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,300
You had collapsed for a few days, but when you returned, you were already considered dead.

453
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,490
Sa Geum Ran!

454
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,560
Geum Ran...

455
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,600
Poor thing. How could this be?

456
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,520
Geum Ran.

457
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,500
You went to your funeral, but you saw that your husband and in-laws didn't even shed a tear.

458
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,290
You said he was unaffected.

459
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:51,040
What are we going to do?

460
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,800
Who is it?

461
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,800
What the heck? Is this a dream?

462
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,490
You're the Change doctor, right?

463
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,960
Please make me beautiful.

464
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,700
I'm sorry, I don't think I can.

465
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,490
Why are you like this?

466
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,100
Why are you doing this to me? I can't do this on my own.

467
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:30,700
Please, Doctor. I can't ever die just like this.

468
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,440
I want revenge.

469
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,500
Please help me, Doctor. Please? Please help me, Doctor.

470
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:45,560
I understand what you want to say.

471
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,820
Please, Doctor.

472
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,500
Help me. Please.

473
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,680
Help me. Please help me, Doctor.

474

♫  A petite girl who smiles a lot  ♫

475
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,680
♫  A girl who looks better without makeup ♫

476
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,470
♫ A girl whose cheeks flush after only one sip of wine ♫

477
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:18,360
♫  A girl whose smiling eyes are pretty  ♫

478
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,000
♫ When I look at you, my heart gets excited. Oh my girl. ♫

479
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,130
♫  The kind of girl that's hard to find. ♫

480
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:32,320
♫ When you smile, I want to cuddle you, oh my girl  ♫

481
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,420
♫  Right now, it's so hard. Oh, I'm in love with you,  ♫

482
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,360
♫ It's like we fit like a puzzle. Oh, I'm in love with you, ♫

483
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,250
♫ You are my ideal type.You are so pretty. ♫

484
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,120
As expected, teardrop shaped breasts are the best shape.

485
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,500
♫ It feels like my heart's going to stop  ♫

486
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,990
♫ Oh I'm in love with you. The seasons seem to change.  ♫

487
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:01,640
That's it. A luxurious diamond shape belly button.
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you. Everything looks different ♫

488
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,490
♫ Was the sky always this pretty and blue? ♫

489
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:09,960
A little more. A little more.
♫ Even watching a sad movie a smile breaks out. ♫

490
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:18,500
You risked your life to receive cosmetic surgery
from head to toe. You even received some hair implants.

491
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,600
Even your voice was enhanced with
collagen implants to your larynx.

492
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,720
♫  Oh I'm in love with you. ♫

493
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,680
Ahjumma, right now, you're in denial.

494
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,100
You're mistakenly under the impression that you're a celebrity,

495
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,110
from excessive anesthesia!

496
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,200
It's a side effect of general anesthesia.

497
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,290
You're suffering from delirium that you're someone else. Delirium!

498
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,930
It's medication for delirium. This is what happens
when you forget your medicine.

499
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,200
I've been following you around for your medication.

500
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,030
You throw me around and change the code for the house.

501
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,880
That house is my house!

502
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,930
For now, take your medicine.

503
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,190
How can I believe you?

504
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,750
What if it's a bad medicine?

505
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,800
Didn't Sa Geum Ran ran look familiar when you saw her on TV
for the first time when you followed her 49th day memorial?

506
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,630
You think that's all due to your interfering nature?

507
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:37,760
That's because it's personal.

508
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,890
Also, you threw me around, sweeping the ankle
and locking the arm. What do you think all that is?

509
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:46,070
- What is it?
- They are judo techniques.

510
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:50,140
Sa Geum Ajumma, up to high school, was a judo athlete.

511
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:55,620
You're delirious. But, on instinct, without
knowing it yourself, your judo skills came out.

512
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,770
Wait a moment.

513
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,460
Advancing forward pull.

514
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,000
Ankle sweep.

515
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,860
Armlock.

516
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,330
That's really true.

517
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,200
Try thinking of why you're angry.

518
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,660
Make a fist and exhale. With the thumb.

519
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:39,030
The front of the collarbone is where the sadness rests.

520
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:45,900
And the shoulders hold the weight of life.

521
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,490
Doctor, dinner is served.

522
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:13,830
I was wrong.You did surgery on me,

523
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,510
and you even arranged a place for me to stay.

524
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:20,940
I touched you, Doctor.

525
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,500
Touched?

526
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:29,240
You trip me, throw me over, and almost break my arm,

527
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,280
and that's just touching?

528
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,230
You just touched me, yet my whole body is black and blue?

529
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,860
I behaved terribly.

530
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,750
I'll make sure that never happens again, Doctor.

531
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,100
Please eat.

532
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,000
It's all organic, and there is nothing with MSG.

533
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,260
Raw oysters are full of minerals and good for bruising.

534
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,330
Contract.

535
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,150
What's this, Doctor?

536
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,940
Our contract.

537
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:25,610
I am the super size party "A"!

538
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:28,740
You are a nano minuscule sized party "B".

539
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,480
It's filled with unimaginable conditions.

540
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,360
It's a total of 50 pages and 99 clauses.

541
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:39,330
To summarize this contract into one word,
it means that

542
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:45,070
whatever I order you, you will do it.

543
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:50,590
After suffering such a ridiculous situation,
I feel a contract is necessary.

544
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,850
What are you doing? Read it.

545
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:00,720
Why? You don't want to stamp it?!

546
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,560
No.

547
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,520
Sara/Sa Geum Ran.

548
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,370
I won't ever go against you again.

549
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,000
Ajumma, tell me.

550
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,400
How do you plan on getting revenge on your husband?

551
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,100
You must have a plan.

552
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,540
As you know, I'm pretty.

553
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:53,470
Why would I need a plan when I'm this pretty?

554
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,500
It's me.

555
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,520
Where are you? Home?

556
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,290
I'm going to you.

557
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:14,960
It hasn't been long since we saw each other at the airport.

558
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,930
We're going into the recording of
'Last Corner' now, so it'll end soon.

559
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:21,620
I'll be there in thirty minutes.

560
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,140
Lee Kang Joon

561
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:40,890
The real reasons for K.J. Lee newspaper deals

562
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,730
This is the news that was on the Internet.

563
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:53,330
Announcer Gyo Chae Yeon's

564
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:56,040
chic airport fashion,

565
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,840
a trip overseas with a mysterious man?

566
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,650
The more important thing than the fact
that they went on an oversea vacation

567
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,080
is the date.

568
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,850
November 11, 2014.

569
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,460
It's today.

570
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,940
Today was my 49th memorial day.

571
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,490
Then that means those two just came back.

572
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:23,340
He said that he doesn't have any interest in his dead, fatty wife.

573
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,090
Here.

574
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:38,230
[Lee Kang Joon's thought process]

575
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:40,890
From Lee Kang Joon's information that
I found from a big database, and

576
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:43,280
the personal information that I gathered from you,

577
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,240
plus the cultural psychological statistics,
I analyzed his brain.

578
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,550
Look carefully. Here.

579
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,770
I will succeed.

580
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,350
"I will succeed" takes up this much.

581
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:00,080
Fifty percent. Fifty percent!

582
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:04,780
The thought of being the representative of HBS. Here.

583
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,520
Ten percent. Ten percent.

584
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,630
And I...

585
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,180
[I like Gyo Chae Yeon]

586
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,660
I like Gyo Chae Yeon.

587
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,310
Thirty percent.

588
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,980
And I want to be good to my parents.

589
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,020
This small part. This terrible bastard.

590
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,790
One percent.

591
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:40,050
And thoughts of the dead chubby previous
wife, Sa Geum Ran. Here.

592
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,780
Do you see that unclear, round dot?

593
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:47,780
You see this small dot, right?

594
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,510
This is

595
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:53,530
0.1%.

596
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,590
0.1%?

597
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:05,090
And there is an another dot that is slightly bigger.

598
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:10,790
Here it is 0.2%. It's 0.2%.

599
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:15,570
This was the thought for a fly that flew around
Lee Kang Joon's room last night.

600
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,980
So,

601
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:23,710
to Lee Kang Joon, you are worth less than a fly.

602
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:38,450
To Lee Kang Joon who has other thoughts,
if you just push your pretty body at him,

603
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,880
do you think your revenge will succeed?

604
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:48,300
What do I have to do, Doctor? Help me.

605
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,750
Ah, jeez. That's right.

606
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:57,690
To an ordinary woman, you need a genius like me.

607
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:00,860
That's good. Since you are my work,

608
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,620
I'll help you as follow-up care service.

609
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,950
To get revenge, Ajumma,

610
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,930
you need to become a completely new person.

611
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:15,820
Although your appearance has changed,
your internal self is still you.

612
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:20,000
You have to change from within your bones.

613
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,570
You have to make your husband completely fall for you.
That way you can destroy him.

614
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,550
Throw away Sa Geum Ran.

615
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,460
Can you become a completely new person?

616
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:59,240
You worked hard.

617
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:04,090
Kang Joon.

618
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,400
I didn't know you would come all the way to the studio.

619
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,610
There is a picture floating around on the Internet.

620
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:16,620
It's before you are inaugurated as the director.
Will it be okay?

621
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,460
Congratulations.

622
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:22,410
It's your first time being a main MC.

623
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,570
Isn't that Director Lee Kang Joon?

624
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:30,010
What's this? Are those two together?

625
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:33,280
It's really shocking.

626
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,710
It's time to reveal our relationship.

627
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,840
I will take you in a limousine next time.

628
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,620
The thought of your dead wife is 0.1%.

629
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:22,830
To you, I am only that much, huh?

630
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,510
But Honey, everything will become different.

631
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,780
I will make it that way.

632
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:11,020
The clothes that I wore when I was fat,

633
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,840
I'm saying my goodbye to Sa Geum Ran.

634
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:21,610
To my bones, I'm going to become a new person.

635
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,320
We have Korea's best beauty

636
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,580
and a genius together.

637
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,290
Revenge?

638
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:33,230
Don't worry.

639
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,360
We can do it!

640
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,620
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you, it's like we fit like a puzzle. ♫

641
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:56,050
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you, you're my ideal type. ♫

642
01:02:56,050 --> 01:03:00,320
♫  I like that you are so beautiful; no because it's so easy, I like it more.  ♫

643
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,910
Birth of a Beauty
~Preview~

644
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:03,250
Strong skinship

645
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,820
You have to seduce Lee Kang Joon

646
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:08,240
He threw away his wife. Start a scandal.

647
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,290
Plastic surgery, after care, diet, exercise,
and my delirium. Why are you helping me?

648
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:13,770
Gyo Chae Yeon is your reason, right?

649
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:15,980
Your husband and Chae Yeon cannot marry.

650
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:18,100
We are getting married in three weeks.

651
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,420
I'm going to stop them from marrying.

652
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,200
There are three weeks until their wedding.

653
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,240
Life or death. Think like General Lee Soon Shin.

654
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,410
There's no way we can't do it.

655
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:28,340
You're Sara, right? Pleased to meet you.

656
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:32,340
- I'm Lee Kang Joon.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Sara.
