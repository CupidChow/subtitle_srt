1
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,500
♫  A petite woman who smiles often ♫

2
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,700
♫  The face that is prettier with no makeup  ♫
Han Tae Hee burned off 1003 calories

3
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,300
♫  A woman who gets flushed with one drink  ♫

4
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,100
The employees at The God of Restaurants keep calling.

5
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,600
They are asking why you are not coming on the opening day.

6
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,300
But why are you exercising?

7
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,300
♫  When you smile, I want to hug you  ♫

8
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,200
Two hours?

9
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Are you okay?

10
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
Don't worry.

11
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,900
This woman is fake.

12
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,000
Get a grip.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,500
Doctor!

14
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Then you should run after eating some protein powder.

15
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,600
She looks pretty again! Don't smile, you fox.

16
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,500
You are pale.

17
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,100
A witch that bewitched a genius.

18
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,000
I will wipe off your sweat.

19
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,900
Just go. Just go!

20
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,200
Just go home!

21
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,500
Yes, I will, Doctor.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,500
Fighting!

23
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,200
She is fake. She is a fox.

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,300
Here.

25
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,700
Here, let's run.

26
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,200
I am going to ignore her. I will just come in when she's asleep and leave before she wakes up.

27
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,200
I won't mix words with her unless it's about sending Lee Kang Joon to jail.

28
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,600
What are you doing right now? It's after 11 o'clock! How can you eat this?

29
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,100
Ahjumma, you don't even exercise. You are going to get fat!

30
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,900
Are you eating after taking the diet supplement?

31
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
My husband became like that,

32
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,500
so there is no one that I have to look good for.

33
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,730
I just have to plan revenge on him, so it's okay if I get fat.

34
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,400
Ahjumma, don't you know what kind of body this is? I designed it myself, from head to toe!

35
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,100
Eyes, nose, lips, butt, waist, back, bellybutton... My effort went into every part of you!

36
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm sorry,

37
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,800
but it's not your business anymore.

38
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,500
Ahjumma, do you not feel love for yourself?

39
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,000
You can just meet another man and live happily!

40
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,600
Just think of her as a fat pig and ignore her.

41
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,800
She is living her own life.

42
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
She is living her own life.

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Okay,

44
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,300
I will just take care of her one more time,

45
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,600
and I will ignore her from then on.

46
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

47
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,900
Ahjumma,

48
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,000
I will ask you one thing.

49
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,300
Like you said, let's say that all you have left is revenge.

50
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,500
Since you are going to do revenge anyway, do you want to do it like a loser?

51
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't you want to be a legend in the world of revenge?

52
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,160
Legend?

53
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,500
The best in the world of revenge. The Count of Monte-Cristo said,

54
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,400
"Do revenge like a mirror." He is saying that you should do it the same way.

55
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,400
Don't make him get a divorce normally.

56
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,900
His wife, who was killed, becomes an attractive mistress.

57
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,400
And splits the couple.

58
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,500
How about this?

59
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's pay him back using the same method.

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,700
Isn't it chic?

61
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,200
If you succeed in this, you will be the legend in the world of revenge.

62
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,700
You will become Korea's "Countess of Monte-Cristo."

63
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,700
I will tell you how you can do that.

64
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,300
Doctor,

65
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,500
give me some diet supplements.

66
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,100
Supplements?

67
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Doctor. I will exercise and then sleep, so sleep first.

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
Okay.

69
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,300
Twenty-eight!
♬Even without trying to look into the mirror at myself ♬

70
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,400
Twenty-nine!
♬ I can't believe it. I 'm like the heroine of a manwa. My image ♬

71
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Thirty!
♬  is so dazzling I can't recognize myself. ♬

72
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,400
Thirty-one!

73
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,500
That ahjumma is just a tool to get to Chae Yeon.
♬  Without being explainable, ♬

74
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,200
Why do you keep getting emotionally involved with her?

75
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,900
- This is irrational behavior that is not suitable for a genius.
- Thirty-three.

76
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,800
♫  Oh, new world,  ♫

77
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Thirty-four!
♫  Oh, new world,  ♫

78
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,300
Thirty-five!

79
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:49,600
♬ The dark sad memories are now all being erased. ♬

80
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,200
♫  Oh, new world,  ♫

81
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,100
Before the problem gets severe,

82
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,400
we need to determine my psychological condition.

83
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,630
I have to find out why I'm like this to fix it.

84
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,200
His wife, who was killed, becomes an attractive mistress

85
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,700
and splits them up.

86
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,600
Madam called you again.

87
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,000
What should I do?

88
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,700
Tell her that I can't go home.

89
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,800
He's going to work overtime again? Can he not answer his phone?

90
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,200
I'm sorry, Madam.

91
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,700
Hey, is Kang Joon not able to come home today?

92
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,980
This is the fourth day.

93
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,900
We do nothing in our house,

94
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,300
but our Kang Joon is the only one suffering.

95
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,200
That's why being a woman is nice.

96
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,000
Isn't that right, Chae Yeon?

97
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
I'm going to rest, Mother.

98
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,900
What is this?

99
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,400
It's like she telling us that she has a temper.

100
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,300
That's right!

101
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,900
Wow...

102
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,600
Winner Group HBS
HBS.

103
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,200
The place where my husband cheated with Gyo Chae Yeon.

104
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,100
It's the place that he cheated on me.

105
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,200
♫ Hey, hey, hey.

106
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,400
♫ What's wrong with my age?

107
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,600
♫ Is there an age to love?

108
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,300
♫ My heart is one,

109
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,500
♫ and there is only one feeling.

110
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,800
♫ You are my only love.

111
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,100
You are my only love.

112
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,400
Fighting!

113
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,200
I'll personally escort you. Hey!

114
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,900
She's so pretty!

115
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,300
I'll lead you this way.

116
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,900
Hey! I told you that I'm going to lead her!

117
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,600
Really...

118
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,900
Thank you. Is that end room where CEO Lee Kang Joon sleeps?

119
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Oh, it's the CEO!

120
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,120
Are you crazy? Why did you come here?

121
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
Have you been well all this time?

122
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,400
Let's talk.

123
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,600
Okay. Let's go to your office.

124
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,800
I brought the vaccine to fix the computers that are down.

125
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,400
Vaccine?

126
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,100
Where did you get this?

127
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,000
At the restaurant where I work, there is a customer who is a pro at computers.

128
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,700
Lee Kang Joon will not be able to get the vaccine for the virus.

129
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,900
I, who spread the virus, am the only one who has it.

130
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:51,600
So, I will give you the vaccine, and you go save that man. You have to be the princess mermaid.

131
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,400
Let's treat the virus together, Kang Joon.

132
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,700
Agassi, wake up!

133
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,900
Can you clean up!

134
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,500
These kids are working hard with Sara, at her restaurant.

135
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,600
Let them be. Can you get me a cup of celery juice?

136
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,100
Celery juice?

137
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,900
Yeah. Why?

138
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,500
Okay.

139
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,000
Chae Yeon, while you're in the kitchen, do the dishes.

140
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,300
And, your father-in-law will come here around five thirty. Prepare for dinner.

141
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,800
I want to see your cooking ability.

142
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,400
Don't just do plain rice, do something like mixed-grain rice.

143
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,300
Make those kinds of things.

144
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,800
You didn't go to your house for a few days.

145
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,100
I wanted you to have a homemade meal.

146
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,400
I brought you a shirt.

147
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,300
Sara...

148
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,500
Why are you like this?

149
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,600
Kang Joon, I want to see you again.

150
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,700
Are you kidding?

151
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,800
The problems between a man and a woman fluctuate.

152
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,600
Kang Joon, have you ever had that experience?

153
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,300
Kang Joon, I want to be your woman.

154
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm a married man.

155
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,700
I know that already,

156
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,100
but I want to see you again.

157
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
You and Gyo Chae Yeon...

158
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
probably talked like this.

159
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,100
So, it's okay if you are my hidden woman?

160
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,900
If you asked,

161
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
Because I love you.

162
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,900
Gyo Chae Yeon would have answered like this.

163
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,600
You guys just married.

164
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,100
You are already leaning.

165
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,600
People like you probably called this love.

166
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,000
You people have no conscience or guilt.

167
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,700
I love you.

168
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,300
I will wait for you, so come look for me anytime.

169
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,400
I will pay you back in the same way,

170
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,700
so that you guys can feel the pain that I felt.

171
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,000
Open your mouth.

172
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,900
Hurry and eat.

173
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,600
Kang Joon... I'm here to see you.

174
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Did your phone battery die or something?

175
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,400
Why are you here?

176
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,800
What are you?

177
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,000
How dare you come here?

178
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,600
I brought the vaccine to cure the virus,

179
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,300
because Kang Joon needs it.

180
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,700
Of course, it's an excuse.

181
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,900
I really came here because I wanted to see him.

182
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,800
You are still like this, just because you guys had a thing before the wedding?

183
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,300
He is a married man now.

184
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,600
Does that matter to either of us?

185
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,100
You also seduced Kang Joon when he was a married man.

186
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,500
There was an article on the Change website.

187
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,600
Somebody wrote that Kang Joon cheated on his wife with you.

188
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,400
You can do it, so why can't I?

189
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,500
Please leave my husband.

190
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Please finish things with him. You are young and pretty.

191
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,600
It doesn't have to be my husband for you.

192
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,900
But I can't do without my husband.

193
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,130
To me, he is my first and last love...

194
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,400
and everything in my life.

195
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,100
I begged you last time,

196
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,300
but this time, it's your turn.

197
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,800
It doesn't matter what we did. What right do you have?

198
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,800
What is your meaning behind this? What are you going to do?

199
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,000
I am going to make you two get a divorce.

200
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,200
In three weeks.

201
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,000
Just like you chased away his first wife,

202
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I will chase you out this time.

203
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,300
From finding out my husband was cheating on me with you,

204
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,700
until I died, was only three weeks.

205
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,000
So, you guys will last three weeks.

206
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,900
A tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye.

207
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:06,100
I'm more suitable for Kang Joon than you.

208
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,700
Then.

209
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,220
Wait.

210
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,810
So you are going to avenge Sa Geum Ran?

211
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,600
What relationship do you have with Sa Geum Ran?

212
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,500
You see, I have an information source that is rather wide.

213
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,400
I accidentally found out about Sa Geum Ran's story.

214
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,500
I was angry.

215
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,900
I applied as a member of The First Wive's Alliance

216
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,600
and came like this.

217
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,900
Of course, the biggest reason is that I like Kang Joon.

218
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,700
Are you playing with me right now?

219
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Oh my... Does it seem like that?

220
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,600
Yes. You saw correctly.

221
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,400
Then, can I leave now?

222
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
Stop right there!

223
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,100
I'm sorry. I'm a bit strong.

224
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,400
It's a lie detector.

225
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,200
So, let's analyze your state of mind.

226
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,300
Okay, gather up some documents about analyzing my state of mind,

227
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,200
so I can decipher my emotions.

228
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,500
Hyung, here. Look here...

229
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,000
Hyung, I'm a doctor who is a liposuction specialist, not the FBI.

230
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I told you there's a first time for everyone!

231
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,700
Then what is it that you want to analyze? What is your state of mind right now?

232
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,200
Lately I'm showing a different response than usual to a strange life form.

233
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,700
I need to find the reason why.

234
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:40,600
Starting now, I'm going to explain to you about this strange life form, and you can check my body's responses to it.

235
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,200
Hyung, you found a woman, didn't you?

236
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,100
I said that's not true! Woman, what woman...

237
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,200
"A J M." Why is it just the initials? Are you keeping a secret from me?

238
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,700
It couldn't possibly be... Ahjumma, could it?

239
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,600
What do you mean, Ahjumma? Are you crazy?

240
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,600
How would I know someone like Ahjumma? My goodness!

241
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,400
How would I know the initials of Ahjumma. You're funny...

242
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,200
-Hello.
-Doctor, where are you?

243
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,100
Doctor. I was on fire today!
 Let's meet right now.

244
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,400
"I was on fire today. Let's meet today?"

245
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,600
But it seems like you found a woman, Hyung.

246
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
I told you that I haven't!

247
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,100
G-go there first, okay?

248
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,900
I'm busy right now! Don't bother me, okay?

249
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,500
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

250
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,200
What are you doing? Can't we meet right now?

251
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,800
Don't bother me, okay? I-I'll call you later,

252
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
so go home and wait. Got it?

253
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,700
Go home! Just go home!

254
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,800
LIE

255
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,100
Oh, hold on a moment. There!

256
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,000
- Take it off!
- Ouch!

257
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,100
Elder... Dong-Gool is dead.

258
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,700
Are you really going to find someone who looks like him?

259
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,200
You can't leave the company to that person, can you?

260
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,100
But, I can find time...

261
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,500
In the meantime, I need to lower Min Hyeok's shares.

262
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:00,500
Even if Min-Hyuk becomes the CEO, it is impossible for him to own more than 50% of the company. He's just a puppet.

263
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,900
The cultural foundation that you oversee is the largest shareholder, isn't it?

264
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,900
What's making you feel uneasy?

265
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,090
Secretary Son...

266
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,600
got my son drunk and slept with him, then got pregnant with Min Hyeok.

267
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:25,200
Due to an accident, I lost all my children and was compelled to bring the two of them into my house.

268
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,800
Evil blood doesn't go away.

269
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Since one never knows, I have nurtured Secretary Son and Min Hyeok thus far.

270
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,200
I don't have the greatest feeling about this. I'm just picking the safest route.

271
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,700
Why are you avoiding it? We were in the middle of talking about that woman, Sara.

272
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,500
She teased me by mentioning the First Wives' Alliance and such.

273
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,700
She even shoved me!

274
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,100
Then, how can I just stop?

275
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,500
Apart from receiving the vaccine, nothing else happened.

276
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,300
Just stop it, it's exhausting.

277
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,700
If you feel exhausted, how do you think I feel?

278
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,600
I'm going to get some air.

279
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,300
Kang Joon!

280
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,100
To get some air?

281
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,700
Oh, Doctor!

282
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,900
There's hot and spicy chicken in the kitchen. Go eat some.

283
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,470
I am going to play the role of an attractive woman.

284
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,600
Since my husband went to get some air, I'm going to go run into him.

285
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,400
When I get back, I'll tell you all the details.

286
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Hyung, you found a woman, didn't you?

287
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,500
No.

288
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,300
No, this is a dream, a terrible nightmare!

289
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,800
Oh, Ji Hoon, immediately cease the psychological assessment report.

290
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,900
There's no time to waste! Okay.

291
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,900
Excuse me...

292
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,900
Sara?

293
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,200
My goodness, Kang Joon!

294
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,000
It's cold outside. Why did you come out?

295
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,900
Aren't you, yourself, cold?

296
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,700
I'm okay. Actually, I'm not cold at all.

297
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,600
He'll probably say something to do with coincidence or fate, won't he?

298
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,100
When coincidences are repeated, they become fate.

299
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,900
When fate gets deeper, its considered to be destiny.

300
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,100
Before, the food you brought me earlier was just how I like it.

301
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,000
This isn't coincidence, or fate.

302
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,700
This is just the pain and suffering others suffer in the name of adultery.

303
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,700
He, the murderer and adulterer, dares to talk about coincidence and fate?

304
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,890
Wow... you don't understand how disgusted I felt.

305
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,400
Until I know my feelings towards this ahjumma, my only concern is revenge.

306
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,500
But, what was really the highlight of my day was Gyo Chae Yeon.

307
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,000
I completely crushed her.

308
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,000
Ahjumma.

309
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,100
This time we need to go immediately to the next stage, without even stopping to take a breath!

310
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,500
Right.

311
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,800
After the virus comes.

312
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,700
The psychological test.

313
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,600
First we crushed him with the virus, and now were going straight at him psychologically.

314
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,100
While this revenge goes on, we're going to have to step it up a notch.

315
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,500
Were going to have to make a scene at Lee Kang Joon's public event.

316
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,800
Even hearing about it thrills me.

317
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,600
There's a saying that, when playing Go-Stop, you must eat both double cards and triple at the same time.

318
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,100
That's where all the points come from.

319
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,500
But... Doctor?

320
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,900
Why won't you look at me?

321
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,900
Me?

322
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,500
Me? Did I do that?

323
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
No I didn't.

324
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I'm looking at you right now.

325
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,600
I'm the same as usual, aren't I?

326
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,300
Really?

327
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,300
My pupils are getting bigger.

328
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,600
This is the feeling a male dog has towards a female dog.

329
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,200
I'll help you by seeing what they're up to.

330
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,600
Its the commemorative publication party of someone high up in the company.

331
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,300
(Seating chart)

332
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,300
Concentrate... Concentrate!

333
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,000
Just concentrate on Lee Kang Joon's revenge.

334
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,900
That's good. Let's do that.

335
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,900
Are you going out to protest again?

336
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,900
You are always chased away from HBS.

337
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,800
This time, I'm going to go to the government agency.

338
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,300
I need to know how Geum Ran died.

339
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
This is a number that I don't know.

340
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,000
Yes, hello? Who is this?

341
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,100
This is the woman that rescued us at the wedding.

342
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,000
That pretty lady?

343
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,900
Mom...

344
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,600
Why are you like that?

345
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,500
What is it that you do?

346
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,200
She is a person that saved us.

347
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,400
I remember where I saw you before!

348
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,520
You came on the 49th day after Geum Ran died, right?

349
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,820
Yes.

350
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,900
I have something to show you.

351
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,500
There are two things that we have to do at the publication party.

352
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,600
We have to make a mess with this picture.

353
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,600
Oh my...

354
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,500
This is Son-in-law Lee and you, right?

355
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,900
What are you?

356
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,380
Yes, it's me.

357
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,300
Look at the date.

358
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,580
It is exactly two weeks before he married Gyo Chae Yeon.

359
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,300
I was deceived by that man as well.

360
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,100
Your combination order is done!

361
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,800
Lee Kang Joon, this rascal, is an a**hole!

362
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm going to make you two divorce.

363
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,100
I'm more suitable for Kang Joon than you.

364
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,100
Chae Yeon!

365
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,200
Chae Yeon...

366
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,900
You said that you were with Sara at the park! Min Yeong said that she saw you!

367
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,300
With you acting like this, do I have to go to the party?

368
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,600
I just met her by coincidence.

369
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,100
I just greeted her!

370
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,300
Why does this remind me of when we dated?

371
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,500
When we lied to your wife and dated.

372
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,200
It seems like I am in Sa Geum Ran's position now.

373
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,800
What is this disgusting feeling?

374
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,700
You are overreacting.

375
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,600
I can't go to the party.

376
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,000
Okay. Even if I meet her by coincidence, I will pretend not to know her.

377
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,600
I will make sure that doesn't happen again.

378
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,800
You know how important General Manager Han Min Hyeok is.

379
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,100
We have to go to the party.

380
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,600
You look perfect.

381
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,000
You look like Winner Group's madam.

382
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,700
The reporters are very interested.

383
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,600
Since this event is the same as an announcement of the new CEO/Director of Winner Group.

384
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,900
Min Hyeok and I always hid and lived like criminals.

385
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:41,000
That I'm stepping forward for the first time today means that I'm driving the stake in.

386
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,600
Congratulations!

387
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,500
They are all coming. Then...

388
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,600
Madam! Congratulations!

389
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,800
You look beautiful!

390
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,000
General Manger Han Min Hyeok's first official appearance.

391
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,690
I'm all happy and excited!

392
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,900
Our Kang Joon thinks of your son as a real brother,

393
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,800
so he seems like my son as well.

394
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,300
Son?

395
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Congratulations, Madam.

396
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,100
Here,

397
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,200
this is

398
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,200
small, but

399
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,200
please look after my son, Lee Kang Joon.

400
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Yes, come in.

401
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,300
Mother!

402
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,700
You look beautiful!

403
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,700
I've waited for today for a long time, Min Hyeok!

404
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,300
Are you happy?

405
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,300
I can't express it with words.

406
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,800
The bloodline of Winner Group is you alone.

407
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,900
The elder will never be able to do anything to you.

408
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,700
Where is Secretary Son?

409
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,200
She went to Manager Han Min Hyeok's ceremonial opening party.

410
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,600
Ceremonial opening?

411
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,700
There is one that I don't know about?

412
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:53,100
Business Survival Strategies to Victory, Commemorative Publication Party for Winner Group's Han Min Hyeok

413
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,700
Business Survival Strategies to Victory

414
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,700
Business Survival Strategies to Victory

415
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I will lead you this way.

416
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,800
I've ensured their safe positioning. Over.

417
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,100
Confirmed. Over.

418
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,900
Lee Kang Joon...

419
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,500
You will experience the worst day of your life.

420
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,900
A bomb will explode over here,

421
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,200
and there will be a nuclear explosion at your office.

422
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,900
Aigoo, hello!

423
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,200
It's been a while, Director Park!

424
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,290
Congratulations on your promotion.

425
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,300
This is my wife.

426
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,000
It's my first time seeing you. I'm Gyo Chae Yeon.

427
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,900
You are the figurehead model for Winner Group.

428
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,500
I've seen you everyday through the commercial. It's an honor to meet you in person.

429
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,590
Thank you.

430
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,800
Okay, smile all you want.

431
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,700
The creative warhead missile is flying over here right now.

432
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,600
Kang Joon, I have to use the restroom.

433
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,500
Son-in-law Lee! Where is Son-in-law Lee!

434
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,100
Lee Kang Joon, where is this cheating rascal?

435
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,400
Escort the two of them safely.

436
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,500
Okay, I got it.

437
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,600
Oh my! He's over there!

438
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,300
Son-in-law Lee! How can you do this?

439
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,900
Even the fact that you married after Geum Ran died is unbelievable, but

440
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,800
you have an another woman?

441
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,800
Wow, you could be in the Guinness Book of World Records for cheating.

442
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,000
Let's talk outside.

443
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,400
Look at this picture and talk.

444
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,400
It's two weeks before the wedding.

445
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,790
You're so busy kissing people here and there that your mouth will probably catch fire.

446
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,390
You cheating habitual offender!

447
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:44,100
You already cheated once, but one more time? Is this your second time?

448
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,000
Are you even human after doing this?

449
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,900
Even if you were born as a seal, you would have had stones thrown at you.

450
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,700
Watch your mouth.

451
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,400
They are lying. This is fabricated.

452
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,900
Send these people out.

453
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,100
Okay.

454
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,700
Mother, are you ready?

455
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,300
Ahjumma!

456
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,900
Shoot!

457
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,400
Lee Kang Joon is totally beside himself.

458
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,510
I got it. Lee Kang Joon's enemy is General Manager Han Min Hyeok.

459
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,100
He is Han Min Hyeok, the General Manager. He will become the CEO of Winner Group.

460
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:18,260
Now, you won't even ask for my permission! Is that it?

461
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,610
You bastard!

462
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,740
These fools!

463
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:37,640
We should go.

464
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:48,260
What's with you?

465
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,130
I'm sorry.

466
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,710
Leave!

467
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,400
You even kissed Sara?

468
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,180
How far did the two of you go?

469
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,090
Right now, that's not what's important!

470
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,480
I'm going to go to Chae Yeon...

471
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,900
Ahjumma, you go and drop the bomb on Lee Kang Joon.

472
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,360
Okay!

473
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:51,900
Oh? I should be feeling more pain for this to be normal.

474
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,760
It hardly hurts.

475
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,860
Honey! Hello!

476
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:38,450
Honey, what do you think of this dress?

477
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,340
Ta-da!

478
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,990
Honey! Hello!

479
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,710
Honey, what do you think of this dress?

480
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,490
Ta-da!

481
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,210
Honey! Hello!

482
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:56,350
Honey! Honey, what do you think of this dress? Hello! Ta-da!

483
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,280
Honey! Honey, what do you think of this dress? Hello! Ta-da!

484
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,640
- Honey! Honey, what do you think of this dress? Hello! Ta-da! 
- Ahhhhhh!

485
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,040
- Honey! Honey, what do you think of this dress? Hello! Ta-da! 
- Ahhh!

486
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,910
CEO Lee Kang Joon left his office just a little while ago!

487
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,310
Aish!

488
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,610
- Security team?
- Huh?

489
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,020
Yes.

490
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:29,320
You weren't dressed like this the last time I saw you.

491
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:35,590
I have another job, as well.

492
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,610
I am a chef!

493
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:46,200
What if I get caught? Where did the Doctor go?

494
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,740
You're beautiful.

495
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,520
Thank you!

496
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,380
Han Min Hyeok?

497
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,810
Goodbye!

498
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,470
Doctor!

499
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:26,550
We will prepare for the commemorative publication party to start again in one hour.

500
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,950
Do we have many women on our security team?

501
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,360
No, there aren't many.

502
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,970
I'll be able to find her quickly.

503
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:41,690
There someone I need to find. Please bring me a list of all the female employees on the security team.

504
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,690
Yes, I understand.

505
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,200
Leaking the photos?!

506
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,750
Oh my... Does that mean that the scene-making in-law ahjumma finally found out about the affair?

507
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:06,850
They said that she caused a ruckus, calling him a seal and a repeating cheater.

508
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:09,280
They said that the whole commemorative publication party was ruined.

509
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,070
Oh my! Jackpot!

510
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:15,890
Hey! What if Dad finds out? He doesn't know yet that Kang Joon committed adultery?

511
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:17,080
What did you say?

512
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,780
Adultery? Kang Joon?

513
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:27,650
This bloody household.

514
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:34,670
♫ This is the perfect age to love.

515
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,500
Did Kang Joon commit adultery? Did he?

516
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,460
Is that why Geum Ran killed herself?

517
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,390
If he did, then he'll be punished by the heavens!

518
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,480
H-honey, the th-th-thing is...

519
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,070
Did you know about it? I'm asking you if you knew about it!

520
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,680
Chae Yeon is Min Yeong's friend.

521
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,940
They knew about it first!

522
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,100
Mom! Dad, I didn't do anything wrong!

523
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,820
Unni's the one who convinced me that having Chae Yeon as a sister-in-law would be beneficial to us!

524
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,790
Hey! Mom said those things!

525
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,530
Oh my! When did I say that?

526
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:11,690
You wretched things! You guys were the ones who killed Geum Ran!

527
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,260
Dad! Oh, we were wrong!

528
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,330
Sister-In-Law! Save me!

529
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:22,220
YOU! Because of your affair, I'm going to be...

530
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,510
Please!!!

531
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:29,030
Chae Yeon, were you meeting Kang Joon while he was still with Geum Ran? Were you?

532
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,010
Either way, it's all in the past!

533
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,680
The real problem is the present. Right now

534
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,890
Kang Joon's mother-in-law stormed into his office building!

535
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,070
Ch-Ch-Chae Yeon...

536
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:49,880
His mother-in-law went looking for him and said something about getting water thrown on her!

537
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,000
So, they came to the company bearing a grudge and threatened us.

538
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,340
Kang-Joon and I... are serious right now.

539
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,690
So, Geum Ran's mother stopped by...

540
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:04,630
and had water thrown on her!?

541
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,480
Her daughter had an adulterous husband which drove her to commit suicide,

542
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,860
and you threw water on her!?

543
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,020
Honey, let me... let me explain!

544
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,680
Let me explain! You see, what happened is...

545
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,680
THIS HOUSEHOLD!

546
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,880
THIS HOUSEHOLD!

547
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,980
I've come home.

548
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,620
Why isn't anyone home?

549
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,450
Mother-in-law and your two sisters ran away.

550
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:24,260
Father went to catch them.

551
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,800
What?

552
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,810
What's the matter now?

553
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,700
I'm asking you what's the matter!!

554
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,950
Do you have the right

555
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,830
to raise your voice at me?

556
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,130
Stop with the nonsense.

557
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,700
Do you have any idea what it's like for me at work?!

558
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,690
This is all

559
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,730
because of you.

560
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,670
Aigoo, how many times has he been slapped in total?

561
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:29,250
That Lee Kang Joon's mug is rightfully being beaten.

562
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,720
What do you think, Ahjumma?

563
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,550
A murdered ex-wife becomes a charming adulteress and turns her in-law's home into a chaotic mess!

564
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:36,840
It's thrilling!

565
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,340
Should I tell you about something even more exciting?

566
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,060
What is it?

567
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,640
Right now, in that house, everyone has left except for Chae Yeon.

568
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,480
What do you think will happen next?

569
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:53,070
I'm not sure.

570
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:57,830
He's going to come looking for you with his own two feet.

571
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,120
How do you feel?

572
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,700
I'm getting excited.

573
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,520
Look at that, Ahjumma!

574
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:11,350
Even though you're not happy and don't have a man, a different kind of happiness like this exists!

575
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:15,910
So, what I'm saying is that you can't just eat, lay around, and give up on life! Got it?!

576
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:28,610
Doctor,

577
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:30,360
thank you.

578
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,330
Sincerely.

579
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:36,440
I'll make sure to repay the debt I owe you.

580
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:47,330
Then, I'll clean the house. I'm also going to have to lock your room door ahead of time.

581
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:53,860
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you, you're my ideal type

582
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:58,650
♫ I like you because you're so pretty, no, I also like you because you're comfortable ♫

583
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:02,130
♫ My heart feels like it will stop♫

584
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:06,500
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you, it feels as if the seasons have changed♫

585
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,740
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you, everything looks different♫
Yeah, Ji Hoon.

586
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:15,040
Did the psychological assessment report come out? Did it?!

587
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:21,690
♫ Although I watch a sad movie, I smile ♫

588
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,110
Oh, mommy.

589
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,160
What are we going to do about this?

590
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,400
Your dad doesn't seem to let this one slide easily.

591
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,700
Now that Geum Ran is dead and gone, there is no one who can take care of this matter!

592
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,330
Aigoo, and also, how could Chae Yeon, that wench, bring up that matter in front of him?!

593
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:40,920
That's what I'm saying.

594
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,330
Hey!

595
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,470
Honey!

596
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:49,470
Where have they all gone?

597
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:56,910
- HEY!
- Omo!

598
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,220
Come on out.

599
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,610
Come out while I'm asking you nicely!

600
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,580
I told you to come out!!

601
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:09,060
What shall we do?

602
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,240
Mom, I'm scared to death!

603
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,780
This is unbelievable! This horror is really scary.

604
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:18,220
If we stay here, we'll get caught by Dad. Let's quickly go when he's calling us out.

605
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,550
Where are you going? There's nowhere to go!

606
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,660
At this rate, we're going to freeze to death!

607
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,470
Look at this. It's going to kill me.

608
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,070
Omo, girls. I just thought of a place where we can go.

609
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:34,280
Who is it?

610
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,510
Kang Joon.

611
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,110
Sara.

612
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:53,670
I remembered your words which told me to come over whenever I was going through a tough time.

613
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,030
Please come in.

614
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:32,100
Kang Joon, welcome.

615
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,560
What happened?

616
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,600
We also got chased out of the house.

617
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,150
Do we have a place to go, except for Sara's?

618
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,720
It's alright.

619
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,180
Only you can know the results of the Psychological Assessment.

620
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,310

love

631
