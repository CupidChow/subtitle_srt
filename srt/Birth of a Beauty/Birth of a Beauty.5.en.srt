00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,160
Episode 5

2
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,460
Geum Ran.

3
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,870
How cold is the ocean water?

4
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,000
My precious daughter.

5
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,020
Announcer Gyo Chae Yeon,

6
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,360
marries the CEO of HBS, Lee Kang Joon.

7
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,510
Son-in-law Lee is remarrying today?

8
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,060
You came! You are so pretty!

9
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,250
Aiyoo, how pretty.

10
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,150
Gyeong Joo, my goodness. What is this?

11
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:01,070
Why, Mother, what is it? Is it about Geum Ran's suicide?

12
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,280
I got a text!

13
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,390
Son-in-law Lee is remarrying today with an announcer named Gyo Chae Yeon!

14
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,450
The wedding date hasn't approached yet. It's supposed to be next week.

15
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,730
You already knew!

16
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,180
It's been three months since Geum Ran died. Her ancestral tablet (memorial in shrine) is still brand new, and he's remarrying?!

17
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,720
Did Son-in-law Lee forget that his wife died?

18
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,300
How can he remarry so quickly?

19
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,080
Did he already have a woman?

20
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,390
Oh my...

21
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,920
He was cheating on Geum Ran with a woman, right?

22
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,050
That is her!

23
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,090
I didn't tell you because you would get hurt.

24
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,720
Did Geum Ran know?

25
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,320
She did?

26
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,040
My daughter... that poor thing.

27
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,120
How hard must it have been for her?

28
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,770
How painful must it have been?

29
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,630
Geum Ran...

30
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,880
My daughter... What am I going to do with my poor daughter?

31
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,850
Mother...

32
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,130
It's done!

33
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,950
How lonely you must have been after your parents passed away.

34
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,540
But now, since we finished the wedding, you have new parents. Isn't that right, Chae Yeon?

35
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,300
Yes. I'm happy, Mother.

36
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,820
Hey, I'll tell the housekeeper to come here,

37
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,360
so change into your honeymoon clothes.

38
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,110
Our pretty piece of luck!

39
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,040
- Change your clothes!
- Okay.

40
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,650
You brought the high heels too, right?

41
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,130
Chae Yeon!

42
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,030
Tae Hee!

43
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,010
Chae Yeon, I have something to say. You can't do this marriage! You can't!

44
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,490
Why are you like that? What happened?

45
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,630
You have to know something about Lee Kang Joon.

46
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,260
Listen to me carefully, although it might sound like nonsense,

47
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,660
but I will tell you the main point. Lee Kang Joon is an a**hole.

48
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,290
He can hurt you. He is the worst of the worst!

49
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,350
Yes, you might be shocked. But you just have to take care of it carefully.

50
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,020
Know what kind of man Lee Kang Joon is

51
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,100
and pretend that this wedding did not happen.

52
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,250
I understand what you are saying.

53
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,750
After my father passed away, you supported me and Ji Hoon

54
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,270
just because my father raised you. However, that was not the only reason.

55
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,630
You sold your apartment and sent me abroad.

56
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,300
You sacrificed so much, so how could I not know how you feel?

57
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,580
You are trying to fault Kang Joon because you like me.

58
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm not trying to fault him! The fact that I like you is not important right now!

59
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,920
You have to know what kind of man Lee Kang Joon is!

60
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,170
Oppa. I love Kang Joon.

61
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,270
Let go of her hands.

62
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,140
She is my wife.

63
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,410
When I first met you, you had this look in your eyes.

64
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,750
After thinking about what it meant, it was jealousy.

65
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,740
Jealousy?

66
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Did you like Chae Yeon?

67
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,320
I don't have anything to say to you.

68
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,410
Let me just say one thing.

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,980
No matter what you do, we don't care

70
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,110
because you are nothing.

71
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,190
You are just talking behind my back

72
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,130
because you don't have anything else to offer.

73
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,010
Hyung! Hyung!

74
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,210
Since it's a happy day, don't ruin it.

75
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,840
- Come here! Come here!
- Tae Hee!

76
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,300
Today is my wedding day.

77
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,400
Hyung, I don't know what happened, but don't be like this.

78
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,100
I ask you. Please.

79
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:36,970
♫  My heart hurts, it seems to be strange road  ♫

80
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:43,540
♫  At the place where you remained,  ♫

81
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,380
♫  I miss those places  ♫

82
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,670
♫  Not only do I miss you, it hurts ♫

83
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:03,670
♫  I tried to put you between my two eyes  ♫

84
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,170
Oppa, I love Kang Joon.

85
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:15,970
♫  Because it's a fearless love,  ♫

86
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:23,520
♫  Because the love goes ahead of pain  ♫

87
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,860
♫  Even if all I can do is to look at you  ♫

88
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:37,670
♫  I can't forget about you  ♫

89
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:42,670
Where is Son-in-law Lee? Come out!

90
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,680
Mom?

91
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,780
Where is Son-in-law, Lee?

92
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,000
Come out! Remarrying?

93
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,920
If I post the wedding pictures on my blog, it's going to be a hit!

94
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,830
The wedding is confidential! There are always people like this.

95
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,950
Remarrying?

96
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,920
Son-in-law Lee!

97
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,520
They actually came?

98
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,160
The wedding is over. Let's go to the groom waiting room.

99
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,400
Those people!

100
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,310
Yes, are you saying that you are not satisfied with a bucket of water?

101
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,620
Fine, then. I will show you a bucket of fire with my fists.

102
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,500
I'm first this time.

103
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,940
Oh my!

104
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,290
Do you know how expensive this hanbok is?

105
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,850
What is this?

106
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,280
Are you crazy? Excuse me, Ajusshis!

107
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,210
Come over here!

108
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,040
What is this?

109
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:52,220
Mother! Mother! Hey! Where are we going?

110
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,070
Oh my word... I never seen such rude people!

111
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,240
Let go! Ow!

112
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,690
Let me go!

113
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,580
- Ow, my heart.
- Are you okay?

114
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,480
Ow! What are you doing?

115
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,820
Mother! Mother!

116
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,540
Run away!

117
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,200
Hurry!

118
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,600
Did you like Chae Yeon?

119
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,660
Ahjumma!

120
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,620
Where are you?

121
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,370
Ahjumma!

122
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,700
Hurry up!

123
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,380
Oh! It was this kind of atmosphere. That's great. As it is, I was spoiling for a fight.

124
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,930
Come here!

125
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,710
Let's go.

126
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,670
Mom.

127
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,600
Aigoo!

128
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,150
Something big could have happened!

129
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,350
Did you get hurt anywhere? No, I'm alright.

130
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,180
It if wasn't for that young lady we could have been in big trouble.

131
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,560
How can that girl be so strong? And ...

132
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,210
why would she have helped us?

133
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:19,180
I don't know... She just came in and started attacking those men.

134
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,980
She's was so cool.

135
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,780
But, I think I've seen her before.

136
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,050
Really? Where?

137
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,470
I wonder. I think I've seen her before, but I don't remember where.

138
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,300
Maybe not.

139
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,190
Something to say?

140
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,980
Ahjumma,

141
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,220
Chae Yeon got married today,

142
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,170
and Lee Kang Joon made me even more pissed!

143
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,490
Don't provoke me. Say what you have to say next time.

144
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,980
I was killed by my husband.

145
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:19,140
Yes, nobody can show their name card in front of you.

146
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,500
What do you have to say?

147
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,970
- I'm sorry, Doctor.
- What for?

148
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,610
Since Gyo Chae Yeon got married, we failed our mission.

149
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,570
You turned me into a beauty, but I couldn't fulfill my duty.

150
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,340
I want to sincerely apologize to you.

151
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,020
What's after that?

152
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,060
A reservation for a plane ticket to Cuba?

153
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,780
They say Cuba is a heaven suited for hot-blooded young men.

154
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,850
I saw it on an educational program that tells you everything.

155
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,710
What is this talk, like having to go to Busan, but saying that you'll follow the free road nonsense?

156
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,620
What are you talking about all the sudden?

157
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,290
Since you can't get hurt, avoid it.

158
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,570
Since I don't have any money, I only reserved it. Buy the ticket with your own money and leave this country.

159
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,630
Seriously.

160
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,560
Mother-in-law Go Soon Dong, Father-in-law Lee Jeong Sik, Divorcee Lee Jin Yeong,

161
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,260
the unemployed Lee Min Yeong and murderer...

162
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,050
Lee Kang Joon.

163
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,950
These are the files.

164
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,390
My mother-in-law is lying to Father-in-law about a secret slush fund, a man,

165
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,840
illegal plastic surgery, and frequenting host bars (male escorts).

166
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,180
She once gave her boyfriend a thousand dollar lighter.

167
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,230
A thousand dollars?

168
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,080
Both my sisters-in-law are using high interest loans (from loan sharks), but no one knows.

169
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,190
My eldest sister-in-law was divorced because of gambling,

170
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,870
and my younger sister-in-law is part of an illegal pyramid scheme.

171
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,280
My mother-in-law's greatest enemy is my father-in-law.

172
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,390
Father-in-law is the Hulk.

173
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,160
He's pretending to be an angel by doing community service, but...

174
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,420
when he's mad, he gets violent. Even my sisters-in-law are scared of him.

175
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,130
My mother-in-law and my sisters-in-law are professionals at harassing and gossiping.

176
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,180
They switch targets and fight, trick and get tricked.

177
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,300
I collected all of this family's weaknesses and corruption.

178
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,260
Wow!

179
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,760
But what's this?

180
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,020
What my mother and I have gone through.

181
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,470
I'm going to make them experience and regret exactly what we went through.

182
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,480
And the last place my murderer of a husband has to go is...

183
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,950
Prison.

184
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,060
Since he cheated on me and "killed" me, he should pay the price.

185
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,910
You should avoid this.

186
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,910
Since she got married, you have to give up on Gyo Chae Yeon.

187
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,940
Give up.

188
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,320
Give up?

189
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,420
You used that word when you counted cabbages and when you made kimchi! (The words cabbage and giving up sound the same.)

190
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,050
I'm not giving up.

191
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,230
These are my files on the CEO of HBS, Lee Kang Joon.

192
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,880
Lee Kang Joon's stock trading records, organization chart of financial reports, business partnerships,

193
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,600
and even his credit card use records. I have everything I need.

194
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,070
This is the encyclopedia and the bible of Lee Kang Joon and HBS.

195
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,020
Then?

196
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:55,290
If we have been fighting against the cold virus until now, from now on, we will be fighting against the Ebola virus.

197
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,320
I can't leave Chae Yeon living alone with a murderer.

198
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,200
I have to save Chae Yeon.

199
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,210
But, what is this?

200
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,590
I also made a simulation.

201
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,270
Lee Kang Joon's final destination is...

202
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,200
Stop.

203
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,960
Prison!

204
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,640
How dare he mock an angel like me. He deserves to be beaten to death.

205
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,180
Of course, he is also an evil person who killed his wife.

206
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,320
She won't listen, no matter how much I explain to her that Lee Kang Joon is a bad guy.

207
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,440
I have to reveal his sins so that Chae Yeon leaves him.

208
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,210
Yes, sir! In the end, we're together on the same side again.

209
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,590
It's the same as that.

210
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,990
We will not fail this mission, like last time.

211
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,690
That's because I have a special weapon.

212
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,820
Weapon?

213
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,260
Your weapon is... what I designed, made my Han Tae Hee...

214
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,120
your beauty. Other than that, is there something else?

215
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,690
The last time we tried to succeed with looks, we failed.

216
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,440
We need something even more special.

217
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,630
Something more special... would be great. What is it?

218
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,320
Household duties.

219
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,720
Household duties?

220
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,470
These are just household items.

221
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,240
No one in that family can to do housework better than I can.

222
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,480
I will use what I do best as a weapon. Household duties.

223
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,920
- I have confidence.
- Fine!

224
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,500
Gyae Tae said this: "What is democratic belongs to the world."

225
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,770
The thing most like an ahjumma is the strongest competitive strength.

226
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,520
I acknowledge that. Daebak! I really like your idea.

227
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,930
Thank you.

228
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,820
Unni Sara, what brings you here so early in the morning?

229
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,380
Last time, at the family meeting, I forgot my coat here.

230
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,830
Coat?

231
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,240
Aw man! This girl forgot her coat here.

232
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,030
Oh! Just hurry up and start cleaning.

233
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,980
Why is there so much stuff inside this coat?

234
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,170
Oh my god! What's all this stuff?

235
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,890
Unni Sara,

236
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,270
inside the coat there was a lot of stuff.

237
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,560
Oh, that?

238
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,000
Twenty-four hours...

239
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,560
You're taking care of your skin and body, right? There were a lot of sprays inside.

240
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,910
That's why this "hot" body is possible, right?

241
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,960
Yes, you're right.

242
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,660
I brought some food that I cooked.

243
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,990
Food!

244
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,510
I will take care of the inside of the house.

245
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,750
I'm going to mess up the household of my in-laws.

246
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,250
Oh my!

247
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,450
Oh, yes!

248
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:53,700
It's so good that if two of us died, I wouldn't know. Did you make all this?

249
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,890
Sara's rice cake was the best, too!

250
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,860
All that time, it was like we were eating prison food, but now I feel alive!

251
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,570
Prison food? Why I ought to...

252
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,510
By the way, my coat...

253
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,680
It's upstairs.

254
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,820
Please eat comfortably. I'll go and get it.

255
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,920
♬ Oh, I'm in love with you, it seems the puzzle piece fits.♬

256
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,470
♬Oh, I'm in love with you. You're my ideal type.♬

257
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,490
Certificate of Registration of Multi-Level (Pyramid) Sales
♬ I like you because you are truly beautiful ♬

258
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,220
The evidence of unemployed Sister-In-Law involved in pyramid scheme.

259
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,880
♬  My heart seems to have stopped. ♬

260
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,360
♬  Oh, I'm in love with you. The season seems to have changed. ♬

261
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,620
I. O. U. (Promissory Note)
♬ Oh, I'm in love with you.♬

262
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,430
The oldest sister-in-law's promissory note to cover her gambling debt.

263
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,920
♬ I never noticed how beautiful and blue the sky is. ♬

264
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,790
♬ Even watching a sad movie, I can laugh.♬

265
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,440
♬ A woman who is radiant from a hundred meters away ♬

266
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,860
Evidence of Mother-in-law's affair!
♬A woman whose nature is attractive without pretense ♬

267
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,150
♬ A woman whose personality is attractive without pretension♬

268
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,910
♬ Like coffee, the woman I think of every day♬

269
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,820
♬ The woman who is addictive to me ♬

270
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,560
♬  When I see you, indeed my heart is excited. Indeed, ♬

271
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,870
♬ (Oh, my girl,) it's hard to find a woman as rare as you♬

272
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,050
To Father-in-law... sent!

273
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:35,400
♬ When you are smiling, I want to cuddle you (Oh my girl) but it is still so difficult!♬

274
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,900
♬Oh, I'm in love with you. It seems the puzzle piece fits. ♬

275
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,620
♬Oh, I'm in love with you. You're my ideal type. ♬

276
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,450
♬ I like you because you are truly beautiful or because it's comfortable, I like you. ♬

277
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,040
♬  My heart seems to have stopped.♬

278
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,700
Wiretap the bride and groom.

279
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,060
Cause the couple to fight by leaving one of my earrings.

280
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:07,000
♬ I never noticed how beautiful and blue the sky is. ♬

281
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,360
♬ Even if I watch a sad movie, I can laugh.♬

282
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,600
Ah, the smell of coffee!

283
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,280
Hey, I didn't get to eat because of the two of you!

284
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,130
Mom, say something that makes sense! You have chicken breast stuck to your teeth!

285
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,790
For me, I have never seen a person as capable since Geum Ran.

286
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,150
Why are you bringing up Geum Ran's name? It might bring bad luck.

287
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,790
Don't make that mistake in front of Chae Yeon! Erase Geum Ran from your mind!

288
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,640
Got it, you two?

289
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,980
Oh, I'm so full!

290
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:59,360
Oh my goodness! You've already done all of the dishes?

291
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,620
Everything is so shiny!

292
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,870
It might get slippery when I cook. How did you do the dishes?

293
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,950
If you put baking powder in the washing liquid, and rinse the dishes in warm water, the dishes will shine.

294
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,290
Sara, you're really amazing!

295
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,770
How does a young person know these things so well?

296
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,970
When Gyo Chae Yeon comes, she'll do a better job.

297
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,310
Oh, of course! Chae Yeon will do well!

298
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,000
Sara, I'm saying this because you already know so much about our family...

299
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,060
Honestly, since we exchanged our daughter-in-law, I feel most gratified.

300
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:36,030
The previous daughter-in-law was so crappy I was ashamed to go anywhere with her.

301
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:40,360
I really love that I am getting a new daughter-in-law!

302
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,330
But Mother...

303
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,930
A daughter-in-law is not like a battery that you can exchange. What do you mean exchange?

304
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,540
Huh?

305
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:57,080
Oh, you must have been startled after I called you Mother!

306
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,290
Since I already said it, would it be okay to call you Mother?

307
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,830
It just feels so distant to call you ma'am.

308
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,920
Oh, of course! Whatever makes you feel comfortable!

309
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,330
Where is your Mother? Go Soon Dong! Go Soon Dong!

310
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,430
That sounds like my husband's voice.

311
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,240
- Oww!
- Father! What's going on? Did Mother do something again?

312
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,480
Together with Dae Pyeong.
Who is Dae Pyeong?

313
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,090
This man and your mother... kissed!

314
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,010
Who sent this to me?

315
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:43,660
This is the principal. I told you to take it easy with him, Mom.

316
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,100
What did you say?

317
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,880
Do you want to die?

318
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,270
Please save me. Honey. Honey.

319
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:57,410
- Come here! Come here!
- Oh! Father, calm down! Calm down!

320
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,740
Hello, Mr. CEO.

321
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,310
Oh.

322
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,720
I'll be... on my way then.

323
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,570
Oh.

324
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,980
Oh, but this...

325
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,890
was inside of my coat, though it doesn't belong to me.

326
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,520
What is it?

327
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,400
Promissory Note?

328
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,220
- Promissory Note.
Thirty ...

329
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,490
$32,000?

330
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,730
$32,000, Lee Jin Yeong!

331
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,690
You put up my car as a collateral?!

332
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,770
Oh my! What is that doing there? You see, I can explain!

333
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,740
While your father worries about this nation and provides community service for the people,

334
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,920
you go gamble and get private loans?

335
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,480
- You're... so pathetic!
- Dad, let me explain.

336
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,400
Of the money, $10,000 was for Min Young. That wench

337
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,560
- got involved in a pyramid scheme, so I...
- What?

338
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,970
What did you say?

339
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,900
I don't have to expose the illegal pyramid scheme.

340
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,060
I knew she'd spill the beans trying to save herself!

341
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,010
Oh, the constipation! Every time I eat rice with beans I feel like dying because of the constipation!

342
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,410
Hey! Hey! Hey! You stop right there!

343
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,890
I'll be going now. Goodbye.

344
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,010
Okay.

345
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,540
Go stand over there!

346
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,550
Attention! Hands behind your back.

347
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,700
Attention!

348
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,450
Yes?

349
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,630
The old lady is awake. Go have breakfast with her.

350
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,420
Did you hear about the report this morning?

351
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,650
Looking for Dong Geul

352
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:06,010
The ad is on the daily newspaper.

353
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,170
Who is putting in the ad or what the reason is...

354
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,340
there is no information as to who is putting in the ad.

355
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,340
There is just this one sentence.

356
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,040
I am looking for Dong Geul.

357
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:45,750
While Ajumma is taking care of the inside of Lee Kang Joon's house, I will take care of the outside:

358
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,490
HBS's CEO position, stature and their assets.

359
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,270
I'll take those away and make him dirt poor.

360
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,540
You are nothing.

361
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,040
What an a**hole, Lee Kwang Joon.

362
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,400
You have just put your finger into a lion's nostril.

363
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,250
I'll show you how painful it can be.

364
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:34,490
Seeing as how you slept late, you must have drunk last night.

365
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,000
Was the meeting with friends fun?

366
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,940
What fun?

367
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,160
Why do they chew out others as they get old?

368
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,220
They are saying that "this" and "that" are the problems.

369
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,160
They were chewing out so much that.

370
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,970
I chewed out all of them as I left.

371
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,810
Grandma! Oh, I have something to show you.

372
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,210
"I am looking for Dong Geul." Who put up this ad?

373
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,900
Dong Geul is Dong Woon's nickname. It felt a bit odd.

374
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,350
It has nothing to do with us, right?

375
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,160
I placed the ad.

376
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,370
You, Grandmother?

377
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,340
Why, all of a sudden? Dong Woon is dead.

378
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:36,030
Winner Group's Chemical factory explosion is something everyone knows about.

379
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,760
My father, Dong Woon, and many other people died.

380
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:47,090
It's a painful matter. Wouldn't it be better not to stir it up?

381
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,180
If the subordinates have done something wrong, tell me. I'll make it to right, Grandmother.

382
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,190
Rat poison came out of Mong Shil's vomit.

383
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,810
Find out about it and send it to Dr. Jung.

384
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:09,300
Oh my... Oh my word, Mother. Is that true?

385
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:15,020
When, in my house, they feed my dog rat poison to kill him, is there anything to keep that from happening to me?

386
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,680
I am even going to find someone who looks like Dong Geul and use him as a bodyguard.

387
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:27,170
I have to have a person who is completely on my side

388
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,900
so that I can be relaxed when I sleep.

389
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,450
The ad to find Dong Geul

390
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:45,040
is not only in the newspaper.

391
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:32,470
This real setting. I prepared for everything perfectly.

392
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:46,380
Lee Kang Joon, I dug you out because I thought you were a marble, but you were actually the eye of an alligator.

393
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,940
Try getting bitten properly once by the alligator!

394
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,240
I will hack into Winner Group and open the desktop of Lee Kang Joon,

395
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,660
send the virus through Lee Kang Joon's email,

396
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,830
and then I will send it through the wedding announcement to everyone.

397
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,630
Winner Group, to all the HBS employees.

398
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,620
Ah, Lee Kang Joon. Because of that kind of jerk...

399
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,730
my pores have gotten bigger because of the stress!

400
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,540
It's annoying, really...

401
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,600
When he comes back from his honeymoon,

402
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,980
I will punch him in the face!

403
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,460
Wait till you come back.

404
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,660
The End!

405
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,870
Find Dong Geul

406
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,130
Find Dong Geul?

407
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,300
Here you go, Dong Geul. Bread.

408
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,120
Bread?

409
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,340
It's my birthday! Grandma!

410
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:42,230
Your nickname is Dong Geul ("circle"), so circular bread is enough,

411
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,400
isn't it ?

Huh?

414
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,520
We bumped simultaneously, but why is he just leaving?

415
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,510
Hey! Won't you come here?!

416
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,760
Hey, punk! What are you doing, you punk?

417
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,170
He's General Manager of Strategic Planning, Han Min Hyeok. He will be the CEO of Winner Group.

418
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,460
I will apologize in his place.

[Looking for Dong Geul]

420
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,050
Why is Grandmother looking for me?

421
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:33,620
I'm going to look for a person that looks like him and use him as a bodyguard.

422
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,750
Min Hyeok.

423
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:49,010
Did you see? Like, how she is taunting us...

424
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,450
She put up an advertisement saying that she is looking for her grandson!

425
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,180
Just which punk becomes the dragon and which punk becomes the monster serpent!

426
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,730
I was always curious.

427
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,840
I wanted to be the dragon,

428
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,090
but Grandmother is proving

429
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,740
to me that it will never come true.

430
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,910
She never called us until I turned fifteen

431
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,120
but told us to live with her once her children died.

432
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,010
And, I was never acknowledged by her even after living with her.

433
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,760
A mistress's son is always a mistress's son.

434

That's all there is.

Until now, not even once,

436
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,730
has she ever treated me like a daughter-in-law.

437
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:56,270
Always calling me Secretary Sohn, because I was your Father's secretary.

You, who are my son,

00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,970
Change the shareholder's meeting to an earlier date. Reconfirm the shares we got for an emergency situation

448
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:02,200
so that we can release it when we need to and ...

00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,210
have a formal ceremony.

450

wished for!

00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,000
It's just a doll. I'll buy you a new one.

476
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,550
That doll had a spell put on it from the sorcerer in Bali. It can't be purchased.

477
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,060
We were told the doll symbolized our love.

478
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,790
I don't have a good gut feeling about this.

479
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:28,190
Chae Yeon, a premonition is simply a premonition, okay?

480
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,200
- What happened?
- The newlyweds arrived.

481
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:46,260
For starters, they entered the house smiling radiantly.

482
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,670
Right now, it may be that way. They have reason to smile, right?

483
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:55,370
Then, shall we listen in on what is happening in the room?

484
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,030
Then...

485
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,500
We returned safely.

486
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,800
Can't you raise them higher?!

487
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,200
Father-In-Law.

488
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,620
Welcome. While you two were gone, something happened,

489
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,490
so the household environment isn't good. Wash up and rest.

490
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:23,130
Keep them raised!

491
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,760
Honey. Honey, Honey. Our daughter-in-law came, let me save face. Okay?

492
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,160
If saving face is important, you kiss an elementary school alumni?

493
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,920
If an apple is rotten, you can cut away the rotten part and eat it.

494
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,040
However if a person's mentality is rotten, there's nothing to cut out. Raise your arms! Raise them!

495
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,850
Even if that's so, this is our first day.

496
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:08,760
He's too much. It's even ruining our good mood.

497
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,830
Father is very hot-tempered. It's something you need to know anyway.

498
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,480
I'm sorry.

499
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,560
I understand.

500
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,760
According to the wiretapping device, the newlyweds have entered the house.

501
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,330
The father-in-law is all up in arms.

502
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:37,490
There is no one to cook for them!

503
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:39,560
It's 5 minutes before all hell breaks loose!

504
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,030
Then the queen of housekeeping should be dispatched, right?

505
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,500
Beat that murderer to a pulp!

506
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,450
You said you won't cook? Everyone is in the middle of being punished.

507
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,650
Today is the first day at my in-laws.

508
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:07,200
If I start cooking today, I'll have to do it 365 days a year.

509
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,290
It's important to start things on the right foot.

510
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,650
Kang Joon! Sister-in-law!

511
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:20,030
It got solved. Everything got solved!

512
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,320
Dad said I don't have to undergo punishment anymore.

513
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,730
Even dinner is solved.

514
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:28,070
- What happened?
- Sara solved everything.

515
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:29,610
Sara?

516
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:42,020
Because the newlyweds were coming home, I made Shinseulro and Goojeul pan (king's royal dishes).

517
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:45,900
Aigoo, this is precious. Thank you.

518
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,440
Oh, Kang Joon, come quickly.

519
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,680
Father, what's going on?

520
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,450
Sara is opening a restaurant.

521
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:15,290
She said she's a chef. That's why she cooks so well.

522
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,750
Thanks to her, she agreed to hire them. We were in the middle of exchanging greetings.

523
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:23,190
Thanks to her, we also don't have to be punished.

524
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,500
Thank you

525
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:31,050
She's hiring my sister-in-laws?

526
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,120
Anyway, I need to hire employees.

527
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,670
Since they also wanted to learn how to cook, I agreed to teach them a bit

528
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,820
at this house.

529
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,890
What are you up to?

530
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:15,340
Why are you meddling in my house? For what reason?!

531
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,520
Murderous husband, iron slap!

532
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,380
Oh, well done,Ahjumma!

533
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,590
Aigoo, it feels refreshing. This headache-free and clear head of mine.

534
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:30,300
Lee Kang Joon.

535
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,980
Are you crazy?

536
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,180
You grabbed my arm so tight that you scared me.

537
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,850
I did it because I thought you were a bad person.

538
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,480
What in the world are you thinking?

539
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,690
What's the reason for meddling in my house?!!

540
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,830
Should I lie, or should I tell you the truth?

541
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,930
Of course, you have to tell me truthfully.

542
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:04,760
Lee Kang Joon and Gyo Chae Yeon,

543
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,060
I'm going to make you two divorce

544
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,530
within three weeks.

545
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:16,920
That's what I'm determined to do. If you can avoid it, please do so.

546
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,560
I'm leaving.

547
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:25,300
After I knew about the affair between you two,

548
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,110
it was exactly three weeks before I died, right?

549
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:35,280
You two also try being on the receiving end. Feel the torment of your family being shattered.

550
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,650
Then, you have to prevent her from entering this house.

551
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:48,030
Father is being stubborn because of Noona and Min Yeong's employment.

552
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:51,520
Go and tell them, honestly.

553
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,180
- Sara is honestly a woman you were interested in.
- Chae Yeon!

554
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,820
Chae Yeon! Lee Kang Joon is upset.

555
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,710
Chae Yeon, success!

556
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,120
- Why can't you say it?
- Lee Kang Joon!

557
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,800
How can I say such a thing to Father?

558
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,030
- Chae Yeon !
- Then, should I do it?

559
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:15,010
- Lee Kang Joon.
- That woman is fixated on me and is jealous of our relationship.

560
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,690
Let's stop. I haven't slept a wink.

561
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,310
- Do you think I slept?
-That's why I'm saying let's stop!

562
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:27,950
Kang Joon, what's the matter? The wedding card you sent is full of viruses!

563
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:31,020
- The computer is messed up.
- What?

564
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,520
Oppa! Exactly what did you send? My tablet PC is totally messed up!

565
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,210
I never sent a card.

566
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,400
Now, Doctor, it's your turn.

567
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,890
Definitely.

568
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,290
Han Tae Hee ?

569
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:36,370
My computer crashed because of the infected email you sent me.

570
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:38,900
You were spiteful and did it on purpose, right?

571
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,600
Aiyoo...

572
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,890
I have to get my computer fixed so I'll be going.

573
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,740
Ah, ah...

574
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:57,340
It's definitely not deliberate, because you said I was nothing and despised me at the wedding hall. Okay?

575
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,960
No misunderstanding, okay?

576
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,940
One step forward towards prison.

577
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,740
♫ Only one ♫

578
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,240
Next...
♫ Ooh, ooh, only one ♫

579
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:58,460
♫ One, ooh just like new, again ♫

580
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:01,460
Are we working here now?

581
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,420
It's so cool!

582
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,380
When are you opening, Sara?

583
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,550
Next week.

584
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,760
Ah, I see.

585
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:15,030
Is this restaurant yours, Sara?

586
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,860
The owner is someone else.

587
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,640
I'm a chef and the manager.

588
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,490
I see.

589
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:27,740
Thank you, Sara, for giving us a job.

590
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,560
I like our job.

591
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,970
Sara, you are an angel that saved us.

592
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,190
Angel?

593
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:45,720
I'm not an angel but a pig sister-in-law that came back from hell.

594
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,590
What should we do first? Where do we cook?

595
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,180
Let's clean first.

596
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,540
Cleaning the bathroom.

597
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:03,340
This restaurant hasn't been open for a while, so there are many disgusting things stuck on the toilets.

598
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,660
You guys have to scape it off by hand.

599
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,700
It's vinegar.

600
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,100
Add it to the bleach and scrub the floor.

601
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,140
We have to get rid of the smell.

602
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,160
What is all this?

603
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,650
The shareholder documents have disappeared.

604
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,510
What the heck did you do to me?

605
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,420
I know you may not believe me,

606
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,070
but it's not my doing.

607
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,650
There are five days left until the shareholder's meeting. Restore everything back the way it was before.

608
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:02,220
Yes, Manager.

609
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,850
Kang Joon.

610
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,260
Let's do well, okay ?

611
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,490
It's an earring.

612
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,220
It's not mine.

613
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,330
Kang Joon, where are you ?

614
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,630
The situation in the company isn't good because of a virus email.

615
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,450
Earring?

616
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,290
It's Sara's.

617
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:28,490
Did you have her in the room before?

618
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:33,710
It can't be! Why are you being like this, really!

619
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:37,910
Stop. I'm hanging up. Let's talk at home.

620
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,310
Kang Joon!

621
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:58,470
Kang Joon, when are you coming home?

622
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,630
You can't come?

623
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,790
You are staying out?

624
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:06,070
I'm not sleeping outside! It's just the situation!

625
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:10,870
There is Sara's earring on the bed, and it's the second day after our honeymoon,

626
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:12,650
but you are spending the night outside?

627
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,220
I understand.

628
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:17,980
I said I understand!

629
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,840
Ajumma, how is it going?

630
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,360
They are having a great fight!

631
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,950
Oh! Everything is going as planned!

632
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,760
It means it's working!

633
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,400
Ahjumma, the feeling is great. Should we get out a (drink).

634
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,970
What are you doing? You should prepare the snacks.

635
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,790
Yes, Doctor.

636
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:01,030
Well.

637
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,520
Your plan of revenge is making progress!

638
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,000
It's it good! Let's drink today and be happy.

639
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,980
It's a relief.

640
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,010
But,

641
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:30,360
I'm not that happy.

642
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,270
Why again?

643
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:34,450
I...

644
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:37,640
lost the hope

645
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,840
that I can be happy.

646
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:43,150
I lost everything.

647
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,380
How can I be happy?

648
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,170
That's because your heart was broken too many times.

649
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:51,640
That rascal, Lee Kang Joon,

650
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,420
did too many bad things to you.

651
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,120
Doctor,

652
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:02,860
when Gyo Chae Yeon gets a divorce, are you going to accept her?

653
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,990
Even if she is a divorcee?

654
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,090
To me

655
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,770
Chae Yeon's happiness always comes first.

656
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:28,190
If Chae Yeon believes that the person that will make her happy

657
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,930
is me, I will.

658
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:33,480
I see.

659
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,580
From tomorrow, eat this for snacks.

660
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,630
It's homemade chocolate with almonds.

661
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:00,710
Mmm.

662
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:03,890
But, why suddenly chocolate?

663
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:08,360
I'm worried about you.

664
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,950
Me?

665
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,280
Why me ?

666
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,370
When you know that the person you love,

667
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:19,530
is a bad person.

668
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:21,380
Also,

669
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,370
I know how painful it is

670
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,740
when you find out

671
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,240
that you were deceived the whole time.

672
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,340
You loving Gyo Chae Yeon

673
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:41,880
is similar to how I loved my husband.

674
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,880
It's unconditional, isn't it?

675
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:47,250
Doctor,

676
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:53,050
I'm worried that you will feel the same pain as I have.

677
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,490
I hope that

678
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,780
you don't go through that kind of pain.

679
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,450
That...

680
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:15,980
is a very difficult thing.

681
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:29,670
That almond chocolate can decrease the stress well.

682
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:33,590
As a prevention for a broken heart, eat it everyday!

683
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,070
But ...

684
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,180
why does she look pretty?

685
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:33,350
If you are going to drink a lot, drink one sip of milk.

686
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,100
Why am I like this ?

687
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:52,110
It's not like she is wearing a dress or doing kama sutra.

688
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:53,730
But why?

689
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,710
Why am I thinking that this ahjumma looks pretty?

690
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:10,550
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you, it's like we fit like a puzzle. ♫

691
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:15,340
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you, you're my ideal type. ♫

692
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:20,310
♫  Was the sky always this pretty and blue?  ♫

693
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:25,680
Birth of a Beauty
~Preview~

694
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,750
This woman is a fake.

695
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,220
- Pull your senses together.
- It's thrilling.

696
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,700
This ahjumma is just a tool to get to Chae Yeon.

697
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,570
Why do you keep getting emotionally involved with her?

698
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:35,710
- I'm excited.
- She is a witch that bewitched a genius.

699
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:38,140
- I will try my best.
- No, this is a dream.

700
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,240
- Fighting.
- Just go home already!

701
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,890
Don't you want to be a legend in the world of revenge?

702
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:44,260
It doesn't have anything to do with you anymore.

703
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:47,770
Let's pay them back the same way. The murdered wife of a previous life...

704
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:50,740
Let an ex-wife, who was killed, become an attractive mistress. Let's make them get a divorce.

705
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,270
Kang Joon, I want to see you again.

706
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:55,900
- Why are you like this ?
- You can come to look for me anytime.

707
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:59,450
It seems like I'm in Sa Geum Ran's position. What is this dirty feeling?

708
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:01,640
I was also deceived by that man.

709
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,040
- Kang Joon!
- Sara! I remembered your words, that you told me to look for you when I'm having a hard time.

710
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,270
This playboy will never change.

711
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:12,010
Lee Kang Joon, you are going to have the worst day of your life.
