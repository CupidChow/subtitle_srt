1
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,730
Episode 11

2
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,170
Ajumma!

3
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,410
How can you so foolishly wait for me for this long?

4
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,870
A person might die preparing your birthday for you.

5
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,670
I can live as I always have lived in the past.

6
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,780
What's so important about my birthday?

7
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,050
No, from now on, I'll take care of it for you.

8
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,110
Happy birthday,

9
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,490
Sa Geum Ran.

10
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,270
♫ There was nothing that went on. ♫

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,330
♫ It was not sadness, either. ♫

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:08,900
♫ Without a reason, I hurt and I feel alone. ♫

13
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,840
♫ I don't know what it is. ♫

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,070
♫ I think my heart opened up. ♫

15
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,940
♫ Nothing seems fun ♫

16
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,500
♫ The days that you are not with me. ♫

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,990
♫ I never thought it would be this hard. ♫

18
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:44,260
♫ I guess my longing for you was good. ♫

19
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,990
We should sleep.

20
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,350
We should.

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,110
We have a lot of things to do tomorrow.

22
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,710
You have to visit your grandmother
and consult with the attorney.

23
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,930
I have a shoot for Birth of a Chef, and I have to go to the restaurant.

24
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,270
I have to go see my mother in the hospital.

25
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,970
Why did we have to be so busy?

26
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,470
I don't think there's time to go on a date.

27
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,700
Let's call each other to keep tabs on each other.

28
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,480
Alright.

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,310
Sleep tight.

30
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,450
Yes, you too.

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,440
I thought we were sleeping separately, so why
are you holding onto my hand so tightly?

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,170
I'm not holding onto your hand; it's the other way around.

33
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,710
I... this...

34
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,030
I have Alien Hand Syndrome. It's not me, but it...

35
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,310
seems like my hand is holding you!

36
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,150
Is that so?

37
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,830
Then, I'm really going to let go.

38
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,230
No, don't!

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,990
Oh, come on.

40
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,600
You're the man, the man! Han Tae Hee,

41
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,250
you're the man!

42
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,690
Wow!

43
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:04,470
Timing and Subtitles brought to you

44
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,140
Ajumma, good night!

45
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,890
This is what I'll wear for tomorrow's date.

46
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,770
Oh, Sa Geum Ran!

47
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,260
Oh, Sara!

48
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,520
You've gone through a lot;

49
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,930
from being in a car accident and almost drowning,
to getting surgery.

50
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,810
I have suffered a lot.

51
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,470
Although I have gone through a lot, it's alright now.

52
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,770
See, you're laughing.

53
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,230
You've met a good man, and happiness
is right in front of you.

54
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,050
Being loved is good, but

55
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm a little afraid of love. Aren't you?

56
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,950
Will I be able to love someone again?

57
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,350
It's not easy

58
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,550
because your marriage was pretty painful,
and you're scared.

59
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,670
I'm really scared

60
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,930
because I've already failed once.

61
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,000
So what? You've even gotten surgery,
so you can do anything.

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,100
Don't get scared and just go forward.

63
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,190
Han Tae Hee is different from Lee Kang Joon.

64
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,590
Right?

65
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,610
Of course.

66
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,910
You're not scared of love.

67
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,180
You're scared of getting hurt.

68
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,210
What I've gone through, it was because I had no strength.

69
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,310
I was an ajumma that only relied on her husband.

70
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,530
So when everything was taken away,

71
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,910
I didn't have the strength to protect myself

72
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,530
or the strength to protect my mom.

73
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,030
Then,

74
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,950
I should have confidence within me,
not in my husband or my land.

75
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,950
That's right! Strength comes from skill!

76
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,480
Women who work are so cool!

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,430
If you have strength, then you can
protect your love and your mom.

78
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,110
That's a great thought!

79
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,200
Birth of a Chef - Challenge a Chef

80
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,580
If you become the best chef,

81
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,600
the first place prize is $100,000.

82
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,610
The answer is not to be a judge,
but to become a contestant.

83
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,330
This crappy world.

84
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,030
Honey, why'd you come home so late?

85
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,590
You reek of alcohol!

86
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,480
What happened?

87
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,070
My heart doesn't feel good because of Geum Ran.

88
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,400
When Geum Ran married Kang Joon,

89
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,130
we were living in a rental.

90
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,670
We didn't have anything.

91
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,670
Geum Ran . . .

92
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,570
She always took care of my mother, who had dementia.

93
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,450
She always had a smile on her face
and never complained.

94
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,210
Geum Ran, a person of that type . . .

95
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,890
We know that she died over the grief of
her husband cheating on her.

96
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,730
And, the fact that we're living so well

97
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,320
makes me feel guilty.

98
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,100
The building that we built on Geum Ran's land,

99
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,000
I think it'd be best to return it to her family.

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,560
What?!

101
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,370
- Honey!
- We can survive without the building!

102
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,390
Greed!

103
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,760
It's ultimately what

104
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,360
ruins people!

105
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,050
Let the building go?

106
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,010
Of course, I don't plan to give it away to the in-laws.

107
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,770
I'm not crazy.

108
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,490
However, since my husband won't give up on the idea,

109
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,560
let's pretend to give it back, then do what we need with it.

110
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,260
You gave me the building because
this was a second marriage for your son.

111
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,920
Kang Joon is the CEO of the broadcasting station. There
would have been ill-talk about him owning a building.

112
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,310
So, we gave it to you for certain reasons.

113
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,630
Is that why you left it as a provisional registration?

114
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,130
So, if you saw the chance, you'd take it back?

115
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,140
How could you look straight at your mother-in-law?

116
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,280
Oh, I'm so scared. Whenever you act like this,
I start to think of Geum Ran.

117
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,290
Please, try to be as half as good as her.

118
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,030
Seriously! So nasty!

119
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,330
I can't believe her.

120
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,650
Where is Lee Kang Joon?

121
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:53,120
Sara is at that house with a man right now?

122
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,810
Yes, the lights in the kitchen are still on.

123
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,630
Find out when they started dating,
the man's name and occupation.

124
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,430
Follow Sara tomorrow too.

125
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,610
Are you stalking Sara?

126
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,620
-None of your business.
- If I don't pay attention,

127
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,090
then you'll regret it.

128
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,000
Sara is just playing with you.

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,190
Are you jealous?

130
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,510
I did love you once.

131
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,100
And, that's why I hated you.

132
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,620
But now, I think you're pathetic.

133
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,950
It's not jealousy.

134
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,990
I'm only enduring this for three weeks.

135
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,570
After this, get out as you promised to do.

136
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,280
You're already up?

137
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,730
I was going to prepare today's breakfast though.

138
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,520
Birth of a Chef - 'Become a Chef!'

139
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,880
I'm going to take the 'Birth of a Chef' challenge.

140
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,480
Now?

141
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,150
We don't even have time to date.

142
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,190
I have an important reason why
I'm going on Birth of a Chef.

143
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,530
Doctor, you should sleep more.

144
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,560
No, let's do it together.

145
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,040
No!

146
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,750
I have to do it by myself.

147
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,450
Don't worry!

148
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,470
I'll do everything that I need to do.

149
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,190
Of course, we'll date too.

150
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,100
First round will include Lee Jung Shin, who has
30 years of experience in cooking and

151
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,440
Soo Hyun's chef, Kim Joon Hyun.

152
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,840
While the scores are being decided,
should we have a taste test?

153
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,820
How is Lee Jung Shin's cooking, Sara?

154
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,520
It tastes way better than the pork short ribs from last time.

155
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,120
The fermented bean paste is very unique, and

156
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,030
I want to suggest that if we added shiitake mushroom powder to this what it may taste like?

157
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,740
They would fit perfectly.

158
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,010
- Sara, you worked hard! - You too!

159
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,820
You worked hard!

160
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,860
Sara?

161
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,090
- Yes, Teacher? - How'd you know
about the shiitake mushroom powder?

162
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,210
I mean, you're just a young lady.
Have you done some cooking before?

163
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,120
Yes, Teacher. I really like cooking.

164
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,740
Could you take a look at the food that I cooked?

165
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,760
I've cooked Korean food, Japanese food,
Chinese food, and even Italian food.

166
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,480
I wanted to challenge the chef,
so I tried making some.

167
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,820
Teacher, please try some.

168
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,880
Everyone, please taste this!

169
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,130
Wow, what is this?

170
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,520
Taste it!

171
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,600
- It's delicious!
- Sara,

172
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,130
You're great at cooking!

173
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,460
Eat a lot!

174
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,080
- Wow, you're great! - This is really good.

175
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,930
I'm Lawyer Park Ji Hyun.

176
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,230
Allow me to rely on you.

177
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,900
There is no time to waste because
my grandmother is waning.

178
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,950
By the end of this week, I am confident
that I can get her released.

179
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,860
We ate really well!

180
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,330
Really, Teacher?

181
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,820
Can I really challenge the chef?

182
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,990
Of course!

183
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,080
Your level of skill is more than satisfactory.

184
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,330
Wow, it'd be great if you won first place.

185
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,460
From only eating to actually cooking,
that's a transformation.

186
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,800
Sara,

187
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,950
if you're that good at cooking,
then it means you've cooked quite a lot.

188
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,020
It's fascinating.

189
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,910
A miss who isn't even married,
when did you learn how to cook?

190
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,300
Since eight years ago, I did all the cooking in our house.

191
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,450
I did it as a hobby, but I guess it's now a skill.

192
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,380
Oh, a hobby?

193
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,480
Looking at your resume, you're the daughter
of my mother's friend from Gangnam,

194
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,850
but your hand is rough and you have a lot of calluses.

195
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,280
It seems like you did a lot of household chores.

196
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,520
Have you lived a rough life?

197
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,990
Why do I feel like you're hiding something?

198
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,950
We're not even close,

199
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,080
but you seem to be very interested in me.

200
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,980
Since when did you start looking at my resume?

201
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,280
Since you are so unique, when you become more famous and

202
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,190
come on as a guest on a talk show later,
we'll probably have much to talk about.

203
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,820
You're going to be able to do well. You're admirable.

204
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,420
Thank you!

205
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,790
I'll work hard! Go home, Teacher.

206
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,820
Go home safely!

207
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:22,150
But Sara, why do you work so hard?

208
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,760
I want to protect my loved one.

209
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,200
To do that, I have to be strong.

210
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,850
A man?

211
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,820
Well, I don't know what kind of man he is,
but he's lucky!

212
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,790
See you later!

213
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,650
I stopped by the filming site to see you and
heard that you're going to challenge the chef?

214
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,910
Yes, you heard?

215
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,010
Everyone is expecting a lot, including me.

216
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,300
I'm going to work hard!

217
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,520
That's good. I took this to give to you.

218
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,160
It's an invitation to a famous Italian chef's cooking class.

219
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,240
Thank you so much!

220
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,090
What is this?

221
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,330
Why aren't there any calls from her?

222
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,450
It's our first date.

223
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,190
Such an obtuse ajumma.

224
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,230
Ajumma, what are you doing?

225
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,100
Filming's done, right?

226
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,720
Have you eaten?

227
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,090
Why aren't you replying?

228
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,570
So annoying!

229
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,320
Did you turn off your phone?

230
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,460
You're really not going to reply!

231
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,890
This ahjumma! Are her fingers broken or what?

232
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,880
Doctor?

233
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,000
Ajumma!

234
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,120
Are you carrying your cell phone just for looks?
What is this?!

235
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,370
Why didn't you send even one text or Talk (Kakao) all day?!

236
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:50,740
If you act like this, what's the difference between us not
dating and right now? You're supposed to like me more!

237
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,130
Tell me!

238
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,690
I sent you a ton of (Kakao) Talk messages,
but why didn't you send me even one?

239
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,890
Why are you so mad?

240
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,340
I was busy because of work.

241
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,470
Oh, really?

242
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,840
Am I more important or is work more important?

243
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,800
Why are you asking those type of questions?

244
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:19,720
Doctor, my mom's visitation times at the hospital are designated, so I'll call you later.

245
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,330
Ajumma! Ajumma!

246
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,690
Gosh!

247
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,960
President!

248
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,950
The one in charge of Lee Kang Joon contacted us.

249
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,290
Lee Kang Joon has been released.

250
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,980
What?!

251
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,910
Lee Kang Joon.

252
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,870
He'll start to suspect who reported him.

253
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,520
Ahjumma.

254
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,140
It's really cold outside. Mother, I'll bring a blanket.

255
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,070
Wait a minute!

256
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,930
Doctor, I'm at the hospital and
it seems like a man is following me.

257
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,360
He's wearing a black coat.

258
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,490
That man...

259
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,640
He's the one who kidnapped me.

260
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,610
It's okay, you won't be dragged there again.

261
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,730
I was also sent by Lee Kang Joon.

262
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,600
Tell this to Lee Kang Joon:

263
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,540
"From now on, I'll be sticking to Sara
twenty-four hours straight."

264
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,050
If you get caught again, it won't end like this. Got it?

265
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,820
You're the one who saved me last time, right?

266
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,840
Thank you.

267
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:52,230
Ahhh, the one who helped you escape
from the hospital? It was him?

268
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,980
How is it that you always save us like this?

269
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,920
But, what kind of relationship do you two have?

270
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,070
Ah, yes.

271
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,180
I'm Sara's manager.

272
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,390
Don't worry about bad men. I'll be there to save you.

273
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,190
- He knows that I sent you?
- Yes.

274
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,090
And at the hospital where Sara was,

275
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,170
your former mother-in-law was there.

276
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,830
What did you say?

277
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,630
I'm not going to leave the man
who kidnapped you alone.

278
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,300
If he gets caught, I'll scratch him.

279
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,530
Mother, I told you not to worry.

280
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,570
It's not that, but

281
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,720
- I'm worried about Sara.
- What about her?

282
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,310
When she was hugging me, it felt, how should I say,

283
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,530
familiar.

284
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,330
Her fragrance seemed familiar

285
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,170
and I can't forget that feeling.

286
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,670
I keep thinking of her.

287
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,750
Here.

288
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,290
For today,

289
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,330
thank you.

290
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,290
What did you do all morning?

291
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,450
Why didn't you answer your phone?!

292
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,190
I already told you.

293
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,590
- Birth of a Chef
- That Birth of a Chef show!

294
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,490
- Why are you so angry?
- It's because I feel so wronged!

295
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,350
I'm the only one to call you all day long. And,

296
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,170
all day, I don't get one (Kakao) Talk
reply. So, I feel wronged, okay?!

297
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,290
You're angry because of that?

298
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,740
Yeah, both of us look really good
on the first day of dating...

299
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,860
That's a relief. It's better for us to look good
like this than be worse off.

300
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,130
Hey, it's eating broadcast star, Sara!

301
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,400
Can we take a picture?

302
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,330
Of course.

303
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,490
One more?

304
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,560
She doesn't know the danger she's in and just so casual...

305
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,010
Let's take a selfie.

306
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,680
Ajumma, there might be the guy
that Lee Kang Joon sent out there.

307
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

308
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,320
Hello.

309
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:48,570
I am Manager Kim from J Planning.

310
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,240
- J Planning...
It's an advertising company.

311
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,270
Soon, I would like a meeting with you.

312
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,150
I'm her manager.

313
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,850
You're really going to be my manager?

314
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,820
I think being a manager is good.

315
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,510
I think I'll have to be your forceful manager.

316
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,810
I'll make money while I'm your manager

317
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:19,150
and I can stay by you 24-7,
while controlling all your activities.

318
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,050
I should check it out.

319
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:24,690
From now on, I'm your manager. The forceful manager!

320
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,340
I am requesting ownership change
of the Canvas Building to my name.

321
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:41,190
This is Lee Kang joon's personal stamp and here is
the ownership document, as well as other documents.

322
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,610
As soon as the ownership changes,
I am thinking of selling the building.

323
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,850
Since I have to sell the building discreetly,
you look into it.

324
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,570
Yes.

325
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:06,360
Min Hyuk, they say that the lawyer that we attached to the old bat has been fired.

326
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,170
Han Tae Hee is trying to take your grandmother
out of prison.

327
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,970
The side that has the old woman will look like the real grandson.

328
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,250
The directors (of the board) will probably side with him.

329
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,950
What do we do if Han Tae Hee makes
a move before us, Min Hyeuk?

330
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,610
If that happens, we'll have to stab him from behind.

331
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,670
Tell Lee Kang Joon to come.

332
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,960
Han Tae Hee ...

333
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,170
is the heir to Winner?

334
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,550
Just what the heck were you doing?

335
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,430
Your wife knew about Han Tae Hee.

336
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,890
Disregard everything else for now.
We need Grandmother.

337
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,730
Kang Joon, the thing that you have to do
is to obtain Grandmother's release.

338
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,280
Then, in front of the prison, I will greet Grandmother
and pretend that I am a nice grandson.

339
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:06,200
During that time, you gather the people saying that
I am the one to revive the Winner Group, as the new CEO.

340
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,420
Chae Yeon!

341
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,730
Chae Yeon! Chae Yeon! Hey!

342
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,930
Where did Chae Yeon go?

343
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,170
What? What about Chae Yeon?
Is she causing more problems?

344
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,190
What is it again? Hearing her name makes me scared.

345
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,290
Chae Yeon is trying to make the Canvas Building hers,

346
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,630
so she requested ownership change.

347
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,640
What? Chae Yeon is trying to make the building hers?

348
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,000
Yes, honey! I got a text message
from the property registry saying

349
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,910
they wanted to confirm the ownership change of the Canvas Building.

350
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:48,310
Chae Yeon has gone crazy over the building.

351
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:52,160
That bit*h!

352
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,270
Chae Yeon did?

353
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,520
Yes, I understand, Father.

354
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,760
Come home immediately.

355
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,290
Self-defense?

356
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,120
From now on, we'll be learning self-defense methods.

357
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,890
You are a person who will be making a lot of money,
so you must not be hurt in any way.

358
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,230
The first stance...

359
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,830
Listen carefully.

360
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,830
Some man approaches you . . .

361
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,830
Like this, and

362
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,290
looks at you.

363
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,170
And says, "Ajumma, you're really pretty."

364
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,290
Then he grabs your wrist. What are you going to do?

365
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:58,070
Your hand has been caught.
What are you going to do?

366
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,860
Are you hurt?

367
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,650
So why would you try to teach me self-defense moves?

368
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,590
I even competed nationally as a judo participant.

369
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,010
Ajumma!

370
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,150
You still need to learn!

371
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,530
We're going to do more?

372
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,510
Of course.

373
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,450
I'll try a different scenario.

374
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,290
This time, a man

375
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:34,090
approaches you from the side
and attacks you from up front.

376
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,370
Like this. He grabs you like this.

377
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,910
Like this. He's putting you in danger—

378
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,610
I can just head-bump him.

379
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,310
Ajumma! You put a lot of emotion (strength) into that blow!

380
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,290
That was a soft one!

381
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:51,340
So, stop it.

382
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,340
Wait, no.

383
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,360
This time, an attack from behind . . .

384
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,390
This time, the bad man

385
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:03,890
attacks you from behind.
Now what are you going to do?

386
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,390
He hugs you tightly and...

387
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:20,600
Timing and Subtitles brought to you

388
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,910
If he does this, what are you going to do?

389
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,930
Do you know this too?

390
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,510
If you know, then do it.

391
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:37,480
No. With this... I'm not sure what to do.

392
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,350
Oh, really?

393
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,430
Then, what if that bad man hugs you tighter and

394
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,630
chokes you.

395
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,790
Really?

396
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,790
Then, what do I do?

397
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,460
Well...

398
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,830
Oh, if it turns out like this, then

399
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,240
it's a big problem.

400
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,960
I know.

401
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,340
You stole my identification seal?!

402
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,250
All I have to do is ask for a correction,
then your efforts will have been in vain.

403
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,650
Without my consent, transfer of the building
will never happen.

404
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,300
You got hit? By Tae Hee?

405
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,920
Where are you going?

406
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,350
I'm going to check myself into a hospital.

407
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:11,910
To keep the Canvas Building, I'll use any means.

408
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,430
Although, I do have the intention to negotiate.

409
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,860
If you give me the building,
I'll give you some information.

410
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,870
You like Sara, but you are suspicious of her,
which is driving you crazy.

411
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,170
I'll resolve your dilemma about Sara.
So, let's come to terms.

412
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,330
You want to exchange some information for a building?

413
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,180
Because the information has that kind of worth . . .

414
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:46,180
I got the Canvas building after I married Sa Geum Ran.

415
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:51,160
Do you think I'll give eight year's worth of work
and effort away to you?

416
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,660
If you're going to be like that, then it's war.

417
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:09,340
You're going to be my forceful manager today also?

418
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,990
Today, I'm going to invest in you.

419
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:17,450
I'll give you greatly and receive it back with words.

420
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,870
I like it.

421
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,490
Okay. Next.

422
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,400
I really like it.

423
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,130
You're pretty.

424
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,820
I like this one.

425
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,390
Ajumma, you're really pretty. Beautiful!

426
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,050
Yes, that. Next. Go.

427
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,500
Go already!

428
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:04,930
♫ Was the sky so blue?
Even when I watch a sad movie, I laugh ♫

429
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:10,070
♫ A woman who is petite and smiles often ♫

430
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:14,180
♫ A woman who is more attractive without make-up ♫

431
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,630
- It's Sara, look.
- She's really pretty.

432
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,860
Look at her!

433
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,520
What are you going to do with all these clothes?

434
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,310
It's your first appearance tomorrow as Chef.

435
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:29,810
You have to wear your best and be the envy of women!

436
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,590
There's more.

437
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,010
How much is this?

438
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,260
I don't need to have a car.

439
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,700
Every celebrity needs a car.

440
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,150
Which one is the best-selling car?

441
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,380
This one.

442
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,750
- Here.
- Okay.

443
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,680
What is this?

444
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,280
When that woman goes to the restroom,
make the payment into installments.

445
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,610
Oh, this guy.

446
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,490
Can you really do all of this for me?

447
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,560
Don't you think you invested too much?

448
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,210
From now on, I want you to make a lot of money. Okay?

449
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,700
Alright, alright.

450
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,880
It stopped.

451
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,230
I didn't step on the break.

452
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:04,140
I chose a car that stops on its own, just for you.

453
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,920
Ajumma . . .

454
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,360
It's because you have trauma from the prior car accident.

455
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,780
Whatever I do, I do it completely! I'm like this!

456
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,090
Doctor,

457
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,800
there is a place I want to visit. Can you come with me?

458
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,340
Where is it? Tell me! As your manager, I'll go!

459
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,630
Wait . . . But,

460
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,270
why did we come here?

461
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:41,240
People viewed me as a pitiful woman
when I was Sa Geum Ran.

462
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,930
Since I was always insecure,

463
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,590
I want to show you my confident side.

464
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,810
I'm allowed to do that, right?

465
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:51,280
Yes, of course.

466
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,880
Shall we go shopping?

467
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,470
What?

468
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,250
Yeah.

469
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,160
Okay, let's go.

470
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,000
He looks so handsome!

471
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,530
He's my man!

472
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,850
Hello.

473
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:16,130
Oh my goodness. He looks really handsome.

474
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,210
- You must be really happy.
- Thank you.

475
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,370
I'm not alone this time! I came with someone!

476
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,640
- Hello.
- You're really good looking.
Yes, thank you.

477
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,450
The peanuts are good today. Give him some peanuts.

478
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,510
Well, I'm allergic to peanuts.

479
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,600
I'm sorry. I hope you sell a lot.

480
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,630
This way, this way.

481
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,150
Hello!

482
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,690
Welcome.

483
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,620
Oh, this looks good.

484
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,290
Today, the sea worms (spoon worms) are really fresh.

485
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,980
Buy some.

486
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,560
The sea worm are really nice, Ajummoni.
Give me some mussels and

487
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,190
some mackerel and cod, but give me
the cod innards separately.

488
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,540
Okay, good. How much worth do you want?

489
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,560
Ten dollars worth.

490
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,930
Hello. Oh!

491
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,850
Today's pig's head is the best!

492
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,250
This...

493
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,840
President. This...

494
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,360
Here. Here. Here.

495
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,230
How much is it? I'll buy it.

496
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,130
Stop it.

497
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,120
It's been a long time, you. Really!

498
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,650
Are you that happy?

499
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:53,760
Yes, I'm happy. I'm really happy.

500
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,610
Whenever they asked where was my husband or
why I was alone, I always wanted to hide in a rat hole.

501
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,310
Now, I feel I can run!

502
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:05,520
This kind of day can happen to me.
I feel so vindicated!

503
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,880
Give them to me.

504
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,240
Ah, I smell like fish.

505
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,360
I stepped forward because I wanted to help Ajumma,

506
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,730
but seeing how she likes it, I feel better.

507
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,820
Ahjumma.

508
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,820
Yes?

509
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,870
I'm happy since you're smiling.

510
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,390
Yeah, Ji Hoon.

511
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,270
Alright, I'll be there.

512
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,120
Is there a problem?

513
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,790
Chae Yeon is facing some problems.

514
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,740
I was really scared.

515
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:29,100
Lee Kang Joon, this bastard.

516
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,130
I'll go meet him.

517
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,630
Don't do that.

518
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,890
When your father passed away,
I made a promise to him on his deathbed.

519
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,450
I would protect you and Ji Hoon.

520
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,630
I just can't let it go if you're getting hit.

521
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,710
It's a problem between me and Kang Joon.

522
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,910
But at this moment,

523
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,380
I don't want to go home.

524
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,270
For now, let's go to Ji Hoon's house.

525
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,880
I want to go somewhere Kang Joon doesn't know about.

526
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,350
Let's go to the place where we went often

527
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,350
when we were younger.

528
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:16,200
If we go there, I think I'll feel better.

529
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,380
Chae Yeon wants to go there?

530
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,360
Alright, Tae Hee. I'll be there.

531
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,860
Ji Hoon Oppa,

532
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:57,350
I just want to be with Tae Hee Oppa today.
Don't worry too much.

533
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,480
Let me lean on you and rest my eyes.

534
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,860
Chae Yeon must have some problem.

535
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:38,860
Chae Yeon, I'm glad to see you
since it's been years, but

536
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,880
you don't look too good.

537
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,640
I'm glad to see Tae Hee, too.

538
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,970
Even though you're busy, visit from time to time.

539
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,700
Thank you.

540
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,600
Ji Hoon is very late.

541
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,620
I got a text message from him.

542
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,320
He said he had a lot of work at the hospital.

543
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:54,770
It felt okay to be by myself in the past.

544
00:44:54,770 --> 00:45:01,420
After I got to like him, I feel lonely when I'm by myself.

545
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,740
Why isn't he coming home?

546
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,520
Another person took these photos.

547
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,950
She was with the man all day. They seemed close.

548
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,980
The man's face is there.

549
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,770
Han Tae Hee?

550
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,220
Where is Sara right now?

551
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,330
She's home alone.

552
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,860
Seriously, where is he? He said that
he'd be by my side 24/7.

553
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:58,670
He came, he came.

554
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:03,260
What is it? You have the keys, so why the joke?

555
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:11,450
You said you were my manager,
so is it okay for you to leave me?

556
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,710
It's Lee Kang Joon.

557
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,530
Porch view

558
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,840
Aren't you going to open the door?

559
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,860
Open door.

560
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,850
What happened?

561
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:33,460
When did he come out of the prison?

562
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,550
It's been a long time.

563
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,400
Didn't you miss me?

564
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,590
Ahjumma.

565
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,610
I need to go.

566
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:14,870
I'll call Ji Hoon or Team Manager Choi at least.

567
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,510
Oppa, don't go.

568
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,310
I regret it.

569
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,360
That I married and didn't listen to you.

570
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,450
If I send you away, then I'll regret it again.

571
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,120
So please stay with me.

572
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,660
I'm sorry for not knowing your feelings for me sooner.

573
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,500
I want to be protected by you!

574
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,900
Accept me, Oppa.

575
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,170
You never thought of me as more than as a brother.

576
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,320
Getting married to Kang Joon was a stupid decision.

577
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,240
Instead, thanks to you, I realized what true love is.

578
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,210
I want to be with you.

579
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,430
I...

580
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,680
have someone else.

581
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,140
It's because you didn't have me.

582
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,690
- It's not so.
- Oppa, you have Broken Heart Syndrome.

583
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:26,340
The only person who can stop that is me.

584
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,280
We need each other.

585
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,930
It's not like that anymore.

586
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:36,130
Then, is it Sara?

587
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:43,660
Say it's not! She was only a substitute for me!

588
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,420
I'll call Ji Hoon.

589
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,090
Tae Hee Oppa!

590
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,080
Have some, Kang Joon.

591
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,100
I have something to ask.

592
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,550
I was only thinking about you for the past few days.

593
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:43,900
When you said you loved me,

594
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,740
is that the truth?

595
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,690
Of course, it's the truth.

596
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,890
Why?

597
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,240
I'm not sure.

598
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:16,200
I just wanted to ask you.

599
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,430
Someone must have come.

600
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,950
Who is it?

601
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:58,860
Please move the furniture in front
of your house. People can't get by.

602
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:03,870
That's weird. I never put furniture in front of my house.

603
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,990
Kang Joon.

604
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:13,700
I'm going out for a minute.

605
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,930
Doctor.

606
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:53,620
Aigoo, why isn't this ahjumma answering her phone?

607
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,110
- Yes?
- You're Sara's manager, right?

608
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:04,330
A casting request for Sara came in.

609
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,950
I'll text you the content information.

610
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:11,980
Sara said that in order to protect the man she loves,
she needed to be strong.

611
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,760
That really touched me.

612
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,200
In order to protect...

613
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,710
the man she loves?

614
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:27,180
No. I have to do this by myself. By myself.

615
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:31,480
There's an important reason why
I'm accepting the chef challenge.

616
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,450
Ahjumma!

617
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,060
What is this?

618
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:35,410
I'm sorry.

619
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,200
I'm sorry.

620
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:42,210
What did you do to me?

621
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,020
What is this?

622
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,470
Ahjumma! Ahjumma!

623
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:54,320
Are you okay? You're not hurt?!

624
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,260
I'm okay.

625
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,220
Han Tae Hee.

626
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,850
Sara.

627
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,820
What is it?

628
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,890
I have something to say.

629
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:17,570
I have something to say about Sara.

630
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:30,560
Lee Kang Joon finally saw us together.

631
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:35,420
What will he do this time? I can't even imagine it.

632
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,640
Don't worry.

633
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:49,390
You're not alone this time. I'm going to be at your side.

634
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:04,540
Yes, Team Leader Choi.

635
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:08,960
President, there's big trouble! General Manager
Han Min Hyeok's side has made a move.

636
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,930
Han Min Hyeok has released your grandmother
and plans to bring her home.

637
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,320
The reporters are also here right now.

638
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,740
What?

639
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:23,190
Alright.

640
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,890
Why? What happened?

641
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:32,190
That bastard is going to take Grandmother.

642
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,640
What?

643
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,990
You said that he's the person
who put Grandmother in prison!

644
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:39,290
We can't just do nothing.

645
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,960
I'm going to have to go.

646
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,370
- She's coming.
 - She's coming outside.

647
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:47,520
Chairman, is there anything you want to say?

648
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,590
Please say just one thing!

649
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:54,000
- Look this way, Chairwoman.
- Look over here!

650
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,850
How do you feel about coming out?

651
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,680
Just say one thing!

652
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,970
You...

653
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:03,340
I'll bring you home.

654
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,570
There are reporters here to take pictures of us.

655
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,740
I'm not going...

656
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:12,480
Look over this way!

657
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:19,430
If you're not quiet, not only for illegal slush fund investigation,

658
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:23,620
it can be reported as falsifying records.

659
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:26,940
There's nothing good that will come of that.

660
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,370
You bastard!

661
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:45,250
- What about Grandmother?
- It was almost as if she were practically dragged off to Sewoondang.

662
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,680
If you go to Sewoondang now,
you should be able to meet them.

663
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,380
I have to go. I can't send Grandmother to that bastard.

664
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,760
Let's go together. I'll go with you.

665
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,350
No, it might be dangerous. Don't come.

666
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:00,920
It will be quick. Go wait at home.

667
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,680
I'll request you to take care of Sara.

668
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,760
You should go inside, Mother.

669
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,850
There's no reason that I have to stay with you!

670
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:29,800
You like prison better?

671
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,970
You terrible wretches.

672
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,760
Escort the elder inside.

673
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,020
Yes.

674
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,400
Let go of me.

675
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,130
Grandmother!

676
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,050
Han Min Hyeok.

677
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:19,380
There's nothing you can do right now.

678
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:23,730
Don't make a fuss and leave.

679
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,260
What about Grandmother?

680
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,970
I was one step too late.

681
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,060
We can bring her back.

682
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:03,000
Let's figure out a method together.

683
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,880
I'll be by your side.

684
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:34,480
What a long day.

685
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:40,110
Acting as a manager, you also went to your childhood home.

686
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:45,310
The problem with Lee Kang Joon
and even your grandmother.

687
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:47,680
Of course it was a long day.

688
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:55,220
Starting tomorrow, there will probably be
a great number of things that will come at us.

689
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:58,350
Don't you have to conserve your body a bit?

690
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:02,900
Running over and running into things, don't do that.

691
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:07,880
But...

692
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:16,200
If I feel like something dangerous
will happen to you, I'll still come running.

693
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:22,760
Alright. I'll run too.

694
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:32,420
But why didn't you tell me that
Lee Kang Joon was released?

695
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,260
I don't want you to be afraid.

696
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:45,940
I wanted to protect you.

697
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:54,340
That's why you taught me self-defense
martial arts and even bought me a car?

698
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,670
Since there are times that I'm not at your side also.

699
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:09,180
Earlier there was a call from the producer in charge.

700
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:13,210
The reason you stepped forward to work

701
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:19,390
was to protect the man you love.

702
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:28,630
I have something I want to hear from you, Ahjumma.

703
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:34,010
I don't want to hear it from the producer in charge first.

704
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,350
What is it?

705
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:43,270
The word that starts with the letter "L."

706
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:55,130
What words start with the letter "L"?

707
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,630
Lord?

708
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:04,760
Hurry up and tell me.

709
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,590
Lady Sa Geum Ran?

710
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,810
No.

711
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,110
You know.

712
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:25,810
What I want to hear.

713
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:45,310
I can't even imagine what things will happen tomorrow.

714
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:53,280
To love someone again is a fearful thing for me.

715
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:59,200
But if it's you...

716
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,640
I love you.

717
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:09,330
♫  My heart feels like it's opened up some,  ♫

718
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:15,680
♫  Nothing is fun,  ♫

719
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:23,170
♫  My every single day without you, I couldn't know  ♫

720
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:27,650
♫  that it would be this hard,  ♫

721
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:33,650
♫  I must have liked you very much,  ♫

722
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:40,360
♫  I must have loved you very much,  ♫

723
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,390
- Say ah.
- Ah.

724
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,870
Hello, I'm chef challenger, Sara.

725
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:51,710
Because that you're going to challenge for
'Birth of a Chef' is so pathetic.

726
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:55,000
If you like Han Tae Hee so much,
you should divorce first and then call.

727
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,840
It can't just be a coincidence.
An eavesdropping device?

728
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,980
Hello Grandmother
I'm Tae Hee's younger sister

729
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,290
- Did you propose or not?
- Propose?

730
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:05,700
To Sa Geum Ran, who had a failed marriage,
marriage is never

731
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,850
something you can just talk or laugh about.
