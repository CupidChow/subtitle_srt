00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,810
Episode 13

2
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,120
I love you Ajumma.

3
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,350
I'm going to grow old waiting for you.
Hurry up and come, Ajumma.

4
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,550
I'm already in the parking lot.
So, I'll be there soon.

5
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,850
Is my peanut allergy starting?

6
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,130
Sa Geum Ran is alive?

7
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,370
Is that right?

8
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,870
Tell me. Is Sa Geum Ran alive?

9
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,480
Answer me!

10
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,920
Why are you asking me? I don't know.

11
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,000
Chae Yeon, she asked me about the
peanut allergy and then, left.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,500
Something happened at the studio
during the recording, right?

13
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,620
Ask Gyo Chae Yeon directly.
Why are you doing this to me?

14
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,130
Tell me! Is Sa Geum Ran alive?

15
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,320
Answer me!

16
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,290
Tell me!

17
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,570
Why are you like this?

18
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,540
A J M

19
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,930
I love you, Ajumma

20
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,840
The phone is turned off.
You are being connected to voicemail...

21
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,400
Why is her phone turned off?

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,940
She clearly said that she was coming.

23
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,930
It's going in the opposite direction.

24
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,570
Team Leader Choi. There's somewhere that
you have to go with me. Hurry and come.

25
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,130
Wake up. Wake up.

26
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,490
Wake up I say!

27
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,970
Are you so certain about it?

28
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,180
Did Sa Geum Ran really have a peanut allergy?!

29
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,330
Could it be an allergy? Sara, who are you?

30
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,630
Kim Deok Soon.

31
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,880
Kim Deok Soon.

32
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,260
What are you doing here at this time?

33
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,170
The broadcast finished early. I was thinking to have
a cup of coffee at your house before I go.

34
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,520
If you finished early, you should go right to your in-law's house.

35
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,670
To whom would that be good?

36
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,840
Aren't you trying to make up with Brother-in-law?

37
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,740
I'm not the problem, Oppa.

38
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,310
Kang Joon has fallen hard for that woman, Sara.

39
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,490
Even now, he'll probably be busy due to her.

40
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,200
Sara has collapsed.
Does she perhaps have a peanut allergy?

41
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,450
Does this have any relation to Sa Geum Ran?
Tell me before I explode.

42
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,670
Sara collapsed?

43
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,420
Look, Kang Joon says that he's with Sara in a hotel room.

44
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,650
Oppa, you're going to become the witness
at the scene of Sara and Lee Kang Joon's affair.

45
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,090
If you turn right, we'll be there.

46
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,110
Oh, it's the Lyle Hotel.

47
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,820
Hotel?!

48
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,010
Did this woman come to the hotel, by any chance?

49
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,600
Can you tell me the last name of the guest?

50
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,040
Could you connect me to Lee Kang Joon's room 1815.

51
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,810
Tae Hyung Hyung.

52
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,700
Lee Kang Joon is here?

53
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,520
Hyung, how is it that you are here?

54
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,800
1815, Lee Kang Joon is connected.

55
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,450
1815.

56
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,360
Hyung Tae Hee!

57
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,420
I never called you.

58
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,540
What have you done to Sara?!

59
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,980
What are you imagining?
Sara and I are in a dating relationship.

60
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,100
Close your mouth!

61
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,760
Are you okay?

62
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,210
Can't you hear me?

63
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,830
Hurry up and leave. We still have things to talk about.

64
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,980
I've endured as much as I'm going to.

65
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,560
Jealousy? You must be jealous.

66
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,980
The one who Sara loves is me. You're second.

67
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,380
Do you really want to die?!

68
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,370
Hyung, Hyung. What's this about?

69
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,260
Hyung Tae Hee.

70
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,660
Hyung Tae Hee.

71
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,130
Talk to me.

72
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,630
That woman . . . You said that she's the woman
who ruined Chae Yeon's marriage.

73
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,360
Isn't it enough that she's a woman who could be
reported for adultery, but your choice is that woman?

74
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,100
- How can that be, Hyung?!
- She's the woman that I love.

75
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,710
I'm going to act as if I never heard what you said today.
Be careful with your words next time.

76
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,550
Oppa Tae Hee came to the hotel?

77
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,320
Is the woman that Hyung Tae Hee loves . . . Sara?

78
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,120
Why is it that woman of all people?

79
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,740
How do you know that Oppa Tae Hee loves that woman?
Who did you hear it from?

80
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,340
I heard it from Han Tae Hee Hyung, himself.

81
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,550
You have to dissuade Oppa Tae Hee. Even more right now.

82
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,730
Even more now? What are you talking about?

83
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,770
Oppa Tae Hee is the successor of Winner Group.

84
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,740
Does it make sense for a woman, such as Sara,
to be right for him?

85
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,240
Why did you follow him to a hotel?

86
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,070
Why did you follow him, and why is your cell phone turned off?

87
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,520
Did you turn off your cell phone thinking I'd bother you?

88
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,910
Did you deal with Lee Kang Joon alone thinking
that you'd take care of it as you saw fit?

89
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,880
Didn't you collapse after overdoing it; dealing with him?

90
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,370
It's not that I followed him and dealt with him.

91
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,010
He suddenly appeared in the parking lot.

92
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,870
Because of Lee Kang Joon, you're having a hard time
and my being one step late too late.

93
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,990
This isn't the first time! Every time there's a problem
with Lee Kang Joon, you do this!

94
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,220
Let's talk next time.

95
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,970
That's your answer? Is it that no matter how hard I try,
I can't wedge myself in when it comes to Lee Kang Joon?

96
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,310
For people who were once a married couple,
is the wall this high?

97
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,900
How can you make that kind of comparison?

98
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,490
I feel like it is comparable.

99
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,100
You chose Lee Kang Joon as your marriage partner.

100
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,330
Ajumma, that you liked him to death is because you loved him to death!

101
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,300
Isn't it that the heart you have for me can't be more than that?!

102
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,670
No matter how I cherish you, I'm always after Lee Kang Joon, right?

103
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,410
Even if I love you, Lee Kang Joon is first. Even if I swear
an oath to you, Lee Kang Joon is first!

104
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,520
I know that it's a comparison that doesn't make sense and a bewildering jealousy. I also know that it's a problem with no solution

105
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,840
And, I'm angry at myself to make this kind of comparison.

106
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:54,030
Right now, I dislike you more than Lee Kang Joon.

107
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,460
Get out.

108
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,010
I'm going to leave!

109
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,640
I regret everything that I was going to do for you today!

110
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,570
What in the world?

111
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,350
Kang Joon, what happened to your face?

112
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,830
Who did this to you?!

113
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,390
Did you fight with someone?
Or did someone hit you?

114
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,250
Oh my gosh. That must hurt!

115
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,460
I'm going upstairs.

116
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,850
Ever since that daughter-in-law came to this house,
everything's a mess!

117
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,590
Wait a minute.

118
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,250
Why isn't Chae Yeon here?

119
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,330
Hey!

120
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,430
Do you think this house is a boarding house?

121
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,150
- This house is your in-law's house!
- Let's talk later.

122
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,970
I have something to talk about with Kang Joon.

123
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,930
Omo. Oh my....

124
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,670
Did she just rudely go upstairs
without apologizing to me?

125
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,750
Is she really my daughter-in-law?

126
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,270
What in the world...
Is this for real?

127
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,250
I'm finally getting punished for chasing out Geum Ran.

128
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,270
Aigoo...aigoo...

129
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,050
What are those two doing?

130
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,030
It smells pretty fishy to me.

131
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,290
Do you want to eavesdrop a bit?

132
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,890
Oh, let's do that!

133
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,290
Did you fight with Oppa Tae Hee?

134
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,350
What are you doing right now?

135
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,370
Sa Geum Ran... peanut allergy...

136
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,290
I need to find out what it is.

137
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,150
If Sa Geum Ran is still alive,
I'm going to have to confirm it myself.

138
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,030
Geum Ran might be alive?

139
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,630
Hey, how could the dead Geum Ran be alive?

140
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,610
Oppa definitely said
that he has to confirm if she's alive.

141
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,900
Chae Yeon even confirmed with us
that Geum Ran was allergic to peanuts.

142
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,560
What's actually happening?

143
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,210
Geum Ran. Is she actually alive?

144
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:24,330
What are you saying?
Geum Ran is alive?

145
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,270
This was your first time preparing for a proposal.

146
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,430
But, you couldn't even show her.

147
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,050
Ajumma's love is bullsh*t.

148
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,190
So what?

149
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,260
I'm saying that we shouldn't trash it.

150
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,110
You can always use it next time.

151
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,950
I'm guessing you're going to
propose again.

152
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,680
Trash all of it!

153
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,220
Alright, I'll trash it right away.

154
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,010
Wait.

155
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:04,350
Good job!
I'll trash the necktie too.

156
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,410
Right now, I hate you more
than Lee Kang Joon.

157
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:47,450
Timing and Subtitles brought to you

158
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,090
So she's not going to prepare breakfast?

159
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,790
Did you think
I'd ask for breakfast?

160
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,550
Aish...

161
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,530
Still, it's my first time going to work
as Winner Group's CEO.

162
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,930
On such an important day,
it looks like I'll be going to work alone.

163
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,870
Honey, it's been a while. Congratulations on your marriage...

164
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,280
It's a handwritten letter.

165
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,340
Sa Geum Ran wrote that.

166
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,420
She was missing, but I got that letter.

167
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,690
That woman is Sa Geum Ran.

168
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,170
Find the fingerprints in that letter.

169
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,620
This is Sa Geum Ran's journal.

170
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,310
Check the handwriting to see if

171
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,280
Sa Geum Ran wrote the letter.

172
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,430
I understand.

173
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,690
Sa Geum Ran.

174
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:10,440
I guess I'll know if you're alive, if I check.

175
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,520
If the person who wrote that letter

176
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,530
is really Sa Geum Ran, what are you going to do?

177
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,570
What are you going to do if Sa Geum Ran is actually alive?

178
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,350
That woman . . .

179
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,610
She'll have to die again.

180
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,710
If so, then I have no need to stop you.

181
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,150
It's been a long time since you've looked cool.

182
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,210
Winner Food's assets, financial statements, manpower issues,

183
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,410
the true outlook of the dealer situation, and
even the business related contracts for next year.

184
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,260
Bring it all to me.

185
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,080
Oh, and by the way, Han Min Hyeok applying
for bankruptcy to dispose of the company,

186
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,670
how far has it progressed?

187
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,570
They're waiting for the adjudication of the bankruptcy.

188
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,050
The unions are striking and there's no CEO/Director.

189
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,220
The workers are looking for a new place to work.

190
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,410
In one word, it's the 'pits'.

191
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,430
We'll probably have an office, right?

192
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,490
It's on the ninth floor. But that room...

193
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:51,650
Wow. Your're the first group
of people that I meet on my first day.

194
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,150
Huh?

195
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,210
We must not have just an ordinary fate.

196
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,670
Once the courthouse notifies us of the bankruptcy,
it's the end for the company.

197
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,550
What can you do in a month?

198
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,350
If one uses ones head, everything works out.

199
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,690
Oh right.

200
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,030
Is Grandmother doing well?

201
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,110
Please tell her that I'll be visiting her soon.

202
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,300
My office is located on the ninth floor of this building.

203
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,550
Let's see each other often, General Manager Han.

204
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,300
Even if it's a small affiliate, I'm still a CEO/Director.
And, you're just a general manager.

205
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,840
Since I'm in a higher position than you, I'll speak informally.

206
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,510
Let's see each other often.

207
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,810
The Winner Foods labor union is digging in its heels, right?

208
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,790
They are the most rigid.

209
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,790
Make an appointment with the chairperson of the
labor union. I'm going to have to pull him to my side.

210
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,070
Hey, what's all this?

211
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,990
They're the discontinued instant food stock.

212
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,690
There's no one buying it and there's nowhere
appropriate to throw it away.

213
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,220
So, they said that they stored it all here.

214
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,870
Although this is the CEO/Director's office,

215
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,270
it's basically a storage room.

216
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,330
Are you telling me to work here?

217
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,590
Let's sit here.

218
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,300
Seriously.

219
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,920
Dust!

220
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,870
Oppa Tae Hee, you work here?

221
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,670
Oh, Chae Yeon. Come in.

222
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,170
Give it to Grandmother.

223
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,240
It's for her to use to contact me.

224
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,830
Since she's out on illness bail, she has to be
careful about going outside in the beginning.

225
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,210
I will make a place where you guys can meet very shortly.

226
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,730
Tell her I'm doing my work diligently.

227
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,840
And that I'll visit her soon.

228
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,990
Grandmother likes me.

229
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,510
She says I'm no different than family
since I'm your younger sister.

230
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,290
You came again?

231
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,050
You work hard.

232
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:18,830
Grandmother said that I have to come for her to eat.

233
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,110
I bought earrings for you.
I think they will suit you well.

234
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,060
Go on.

235
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,310
Welcome, Chae Yeon.

236
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,110
You've gotten even prettier.

237
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:37,640
Grandmother, today Oppa Tae Hee went to work
for the first time at Winner Group's head office.

238
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,130
Although the office was full of dust, he was still strong.

239
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,960
It's not going to be easy, taking over Winner Food.

240
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,200
We struggled for a few years.

241
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,370
He chose to do the hard work on purpose.

242
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,390
It's very like him.

243
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,390
This is porridge that I made myself.

244
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,850
Grandmother.

245
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,250
I have something to discuss with you

246
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,710
about Oppa Tae Hee.

247
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,670
What is it?

248
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,190
He is dating a woman.

249
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,690
And, she has a problem.

250
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,030
Sara?

251
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,680
So you know? You might have noticed then.

252
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,160
Sara is actually...

253
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,860
It's difficult to tell you.

254
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:41,990
It feels bad to say things about
the woman whom Oppa loves.

255
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,970
What is it? Tell me.

256
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,910
To be honest, Sara

257
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,910
is meeting another man

258
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,860
behind Oppa's back.

259
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,880
What?!

260
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,410
Winner Food.

261
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:03,050
Last year's sales losses were 1st quarter, $500,000,
2nd quarter, $300,000,

262
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:07,350
3rd quarter, $500,000, 4th quarter, $800,000!

263
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,470
They were all deficits.

264
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,900
The business losses have continued for three years in a row.

265
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,000
And, it's a situation where damages from the affiliate companies
are spilling over, so bankruptcy has been requested.

266
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,980
This ajumma...

267
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,300
She sent me out without breakfast and now
there's not even one contact?

268
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,930
Let's say that she didn't prepare breakfast, but it's time for her to have come to the broadcast station. She's not even coming to look for me?

269
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:37,260
So I'm already out, am I?
You should see their successful products this time.

270
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,730
This is Winner Food's specialty item last year,
chicken and soy marinated crab rice.

271
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,180
This ajumma... I hate her so much.

272
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,340
But I want to see her. Trying to pretend
nothing is wrong, I can't even do that.

273
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,920
This is driving me nuts.

274
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,020
Aiyoo. That doenjang.
(A pun for a girl who scrimps on essentials unnecessarily.)

275
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,390
Excuse me?

276
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,820
It's not doenjang, it's gejang. 
(Doenjang: bean paste. Gejang: marinated crab.)

277
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,960
Team Leader Choi.

278
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,420
Should we go visit the makeup (green) room?

279
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,280
Let's go sightseeing for celebrities.

280
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,640
Why are you suddenly interested in celebrities
when you never were before?

281
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,700
Oh, by chance is it time for that person to come?

282
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,280
What do you mean that person? No!

283
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,300
What are you talking about. I, seriously...

284
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,420
Hey.

285
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,100
Aigoo, why does it taste like this?

286
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,020
You mean this is the kind of thing
they've been selling all this time?

287
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,260
It tastes bad and makes me feel bad.

288
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,780
This won't do. I have to get a breath of fresh air.

289
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,640
Yes, I got it.

290
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,570
I guess the best place to get a breath of fresh air
is the makeup (green) room?

291
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,540
Aiyoo...

292
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,820
You're so fast and sharp with your senses. Let's go.

293
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,540
Hello, Manager Han.

294
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,700
Is Sara not here yet?

295
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,280
Don't you have to rehearse for the cooking show?

296
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,780
I called to tell her that the show with her win was being
broadcast if she want to watch it, but her phone was turned off.

297
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,780
Did something happen?

298
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,150
Sara is definitely broadcast material.

299
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,650
She's so photogenic.

300
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,380
What is this? How come no one's here?

301
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,080
Did she not come because she's mad?

302
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,380
She's not the type of ajumma to skip
work because she's mad.

303
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,100
Sara, do you like peanuts?

304
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,290
Yes, I do.

305
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,300
Have you tasted what you cooked?

306
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,200
No way.

307
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,770
Ajumma!

308
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,180
President!

309
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:46,940
This ignorant Ajumma. When she has an allergy,
how can she eat peanuts?! She could die like that!

310
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,770
Ajumma!

311
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,400
Ajumma!

312
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,040
Ajumma!

313
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Ajumma!

314
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,460
How is she?

315
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,580
Since I gave her a shot to calm the allergy,
there shouldn't be any major problems.

316
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,600
It seems like she collapsed from the big competition.

317
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,500
She should have been treated earlier.
Why was it so delay?

318
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,570
Walking or activities will be difficult for right now.
She has to rest, no matter what.

319
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,480
It's not easy talking about this type of problem,
but since we're family, I'll tell you.

320
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,360
Sara is not the one.

321
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,020
Hyung, until now, you've lived an abundantly hard and lonely life.

322
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,100
Hyung, choose a woman who can make you happy.

323
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,680
Not one who will make things more complicated or hurt you.

324
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,960
How are Oppa Tae Hee and Sara? Are they doing well?

325
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,640
Even if she went to the hotel with Kang Joon?

326
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,540
Tae Hee Hyung is deeply in love with her.

327
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,510
He didn't know that she collapsed because of her allergy
and he regrets that he misunderstood her.

328
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:01,530
I mean, since he loves her so much, that's
why he must have thought to propose.

329
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,600
Propose? Oppa did?

330
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,860
Are you feeling alright? Do you know who I am?

331
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,800
Did the doctor come?

332
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,950
Yeah. You got a shot for your allergy.

333
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,900
How are you feeling now?

334
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,440
I feel much better.

335
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,110
I should get up now. I have a lot of things to do.

336
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,680
He said that you need to rest.

337
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,780
He said that it will take some time for your muscles to relax.

338
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,740
I'm okay.

339
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:02,480
The second round of the Chef Competition is tomorrow
and there's a lot of housework too. It's a mess.

340
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,120
I need to go to the restaurant as well. I need to get up.

341
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,300
Why is it like this? I have no strength in my legs.

342
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,600
I made a mistake, Ajumma. It's my fault.

343
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,320
I should have taken you to the hospital right away
when I first saw you at the hotel. But,

344
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,910
because I was jealous of Lee Kang Joon,
we ended up fighting.

345
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,750
So, because the treatment was delayed,
you ended up like this.

346
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:46,180
If you want to walk properly, he said
it's going to take a couple of days.

347
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,540
It's going to take a couple of days?

348
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,560
What about housework and the restaurant?

349
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,810
More than that, I absolutely can't miss the cooking competition.

350
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:59,560
I can do it all. I'm the one at fault,
so I'll help you as much as possible.

351
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,820
How will you do everything?
You have to focus on company work.

352
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:08,830
There's a lot of work at the restaurant.
I have to do everything on my own tomorrow.

353
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,620
No.

354
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:17,280
The restaurant is earning money properly and operating very
well. I'm not that greedy, so I told them that that was fine.

355
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,690
And, was it decided the day you were born, such things
as your work versus others' work? I'll just do it all.

356
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,610
Contract

357
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,350
What is this?

358
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:34,620
A temporary contract. I drew up a new one.

359
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:40,580
Ajumma is Party "A." I'm Party "B.

360
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,930
Everything is the same, but only Party "A" and
Party "B" have been switched.

361
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:51,040
From now on, until you've recovered completely
and can walk, Ajumma, you're the supersize Party "A."

362
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,680
I'm the miniscule nano-sized Party "B."

363
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,000
Our relationship has been completely turned around.

364
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Really?

365
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,840
From "Do as I say." to "I do as you say"?

366
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,220
If Sara tells you to live, you live, and
if she tells you to die, you die?

367
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:14,250
Of course. I'll do everything you're in charge of doing.
I'll even cook.

368
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,320
Your lips just need to be okay.

369
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,520
With your mouth, you can order me around
as much as you want.

370
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,660
Oh, blah, blah, blah?

371
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,860
Yeah.

372
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:35,590
Ajumma.
♬  Even without trying to look into the mirror at myself ♬

373
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,230
I'm cleaning.
♬ I can't believe it.♬

374
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,700
♫  I seem like a main heroine of a comic book romance  ♫

375
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,870
♫  I'm so dazzling I can't recognize myself,  ♫

376
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,250
♫ I'm a beautiful girl. ♫

377
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,420
♫  My heart unexplainably fluttering is a first to me. ♫

378
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,650
Clean it meticulously, all the corners.

379
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:00,440
♫ Oh, new world ♫

380
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,580
♫ Oh, new world ♫

381
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:12,940
♫  I want to erase all the dark and sad memories now ♫

382
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,760
♫ Oh, new world ♫

383
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,820
♫ Oh, new world ♫

384
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:27,450
♫ Like a magnet, all eyes follow me ♫

385
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,980
♫ Even knowing but pretending not to, ♫

386
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:39,490
♫ Telling me I'm pretty, giving me gifts,
saying sugar coated things, I'll decline,  ♫

387
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:49,220
♫  It's enough if you keep one heart that doesn't change easily,  ♫

388
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,620
- It's time to cook.
- Yes.

389
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,120
It's good, right?

390
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,180
How is my service?

391
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:10,260
Well, the taste is appropriate. There isn't
any large impression about your service.

392
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,920
What?

393
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,550
Why?

394
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,870
It's nothing. Our supersize Party "A."

395
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,330
Ajumma, eat a lot.

396
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:40,570
If patience is a virtue, there's nothing
in this world that I can't do.

397
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,240
Hello?

398
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,860
We had a rehearsal amongst ourselves, so I'll tell you
the second round theme of tomorrow's chef competition.

399
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,170
The ingredient is beef and the mission is
to cook the world's flashiest beef dish.

400
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,410
It must mean that they'll look at the visual quite a lot, right?

401
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,200
To cook the world's flashiest beef dish.

402
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,800
The other competitors have already started?

403
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,520
Except for me, they said that they've all finished the rehearsal.

404
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,020
It's okay. We can do it!

405
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,550
But I'm not prepared. When are we going to finish everything?

406
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,940
I'll do it then.

407
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,440
You can use me like a servant.

408
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,510
That one! Buy the onions.

409
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,410
The ones in the pack!

410
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,570
- This one?
- Not the four pack!

411
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,370
The eight pack!

412
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,430
- This one.
- Okay.

413
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,790
Okay.

414
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,650
- This one?
- No! The one next to that!

415
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,580
Oh, not these.

416
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,730
The one next to the green onions; the one with roots!

417
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,380
- This one.
- Yeah, yeah! That one.

418
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,110
- This one, right?
- Yeah! That's the fresh one.

419
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:07,420
This ajumma suddenly began to have fun talking informally.

420
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,970
Why? Are you in a bad mood?

421
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:14,090
Of course not. Why are you talking informally now?

422
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,470
That's what I mean.

423
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,390
Daebak!

424
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,810
Next to you. The sweet pumpkin.

425
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,890
That's the last one. Quickly grab it.

426
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,820
Hurry!

427
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,310
Don't let her take it.

428
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,320
This Ajumma.

429
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,120
Hold it tightly.

430
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,030
This is mine.

431
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,850
It's mine.

432
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:51,600
She must be kidding. He grabbed it first.

433
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:57,450
Doctor, throw off that Ajumma!

434
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,750
The cleansing wipes are 1 plus 1!

435
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,510
Where?

436
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,970
You're the best!

437
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,090
Hey, Kang Joon.

438
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,790
What do you mean by Geum Ran? Talk clearly.

439
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,150
Is Geum Ran really alive?

440
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,390
She's not, right?

441
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,530
Noona, why are you uselessly eavesdropping
on other's conversations?

442
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,120
Oh my.

443
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,370
If it's not true, then you should just say so.

444
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,920
Why are you so sensitive?

445
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,260
I need to take this phone call. Please leave.

446
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:06,130
The results of Sa Geum Ran's fingerprints
and handwriting are out.

447
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,730
I need to go out for a moment.

448
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,530
Where?

449
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,990
Results

450
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,850
According to the analysis results,

451
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,390
the handwriting of the letter matches Sa Geum Ran's,

452
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:28,480
and the fingerprints on the letters match Sa Geum Ran's.

453
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,250
Sa Geum Ran

454
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,380
is alive?

455
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,560
Geum Ran?

456
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,850
Kang Joon.

457
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,310
Geum Ran

458
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,160
Geum Ran is alive?

459
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,560
No, she's not. Could that be?

460
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,540
You misheard.

461
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,810
Sa Geum Ran

462
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,730
is alive.

463
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,370
Scoop up the flour.

464
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,410
- This much?
- Yes.

465
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,850
Please taste the fried sweet pumpkin.

466
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,610
Sweet pumpkin.

467
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,040
Here.

468
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,070
It tastes okay.

469
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,570
This is enough for tomorrow' cooking competition, right?

470
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,850
We finished practicing with making the side dishes.

471
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,050
How is it? Are you satisfied?

472
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,110
You're really good at it.

473
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:01,130
If you keep acting like an ajumma,
you'll be really good at it.

474
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,420
Yes, yes. if Super Part A tells me to do it, I should.

475
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,160
Okay, now . . .

476
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,020
Let's start making the world's best, flashiest

477
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,150
beef dish.

478
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,650
Am I not heavy?

479
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,330
Do you call those words?

480
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:28,030
Because of you, I hurt my back and got housewife's eczema.

481
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,190
I have flour on my face, don't I?

482
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,690
My style is crumpled now.

483
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,360
You have flour smudged on your cheek.

484
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,110
Where? Show me.

485
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,030
Here.

486
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,990
Where?

487
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,770
Here.

488
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,130
Where?

489
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,210
Right here.

490
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,130
Oh, it was there.

491
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,340
Ajumma, you being Party "A" is pretty okay.

492
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,370
I was lying about hurting my back.

493
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:16,570
You are totally light. I got rid of all of your fat.

494
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,530
Really?

495
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,390
Ajumma,

496
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,650
when your legs heal, what do you want to do the most?

497
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,110
I want to dance.

498
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,600
I feel suffocated because all I can do is sit down.

499
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,960
You know how to dance?

500
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,380
When would an Ajumma have ever learned to dance?

501
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,790
I just dreamt of it.

502
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,880
When your legs heal, let's dance.

503
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,250
Just us two.

504
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,430
- Really?
- Of course!

505
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,060
Here. Say, "Ahh."

506
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,830
Wow, this is really good.

507
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:10,540
- It's really good!
- Nothing special is in it, but it's still good!

508
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,140
What do you mean Geum Ran is alive?

509
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:22,570
I don't know why I keep hearing that
Geum Ran being alive is possible.

510
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:26,150
They said that there was a text message to Kang Joon as well.

511
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,180
There was that previous criminal complaint too.

512
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,290
Do you know anything else?

513
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,650
I'll go to the broadcasting station with you and

514
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,370
make sure that you can sit down during the broadcast.

515
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,690
Wait.

516
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,230
Huh?

517
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,190
Wait, what?

518
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,390
You're fine.

519
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,070
You said that it was okay to be subjected to Party "A."

520
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,010
I was fine from yesterday afternoon.

521
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,450
Seriously, this ajumma.

522
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,410
It's good if my legs are better.

523
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,140
I'm going to the cooking competition!

524
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,430
Seriously...

525
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,610
Yes, Mother.

526
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,170
It must be disconcerting, right? That Geum Ran might be alive.

527
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,820
But you popped into my mind.

528
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,210
When you rescued me from the hospital,
you said that you knew Geum Ran, right?

529
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,130
Why are you so into helping me?

530
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,990
I ate a meal with Sara here.

531
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,730
I saw Sara

532
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,850
holding the cup the same way as Geum Ran.

533
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,650
Geum Ran

534
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:04,060
often held a cup that way because of the after effects of Judo.

535
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,850
Also, when Sara hugged me,

536
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,930
it felt different.

537
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,370
It was just my feeling and instinct,

538
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:17,150
since I am her mother.

539
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,010
I don't want anything.

540
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,710
I won't be curious as to why

541
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,110
or what happened.

542
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,000
My daughter just needs to be alive.

543
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,540
As long as she is alive,

544
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,420
I will have no regrets, even if I die.

545
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
I feel that you

546
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,120
are helping my daughter.

547
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,560
So I'm asking you.

548
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,360
Is Geum Ran

549
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,120
alive?

550
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,250
Yes.

551
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,110
Thank you.

552
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,610
Thank you.

553
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,430
Your daughter is doing well.

554
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,270
You should come see your daughter today.

555
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,470
I'll take you to see her.

556
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,290
Okay.

557
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:53,200
Timing and Subtitles brought to you

558
00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:01,330
Sara, who was the previous winner and first time challenger,
who holds western food specialist certification and

559
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,920
the five-star Hotel Gatsby's chef, Oh Kyung Hee.

560
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,290
Then why don't the two of you directly introduce your cooking?

561
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,530
I will cook Chopped Steak.

562
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:16,340
I will prepare beef fajitas.

563
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:24,530
Sara, you must have an advantage, having won.

564
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,950
You didn't participate in the cooking rehearsal, right?

565
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,840
I had an situation.

566
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,670
Since you decided on your cooking independently,

567
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:36,240
rather than the other side's Oh Kyung Hee,
who decided through a meeting,

568
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,380
your concept appears to be lacking.

569
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:44,420
I will wait to see if you can collect another win.

570
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:54,300
Then, we'll start cooking now.

571
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,250
Mom.

572
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,030
Geum Ran.

573
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,660
Since she was near, I told her to come by and watch.

574
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,440
Ajumma, fighting.

575
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:13,820
Sara, why are you changing the chopped steak ingredients?

576
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,300
I wanted to try something else.

577
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,390
Please watch over me.

578
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:49,570
Mom and Teacher. Please watch over me.

579
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,270
I'll show you the truth.

580
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,430
The cooking has been completed.

581
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:42,510
What do you thing about the challenger Oh Gwang Hee's beef fajitas?

582
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:46,820
With a pronunced flavor and retaining the beef juice,

583
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,280
it seems like an explosion is created in my mouth.

584
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,140
In being a most flashy beef dish, the visual and colorful texture

585
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,660
has satisfied all the requirements.

586
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,110
It's the best.

587
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,470
Thank you.

588
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:04,390
And now, shall we look at Sara's?

589
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,900
I made beef rice balls.

590
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:18,840
Today's cooking theme was the flashiest beef dish.

591
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,450
What we wanted to see was artistic feel and skill.

592
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:26,080
So, why did you make rice balls?

593
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:33,520
There are people whom I love who have come here.

594
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:39,240
Because of the two of them,
I want to do well and live diligently.

595
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:44,090
With that meaning, the two of them are the reason I live.

596
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,450
Cooking shines the most when you make it for someone.

597
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,410
Rice balls are made by hand.

598
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:04,670
The image isn't flashy, but it's cooking that has the
most body temperature (heart) contained in it.

599
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,360
I've put my sincere heart into them,

600
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:12,540
and I want to give them to my loved ones.

601
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:52,310
Then I will reveal the final results.

602
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,700
A tie?!

603
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,010
It's the first time having a tie on our program.

604
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:02,110
You're going to have another competition next week.

605
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:06,090
I was expecting to be eliminated, but I'm relieved
that I still have a chance.

606
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,220
It's no different than if you had won.

607
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,080
Isn't that right?

608
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,870
There's someone who came to see me,
so I'll see them for a moment and come back.

609
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,760
Okay, go ahead.

610
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,120
Mom. Mom, where are you?

611
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,260
Mom.

612
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:27,410
Sara? I want to introduce you.

613
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,490
You two know each other?

614
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:36,850
I like you, Sara.

615
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:43,000
I wanted to compel you to be my cooking teacher
so I used some influence.

616
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,410
A cooking instructor?

617
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:51,220
The position of Madame's cooking instructor
is a position that everyone covets.

618
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,670
Just say you will do it for now.

619
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:59,390
Since she's also the sponsor of Birth of a Chef, Director Lila.

620
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,500
Yes.

621
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,500
Mother.

622
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,960
Sara.

623
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:08,760
I saw you during your recording.

624
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,650
Your opinion about cooking was touching.

625
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:16,900
- I invited Sara to be our cooking instructor.
- Really?

626
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:22,130
When you eat her food from now on, you should be

627
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,200
thanking me, instead of her.

628
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,000
Okay.

629
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:36,090
Doctor, I'm in the parking lot.

630
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,290
Here.

631
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,630
Wow, Ajumma, you were really cool.

632
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,760
But you know you were a bit reckless, right?
Why suddenly the rice balls?

633
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,180
Anyhow, I can't dissuade you from that ajumma mindset,
where you don't differentiate front and back.

634
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,610
What about my mother?

635
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:06,410
You should meet your daughter.
She would be happy to see you.

636
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,890
I'll watch her from afar.

637
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:14,180
Since she is starting her new life, I don't want to interfere.

638
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,390
I'll quietly watch her.

639
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,150
She left. She said she had something to do.

640
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,330
You can see her next time.

641
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:35,550
Now your legs are all better and at the
cooking competition, it's not a win, but

642
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:39,380
since it's a tie, there's still a chance. So, that's good.

643
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,940
Now, there's only one thing left to do.

644
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,020
What is it?

645
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,570
Dance.

646
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:53,080
One song?

647
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,610
Here?

648
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,710
No.

649
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,290
I'm going to ask you for a dance, officially,

650
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:04,780
at a special place, with special words.

651
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,700
What is that? You're making me nervous and everything.

652
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:14,400
I'm going to say the words that I wasn't able to say to you
four days ago, when I waited alone for you.

653
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:20,850
This time you absolutely won't be able to punk out.
I'm going to make it at a place that you'll have to come.

654
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:27,410
I'll see you at home. I'll finish up some work and go home.

655
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,080
Team Leader Choi.

656
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,860
I found the item to save Winner Food.

657
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,750
What is it?

658
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,870
Rice balls.

659
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,040
Rice balls?

660
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,320
I only found out today that there is love
impressed on these rice balls.

661
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,480
Let's fix the concept and prepare the product.

662
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,200
And Winner Food, let's go declare war.

663
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,330
Doctor! You came?

664
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,130
Is he not here yet?

665
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,020
Yes, PD.

666
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:21,590
Sara, I have good news.

667
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:27,390
Winner Food is going to invest in your rice balls
as their instant product!

668
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,500
Really?

669
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,570
Yes, I got it.

670
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,540
Doctor, there is really good news.

671
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,560
What is it?

672
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,790
Winner Food wants to produce my food!

673
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:57,220
There is a ceremony tomorrow. They are going to
announce my food there. I've been invited.

674
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:03,320
And, the President personally invited me.

675
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,720
He's in a high position.

676
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,520
Um...

677
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:15,730
I'm the owner. I'm the President.

678
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:23,690
Oh, okay, okay.

679
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,920
It's true! I'm really the President!

680
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,140
Okay!

681
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:38,650
Doctor, are you a little upset that I'm doing well?

682
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:42,690
You also have your own restaurant consulting company.

683
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,050
If you try a little more, you can grow that company.

684
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:49,040
I will give you many ideas.

685
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:56,900
Okay then. I bought dresses,
so wear one at the ceremony tomorrow.

686
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:02,880
If you are the main heroine who invented the new product,
you are going to be in the spotlight.

687
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,670
So, you have to look good.

688
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:20,110
Invitation from Winner Food Investor Relations

689
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,200
Winner Food Business Explanation Meeting?

690
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,790
It's Han Tae Hee's declaration of war.

691
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:28,690
Winner Food, which is waiting for adjudication of bankruptcy . . .

692
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:32,990
He's trying to notify people internally that he's reviving it.

693
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,460
Winner Food's labor union is on strike.

694
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,060
Ajudication of the bankruptcy is the day after tomorrow,
but a business explanation meeting?

695
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:43,190
They've already spread promotion
for their new product across the media.

696
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:45,830
They've already chosen their new product?

697
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,900
Hello.

698
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:55,670
To all who came to Winner Group's
future vision business explanation party,

699
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:58,200
I sincerely thank you.

700
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,550
In chosing to focus on the main ideals that
Winner Food was founded upon, and

701
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:08,660
to sincerely communicate with the consumers,

702
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,530
I chose the rice balls of Sara, who was in "Birth of a Chief,"

703
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:15,440
for the rebirth of Winner Food.

704
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:28,370
Where is the event location for Winner Food?

705
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:30,150
I have my invitation.

706
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,240
It's over there.

707
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,540
Wait a moment.

708
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:40,170
This is my first time officially invited to a big event.

709
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,370
Do I look okay?

710
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:44,020
You look beautiful.

711
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,270
Is that right?

712
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:52,260
I'm still nervous. I'm an important part of that event.

713
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:57,890
When one is nervous, the best thing to boost
one's self-esteem is one's makeup.

714
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,020
Shiny, shiny, changed to a luscious lip!

715
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:18,450
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

716
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:26,350
Without any effort, becoming a major stockholder
and leading the company...

717
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,230
You're here? I will escort you over to there.

718
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:35,160
With the sale of a new product and through
management of communication,

719
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,280
we will decrease the total amount of debt dramatically.

720
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,050
Who is Winner Food's President?

721
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:45,570
He invited me, so I want to greet him first.

722
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,290
Is he over there?

723
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,760
No.

724
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:53,860
Is it him?

725
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:58,390
The President is speaking right now. There.

726
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:01,210
And everyone,

727
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:04,140
please give strength to Winner Food.

728
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:11,600
I, Han Tae Hee, will get back your rights to dream.

729
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,900
Here, cheers for Winner Food!

730
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,430
Cheers!

731
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:44,080
Please enjoy the small party that we've planned,
in the remaining time.

732
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,890
Thank you.

733
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,050
Let's go over there.

734
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,920
You styled your hair, and your lips are shiny, as if you put on honey.

735
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,520
You're totally like a Miss Korea.
Who are you trying to look good in front of?

736
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:40,430
You dressed up because there might be good men here.

737
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,990
Why are you prettier than when you normally meet me?

738
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,170
What is this, Doctor?

739
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:55,420
I promised you a dance at a special place, with special words.

740
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,640
You are the President of Winner Food?

741
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,860
I told you yesterday!

742
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:18,160
Shall we dance, Sara?

743
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:27,550
I've never danced before.

744
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:31,970
People are all watching me. What if I embarrass myself?

745
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:36,670
I'm here! Just follow my lead.

746
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:23,820
♫  Countless times, I look at myself in the mirror  ♫

747
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:28,230
♫  I can't believe my reflection  ♫

748
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:32,620
♫  I seem like a main heroine of a romance comic book,
too dazzling for me to recognize,  ♫

749
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,770
♫  I'm a beautiful girl. ♫

750
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:44,360
♫  The unexplainable fluttering heart is a first for me.  ♫

751
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:53,010
♫  Ohh, new world, oh, new world~ ♫

752
01:04:53,010 --> 01:05:01,710
♫  I want to erase all the dark sad memories  ♫

753
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:11,040
♫  Oh new world, oh new world  ♫

754
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,830
Ajumma.

755
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,920
Will you marry me?

756
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,300
What?

757
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:28,120
♫  Oh new world, oh new world  ♫

758
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:34,570
♫  I want to erase all the dark, sad memories  ♫

759
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:37,690
How can you marry Tae Hee?

760
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:40,960
You know that neither Winner Group
nor Tae Hee can be yours.

761
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,500
He even proposed to Sara?

762
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,410
Yes, Grandmother. Sara has
complicated relationships with men.

763
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:48,720
I'm worried for Tae Hee, who can't see it.

764
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,270
Organize a meeting with Sara.
I need to find out the contract between

765
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:53,370
Winner Food's Han Tae Hee and Sara.

766
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:57,090
Kim Deuk Soon didn't have a grandmother with
dementia. The peanut allergy.

767
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,800
That song. Sa Geum Ran!
