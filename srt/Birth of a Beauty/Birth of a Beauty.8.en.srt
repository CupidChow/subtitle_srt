00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,510
Episode 8

2
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,970
But Doctor,

3
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,410
is it possible...You don't like me, right?

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,050
Do ... Do I like you, Ajumma?

5
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,380
Are you delirious? What do you mean, I like you?
What a thing to say.

6
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,200
Comprehensive Analysis of Results?

7
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,280
Han Tae Hee, you ... you are currently loving Sara?

8
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,040
Doctor, you're in love with me?

9
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,000
Really?

10
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,000
Ajumma.

11
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,450
There is something called Alien Hand syndrome.

12
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,970
Alien Hand syndrome?

13
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,510
The right and the left brain do not work together.

14
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,800
So it's a side effect where part of the body
moves on its own.

15
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,180
For example, it's like this. Watch.

16
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:11,860
I'm not trying to move like this now,

17
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,150
but this...

18
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,700
Doesn't it hurt? I didn't hit you, but this hand did.

19
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,070
This is Alien Hand syndrome.

20
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,150
When I was taking the psychological test,

21
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,160
in front of the lie detector, this hand suddenly...like this...

22
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,590
It moved on its own during the test,

23
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,410
so this nonsensical result came out.

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,360
Don't go over there!

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,310
You are neither a woman or man;
just another sex.

26
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,060
You are just an ajumma.

27
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,850
Are you serious?

28
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,250
Yeah, yeah. We are colleagues that
came together for one goal.

29
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,440
That's all! I don't have any feelings towards you.

30
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,990
Why?

31
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,500
Is your pride a little hurt?

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,810
No. It's all right.

33
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,860
You are also neither a man or a woman;
just another sex.

34
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,320
You are just a person I respect.

35
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,230
I, too, have no feelings for you.

36
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,540
Ah, right. Then we are alike, right? Same-same, huh?

37
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,310
Isn't that right?

38
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,110
Go and do your work.

39
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,750
So, you're saying you have Alien Hand syndrome...

40
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,020
That ajumma...

41
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,180
Why did she see it at that moment?

42
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,990
Doctor,

43
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,710
I have to clean.

44
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,930
In case someone would think she weren't an ajumma,

45
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,240
singing a trot . . .

46
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,160
♫  Oh, new world,  ♫

47
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,350
Please pick up your feet.

48
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:11,830
♫  I will now erase all the dark and sad memories.  ♫

49
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,430
♫  Oh, new world  ♫

50
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,820
♫  Oh, new world. I forget.  ♫

51
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,310
♫  Everyone's eyes are following me like a magnet. ♫

52
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,640
♫  Even if I know, I pretend not to know in front of them, I'm beautiful and  ♫

53
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:38,700
♫ I will decline the presents offered here and there and the honeyed speeches.  ♫

54
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:46,800
♫  One heart easily forever is enough for me.  ♫

55
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,480
D ... D ... Don't come here. Don't come over here, I tell you!

56
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,090
What's wrong? You said I'm neither
a man or a woman, just a sexless being.

57
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,770
♫  Oh , new world  ♫

58
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,750
♫  Oh, new world ♫

59
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,750
♫  The darkness- ♫

60
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,940
I was just trying to tease him.

61
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,970
But why do I feel weird?

62
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,820
So why did he piss me off by saying
that I'm neither sex?

63
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,570
Ajumma just insulted me, right?

64
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,470
No one has survived after insulting me, the genius.

65
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,420
Ajumma!

66
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,570
Can you clean this?

67
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,770
Why do you suddenly take off your clothes?

68
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,600
Why? When you were cleaning,
you were flirting with me.

69
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,130
But, I'm not a man to you, right?

70
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,660
So, I'm neither a man nor woman, just a doctor.

71
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,970
Even if that's the case, how can you just undress like this?

72
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,810
Then why are your eyes looking at me?

73
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,940
Get out. Get out, okay?!

74
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,460
Why? You should flirt as well.

75
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,240
Get out. Get out! Oh! Get out!

76
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,180
Get out!

77
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,220
Clean that, okay?

78
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,210
I get it, I get it. Now get out!

79
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,030
How dare she tease me!

80
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,240
I'm the genius, Han Tae Hee.

81
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,660
It's cold. I should turn on the boiler.

82
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,060
What does he think about Korea's ajummas?

83
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,540
My wedding ring...

84
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,060
When I marry him, I'll get it back.

85
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,710
Doctor!

86
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,490
What is it now?

87
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,120
Oh, you are such a child!

88
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,330
I scared you, I scared you, right?!

89
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,220
Don't come at me. I have an athletic club background,

90
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,710
so I'm really fiercely competitive.

91
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,220
This...

92
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,240
Why do you have my wedding ring?

93
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,930
I left it at the pawnshop.

94
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,760
I brought it back.

95
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,220
You said that your wedding ring is valuable.

96
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,810
When I leave, I don't want you to be whining
that somebody else bought it.

97
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,460
Since you are mad at your husband, it has no meaning.

98
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,040
However, you should be the one to get rid of it.

99
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,470
Gyo Chae Yeon, who didn't choose you, is a fool.

100
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,260
Is that right? Why do you think that?

101
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,420
You may sound like you are full of it, like Kim Sun Dal, but

102
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,400
you are sincere inside.

103
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,430
You don't look like it. But actually
you are a warm-hearted person.

104
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,600
How can she deny that kind of person?

105
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,190
Gyo Chae Yeon is a stupid fool.

106
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,060
And what? What are my strengths?

107
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,330
You're really smart. You don't have an empty head.

108
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,790
- And?
- You are good at fighting.

109
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,070
When you punched guys like this,

110
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,460
any woman would fall for you.

111
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,350
Ajumma, you're cool too!

112
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,960
That slap towards Lee Kang Joon...

113
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,780
Most woman would not be able to do it with this stance.

114
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,770
Really?!

115
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,110
I thought you were the woman version of Hwang Bi Yong.

116
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,160
Like this.

117
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,030
Seriously I can never have this stance.

118
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,300
How does a stance like this come out from a woman?

119
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,780
Ajumma, do more; compliment me more.

120
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,840
Doctor, your eyelashes are long, too.

121
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,220
If you look this way, you look melancholy.

122
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,780
Like this?

123
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,040
Yes! Like that, like that!

124
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,010
More, more. Isn't there any more?

125
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,890
Doctor, your lips are sexy too.

126
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,400
Like this... It's totally sexy when you purse your lips!

127
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,870
Like this?

128
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,220
Exactly like that! It's totally sexy!

129
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,200
Ajumma, try an angry glare.

130
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,140
Here?

131
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,350
This is it. This is it. It'll make people go wild.

132
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,690
How?

133
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,140
You know how pretty women are usually weak.

134
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,710
But you are pretty and have this ajumma power.

135
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,970
Your angry glare, along with your pretty face, was

136
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,860
totally attractive; making me go crazy.

137
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,900
Among attractive qualities, that retroflection was such an attractive quality, I discovered for the first time after seeing you.

138
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,840
Your charm is explosive.

139
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,740
Really? How was I at the In-law's
when I stomped on everything?

140
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,770
Oh, it's totally sexy! Completely sexy!
It's crazy, I tell you!

141
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,750
Just like that, glare at me. Action!

142
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,140
It's sexy. You're totally sexy, you naughty ajumma.

143
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,090
You, you, you, ball of charm.

144
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,790
Doctor, I really like this! You're really cool!

145
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,690
The earth's greatest charmer!

146
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:19,080
Doctor, you are the greatest, cutest talker.

147
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,020
It's my husband.

148
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,970
Sara? Today I had to take care of some
difficult matters, so I was tired.

149
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,330
Then, I thought of you, Sara.

150
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,400
What is the difficult matter?

151
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,100
You don't need to know.

152
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,930
I want to cool my head. Shall we go on a date?
Let's go on a drive tomorrow.

153
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,190
A date in the countryside?

154
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,500
OK!

155
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,540
Okay, let's shop together and
prepare the lunch together.

156
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,390
How is it going with Sa Geum Ram's mother?

157
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,340
Just as you instructed, we had her
admitted to the hospital.

158
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,480
What do you mean psychiatric treatment?

159
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,560
Why should I, Doctor ?

160
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,170
I am completely sane.

161
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,960
After you lost your daughter, your mind
and body have become weak.

162
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,590
It's true that my daughter is dead,
but I've no problems.

163
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,770
Who?

164
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,430
Who in the world sent me here? Huh?

165
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,100
It's your son-in-law, Lee Kang Joon's decision.

166
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,660
Since your daughter is no longer here,
your son-in-law is your only guardian.

167
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,860
That bad jerk!

168
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,310
Doctor, allow me to call my daughter's friend.

169
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,460
Your son-in-law asked us to forbid any contacts by you.

170
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,490
Try this, Chae Yeon. Your face doesn't look good.

171
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,960
I am at my family's home,

172
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,430
but none of Kang Joon's family have contacted me.

173
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,900
I'll go and meet with your husband.

174
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,800
If he comes to get you, it will be okay, right?

175
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,220
I heard that he has a woman.

176
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,050
A woman? How long has it been since your wedding?

177
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,770
The woman is not an ordinary person.

178
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,020
But, something about that woman is suspicious.

179
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,770
I think she has something to do with his previous wife.

180
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,760
I have to find out. I'll surely find out.

181
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,090
In the worst case scenario, when Chae Yeon
finds out that we know each other,

182
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,850
not only our relationship,
but your identity may be exposed.

183
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,750
Before that happens, we should
get the confession out of him.

184
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,170
Naturally! Let's finish it on today's date!

185
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,120
The next station is . . .

186
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,880
The House of Ghosts.

187
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,420
The House of Ghosts...

188
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,680
It'll soon be over, Ajumma.

189
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,690
After we put Lee Kang Joon in jail,
we'll be going our separate ways.

190
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,260
Here, drink up.

191
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,640
I told you to stay at the villa. The prosecutor
has a warrant for Grandmother's arrest.

192
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,980
You want me to miss seeing the hag
being taken away by the prosecutor?

193
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,040
I am going to keep my eyes open and watch.

194
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,540
The one who should escape is not me, but the old hag.

195
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,360
Yes. The Madam wants to see you.

196
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:32,990
Min Hyeok, the prosecutors are coming
to look for me. But why on earth?!

197
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,080
HBS has reported on the Cultural Foundation's corruption.

198
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
Since the actual manager of the
Cultural Foundation is you, Grandmother . . .

199
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,140
Are you telling me that the TV news is real ?

200
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,160
The Cultural Foundation was to honor
your dead father and Dong Geul.

201
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,840
We're leading the way in helping people
in difficult straits. You know very well.

202
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,340
The HBS board members don't think so.

203
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,840
HBS is a subsidiary company of Winner's Group, so why?

204
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,930
It's not possibly your doing...
trying to entrap me, right?

205
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,490
So, that's why you took over HBS,

206
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,050
making Lee Kang Joon your right arm,

207
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,090
planting him as the CEO of HBS...

208
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,530
Everything, from the start,
was something you thought of?

209
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,220
- I just can't believe it.
- Min Hyeok?

210
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,760
It's getting late. You should quickly go to work.

211
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,480
Stop doing things that will cost you.

212
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,690
Unless my half brother, your grandson,
Dong Geul (Han Tae Hee) returns,

213
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,670
your destiny lies in my hands.

214
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,050
I'll be leaving now.

215
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,950
Recorder to record Lee Kang Joon's confession.

216
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:23,430
Also, another voice recording device
containing Sa Geum Ran's voice.

217
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,000
Lee Kang Joon's car key to
reenact the accident. His car key...

218
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,200
All right.

219
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,080
Lee Kang Joon, you have to pay for the sins
that you committed against Ajumma.

220
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,680
Lee Kang Joon, today is your last day.

221
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,750
Murderer Lee Kang Joon.This is your judgment.

222
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,950
You are ready to go get Lee Kang Joon, right?

223
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,730
Yes. I'm prepared.

224
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,190
Let's go.

225
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,400
While doing grocery shopping together,
it feels like a married couple.

226
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,880
Kang Joon, you like kiwi, right?

227
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,000
How did you know that I liked kiwis?

228
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,750
Oh, I just wanted to eat it.

229
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,480
We eat similarly. I really like kiwi.

230
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,040
Kang Joon, if we are going for a drive,
how about toward Yangsoori area?

231
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,200
Having a picnic by the water is romantic, isn't it?

232
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,950
If I had known that, I would have
told you to dress warmly.

233
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,190
The air near the river is cold.

234
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,190
After we shop here, I'll buy you some clothing.

235
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,890
A couple look? Like a married couple?

236
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:39,570
No, that as*hole. That player.
Like an ocean seal (having countless mates).

237
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,510
Where is he putting his hands?!

238
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,610
Take those hands off. Get off of Ajumma.
How long ago was it when you killed her?

239
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,860
Where are his hands now?!

240
00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:00,000
Get apart... yaaah... Get apart...

241
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,920
Get apart... get apart... get apart...

242
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,360
While on an important project to get a killer,

243
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,140
am I being jealous right now?
About that ajumma?!

244
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,090
No way, it can't be!

245
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:39,600
I know! It's chivalry, chivalry!

246
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,840
Seeing a killer kiss a victim and such . . .

247
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,390
Without my even knowing,
my sense of chivalry has kicked in.

248
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,530
It was chivalry, chivalry.

249
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,100
The Birth of a Food Broadcast Beauty

250
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,740
The Birth of a Food Broadcast Beauty

251
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,060
How did this happen?

252
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,290
Huh?

253
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,860
This woman.

254
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,990
There are people who claim to have seen her
because her beauty is eye-catching,

255
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,650
but I have not been able to find out her name,
address, or place of employment.

256
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,460
Is that possible, when I saw her at the company twice?

257
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,990
It isn't just us. The broadcasting station
is looking for her as well.

258
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:33,080
She's already become a hot topic. She is so beautiful
that she also has merchandizing value.

259
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,850
I'm sure someone will be able to find her very soon!

260
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,790
No. Find her.

261
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,080
Before anyone, I must find her first.

262
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,790
Yes sir.

263
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,350
What do you think about this, Kang Joon?

264
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,830
Sara, pink suits you.

265
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,730
I'll try it on then.

266
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,110
Sa Geum Ran's cellphone.

267
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,090
Then there's this phone with the cloned number.

268
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,710
If I forward a message from Sa Geum Ran's phone,

269
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,170
you're going to think that your dead wife has returned
from the dead, and then you will pass out, you punk!

270
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,350
Honey, it's me. Sa Geum Ran.

271
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,210
Sa Geum Ran...

272
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,150
The phone number is also hers.

273
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,150
I see that you're with another woman
and not Gyo Chae Yeon.

274
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,490
Is it adultery again?

275
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,950
Kang Joon!

276
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,460
How do I look?

277
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,880
It's not pretty?

278
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,780
Yes, it's pretty.

279
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,130
That woman, Shim Yeo Ok, are you sure
you put her in the hospital?

280
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,070
I just got a threatening text from her.

281
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,800
I understand.

282
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,570
Sa Geum Ran. There is no way that woman is alive.

283
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,830
Who are you? Exactly who are you, I said?!

284
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:22,380
You must be hungry since you are driving.
Shall I give you a walnut cookie?

285
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,760
What's this? It's a ring case.

286
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,060
And there is a picture.

287
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,140
It's a wedding picture of you and some woman.

288
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,760
Wedding rings?

289
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,290
Ajumma!

290
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,770
Sa Geum Ran. Sa Geum Ran is alive.

291
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,880
Are you all right? You look tired.

292
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,760
You should rest.

293
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,630
Kang Joon, it's going to be over for you soon.

294
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,870
Before that, have some rest.

295
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:07,450
Doctor, I'm okay. I'll definitely
get his confession to the murder.

296
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,660
Sorry, this date was such a dud.

297
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,260
It's all right. It happens.

298
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,040
Sara,

299
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,970
when you said you loved me,
you were telling the truth, right?

300
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,180
No matter what, promise me you won't leave me.

301
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,420
Yes, Kang Joon.

302
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,220
Honey, I'm watching you from the car in front of you.

303
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:32,250
The day you killed me ... Do you remember?

304
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,590
Who are you?! I said who are you?!

305
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,890
Who is it? Who is it?!

306
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,630
Come out!

307
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,600
Honey.

308
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,390
It's me.

309
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,080
No way.

310
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,950
It can't be. You're dead.

311
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,360
It's somebody else.

312
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,550
What happened that day,

313
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,720
only the two of us know.

314
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,890
You followed me and passed me.

315
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,750
Then, you turned around to drive towards me.

316
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,310
Is it really,

317
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,960
really you?

318
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,800
Why did you do it?

319
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,880
Was it because of money?

320
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,850
Or was it

321
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,980
because of your happiness?

322
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,380
Oh, yeah!

323
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,100
You were alive?

324
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,890
I'm not afraid.

325
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,770
Do as you wish.

326
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,820
I killed you once. Do you think I can't kill you twice?

327
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,980
Come out.

328
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,770
I'll properly kill you this time.

329
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,860
Come out, I said!

330
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,520
Did you have to go that far?

331
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,910
You know, I am your wife.

332
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,460
Am I not?

333
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,120
Honey.

334
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,420
It is said that even if a beast lives under the same roof
as you for a long time, you'll grow attached to it.

335
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,000
So, how could you?

336
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,730
How?

337
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,540
You were too cruel.

338
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,090
Ajumma, are you okay?

339
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,450
Having hard time with breathing...

340
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,340
It's okay.

341
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,690
Nothing will happen. Breathe slowly.

342
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:41,280
It's okay. It's okay.

343
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,820
It's okay.

344
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,750
Awesome. Such a hot issue. Internet search at #1.

345
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,180
Everyone come here! Hurry!

346
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,140
What is it now that's got you in such a fuss?

347
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,410
There's no way not to fuss!
Be prepared to pass out!

348
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,110
Mom! Dad!

349
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,410
Has war broken out?

350
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,830
What is it?

351
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,360
Sara's become a hot issue.

352
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,660
This unnie is now a star.

353
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,460
It really is Sara.

354
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,840
Oh my, that's right.

355
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,760
Someone took a video of her eating and uploaded it.
Since she eats so well and is so pretty,

356
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,090
the number of hits are crazy.

357
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:51,220
CNN even said pork potato soup, kimbap, blood sausage and ddeokboki represent Korean food,

358
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,130
reporting it on air.

359
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,630
Gyo Chae Yeon

360
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,780
If we get her as a tasting judge on Birth of a Chef,
it would be awesome!

361
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,060
Her nickname is 'Birth of a Beauty'.

362
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,090
Birth of a Beauty?

363
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,050
This is my first time seeing such a beauty.

364
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:10,280
Her face is like a CD size.

365
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,850
Chae Yeon.

366
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,990
Sara, that woman, became a star.

367
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:28,540
The broadcasting station is interested in her.
Our program wants to negotiate with her also!

368
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,750
How can this happen?

369
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,490
How can such an evil event happen?!

370
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,730
You are slowly becoming very sensitive.

371
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,160
This won't do.

372
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,550
Don't be like this here, go back to your in-laws.

373
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,640
What about my pride?

374
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,600
I'll take you back.

375
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,710
Let's make it seem like you couldn't return because of me.

376
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,130
The phone is off...

377
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,100
Mother..

378
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,970
Did something really happen?

379
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,430
The phone is off...

380
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,120
Oh my goodness...

381
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,050
If it hadn't been for Sara, something major
might have happened.

382
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,910
How did Kang Joon faint?

383
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,560
It seemed like someone was stalking him.

384
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,710
Sa Geum Ran. It was that name.

385
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,740
Sa Geum Ran!

386
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,260
Geum Ran!

387
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,160
That's our dead daughter-in-law's name.

388
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,000
Kang Joon said,

389
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,930
"Sa Geum Ran is alive. She is here." He said that.

390
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,830
What is happening here?

391
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,250
Geum Ran is alive?!

392
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:59,100
There's evidence in here that will prove
that Lee Kang Joon is a murderer.

393
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,450
Lee Kang Joon's confession and
other evidence is in there, as well.

394
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,450
Take it to the police at first light!

395
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,320
Yes, I understand.

396
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,440
Elder President, have you been well?

397
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,690
In-law, have you been well?

398
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,880
I am, In-law Bachelor.

399
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,380
It's been a while, Chae Yeon.

400
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,360
Chae Yeon had the flu, so she was very sick.

401
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,850
That's why she is late (in returning).

402
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:54,130
Chae Yeon is flawed in many ways.

403
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:59,540
It is all my fault, so please generously forgive her.

404
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,080
Then, good bye.

405
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,700
Take care, In-law Bachelor.

406
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,580
Yes, go ahead and rest.

407
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,670
Chae Yeon, Sara's ups...

408
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,930
Oh my, did she already go upstairs?

409
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,180
Well, isn't she fast!

410
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,610
Sara's upstairs taking care of Kang Joon.

411
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,660
Chae Yeon's eyes are going to fall out!

412
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,640
Go up and tell her ahead of time.

413
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,860
Let's live quietly, huh?!

414
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,530
Let's leave it alone.

415
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:40,410
She scurried off to be with her family, and has no idea what's happened to her husband! Such a bad daughter-in-law!

416
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,200
What does it matter if she's surprised or not
when she sees Sara?

417
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,970
Did you come?

418
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,990
You crazy...

419
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,080
Do you know where this is that you've entered?

420
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,140
This is my room!

421
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,270
Originally, it wasn't your room.

422
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,680
It was Sa Geum Ran's room.

423
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,750
Soon...

424
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,340
I feel like it'll be my room.

425
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,530
You devilish wench.

426
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,100
Yes.

427
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,640
I came from hell.

428
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:41,720
Bring me fresh water so I can take care of Kang Joon.

429
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,240
You should go ask Mother and Father what's happened here.

430
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,320
Mother? Father?

431
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,150
Who are your mother and father?!

432
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,700
- It must be cold.
- Hey.

433
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,450
It'll only take one finger to catch a wench like you!

434
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,920
Don't even think of attacking me with strength.

435
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,510
Do you understand?

436
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:24,250
Our Kang Joon, I wonder if he'll wake up
since it's so loud.

437
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,080
Open the door! I have something to ask!

438
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,390
I'm going to barge in! Open the door!!

439
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,270
What did you do to Geum Ran's mother?
What did you do?!

440
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,540
You did something to her, didnt you?

441
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,790
Why are you looking for Geum Ran's mother here?

442
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,810
Why are you so fretful all the time
when you can't torment us, huh?!

443
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,390
Wait a minute.

444
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,080
Since when have you not been able to
contact Geum Ran's mother?

445
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,270
Since yesterday. I'm sure something happened!

446
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,220
Oh my!

447
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,610
What is this?

448
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:11,010
How can you let that woman in the room?!

449
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,500
I wasn't away at my family's home for very long!
How could you do this to me?

450
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,220
Oh heavens..

451
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,910
Did you have a fight with Sara?

452
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:23,790
Aigoo, this household is in ruins. It's in ruins!

453
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,030
That seal-like rascal must have brought
another woman in already, right?

454
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:31,720
I don't know who it is, but she did well. You had it
coming since you also chased Geum Ran out!

455
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:36,840
Did you do something to Geum Ran's mother? Huh?

456
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,440
Hey! Where are you going?!
Hand over Geum Ran's mother!

457
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,600
This is not the time to scream!

458
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,020
Let's look for Geum Ran's mother together.

459
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,840
We are not the kind of people to threaten or hurt people!

460
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,690
Mom is?

461
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,970
Hey!

462
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:06,890
What do you mean you cannot reach Mother?
Since when?

463
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,340
Can you tell me with details?

464
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,500
Why are you coming out from there?

465
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,910
Oh, so you're the one playing around with Lee Kang Joon?

466
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:21,450
If you are with that rascal, why should
you worry about Geum Ran's mother?

467
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,540
I'm on Sa Geum Ran's side.

468
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:29,160
What I'm doing is all for Sa Geum Ran.

469
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,360
I will explain everything later. Okay?

470
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,820
It's all for Sa Geum Ran?

471
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,100
It's suspicious.

472
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,100
Sara, you, have something up your sleeve.

473
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,990
With whom did Mother meet yesterday?
Where did she go?

474
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,230
Tell me everything.

475
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,600
Her phone has been off since yesterday,
and this is Mother's journal.

476
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:45,950
Doctor, something has happened,
so I will come home tomorrow morning.

477
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:02,620
Doctor, I cannot reach my mom.

478
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,770
Doctor?

479
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:25,920
Last night could have been the last, so I waited.
But I'm disappointed.

480
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,940
I have something to do, so don't cook for me.
I'm going to meet my relative.

481
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,360
Let's have the goodbye party after I come back.

482
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:41,980
Doctor! Where are you?

483
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,380
I'm here, Elder.

484
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,770
Can we gather a legal team from the Winner Group?

485
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:31,860
Winner Group's legal team is under
Han Min Hyeok, so it'll be dangerous.

486
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,570
Then what can I do? I don't have enough time.

487
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:39,810
We are trying our best to get through this.
For now, don't return to the house.

488
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:43,330
As much as it's inconvenient,
don't you think you should avoid them?

489
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,890
Grandmother...

490
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,110
Dongguel Love Foodtruck

491
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:11,330
Here, Donggeul

492
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,490
Grandma...

493
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:25,240
Grandmother, it's been twenty years.
Nothing's happened, right?

494
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,960
- No.
- Han Man Deok.

495
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,540
Arrest Warrant
- This is a warrant for your arrest, with special circumstances.

496
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,860
Since there is a chance that you will destroy
evidence or flee, I have to arrest you.

497
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:16,160
These rascals. Heaven and earth know
that I did not do anything.

498
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,690
- Arrest her.
- Okay.

499
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,720
Stay still.

500
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,060
No, no!

501
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,420
You rascals! You rascals!

502
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,950
Stay still!

503
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:32,360
Grandmother!

504
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,540
Grandfather...

505
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:27,450
♫  Because you are a person without fear,  ♫

506
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:35,060
♫  Because love always comes before pain ♫

507
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:41,440
♫  Even if all I can do is to look at you,  ♫

508
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:47,460
♫  You are someone whom I can't leave behind  ♫

509
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:54,090
♫  Because I'm useless,  ♫

510
00:51:54,090 --> 00:52:01,790
♫  I risk everything for love  ♫

511
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:08,430
♫  Even if I'm not happy, ♫

512
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:15,220
♫  I will walk to where my heart heads ♫

513
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:22,210
♫  Even if all I can do is to look at you, ♫

514
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:29,120
♫  It's a love in which I can't let go  ♫

515
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,730
Why are you overreacting? I'm okay now.

516
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:36,760
Then, why are you leaning on me if you are okay?

517
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,690
It's because you are clutching me so tightly!

518
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,630
Doctor, if it wasn't for me,
something bad could have happened.

519
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:46,150
You think you can slack off on me?

520
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,810
Slack off on you?

521
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,050
This ajumma...

522
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,340
Okay, okay!

523
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:07,140
Do they live together?

524
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:11,730
Ajumma? Why is Sara . . . Ajumma?

525
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,900
Since I saved you today, help me find my mother.

526
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,640
I can't reach my mother.

527
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,380
Don't worry.

528
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,290
Mom?

529
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:31,100
What do you mean you cannot reach Mother?
Since when?

530
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:36,450
I'm on Sa Geum Ran's side.
What I'm doing is all for Sa Geum Ran.

531
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,130
What is this?

532
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:47,140
Why didn't you tell me that you have a grandmother?

533
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:53,240
Whenever I think about the accident,
I experience Broken Heart syndrome.

534
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,660
From the trauma of the accident,
I cannot meet my grandmother.

535
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:06,150
And my parents wanted me to live
forgetting about my past.

536
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:17,400
I'm telling you so much. Anyhow, today
is the day we say goodbye.

537
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:26,480
Doctor, what are you going to do if you experience Broken Heart syndrome when I'm not around?

538
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,200
You are a problem. If it weren't for me, you
would have collapsed in front of Lee Kang Joon.

539
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,060
You are worse than me. You said that something
major happened to your grandmother.

540
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:41,180
Because of Broken Heart syndrome, you can't even appear in front of your grandmother. What are you going to do?

541
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:47,300
So what do you want me to do?

542
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:54,050
Don't you need me?

543
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,840
Am I the only one? How about your accident trauma?

544
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:05,780
You have to know your mother's current state, but what are you going to do if you faint at an important time?

545
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,850
I need you, too.

546
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:11,520
At least until I find out how my mom's doing.

547
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:19,420
When I get Broken Heart syndrome,
you have to look after me.

548
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:28,340
So what do you want me to do?

549
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:32,900
Well, so...

550
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,890
You need me and

551
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:41,560
I'm saying that I need you. Isn't that so?

552
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,960
So what?

553
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:51,580
So, can we delay our parting?

554
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,770
That's what I'm saying.

555
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,360
That's it?

556
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,160
It seems like it.

557
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:07,500
What's wrong with me?

558
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:12,660
If it wasn't for me, it would have been
perfect for us to say our goodbyes.

559
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,020
Isn't that right?

560
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,350
That's right.

561
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,360
You found that woman?

562
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,160
What is her name and what does she do?

563
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,340
She is a chef and her name is Sara.

564
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,210
This is the restaurant address.

565
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,260
Seoul, Jongno. Hwajeong-dong 11. God of Restaurant.

566
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,670
Geum Ran's friend came by?

567
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,630
Last night,

568
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:55,500
she came here yelling that Geum Ran's
mother can't be contacted.

569
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,330
Is there a curse at our house?
How can you guys fight everyday?

570
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:05,640
Hey, come down to eat something. Then
come back upstairs, okay? Come down quickly.

571
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,300
Eun Gyeong Joo

572
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,130
Gyeong Joo, I'm going to my hometown.

573
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,320
"Gyeong Joo, I'm going to my hometown.
I'm going to go get some air."

574
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,680
Mother!

575
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:54,220
Sara, Geum Ran's mother contacted me.

576
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,060
That's a relief.

577
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,200
I was really worried.

578
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,130
Please keep trying to contact her until you
get to talk to her personally.

579
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:03,070
I'll keep trying also.

580
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,450
Sara!

581
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,380
There's a commotion, a commotion!

582
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,840
What's wrong?

583
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,990
Go quickly.

584
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,930
You are Sara, right? We are from
Cable Channel Hot, can you talk to us?

585
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,790
Sara, I am from men's magazine, Disc.

586
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:42,620
Sara, we are from HBS Cooking Show.
Please come on our show.

587
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,540
Wait a moment!

588
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,950
I'm her manager, so speak to me.

589
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:01,830
♫ I never noticed the sky was so beautiful and blue. ♫

590
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:07,220
♫ Even watching a sad movie, I smile. ♫

591
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:16,830
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you. You're, Oh I'm in love with you, I won't beat around the bush. ♫

592
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,110
This is our third time meeting.

593
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:26,440
♫ The long lonely times must be ending now. ♫

594
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:32,500
♫ We won't separate. Oh happy ending. ♫

595
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,040
Of course, I already predicted it all!

596
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:41,870
You calculated that I would get popular?

597
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:47,080
When I designed you as the greatest beauty
in Asia, I predicted all of these future events!

598
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,300
You're perfect, Ajumma. You're the best!

599
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,630
Where is there a woman who even has a pretty
belly button like you? On top of all this,

600
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,250
even your nostrils are pretty.

601
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:59,110
The Republic of Korea will take notice of my creation.

602
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:01,060
I was sure of it!

603
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,580
But, the broadcasting station...

604
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,660
I never thought about it.

605
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:10,170
What do I do from now on?

606
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,350
Ajumma,

607
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,570
the confession that Lee Kang Joon is a murderer,

608
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:21,330
Sa Geum Ran's cellphone, and the record of her talking to her husband on the day she died,

609
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:24,150
we collected all that evidence and gave it to the police.

610
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,740
We've finished everything that we need to do.

611
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,290
So?

612
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:34,190
Erase Lee Kang Joon and everything in your past completely, and start a new life.

613
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:36,860
You'll be reborn as a completely new person.

614
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,170
I'll make a new identity for you.

615
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:45,130
You'll have a new birthday, a new name, and a new citizen identification number.

616
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:49,020
In any case, since you're dead,
let Sa Geum Ran be dead forever.

617
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:52,430
With a new character, you can have a magnificent life.

618
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:56,770
Like how Edmond Dantes became
the Count of Monte Cristo,

619
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:00,300
throw away Sa Geum Ran, and as a true beauty

620
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,940
live a new life.

621
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:10,800
All those coincidences and bad happenings.

622
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:14,720
It's being done on purpose.

623
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,470
What can it be?

624
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,040
Why?

625
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,380
Since I saved you today, help me find my mother.

626
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,580
I can't contact my mother.

627
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,790
Is it possible...

628
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,030
Min Yeong, it's me. Can you meet with me?

629
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,400
Did Sa Geum Ran have a sister?

630
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,850
Sa Geum Ran?

631
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:03,010
Do you want to know whether
my fat sister-in-law had siblings?

632
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,800
Nope, none.

633
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:09,010
The fat pig is the only daughter.

634
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:12,780
If it's not a sibling, then what can it be.
There really is something.

635
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:17,230
But why is everybody asking about
the dead sister-in-law these days?

636
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:21,110
Oppa says he got a text message
from the dead sister-in-law.

637
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:24,370
That's why he panicked and fainted.

638
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:25,570
What is this then?

639
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:29,770
Then you think that fat one is not dead, but alive?

640
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:34,110
Sa Geum Ran is alive?

641
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,240
Sa Geum Ran is alive?

642
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,310
Sa Geum Ran? Why are you suddenly asking about her?

643
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:42,810
This originally wasn't your room, either.

644
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:44,390
This was Sa Geum Ran's room.

645
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:46,920
Help me find my mother?

646
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,620
Don't worry.

647
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,660
There's no way...

648
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:02,530
What's up now?

649
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:04,790
What's so urgent?

650
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:07,440
Oppa, do you know this woman?

651
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,630
Well.

652
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,000
I don't know.

653
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,810
Then,

654
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,780
what about this woman?

655
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:25,130
Why are you asking about this woman?

656
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,180
How do you know?

657
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,770
Who is this woman?

658
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:35,470
- I don't know what this is about, but I can't tell you.
- It has something to do with Tae Hee Oppa, right?

659
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,630
What is wrong? What's this all about?

660
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:42,410
Where did you see this woman?

661
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:45,990
Tell me, Oppa!

662
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:49,020
She was a patient.

663
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:52,280
Tae Hee Hyung asked me to do it as a favor.
Without leaving a record,

664
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,780
I did reconstructive surgery on her.

665
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,940
Just like how you kicked out Kang Joon's previous wife,

666
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,800
this time

667
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,330
I will kick you out.

668
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:20,140
Because Tae Hee Hyung asked me, I did reconstructive
surgery on her without leaving a record.

669
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:23,500
Yes, I came from hell.

670
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,720
She's alive... she's alive...

671
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,820
Sa Geum Ran.

672
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:34,860
Sara is Sa Geum Ran.

673
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,530
Make Sa Geum Ran a dead person and

674
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:46,670
buy a new identity to live a new life?

675
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:57,250
Sara is...

676
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,390
Sa Geum Ran?

677
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,440
Sara is Sa Geum Ran?
