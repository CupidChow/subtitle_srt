1
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,850
After comparing the two DNA samples,

2
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,000
Sa Geum Ran and Sara

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,530
are the same person.

4
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,930
Where is Sara?

5
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,330
Marry me.

6
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,940
Sa Geum Ran...

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,550
My wife is marrying another man?

8
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,430
As long as this bracelet does not break,

9
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,290
we will never break up.

10
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,690
You picked one that looks very sturdy, Ajumma.

11
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,430
If one wants to break this one, one would
have to be the world's strongest man.

12
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,800
You are in big trouble. You can't ever run away now.

13
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,330
Shall we now, earnestly, prepare full scale?

14
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,060
Our engagement ceremony.

15
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,910
No, we don't have to go the long way. Let's just
prepare for the wedding straight away.

16
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,110
You should answer your phone first.

17
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,430
Later.

18
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,390
You are busy with work. Answer it.

19
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,760
Why?

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,680
Because I like you.

21
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,350
You should hurry up and answer your phone.

22
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,770
Yes, Team Leader Choi.

23
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,290
Grandmother's trial date has been announced?

24
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,880
When is it? Let me talk with Lawyer Park.

25
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,700
Wait a moment.

26
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,420
Yeah.

27
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,710
Why? Are you going to get married?

28
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,110
With Han Tae Hee? But what are you going to do?

29
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,550
You can't without my permission.

30
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,490
Why would I need your permission?

31
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,300
It seems like you have something to say to me.

32
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,950
I just stopped by, Han Tae Hee.

33
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,100
Are you getting married?

34
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,830
It's not something that you should interfere with.

35
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,570
Get out.

36
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,050
Due to Grandmother's matter, HBS Broadcasting's Board of Directors is considering disciplining him and firing him.

37
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,710
If the Board of Director's decision is made I'm thinking of suspending him and even transferring him to the provinces.

38
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,330
I will try anything

39
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,760
to put distance between you and him.

40
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,410
Episode 15

41
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,530
Christmas?

42
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,310
Ajumma, you're going to marry me anyway, right?

43
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,450
Then how about if we marry on Christmas Day?

44
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,280
What?

45
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,330
That's only four days away!

46
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,410
I know!

47
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,830
But if we are married on Christmas,
we'll be happy for three generations.

48
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,590
That is widely known across the whole world.

49
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,670
Does that really exist?

50
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,910
Let's verify. So, let's get married

51
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,670
and see if we are happy for three generations.

52
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,860
Every day, I want you to be my wife as soon as possible.

53
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,260
I don't want to see you afraid
because of Lee Kang Joon anymore.

54
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,330
And there is no reason to delay it anyway.

55
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,930
There will be many things to prepare.

56
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,040
I don't know if it will be possible.

57
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,090
Of course it's possible!

58
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,370
For four days, we just have to
prepare efficiently and with all our strength.

59
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,910
We can make a list of things to do and do it together.

60
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,410
How does that sound?

61
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,940
Okay. Let's do it.

62
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,700
DNA Parentage Test Report

63
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,480
Sa Geum Ran... So you are getting married,

64
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,340
even when I am your husband?

65
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,630
What is it?

66
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,700
Let's meet tomorrow. Just we, two.

67
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,530
I don't have a reason to meet you.

68
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,320
- I have a reason.
- I don't have any.

69
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,370
- I'm hanging up.
- Then I'll go find you myself.

70
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,410
Result of the DNA Test?

71
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,730
Result: Sa Geum Ran and Sara are the same person.

72
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,010
Sara...

73
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,250
is Sa Geum Ran, for certain?

74
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,430
I've been deceived the whole time,

75
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,260
without knowing anything.

76
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,240
Then what do we do?

77
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,150
Sa Geum Ran became Sara to exact revenge from us.

78
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,550
Think of all the things we went through up to now.
Are you just going to let her go?

79
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,030
Since I've discovered such an interesting fact,
I can't just do nothing.

80
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,270
Even if we've been deceived by her this whole time,

81
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,410
now it's my turn.

82
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,890
- You've worked hard.
- Bye.

83
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,310
- We're going.
- Okay.

84
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,370
Honey.

85
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,430
Sa Geum Ran...

86
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,070
It's been a while since I said your name.

87
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,850
What are you saying?

88
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,570
I found a strand of hair in the comb
that Sa Geum Ran had used

89
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,820
and your strand of hair...

90
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,300
I did a DNA test.

91
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,270
Sa Geum Ran and Sara are apparently the same person.

92
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,340
You became very pretty.

93
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,840
That's why I couldn't recognize you.

94
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,940
Deceiving me this entire time,

95
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,930
how fun must it have been?

96
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,790
Were you happy that my family

97
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,910
and I were deceived?

98
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,540
Having deceived everyone in the world,

99
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,230
you are even going to marry another man?

100
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,650
You can't do that.

101
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,700
You are still

102
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,880
my wife.

103
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,090
Sara, I want to make some color revisions. Would it
be alright to discuss it with you before I go?

104
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,430
Do you have time?

105
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,600
So...

106
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,700
What kind of food do you want to recommend?

107
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,940
Honey...

108
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,360
You are still my wife.

109
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,450
Here!

110
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,510
My mission list.

111
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,730
Where is yours? We have to combine them.

112
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,450
Here you go.

113
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,340
Shop together.

114
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,910
Take a selfie together.

115
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,980
Now that I see it, there isn't a picture
that we've taken together.

116
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,860
- That's right.
- Because we're always together,

117
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,750
we never had to take a picture to look at again.

118
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,310
Okay! Let's take one.

119
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,830
The next one...

120
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,830
Wedding Oath

121
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,270
Wedding oath?

122
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,440
Oh, you are very sensitive.

123
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,650
Here.

124
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,790
Doctor,

125
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,890
Can we delay

126
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,490
our wedding a bit?

127
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,290
- Just a little.
- Why?

128
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,040
- Did something happen?
- No.

129
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,650
It just seems like we don't have enough time.

130
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:20,360
That's why in this kind of situation,
you have to look to your soon-to-be husband.

131
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,790
Since there are things that we both want,
let's solve them one by one.

132
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,500
Wait and see! I will accomplish everything!

133
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,020
The next one...

134
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,410
He likes it this much...

135
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,220
Here.

136
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,480
Here you go.

137
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,380
- Doctor, you should wear one!
- Me too?

138
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,580
Here you go. So pretty.

139
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,980
Then we got the concept, Christmas and Santa.

140
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,380
So, let's do the first wish on the list.

141
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,160
Selfie?

142
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,080
Here. One, two, three!

143
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,370
♫  It seems like my heart is empty ♫

144
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,070
Ddukbooki and Fish Cake

145
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,400
♫  Nothing is fun anymore  ♫

146
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,440
Open your mouth!

147
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,740
♫  I never knew that every day without you  ♫

148
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,190
♫  Will be this hard  ♫

149
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:45,250
♫  I must have liked you a lot  ♫

150
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,930
♫  If it hurts as much as me,  ♫

151
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,630
A date on the street. Okay.

152
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,770
Date on the street.

153
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,910
♫  Without you,  ♫

154
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,570
Here, and the next one!

155
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,040
Getting the wedding dress and tuxedo ready.

156
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,790
How can we pick the wedding dress?
We are getting married abroad.

157
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,910
I will do it myself. I can just carry it onto the plane.

158
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,490
Our soon-to-be bride is ready to be presented.

159
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,080
I've had this one Christmas wish for a long time.

160
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,710
What was it?

161
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,270
A wish to spend Christmas with my family.

162
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,030
Now, that wish is fulfilled.

163
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,280
Now, that I can marry this pretty bride.

164
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,550
So, is that why you wanted to
get married on Christmas?

165
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,240
Groom, would you like to try on your tuxedo?

166
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,550
It's my turn. I'll be back.

167
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,980
Soon-to-be bride, it's your phone.

168
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,520
Lee Kang Joon

169
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,090
Wedding dress?

170
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,410
My wife is trying on a wedding dress
to marry another man.

171
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,820
It feels like I've been abandoned.

172
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,290
Don't be too happy.

173
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,240
Because you two can never get married.

174
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,720
Did something happen?

175
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,280
You seem tired. You should go home first and rest.

176
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,660
I will do one of the items on the wish list
and then, come home.

177
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,070
Are you coming home late?

178
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,930
No. I'll be there soon. One hour.

179
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,650
Ajumma!

180
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,860
It's cold! Why are you outside?

181
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,750
It's been longer than one hour! What is this?

182
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,340
This? It's a Christmas tree.

183
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:17,260
It was on your wish list.
It's cold. Let's go in.

184
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,250
What is this card?

185
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,840
You can't open this yet.

186
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,230
My wish is written there.

187
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,380
If you light up the tree after hanging up
your wish, then, your wish will come true!

188
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,860
If I do this, all of my wishes will be fulfilled!

189
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,950
This is all your wishes?

190
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,560
You're so greedy.

191
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,280
What's wrong with that? It's not like the police are
going to arrest me for having too many wishes.

192
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,350
Are any of my wishes written in there?

193
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,910
There is one.

194
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,430
Here!

195
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,940
What is this?

196
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,710
Who does it resemble?

197
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,960
It looks like you.

198
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,120
That's right. A 'Worry Doll'
that worries in your stead.

199
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,370
Indians put a doll next to the heads of

200
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,390
children who can't sleep because they are afraid.

201
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:44,740
I saw you worry about me not being around,
like at the wedding shop.

202
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,530
They say that women, who are about to marry,
are worried about many things.

203
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,410
But from now on, you should let this
'Worry Doll' do the worrying for you.

204
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,800
So, you should relax.

205
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,820
Here. Turn on the light now.

206
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,410
You are going to marry Han Tae Hee?

207
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,290
Don't be too happy.

208
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,540
Because you two can never get married.

209
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,090
Why of all times does it have to be now?

210
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,250
I'm not Sa Geum Ran who let herself be hurt
without any resistance.

211
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,480
I am not going to be hurt from now on. Never.

212
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,830
It's me.

213
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,160
It's late. Why are you calling me?

214
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,740
Stop stalking me. If you have something to say,
meet me and say it.

215
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,210
Your attitude has changed.

216
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,050
Have you come to wanting to see me?

217
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,620
I will tell you the time and place. Tomorrow,

218
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,820
I will determine the meeting time and the meeting place.

219
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,200
You just have to follow my decision.
You are quivering with fear anyway.

220
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,570
Why do I have to quiver with fear?

221
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,290
You deceived people in this world, you swindler.

222
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,540
You are a murderer.

223
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,370
It's not murder.

224
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,060
You're very alive.

225
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,630
I did not commit any sin.

226
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,600
You're confident.

227
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,850
So you don't care if people find out everything?

228
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,210
Fine, then.

229
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,320
Kang Joon, you'll have to come home.

230
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,370
A guest came to the house.

231
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,530
Guest?

232
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,920
Sara came.

233
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,100
She said she has something to say
when you come home.

234
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,220
Kang Joon was arrested, without a warrant,
in connection to Sa Geum Ran's murder investigation.

235
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,910
Arrested without a warrant?

236
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:18,800
Please excuse my discourtesy,
but I thought you ought to know.

237
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,470
Kang Joon killed Geum Ran?

238
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,880
Who said that?

239
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,480
What is this bolt of lighting out of the blue?

240
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,500
I feel nauseous.

241
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,870
Have you confirmed that, Sara?

242
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,370
This is something that can kill someone!

243
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,510
Why are you staying still, Honey?
Say something!

244
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,490
Did you already know?

245
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,700
Kang Joon!

246
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,100
Kang Joon, what is she talking about?

247
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,410
- You killing Geum Ran?
Is there ground for this kind of talk?

248
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,560
Hold on. Last time, you said that
Sa Geum Ran could be alive.

249
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,120
That's right, I remember!
If Sister-in-law Piggy is still alive,

250
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,610
then, why are you being investigated for murder?

251
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,380
Oh, my word. Oh, my word.

252
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,000
What is going on here?

253
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,940
Geum Ran is alive, or dead?

254
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,120
Did she commit suicide?

255
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,950
What exactly is going on?

256
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,770
Someone, with malicious intentions, filed a report.
I'm being framed.

257
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,530
You don't have to worry.

258
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,080
Sara,

259
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,860
let's talk for a moment.

260
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,100
What are you doing now?

261
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,780
This is just the beginning.

262
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,400
You wanted to get rid of your wife of eight years,
so you tried to kill her.

263
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,460
Why do I have to suffer and be chased
by a person like that?

264
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,910
I can't do that.

265
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,890
- So?
- You wrote the suicide note and took my building.

266
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,300
Your family should know what you've done.

267
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:19,130
You're their pride, but what would your father
say if he know about all this?

268
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:25,890
You were first to say that you would expose
and ruin me, so I can't just stay still, right?

269
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,080
This house and the building are all mine.

270
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,520
You and your family will probably be
thrown out on the streets.

271
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,440
Think hard.

272
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,030
Between you and me, who would be more ruined.

273
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,780
Sa Geum Ran.

274
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,770
You're not the Sa Geum Ran that I knew.

275
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,070
It wasn't just your face that has changed.

276
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,120
The pushover wife you knew is gone.

277
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,950
Watch your back. I won't make
the same mistake twice.

278
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,180
What did Sara say to your family?

279
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:36,180
Ajumma! Are you sleeping?

280
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,780
That's weird.

281
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,080
It's almost 11pm. Where did she go?

282
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,350
Doctor! Doctor!

283
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,520
If you're going somewhere,
you should tell me! I was worried!

284
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,360
Doctor!

285
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,670
I feel much lighter now!

286
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,920
I feel refreshed.

287
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,560
Where did you go?

288
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,040
Ah...

289
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,610
Did you go to the washroom?

290
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,950
Sure, let's say that.

291
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,070
That's why I feel refreshed.

292
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,390
I got it, I got it.

293
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,260
I don't know what you did, but good job.

294
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,530
Ajumma. I like these excessive displays of affection.

295
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,920
Ta-da!

296
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,880
D-2?

297
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,020
The wedding?

298
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,670
Yeah.

299
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:02,260
The day after tomorrow, we will be husband and wife.

300
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,560
You can't believe it, right?

301
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,290
I can't believe it and I'm nervous.

302
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,890
Why? Are you afraid something will happen?

303
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,270
Truthfully, I wonder

304
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:20,160
if it's okay to marry you, Doctor.

305
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,230
Why?

306
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,480
Because I'm a fake.

307
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,080
Everyone thinks I'm a great beauty,

308
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,020
but I'm just a plastic surgery beauty.

309
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,600
My identity is a fake too.

310
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,700
Can I live the rest of my life like that?

311
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,890
If I have a child, how much could I tell him/her?

312
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,550
These thoughts keep clouding my head.

313
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,270
Ajumma, you're not a fake.

314
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,080
Your exterior may have changed, but the inner
Sa Geum Ran is still the same.

315
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,460
I completely understand Sa Geum Ran.

316
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm marrying you because of your sincerity.

317
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,690
Ajumma is real.

318
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,970
It's alright if I know Ajumma is real.

319
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,280
Winner Group/HBS

320
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,050
PD-nim, tomorrow is the last filming of the year, right?

321
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,300
That's right, then we have Christmas and the year end.

322
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,860
Why? Are you going somewhere?

323
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,500
I have to go abroad for something.

324
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,690
Seems like a good thing.

325
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,880
Oh! You have a ring!

326
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,040
Engagement?

327
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,440
Chae Yeon! Do you have plans for Christmas?

328
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,190
Sara is going abroad. Seems like she has
something good going on.

329
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,790
Abroad?

330
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,530
What is it?

331
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,200
It's a private matter.

332
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,080
You can get the feeling right away from just looking.
She's wearing a ring.

333
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,440
So an engagement trip, or even getting married?

334
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,790
Since you're a celebrity, marrying abroad
is good because of privacy.

335
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,050
She's going abroad for Christmas?

336
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:38,190
A person living with a fake identity is so bold.

337
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,110
You don't know anything?

338
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,370
I saw her trying on wedding dresses.

339
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,610
Wedding dresses?

340
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,980
Oppa Ji Hoon, I have a favor to ask.

341
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,340
Find out Oppa Tae Hee's schedule for the year end.

342
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,710
I already talked to him.

343
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,970
I asked him to spend Christmas together,
but he said he's going abroad.

344
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,750
It sounded like he'll be abroad for a while.

345
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,560
Oppa Tae Hee is also going abroad.

346
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,850
It seems like those two will marry abroad on Christmas.

347
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,520
Sa Geum Ran, my life has been ruined because of you.

348
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,350
You'll take Oppa Tae Hee
and be happy by yourself?

349
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,860
You think that's possible?

350
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,250
These are the business plans for
Winner Food's new products.

351
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,150
These are the ingredients for the rice balls
that were introduced on Birth of a Chef.

352
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,610
It's also the new product Winner Food will develop.

353
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,750
If the labor union ends the strike, and you come back to work, we can start working on the new product immediately.

354
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,910
Please believe me, just once.

355
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,580
I will do my best too.

356
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,870
Please help us in developing this new product.

357
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,230
Ta-da!

358
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,240
They're plane tickets. You only need to
board the day after tomorrow.

359
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,960
So soon after we decided to marry,
from east to west...

360
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,740
Things are happening so fast.

361
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,110
Will we be able to board this plane?

362
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:44,180
Don't worry. We'll have a happy
ending the day after tomorrow.

363
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,660
It's time to go to the wedding shop.
Are you coming too?

364
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,040
It's an opportunity to see you wearing a wedding
dress again, so of course I have to go with you!

365
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,680
Excuse me, President.

366
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,770
Can I borrow Sara for an hour?

367
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,600
It's related to the contract for Birth of a Chef.

368
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,130
Okay.

369
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,690
Just one hour!

370
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,200
Yes.

371
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,920
I'll go first, so take your time and come.

372
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,040
Strategic Planning Office?

373
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:34,060
They say that your working with Winner Food
is a breach of contract with

374
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,950
Winner Group and HBS.

375
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,250
Breach of contract? Then,
can I not work with Winner Food?

376
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,990
We'll have to hear the situation first.

377
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,250
And, the person you're meeting now is the
General Manager of Strategic Planning.

378
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,220
He's the second largest shareholder of Winner Group.
He's the heavy weight of heavy weights.

379
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,320
Yes.

380
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,050
Oh!

381
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,150
General Manager of Strategic Planning?

382
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,030
Is this someone you know?

383
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,340
Sit down first.

384
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,780
I wanted to make you the main model of Winner Group.

385
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,190
But the main model of Winner Group is Gyo Chae Yeon.

386
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:37,410
It's been Gyo Chae Yeon for three years.
So, it's about time to change to a new face.

387
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,420
Working with Sara is against the regulations?

388
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,720
Who said that?

389
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,800
General Manager, Han Min Hyeok.

390
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,750
Doctor!

391
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,810
Winner Group's General Manager of
Strategic Planning is Hang Min Hyeok, but

392
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,360
it's the same person who was
my number one fan all this time.

393
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,080
The one who followed you home and
brought you a bouquet of flowers?

394
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,740
I'm also his mother's cooking teacher.

395
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,770
Han Min Hyeok.

396
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:23,770
Han Tae Hee can't use Sara's cooking
for Winner Food's new item.

397
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,820
The only thing left is the warehouse.

398
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,300
Why hasn't the decision for closure not come down yet?

399
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,420
The labor union is still holding onto hope.

400
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,270
Do they think Han Tae Hee will be
able to do something?

401
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:38,110
It seems like their hope is on
developing the new item.

402
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:45,170
I'll do away with that hope.

403
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:55,240
General Manager Han Min Hyeok
is your half-brother?!

404
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,140
He's risking his life to interfere with my work.

405
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,420
We have the worst of the worst fates.

406
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,830
He's going to use you as
Winner Group's main model?

407
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,540
Who does he dare to aspire to?

408
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,380
Hey.

409
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,250
They say that General Manager Han Min Hyeok
went to the Winner Food warehouse.

410
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,250
It has been several days since the order to
move out the materials from the warehouse.

411
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,400
Why haven't you made a decision yet?

412
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,440
If CEO Han Tae Hee can launch
a new product, isn't there hope?

413
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,640
I saw the business contract.

414
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,700
CEO Han is working diligently.

415
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,720
There is no new product release.

416
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,610
I'm concerned about you all and I'm trying to
make sure you get some severance money.

417
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,970
You shouldn't let go of this opportunity.

418
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,360
That's true.

419
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,480
You shouldn't let go of this opportunity.

420
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,090
Representative Han.

421
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,350
Look at this.

422
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:08,560
The one blocking the new item release,
so Winner Food will go bankrupt is Han Min Hyeok.

423
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,200
Certified Request for Injunction Prohibiting Wrongful Acts

424
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:14,670
And he's standing here acting as if
he's concerned for all of you.

425
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,250
Shall I tell you the reason why?

426
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:22,160
Very soon, there will be a General Shareholders Meeting.
At that meeting, Winner Group

427
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,340
will appoint the CEO/Director.
The candidates will be Han Min Hyeok

428
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,650
and me, Han Tae Hee.
It will boil down to the two of us.

429
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,830
General Manager Han Min Hyeok, in order to
undermine my management capabilities,

430
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,510
is trying to use you guys, right now.

431
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,480
I'm a person that has to save Winner Food
in order to survive.

432
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,080
General Manager Han Min Hyeok
needs it to die in order to live.

433
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,240
If you trust in Han Tae Hee's words
and the bankruptcy is adjudicated,

434
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,950
you won't be able to get any severance money.

435
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,390
Then who will take responsibility?

436
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,390
This person, here?

437
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,950
I have put in my everything for Winner Group.

438
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,120
Right now it's rough, but the potential will grow larger.

439
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,920
It's because I will do my sincere best.

440
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,360
I will also do my best.

441
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,230
I will continue to invent delicious food.

442
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,170
The person who will save the company...

443
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,700
The person who will kill the company...

444
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,200
Who is everyone going to choose?

445
00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:00,930
We, in order to save the company, are thinking
that we have to do something.

446
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,120
Bring those boxes back inside.

447
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,350
-Let's start again!
-Yes!

448
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,630
Thank you.

449
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,360
Thank you, everyone!

450
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,980
President, President!

451
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,500
Are you okay?

452
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,470
Also, Han Min Hyeok,

453
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,950
that happened to me too. It's no big deal.

454
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,140
All you have to do is dust off your shoulders
and leave it at the dry cleaners.

455
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,810
That's why a noble person like you
shouldn't come to a place like this.

456
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,580
Ah, what is this.

457
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,920
Turmoil between Winner Group's two heirs

458
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,670
Winner Group heir Han Tae Hee was alive!

459
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,040
This is such a humiliation for
President Han Min Hyeok.

460
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,570
Isn't it too much?
I know, right?
"Got flour Min

461
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,330
'M H' hit by flour

462
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,700
It looks like it'll get interesting in the future.

463
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,630
Who would have thought that
Han Min Hyeok would fall like this?

464
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,370
Exactly.

465
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,500
This is such a humiliation for
General Manager Han Min Hyeok

466
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,460
CEO Han Tae Hee totally won.

467
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,290
-You got this yourself?
- Madam.

468
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,700
Turmoil between Winner Group's two heirs

469
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,880
Turmoil between Winner Group's two heirs?

470
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,130
Just thinking about that jerk getting hit by flour

471
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,690
makes me feel so refreshed.

472
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,270
The picture spread all over the internet.

473
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,700
It says we're in a triangle relationship.

474
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,760
Winner Group's heirs, Han Min Hyeok,
Han Tae Hee and Sara in a triangle relationship?

475
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,470
A triangle relationship with me
and Han Min Hyeok?

476
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,670
The quality of our faces are different!
Triangle relationship, whatever.

477
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,670
Will Han Min Hyeok be fine?

478
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,760
What if the relationship between you
and Han Min Hyeok worsens?

479
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,280
It tells the Doctor's story as well; that a
Crown Prince, thought to be dead, came back.

480
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,780
It bothers me that the situation might get bigger.

481
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,620
I feel bad that these things are happening
when our marriage is so near, but

482
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,600
don't let it get to you. Also, me returning to Winner Group

483
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,210
was something that would have happened, anyway.

484
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,730
Is that the life span of these lights?

485
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:40,530
You and Han Tae Hee, battling as heirs,
would've been exposed anyway.

486
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,570
Not a scar like this.

487
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,190
On top of that,

488
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,250
in front of the woman I like.

489
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,840
Everything can't be solved with drinking.

490
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,100
Mother,

491
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,170
I...

492
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,930
As I went through the Winner Group
chemical factory explosion at fifteen years old,

493
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,230
I'd already become resolute.

494
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,440
I won't be shaken by this.

495
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,260
What exactly

496
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,240
do you want to say?

497
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,430
Winner Group's chemical factory explosion,

498
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,870
I know that you did it.

499
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,350
Min Hyeok...

500
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,310
That...

501
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,570
You don't have to explain.

502
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,160
I understood all of it.

503
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,040
You and I were so pathetic.

504
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,650
At that time,

505
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,590
I realized that it was no longer
my fate just to live in

506
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,370
the snowfall.

507
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,010
Do you think that kind of me
would be scared of Han Tae Hee?

508
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,040
I'm not scared, but

509
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,650
I'm wondering how to take care of him.

510
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,730
I'm thinking of a plan right now.

511
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,810
It's me. The Winner Chemical factory
explosion accident twenty years ago...

512
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:34,690
Min Hyeok knows about it and that it's something you carried out.

513
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,520
A love triangle?

514
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,030
Director Han Min Hyeok likes Sara?

515
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,990
I think so.

516
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,520
That's actually better.

517
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,460
You want to stop Sara's wedding.

518
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,150
Just tell Manager Han Min Hyeok

519
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,720
that they are going overseas to get married.

520
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,290
With his pride, would Manager Han Min Hyeok let them be?

521
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:16,470
Lee Kang Joon, me, Han Min Hyeok
and Tae Hee's grandmother.

522
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,380
We will all stop her.

523
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,190
Sara... Will you be able to get married?

524
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,510
Sara and Han Tae Hee are getting married?

525
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,420
If they get married

526
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,470
We won't be able to stop the development
of Winner Food's new product.

527
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,520
Han Tae Hee has a weakness.

528
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:48,430
Sara's identity is one stolen from another person,
but the one who arranged it is Han Tae Hee.

529
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:50,700
Why are you telling me this?

530
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:56,320
Han Tae Hee reported me for disciplinary action
to the board of a directors.

531
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,630
I cannot let him be.

532
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,280
The recording is postponed? To tomorrow?

533
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,030
Gyo Chae Yeon is sick,
so I don't think she will be able to do it.

534
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:15,920
I'm sorry, Sara.

535
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:30,790
You're leaving tomorrow.
What are we going to do?

536
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,690
You're lying that you're sick, right?

537
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,980
You are trying to stop me from leaving!

538
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,400
You pick up clues really quickly.

539
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,030
Also,

540
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,560
I'm going to go meet Tae Hee's grandmother.

541
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,090
I have a lot to say about your problem with men.

542
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,060
We are going abroad tomorrow to be married. When we have the chance, we will have an official ceremony with you and Grandmother.

543
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,740
We are going abroad tomorrow
to get married, just by ourselves.

544
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,260
Later, when we have a chance,

545
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,250
we will have an official ceremony with you

546
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,210
and my grandmother.

547
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,920
You're going to divorce?

548
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,020
Why?

549
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,440
Actually, it's because of Sara.

550
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:29,190
Sara had an affair with my husband!

551
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,540
That type of woman is going to marry
Tae Hee tomorrow, Grandmother.

552
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,280
I don't know how I'm going to endure this.

553
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,180
It's murder, but she's not dead
and now she's alive.

554
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,970
What is all of this?

555
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:54,700
I feel like my head is going to explode.

556
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:59,220
Honey, I think there must be an evil spirit
lingering in our house.

557
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,620
Chae Yeon's wickedness, after coming in
is horrific, but

558
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,760
murder? I can't even say it!

559
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,730
My head! My head!

560
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:10,980
Shouldn't we check, Mom? It's a bit suspicious.

561
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,650
Don't poke at it!

562
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,790
If rumors get out about Kang Joon,
I won't be able to hold up my head!

563
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:21,150
My head! My head!

564
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:25,100
Won't Geum Ran's mother know
something about this?

565
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,550
Did you eat honey (that you can't open your mouth)? Talk!

566
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,740
Is Geum Ran dead or alive?

567
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,880
How unbelievable.

568
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,960
You guys didn't even cry one tear during Geum
Ran's funeral, after leaving Geum Ran in that state.

569
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,930
Now you're so aggressive just because you're curious!

570
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,650
- You should stay still.
- Why should I stay still?!

571
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,960
Every time talk of Geum Ran comes up,
my blood flows backwards!

572
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,900
That's why I'm asking if she is alive or dead!

573
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,490
Geum Ran is dead!

574
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,920
She is no longer a person of this world.

575
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,020
So, don't look for her again.

576
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,690
Yes, Mother.

577
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,420
I'll tell you one thing.

578
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:25,950
I ask you to take care of Geum Ran so that
she isn't hurt a second time.

579
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:28,410
Yes, Mother.

580
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:31,750
I will promise you, with everything I have.

581
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,010
I promise to protect your daughter.

582
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,740
Doctor! Doctor!

583
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,740
I'm coming out, Ajumma.

584
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,070
Obstacle?

585
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:48,060
After I decided to marry you,
there have been many obstacles.

586
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,450
There were many.

587
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,430
Are you tired?

588
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,250
If we can withstand one more day, then we'll succeed.

589
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,650
There shouldn't be much work to do tomorrow.

590
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,990
Let's meet my Grandmother and
then go to the airport.

591
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:07,780
Unfortunately, there's one problem.

592
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,870
The cooking competition was postponed to tomorrow.

593
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:14,780
Are you giving up on me, by any chance?

594
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,970
I can't ever give you up!

595
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,590
I can't because it'll be a waste
to give you to someone else.

596
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,130
Right?

597
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,580
Then, are you going to give up
on the cooking competition?

598
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:28,610
I'm not giving up on that either.

599
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:29,570
Then?

600
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:32,470
Can you delay the time of our flight
by a couple of hours?

601
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,850
I'm certain that we will be married on Christmas,
even if we extend the time.

602
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,040
I knew that would happen,
so I've already exchanged the tickets.

603
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,690
Team Leader Choi already told me that
the cooking competition time was changed.

604
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,340
I'm like this!

605
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:59,170
All you have to know is that
you have the best husband in the world.

606
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:04,020
Shall we practice now?

607
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:15,780
♫  Nothing happened, ♫

608
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,990
♫  It's not like I'm sad  ♫

609
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:22,260
Are we practicing in advance?

610
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,320
We are practicing for the wedding!

611
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,690
We both put it on the wish list.

612
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:32,230
♫  I don't know  ♫

613
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:38,090
♫  It seems like my heart is empty  ♫

614
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,090
You have to walk well.

615
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:44,630
If you trip and grab me, there will be embarrassing
photos of you floating around the Internet.

616
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,650
You should worry about yourself.

617
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,680
You get nervous a lot.

618
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,290
This ajumma, catching an innocent person!

619
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,970
When did I ever do that?

620
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,980
We are practicing for our wedding.

621
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,630
Are you going to do that on the day of our wedding too?

622
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,360
No.

623
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:09,040
♫  I must have loved you a lot  ♫

624
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:14,340
♫  More than you can think, I miss you  ♫

625
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:19,800
♫  Your face, your speech, everything  ♫

626
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:26,320
♫  If you feel like I do  ♫

627
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:32,360
♫  If you are hurt like me  ♫

628
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:38,750
♫  I run to you, wanting to be hugged in your arms,  ♫

629
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:43,620
♫  Without you, I'm nothing  ♫

630
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:48,140
♫  Because I love you  ♫

631
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,430
I must go to the broadcast station.

632
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,090
You can go with me, right?

633
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,720
Are you going to see Tae Hee?

634
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,550
Not Tae Hee, but

635
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,190
the woman he wants to marry.

636
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:08,960
I have something to say to her.

637
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,730
Yes.

638
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,780
Secretary Gi,

639
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,870
shall we meet?

640
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:52,960
It's still morning. Why are we drinking?

641
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,750
I don't like drinking.

642
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:01,170
Weren't you close with my mom once?

643
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,870
It didn't look good when I was young.

644
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,290
That was a long time ago.
It's not like that, now.

645
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,560
There is something I have to ask,
due to your relationship.

646
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,190
What are you trying to say?

647
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:23,320
Twenty years ago, the factory explosion accident.

648
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:28,630
I know that you did it for my mother.

649
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:07,800
Even after doing that, you are still
trusted by my Grandmother.

650
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,450
If Grandmother finds out,

651
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,420
how shocked will she be?

652
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:25,770
I will shut my mouth. So,
you should use your skill once more.

653
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:31,620
Han Tae Hee...

654
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,250
At the time of the factory explosion accident,

655
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,710
he should have died then.

656
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:55,920
When we come back here,
we'll be a married couple.

657
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,460
Our nicknames will be changed.

658
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,880
You won't be "Doctor", but "Honey."

659
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,750
You won't be "Ajumma", but "Darling."

660
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:11,660
Do well on your cooking competition.
I'll see you at three.

661
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:15,120
Let's visit Grandmother, then go to the airport.

662
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,090
Okay.

663
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,750
Let's go.

664
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,920
Don't be late.

665
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,260
Okay.

666
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,060
Hello.

667
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,690
Grandmother!

668
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:53,400
How are you here? Sit over here.

669
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:09,990
I don't have any evil intentions towards you.

670
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:13,090
I have good intentions.

671
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:18,590
It is because I thought that
you would make my grandson happy.

672
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:23,470
However, if you're to make him unhappy,

673
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:25,960
that's a different story.

674
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,800
Winner Group's two inheritors.
The bloody battle, who will be the winner?

675
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:37,290
Just answer two things.

676
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:41,370
Is it true that you have

677
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:43,210
complicated relations with men?

678
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:44,900
You've misunderstood.

679
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,560
Manager Han Min Hyeok and I,
we don't have any relationship.

680
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,280
Misunderstanding or not...

681
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,510
You caused trouble between
Tae Hee and Min Hyeok.

682
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:57,640
And now, the whole world know about their problems.

683
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,580
Also,

684
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:04,350
it is because of you that
Chae Yeon is getting a divorce.

685
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,310
That...

686
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:09,240
is a complicated issue.

687
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,620
Just give me a little time.

688
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,280
I will ask you one more thing.

689
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,680
I heard that because of your identity,

690
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:23,330
Tae Hee will be in trouble. Is that true?

691
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,790
Tae Hee...

692
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,700
has suffered a lot.

693
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,240
I cannot accept a person who makes

694
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,220
him go through more hard times.

695
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,510
Let's pretend that there haven't been
any wedding plans between the two of you.

696
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:53,450
Please end things with Tae Hee.

697
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,890
For Tae Hee.

698
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:17,810
Han Tae Hee is his office.

699
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:23,430
Call him out about Sara's identity.
Then he will have to come out.

700
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:48,420
Today at midnight, are you becoming a married man?

701
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,060
I can't believe it.

702
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,740
When I can't believe it either,
how would it be for you?

703
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,300
While I'm gone, take care of Winner Food.

704
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,350
Don't worry.

705
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,610
Unknown Number

706
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,800
It's Han Tae Hee.

707
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:14,280
Han Tae Hee, I'm Kim Deok Soon's brother.

708
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:28,150
I have somewhere to go, so if I'm late,
bring Sara to the airport.

709
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:29,800
Okay, CEO.

710
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,680
A J M

711
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,110
Yes, CEO.

712
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:50,170
Can you stay with Sara?

713
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:54,560
If someone suspicious comes, stop him.
And tell her not to answer weird phone calls.

714
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,800
Who is the person you talked to earlier?

715
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,400
Someone who found out that Sara
has a fake identity showed up.

716
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:10,910
I am not going to accept anyone

717
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:13,770
who will make him have a hard time.

718
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,760
Tae Hee's Grandmother

719
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,160
is not a typical person.

720
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,460
Just because you got prettier,

721
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,380
you became greedy and aspired to
things that you shouldn't have.

722
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,030
Becoming a celebrity, and marrying Tae Hee...

723
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:41,190
do you think that these things suit your station?

724
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:45,410
Sara, I don't care what happens to you.

725
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:49,990
But Tae Hee is going to get hurt because of you.

726
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:54,430
So, get away from Tae Hee.

727
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:04,260
I'm worried about CEO Han Tae Hee.

728
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,820
Who is it?

729
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,840
I'm Han Tae Hee!

730
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,810
Show yourself!

731
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,830
Han Tae Hee is here! Come out!

732
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:21,600
Who is the person who called me here?

733
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,700
Come out!

734
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,290
Let's talk!

735
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,230
My dream

736
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:59,580
was to become a family with someone I love

737
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:02,200
and spend Christmas with that person.

738
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,380
But for me,

739
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,660
a Christmas miracle didn't exist.

740
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:41,680
If this bracelet does not break,
it means that we won't be parted either.

741
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,870
You're in trouble now. You can't run away.

742
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:08,540
It's over there. Can you go a bit quicker?

743
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,040
Okay.

744
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:28,950
It's thirty minutes before the recording.
What happened to Sara?

745
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,500
Mr. Han! Mr. Han!

746
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:54,750
♫  When I see you like this,  ♫

747
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:58,620
Oh, that bracelet symbolizes an eternal fate.

748
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:02,620
Until the bracelet breaks,
you will never break up with that person.

749
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:09,910
♫  I guess I must send you away,  ♫

750
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:18,210
♫  I can do anything else,
but I can't do that one thing well, ♫

751
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:25,200
♫  After hesitating and sighing for a long time,  ♫

752
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:32,320
♫  I hate myself, who cannot say anything
and just turn around  ♫

753
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:40,300
♫  How can I forget you? How can I erase you? ♫

754
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,350
♫  Every moment, without you,  ♫

755
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:49,690
Because of your identity, I heard that
Tae Hee will be in trouble. Is that true?

756
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:54,130
Because of you, Tae Hee will get hurt.

757
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:58,070
So get away from Tae Hee.

758
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,250
Just save him.

759
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:04,820
If I have to break up with him, I will.

760
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,980
If you just save him, I'll do anything.

761
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,970
Just save him.

762
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:27,980
♫  How can I forget you? How can I erase you? ♫

763
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:35,160
♫  I can't stand a moment without you  ♫

764
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:35,700
♫  My heart hurts too much  ♫
