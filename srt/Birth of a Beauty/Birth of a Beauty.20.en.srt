1
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,380
Ajumma!

2
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,140
It's lucky I found you.

3
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,480
Have you been looking for me all this time?

4
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,790
Where did you go?

5
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:38,020
I stopped by the restaurant. It was closed down.

6
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,390
Ajumma, you have no place to go, right?

7
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,120
I am going to start looking.

8
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,240
I knew it.

9
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,000
For now, come with me.

10
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,880
What are you doing?
I said to come with me.

11
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,880
Episode 20

12
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,130
Check the places where Sara could have gone.

13
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,170
I have a few places in mind.

14
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,790
Come in.

15
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,210
I went to her place, but other than the reporters, Sara wasn't there.

16
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,120
The core members of the Board of Directors have asked to meet with you.

17
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,530
They want an explanation for this scandal.

18
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,900
Tell them I am fixing it.

19
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,630
Yes.

20
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,200
Next week is the General Shareholders' meeting.
We can't have any more problems arise.

21
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,270
I am going to make up a story about Sara,
so you make sure it doesn't get bigger.

22
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,200
Yes, I understand.

23
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,530
Everything is the same.

24
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,820
Except for the fact that you weren't here,
everything is the same.

25
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,950
Your room on the second floor is the same,
so stay until the problem gets resolved.

26
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,640
I won't bother or annoy you.

27
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,990
Yes Mother, I brought Sara back to my house.

28
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,500
I'll talk to her about future plans.

29
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,110
Yes. I'll phone you again.

30
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,970
♫ I can't let you go

31
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:28,230
♫ I can do anything else,
but that's the only thing I can't do ♫

32
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,210
♫ I hesitated for a long time, I sighed endlessly. ♫

33
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:43,520
♫ But I couldn't say anything and just turned away.
I hate myself for that.♫

34
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,300
♫ How can I forget you? ♫

35
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,040
♫ How can I erase you? ♫

36
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,160
♫ I can't stand a single moment without you. ♫

37
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:06,670
♫ My heart aches so much,
I can't let you go like this. ♫

38
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,260
♫ I'll wait for you until always, though it hurts, it's okay ♫

39
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,260
Did something happen?

40
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,130
No. Nothing happened.

41
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,920
I was afraid you might have, perhaps,
disappeared again, like before.

42
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,280
I just wanted to check in.

43
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,480
Take you time to get ready. I'll make breakfast.

44
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:50,280
Sara, that wretched thing.
That she even had that kind of past...

45
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,480
The problem is the General Shareholders meeting.

46
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,990
This matter is a critical blow to your image as an executive.

47
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,440
Sara suspects me as the culprit behind the assault on Han Tae Hee.

48
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,630
Only you, I,

49
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,130
and Secretary Kim know about that.

50
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,980
The press conference was also in case I hurt Han Tae Hee.

51
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,310
If Han Tae Hee starts to suspect us,
things can get very complicated.

52
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,510
If he suspects anything about the explosion incident from
twenty years ago, it will become out of our control.

53
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,800
Here.

54
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,800
- Here, look.
- Wow.

55
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,730
Eat.

56
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:48,380
I admit you can cook well,
but my cooking may, perhaps, taste better.

57
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,550
Really?

58
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,310
Since most ajummas cook all the time, when someone else cooks for them, they usually automatically find it tasty.

59
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,480
How do you know most ajummas think that way?

60
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,080
To properly know you, Ajumma, the third gender . . .
How you live,

61
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,780
I read most books relating to ajummas.

62
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,640
Trying to understand why you broke up with me.

63
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,160
It's Han Min Hyeok.

64
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,040
He probably came to see me because
I disappeared after the press conference. I'll go out.

65
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,520
No, it could be dangerous.
I'll go and check, so you stay here.

66
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,970
Sara is inside this house with you, right?

67
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:09,240
Did you not learn any manners when you were a kid?
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

68
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,070
She isn't here.

69
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,010
That's right. You wouldn't easily give Sara up.

70
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,320
She has damaged Winner Group's image.

71
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,510
Tell her to come back soon and do what I tell her to to fix this.

72
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,670
It shouldn't have come to this point.

73
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:32,450
I should be saying that to you.

74
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:42,070
So, you think the person who ordered
the attack on me was Han Min Hyeok.

75
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,030
I don't have the evidence, but I am sure.
He didn't even deny it.

76
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:51,470
So, in the end, you decided to do the press conference
because of Han Min Hyeok.

77
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,590
Because you thought he would hurt me.

78
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,520
Am I right?

79
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,180
Ajumma, I have a plan.

80
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,310
We're going to catch all the people
who made us suffer, in one fell swoop.

81
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:16,460
We're going to go back to the Genius and Ajumma days, when our plans were 100% successful, in order to catch Lee Kang Joon and Han Min Hyeok.

82
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,600
I will track the facts.
After identifying the person who assaulted me,

83
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,520
I will properly find out Lee Kang Joon's
and Han Min Hyeok's crimes.

84
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,020
Doctor, while you're tracking down the facts,
I'll expose the truth.

85
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:43,430
My In-laws, Gyo Chae Yeon, Lee Kang Joon, and the things
that happened between us—I'm going to expose it all.

86
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,680
Isn't that Sara? Hadn't she disappeared?

87
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,250
She looks fine.

88
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,070
Sara is here?

89
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,140
Yes, earlier...

90
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,930
Sara has appeared at the broadcast station?

91
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,610
Yes.

92
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,500
Hello.

93
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,050
I heard that you came to the front of the house
saying that I had to carry out the contract?

94
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,140
Since you did that kind of thing and disappeared...

95
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,220
I will carry out the contract as you wish.

96
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,780
That's fine. I have made a perfect story about you,

97
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,360
so let's have another press conference.

98
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,290
This time the goal is to cancel out the blow I received.

99
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,270
I will only carry out the contract.

100
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,290
I won't do anything for you.

101
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,940
At the Board of Directors Meeting you said that I was
the model of Winner Group and a chef of Winner Food.

102
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,070
First, I will help Han Tae Hee as a chef.

103
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,440
Ultimately, that benefits Winner Group.

104
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,460
I will do everything I can for Winner Group's image.

105
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:39,440
Also, it would be good for you not to
send any bad people after me or Han Tae Hee.

106
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,510
Between us, if someone gets hurt,
then you will become the prime suspect.

107
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,170
You will know the reason for that
if you look at the company announcements.

108
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,940
How could you come here?

109
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,960
The reporters are looking for you.

110
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,240
I told them I'd do an explanation interview shortly.

111
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,230
It's the same as having bought a few days.

112
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,670
An explanation interview?

113
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,260
What are you going to say?

114
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,320
A story in which people will be interested.

115
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,600
Of course, the story will be something you will hate.

116
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,390
Ah.

117
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,790
Also, I'm living in Han Tae Hee's house again.

118
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,970
From now on, we plan to catch the people who tormented us.

119
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,940
Winner Group Board of Directors Announcement
Han Min Hyeok said Love's Riceballs
were his achievement, but he lied?

120
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,000
Han Tae Hee and Sara made them, but he took credit for it?

121
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,130
Didn't General Manager Han Min Hyeok become the candidate
for CEO/Director of Winner Group because of that?

122
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,750
Winner Group Board of Directors Announcement

123
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,730
The Winner Food $1.2 Million preorder good result
from Chef Sara's, Love's Rice Balls,

124
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:31,650
was not on the order of General Manager Han Min Hyeok,
but by Sara's voluntary participation in its development.

125
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,870
General Manager Han Min Hyeok circulating,
at the Board of Directors Meeting, that he himself

126
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,560
led the development of the Rice Balls
for Winner Group, I relay my regrets.

127
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,420
I announce that I will respond strongly to this matter.

128
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,860
Winner Food CEO/Director Han Tae Hee.

129
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,420
My judgment is that revealing the truth is the safest bet.

130
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,280
In this situation, if either Sara or I are hurt,
you, Han Min Hyeok, will be the prime suspect.

131
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,710
Oh right. I put employees around Sara.

132
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,910
From now on, I'm going to protect Sara myself.

133
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,900
So now, throw away whatever you intend to do.

134
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,360
If you do that, will the General Shareholders Meeting results change?

135
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,660
Who can predict the future?

136
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,320
It's just that I'm doing everything I can.

137
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,880
How did it go, Doctor?

138
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,840
I met Han Min Hyeok, and I let one fly in a good-looking way.

139
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,700
Ajumma, how did you do?

140
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,080
I, too, made a declaration of war that I'd help Winner Food.

141
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,230
This is the the natural seasoning that
I'd like to launch at Winner Food.

142
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,710
With this natural seasoning, I made...

143
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,090
It's mandoo(Korean dumplings).
Try a bite.

144
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,140
Okay.

145
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,310
How does it taste?

146
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,940
Mmm.

147
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,240
It's the best.

148
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,990
Is that so?

149
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,330
Ahh. Such a relief.

150
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,180
This is a chicken and marinated crab broth.

151
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,170
Try some of this too.

152
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,580
Wow. It's the best.

153
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,760
Why are you looking at me like that?
I told you to taste it. Did I ask you to look at my face?

154
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,160
It's because ever since I've been released from the hospital,

155
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,780
I haven't looked at your face closely
in such a long time, Ajumma.

156
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,340
The hospital?

157
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:41,090
You fed me, and put me to sleep,
and you were with me twenty-four hours.

158
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,640
Hospital!

159
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,310
Doctor, I just thought of the man who attacked you.

160
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:11,550
- Who is it?
- When you were hospitalized, some man came looking for you.

161
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,440
There must be a CCTV somewhere.
Go check it, Doctor.

162
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,920
I think that they're going to reject you
at the General Shareholders Meeting.

163
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,440
There's an email that's being spread among the shareholders.

164
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:33,940
Han Tae Hee is criticizing you openly, and
the shareholders' hearts are turning away from you.

165
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,770
If you don't step forward when you should,
it will become a bigger disaster.

166
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,310
Right now seems to be the time for me to step forward.

167
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,300
If only Han Tae Hee disappears,

168
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,900
the shareholders can't come out so resolutely.

169
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,970
Hello, Kim PD. It's Sara.

170
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,930
I have something to meet and discuss with you.
I'll go and find you.

171
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,650
Sara,

172
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,410
if you help me maintain my pride, it won't go to the worst.

173
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,580
Abandon Tae Hee and stand on my side.
I will take care of Lee Kang Joon.

174
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,500
It's my last suggestion.
Think carefully, until tomorrow, and answer me.

175
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,880
No.

176
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,740
You don't have to wait till tomorrow
to hear my answer. I refuse.

177
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,290
If it's not a path, don't even go towards it.

178
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,920
That's a lesson I learned through
Sa Geum Ran's failed marriage.

179
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,620
I'll go first.

180
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,150
Is it that hard

181
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,640
to let me have my pride?

182
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,730
- Is it?
- Why are you acting like this?

183
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,540
How dare you touch her!

184
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,630
General Manager!

185
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,990
I clearly told you. I'm going to protect Sara now.

186
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,940
If you go near her, I will appear right away.

187
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,680
Do you understand?

188
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,900
Ow, my fist!

189
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,160
Ajumma, it hurts so much!

190
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,220
My fist hurts a lot. What should I do?

191
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,740
Endure it a little longer. I will bring the first aid kit.

192
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,870
What are you doing? I'm hurt!

193
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,110
Yes, I'm coming!

194
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,190
It's a little swollen.

195
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,630
Yeah. This side hurts too. Can you blow on it?

196
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,940
- Here?
- That side hurts.

197
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,340
The part behind that side too.

198
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,180
Here?

199
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,470
Oh,

200
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,760
I feel like it's gotten better now.

201
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,280
Han Min Hyeok. Is his face made out of steel?

202
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,910
My fist really hurts.

203
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,160
I saw that you broke my picture.

204
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,260
After I left, you had a hard time alone, right?

205
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,130
How about you?

206
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,030
You must have had a harder time.

207
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,510
How could you stay here?
Our memories are still lingering here.

208
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,330
But since I endured it, look.

209
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,400
This is a place for you to stay.

210
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,780
Until our problems are solved,
don't think about anything else and stay here.

211
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,460
You have to stay next to me, in order for me to feel at ease.

212
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,400
If you want to leave after all is over,

213
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,750
then I will listen to you.

214
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:36,370
♫  I long for you more than you can imagine. ♫

215
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:41,940
♫ Your face, the way you talk, eveything ♫

216
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,980
♫  Perhaps, if you  ♫

217
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,180
Ajumma, it's all in the past. Don't mind it.

218
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,870
♫  are the same as me, ♫

219
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,700
Good night, Ajumma.

220
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,770
♫  I want to be embraced by you  ♫

221
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,630
♫ Without you, I'm nothing  ♫

222
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,300
♫  Because I love you  ♫

223
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,880
Min Hyeok.

224
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,250
Mother.

225
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,140
You said you would get involved at the right time.

226
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,130
I think the time has come.

227
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:46,130
Han Tae Hee and Sara, I don't want to see them anymore.

228
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,970
For tomorrow, our talk show decided to
do a special feature on the chefs of Birth of a Chef.

229
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,760
By chance, could I take part in it as well?

230
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,950
Oh, it would be greatly welcome, of course.

231
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,390
If we get your interview, that's the real exclusive.
Rather, I'd be more than grateful.

232
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,010
Except I have one condition.

233
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,950
Until the day of the broadcast,
I'd like for Gyo Chae Yeon not to know.

234
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,470
Do you really have the desire
to eat during this serious situation?

235
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,680
This is a diet supplement.

236
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,290
The worse the situation is, the more
you should take care of your body.

237
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,900
Mom, what does Kang Joon say?

238
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,980
Okay. We'll get ready.

239
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:57,620
Mom says that we should all go together to meet Geum Ran.

240
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,710
Sara.

241
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,950
Here it is.

242
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:09,400
It's a talk show where we have two chefs
from Birth of a Chef talk about either cooking,

243
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,330
or about your lives.

244
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,920
If you look at the cue sheet,
you'll understand the flow right away.

245
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,370
Thank you.

246
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,490
I'll see you later.

247
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,990
Gyo Chae Yeon's Interview Time

248
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,370
Geum Ran?

249
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,120
We're here. But where is it that she wants to see us?

250
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,530
Syrup (mobile app)

251
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:53,900
- Oh, it's here. This place is the closest to the Broadcast Station.
- Is that right?

252
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,200
Then, I'll call Geum Ran and tell her we're here.

253
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,250
I'll put the order in. If Piggy Sister-in-law hasn't eaten yet,
tell her not to eat before coming.

254
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,450
The one we pre-ordered.

255
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,850
Thank you.

256
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,270
Welcome.

257
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,280
You've become a lot prettier, Geum Ran.

258
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,360
You were pretty when you were Geum Ran also.
Truthfully, I thought so.

259
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,230
Of course.

260
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,370
I...

261
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,920
When you married into our family,
I never gave you wedding jewelry.

262
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,370
So I wanted to do it for you, even now.

263
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,980
These are our letters of reflection.

264
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,370
Sister-in-law, I was wrong.

265
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,670
I saw you having your press conference.

266
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,010
I reflected a lot.

267
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,740
I regretted and cried.

268
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:31,530
Right now, if the circumstances of you
being chased out become known,

269
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:35,350
we won't be able to live in the Republic of Korea.

270
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,570
Think of the old days and forgive us this one time, Geum Ran.

271
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,600
What is it you want from me?

272
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,020
What Kang Joon did to you, we'd like for you not to tell anyone.

273
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,240
I haven't married yet.

274
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,060
If it becomes known, I won't ever be able to get married.

275
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,000
Kang Joon also has to be able to make a living in the future.

276
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,430
And your father-in-law is the head
of a community service group.

277
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,870
I was wrong. Forgive me this one time.

278
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,840
It's all my fault for having raised my children wrong.

279
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,580
During the time when I was a heavy set 100kg,

280
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,970
you ridiculed me, saying that Godzilla wore a flower
and was play-acting as a person.

281
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,920
You made fun of me to my face, calling me Piggy Sister-in-law.

282
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,770
You told me that you were embarrassed to take me around, saying that I was fat and your status was diminished by me.

283
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,460
You wanted an announcer daughter-in-law.

284
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:52,120
Why do you seek forgiveness?
To you all, Sa Geum Ran

285
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,270
is, as always, just a fat pig sister-in-law.

286
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,850
You're not seeking forgiveness because
you really think you were wrong.

287
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,150
You're only apologizing because you're
afraid of what will happen in the future.

288
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:08,770
That one has to take responsibility for ones actions
is one of the lessons I learned as I became Sara.

289
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,870
When everything is revealed, only the actions that we each

290
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,730
committed, are all that we have to be responsible for.

291
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,470
Good-bye Mother and Sisters-in Law.

292
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,130
I was wrong, Geum Ran.

293
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,630
I was wrong. Forgive me once, huh?

294
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:31,090
That's right. Save us, please?

295
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:34,140
Geum Ran. Geum Ran.

296
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,530
Where are you going? Geum Ran.
Geum Ran.

297
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,140
You're asking me to let go of the building, just like this?

298
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,350
Return it to Sa Geum Ran. Except for that,
we have nothing to bargain with.

299
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,580
- Why should I?
- It's not originally yours.

300
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,880
That's my alimony for having suffered married life with you.

301
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:08,320
If Sa Geum Ran exposes the truth of the murder,
I'll be imprisoned and it's the end of your celebrity life.

302
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,790
Then do away with Sa Geum Ran again, properly.

303
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:29,560
Sa Geum Ran is Sa Geum Ran also,
but if I have to kill someone...

304
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,660
Keep in mind that you're included.

305
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,110
All right?

306
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,770
We can catch Lee Kang Joon?

307
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,690
If he is caught this time, he won't be able to
get away like he did last time.

308
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:01,530
If you catch this man, you can catch
Lee Kang Joon and even Han Min Hyeok.

309
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,490
I'll ask for your cooperation.

310
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,980
If you write down your wish, hang it on the tree and
turn on the lights, there's a saying that it will come true.

311
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,290
If I do this, all my wishes will come true.

312
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:49,070
♫  As if I forgot it all,  ♫

313
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,780
♫  While living quietly,  ♫
I'd like for you to smile everyday.

314
00:31:51,780 --> 00:32:01,390
♫  The sudden thoughts of you come surging in like waves,  ♫

315
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:09,730
♫  Even when I try to cut out the stories of you,  ♫

316
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,520
♫  The memories we made remain,  ♫
I hope that you won't have nightmares anymore.

317
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,740
♫  The tears come even today,  ♫

318
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:25,960
♫  I want to see you because the love was deep,  ♫

319
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:35,450
♫  Because I couldn't forget you,
like a habit I miss you,  ♫

320
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,340
Your health.

321
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:45,430
♫  I want to see you, because I miss you so,  ♫

322
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:51,180
♫  Because I love you so,  ♫

323
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,910
Even next Christmas, that we'd be together.

324
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:59,940
♫  I want to see the you that's like this,  ♫

325
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:07,280
♫  I'm not accustomed to you,  ♫

326
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:14,990
♫  In the place where you have left, I only look for  ♫

327
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:23,930
♫  and am wandering, I want to see you,  ♫

328
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,640
I hope that you find your real dream and make it come true.

329
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:34,610
♫  Because I couldn't forget you,  ♫

330
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:41,010
♫  Like a habit I miss you,  ♫

331
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:49,220
♫  I want to see you, because I miss you so,  ♫

332
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,950
♫  Because I love you so,  ♫

333
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,750
Ajumma!

334
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,660
Ajumma!

335
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,250
♫  Like a habit, I miss you,  ♫

336
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,540
That's right. It's this feeling.

337
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:08,500
When I've come home after work,
the feeling of you waiting for me...

338
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,520
Oh, Ajumma. I have a present.

339
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,230
A present?

340
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,300
Tada!

341
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:40,390
Doctor, why did you buy Kim-Dduk-Soon (Kimbap, Ddukboki,
and Soondae - blood sausage) today?

342
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:45,350
Because it's what you like. Tomorrow is an
important day since you're going on the talk show.

343
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,740
So you should eat what you like.

344
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,670
Why do you like Kim-Dduk-Soon?

345
00:34:54,670 --> 00:35:00,290
I had the most confidence when I was a high school student.

346
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:04,610
Since I was naturally strong, I had confidence in my Judo skills.

347
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:09,680
Even when I got teased from being called King Kong,
Bigfoot, or pig, I didn't let it get me down

348
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,580
because I was a Judo athlete.

349
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:19,470
Since the foods I liked at that time were Kim-Dduk-Soon,
I still eat them when I need a fighting spirit.

350
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:25,420
If it's a fighting spirit that you need,
you don't need Kim-Ddduk-Soon anymore.

351
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,920
Why not?

352
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,600
You're already strong, Ajumma.

353
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,940
The Ajumma Sa Geum Ran of the past,
was weak and depended on others.

354
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:40,200
Now, you're a completely different person, Ajumma.
You're independent and active.

355
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,890
I was shocked at your ability to overcome a crisis,
and I experienced it again at the press conference.

356
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,160
You're a strong person now.

357
00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:01,280
But what's the secret to where that strength comes from?

358
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,610
What, there's no secret?

359
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,420
I do have a secret, but I'll tell you later.

360
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:19,300
For now, I'll just focus on tomorrow's talk show
and this delicious Kim-Dduk-Soon.

361
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,390
Maybe it's because you bought it, but it tastes even sweeter.

362
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,900
Is that so?

363
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,070
Here, eat the blood sausage too.

364
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,910
Eat some fishcake, Doctor. Open up.

365
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,280
Yum, yum.

366
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,370
Winner Group HBS

367
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,050
Why is Sara on the list of people appearing on the show?

368
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,510
Isn't it a good thing? Sara contacted us first.

369
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,510
You need to concentrate on asking Sara
a lot of questions today. Got it?

370
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,920
Have you seen Sara?

371
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,430
No.

372
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,060
Let's go.

373
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,940
Sara

374
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,270
The person you are trying to reach has turned off
the phone and you will be connected to voicemail ...

375
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,240
Lee Kang Joon

376
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,540
What is it?

377
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,630
We're in trouble. Sara's going to be on today's live talk show.

378
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,490
That's why I told you that we needed to do something!

379
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,340
The car and plate number aren't clear.

380
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:01,070
Please find out the plate number.
I need to go and watch over Sara.

381
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,880
Yes, CEO.

382
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,610
Oppa Tae Hee

383
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:21,370
OppaTae Hee, it's me. Please stop Sara.

384
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,980
Sara wants to tell the truth.

385
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,900
Oppa.

386
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:32,070
Chae Yeon,
if there's something to take responsibility for, do it on your own.

387
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:36,920
When everything goes back to it's rightful place,
I'll find a way to help you as your Oppa.

388
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,910
Gyo Chae Yeon's Interview Time

389
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,280
Stop even now.

390
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,960
You're the one who wanted to do the talk show.

391
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,310
Don't I just need to give you the building?

392
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,980
Alright, I'll give it back.

393
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,320
You don't need to do that, since I'll get it back on my own.

394
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,150
Hello.

395
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,750
Hello.

396
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,980
Oh, Sara.

397
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,520
It's nice to meet you.

398
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,680
This is the live broadcast of "Gyo Chae Yeon's Interview Time".

399
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,820
Today, we have Sara and Oh Kyeong Hee from Birth of a Chef.

400
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:05,690
We will be sharing cooking and life stories with the two of them.

401
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,390
Hello.

402
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,870
Hello, I'm Sara.

403
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,480
Ajumma, hang in there.

404
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,040
Yes, up to now, we've been discussing Oh Kyeong Hee's
cooking topic, "Cooking for the Family."

405
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,060
Next, it's Sara's turn.

406
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:27,900
The cooking topic that Sara has chosen is,
"Cooking for Guests."

407
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,870
Shall we start talking about cooking?

408
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:39,800
Instead of that, shall we begin by talking about
the things the viewers would like to know about Sara?

409
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,530
Will you talk about the things that
you weren't able to say at the press conference?

410
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,290
First, I'd like to apologize once again.

411
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,870
Please forgive me for wrapping myself in lies.

412
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,880
Since Sara seems to be having a bit of
difficulty talking about personal matters,

413
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,260
shall we talk about cooking first?

414
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,880
No, I'm fine.

415
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,780
Anyway, it's something I need to say at some point.

416
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,310
If it's alright, I'll ask you a few questions.
What is your real name, Sara?

417
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,950
My name is Sa Geum Ran.

418
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:26,140
Six months ago, I was the contestant on Change.
I was on it because I wanted to lose weight.

419
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,680
Then, you originally wanted to have plastic surgery.

420
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,710
I think I had a wrong way of thinking.

421
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:42,160
I thought that I just needed to become pretty
in order to receive love.

422
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,890
However, in order to receive love,
I didn't need to become pretty.

423
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:53,450
I found out too late that I just needed to love myself.

424
00:41:53,450 --> 00:42:01,360
If perhaps, you have people around you
like the former me, think about loving them

425
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,080
because they shouldn't think foolish thoughts, like me.

426
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:13,070
Also, while living like a fool,
that they shouldn't be murdered like me.

427
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,650
Murdered?

428
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,370
Did you just say, "murder," Sara?

429
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:27,100
Sara, I feel a bit cautious since you brought up
a surprising topic during a live broadcast.

430
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,280
Does what I'm saying make you uncomfortable, Gyo Chae Yeon?

431
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,410
No, what do you mean, uncomfortable?
There's no way that would happen.

432
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,320
What do you mean by murder?

433
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,240
Who committed murder?

434
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,590
It was my husband.

435
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,200
My husband had a mistress.

436
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,340
The two of them had an affair,

437
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,720
and my husband stole my property.

438
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:22,090
For eight years, I took care of my in-laws, and
supported my husband who was studying abroad,

439
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,600
but the only thing I got in return was a divorce complaint.

440
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:32,620
My husband and his mistress were ruthless.

441
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:40,400
When I said I couldn't give him a divorce, my husband
tried to murder me and disguised it as a car accident.

442
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:52,150
Sara, you could be in trouble if
you're saying things that aren't substantiated.

443
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,730
That mistress was also at the accident site where I was dying.

444
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:02,720
That woman witnessed my husband killing me
and didn't try to stop it.

445
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,290
She stood watching me die as I fell into the sea.

446
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,370
Who is that woman?

447
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,760
That woman is...

448
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:23,620
in this studio right now.

449
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,990
I'm getting goosebumps!

450
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,110
She is precisely... Gyo Chae Yeon.

451
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,810
Sa Geum Ran's husband is the President of HBS,

452
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:00,050
Lee Kang Joon?

453
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,460
Yes.

454
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,570
Oh my goodness, how could he kill his own wife?

455
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,820
How could a damnable bastard like that exist?

456
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,540
Just what does he look like?

457
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,600
- Do a search on him.
- Yes, okay.

458
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,250
How can he do that?

459
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,460
How can a person do that?

460
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,980
It's so scary. How can I live?

461
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,950
That's why things like this are simply repeated.

462
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:45,000
Yes, Detective Oh, it's Han Tae Hee.

463
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,830
The matter regarding Lee Kang Joon
is being broadcast on HBS right now.

464
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,220
Please take a look.

465
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,760
What did you say? Sara is Geum Ran?

466
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,740
I heard that Geum Ran is on television. Turn it on.

467
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,040
What? Geum Ran is on television?

468
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,020
HBS Announcer Gyo Chae Yeon abetted murder?

469
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,770
Chae Yeon abetted a murder...

470
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,620
And, Sara's real name is Sa Geum Ran...

471
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,340
How about this woman?

472
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,580
Tae Hee asked me,

473
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,370
so I did liposuction on her without leaving a record.

474
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,490
Announcer Gyo Chae Yeon's inside
and outside are completely different.

475
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,950
She was a person who dated a married man?

476
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,680
How dare she say that she was the victim
when she broke apart a family?

477
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,050
I feel really bad for Sa Geum Ran. Don't you?

478
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:28,410
Hello, PD Kim.

479
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,080
Oh, Hello.

480
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,540
Where is Sara? She isn't answering her phone.

481
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:36,790
She didn't come to the makeup room. Is she in the studio?

482
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,120
Oh, I got it.

483
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:58,110
Then break up with my husband.

484
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:00,570
Please end things with him.

485
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,870
Do you think that

486
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:07,490
you and he are suitable together?

487
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:11,250
♫  You, who said that we should end our relationship ♫

488
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:14,670
Do you even look

489
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:17,270
in the mirror?

490
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:23,910
♫  You said as if it's easy  ♫

491
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:28,730
♫  Like it's not a big deal ♫

492
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:33,210
♫  You said that everything is over just because we broke up  ♫

493
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,030
♫  Did I judge you wrong?  ♫

494
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:40,770
♫  You seem like another person,  ♫

495
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:45,160
♫  It seems like everything is a lie.  ♫

496
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:52,440
♫  I was the only one who didn't know, I thought that it will last forever  ♫

497
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:59,830
♫  I was the only one who didn't know, I thought that I would be happy  ♫

498
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:08,170
♫  The words, I love you, which I can't tell you anymore  ♫

499
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:15,160
♫  I didn't know that this was how a goodbye feels like. ♫

500
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:25,210
Everything ended well.

501
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,810
I saw the broadcast.

502
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:30,110
I was waiting for you to come out.

503
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,590
You didn't have to do that.

504
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,300
Come with me for now.

505
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:51,440
There are only four days until
the General Shareholders Meeting.

506
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,560
Get rid of Han Tae Hee.

507
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:02,980
This is Han Tae Hee's official schedule.

508
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,330
Please take care of things without making a mistake.

509
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,410
Schedule

510
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,170
The situation is different from before.

511
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,550
We can be suspected.

512
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,110
Min Hyeok,

513
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,790
how far are you going to go?

514
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:29,720
Until I have Winner Group.

515
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,760
There is someone I can blame it on.

516
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,160
Lee Kang Joon. He has a valid reason to kill Han Tae Hee.

517
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,510
I will take care of it, so you should just do it.

518
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,790
Joon Cheol!

519
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,960
Think of this as helping me.

520
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,110
I beg you, Joon Cheol.

521
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:24,530
You were like this before.

522
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:27,100
You were always like this.

523
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,110
The chemical factory incident.

524
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,590
I got blood on my hands because of you, but

525
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,310
what do I have left?

526
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,050
If Min Hyeok becomes the President,

527
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:48,530
do you think that he will ignore you?

528
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:52,610
I will take responsibility for you.

529
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,030
I beg you, Joon Cheol.

530
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,330
I don't know how long it's been.

531
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:22,510
How do you feel, looking at the ocean?

532
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:26,670
It feels like my heart is unclogged.

533
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:31,400
That's why I brought you.

534
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,520
Here.

535
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,630
It's white roses.

536
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,930
It means "respect."

537
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,910
Respect?

538
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,430
While looking at you,

539
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:59,910
I thought a lot about what I'd do if I were in your position.

540
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:04,130
You always went beyond my expectations.

541
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:11,500
I respect you, who bravely overcame all your obstacles.

542
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:21,730
You asked me how I was able to change, right?

543
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:26,550
Are you still curious about that secret method?

544
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:34,180
That secret is exactly you.

545
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:43,370
Your praise and encouragement changed me.

546
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:46,710
You praised me, even for doing things
that aren't that significant.

547
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:50,870
And, even if I didn't do well, you encouraged me.

548
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:55,130
You were surprised about the things that should be obvious.

549
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:02,830
Sa Geum Ran needed to be treated

550
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,290
because she had too many scars.

551
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:11,450
But Doctor, you healed the me who was like that, with praise.

552
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,360
That's why...

553
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,930
That's why it wasn't weird to call you "Doctor,"

554
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,210
even when you aren't a doctor.

555
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,370
I respect you, who bravely overcame all your obstacles.

556
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:17,090
Ajumma! If you've changed your clothes,
can you come downstairs?

557
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,790
Yes, I got it!

558
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:32,890
So you are going to find out the address
and the phone number of the man, who came

559
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:35,490
to find you, from the plate number of the car?

560
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,220
Yes.

561
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,390
Doctor, you're cool.

562
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:52,370
This is my regular life.

563
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:56,850
When I sent a group email with Lee Kang Joon's account, I did it like this.

564
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:00,170
Back then, I didn't personally see you doing it.

565
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:02,810
I was cooler back then.

566
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:05,510
Since I suffered a lot because of you,

567
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:10,000
my face rotted, and my pores became bigger.

568
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:14,310
Shall I see if your face rotted or not?

569
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:16,660
You know before and after,

570
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,980
so look, then.

571
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:25,270
Doctor, your eyelashes became longer than before.

572
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:27,830
They look steeped in melancholy.

573
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:34,950
Then, I've grown better looking than before.

574
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,410
Then should I examine you?

575
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:45,950
Wow, your gaze changed.

576
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:48,710
They say that if people have a hard time,
it can be seen in their eyes.

577
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:51,970
This can't be made from plastic surgery.

578
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:57,830
You and I got back together after breaking up,

579
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,270
but we became more handsome and pretty.

580
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:05,680
We became a beau and beauty.

581
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,830
You really became much prettier.

582
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,900
You too.

583
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:19,250
The address is out.

584
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:23,750
Seoul, Gangseo-gu, Hwagok-dong

585
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,970
Number 47.

586
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,390
I'm Detective Oh from the Sungbook Police Department.

587
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,610
Where is Lee Kang Joon?

588
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:42,810
He's not here right now. He's been
living outside for a while now. But, what is it?

589
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:46,160
He's being charged for the attempted murder of Sa Geum Ran.

590
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,790
Lee Kang Joon!

591
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,930
They lost Lee Kang Joon?

592
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:05,030
He knows the police are looking for him, so he disappeared.

593
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,450
CEO, he came.

594
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:28,660
He went into his house.

595
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:32,930
You want to go together? This is a real life situation.

596
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:37,550
I'm the only one who knows his face. I must go.

597
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,810
But it will be dangerous.

598
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:42,400
What else am I going to do with my strength?
If I try to save it, it will just go to waste.

599
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,670
We should go together, wherever it is.

600
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:48,300
Go wherever together?

601
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,720
Yes. You don't want to?

602
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:56,030
I welcome it, of course.

603
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:59,070
Good, Ajumma. Then, let's go!

604
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,460
Okay!

605
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,320
- That man is here now, right?
- He went in about two hours ago.

606
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,400
You've worked hard. Go and rest.

607
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,730
We'll take it from here.

608
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,730
Yes, I understand, CEO.

609
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,690
Calling 010-6738 (car owner's phone number)

610
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,750
You're the owner of licence plate #6172, right?

611
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:44,250
I accidentally hit your car. What should I do?

612
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,690
Can you come out?

613
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,930
That's the right man.

614
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:51,110
- Han Tae Hee.
- I wondered what to do if you pretended not to know me.

615
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:54,030
But I'm grateful you're calling my name right away.

616
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:58,100
I didn't even need to ask if you were the one who beat me up.

617
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,000
I won't let you beat me twice.

618
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:31,430
Who told you to kill me?
Was it Lee Kang Joon or Han Min Hyeok?

619
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,160
Exactly who is the person who told you to assault Han Tae Hee?

620
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:33,900
I checked the address book, but Lee Kang Joon
and Han Min Hyeok's names aren't there.

621
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,260
Does that mean there is someone else in the middle of this?

622
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:46,490
Let's make a trap, Ajumma.

623
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,570
Let's make the guy directing all of this contact us.

624
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,290
How?

625
01:02:55,610 --> 01:03:04,330
Okay now... There's someone who found out

626
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:08,510
that I attacked Han Tae Hee.

627
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:12,950
If we send this message to the group...

628
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:18,550
Whoever really did it will probably end up contacting us.

629
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:24,580
Wow. Doctor, you really are a genius!

630
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:28,830
Well, this much is just the kind of easy idea
that comes to me while I play.

631
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,180
There's someone who found out that I attacked Han Tae Hee.

632
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:46,000
The day before the General Meeting of Shareholders,
I'm thinking to get rid of Han Tae Hee.

633
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:56,980
There's someone who found out that I attacked Han Tae Hee.

634
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,200
What is it?

635
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,090
That I directed someone to assault Han Tae Hee...

636
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,180
Someone found out.

637
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:34,440
What happened?

638
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,720
Who is the person who knows I directed this assault?

639
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,480
Why aren't you answering?

640
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,830
Call from Director, voice recording has been stored.
Would you like to check?

641
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,490
I think something's gone wrong.

642
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,490
What's the matter, Doctor?

643
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,360
Somewhere...

644
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,780
I've heard this voice before.

645
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,650
Lee Kang Joon

646
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:51,330
How is it that I'm in the situation of being chased?

647
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,520
Turn yourself in.

648
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,990
Sara is still legally my wife.

649
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:04,900
No matter how much you want to, you can't marry her.

650
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:11,280
I will give Sara her freedom, so let's negotiate.

651
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,280
That was Lee Kang Joon, right?

652
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:24,270
It turned out well, Doctor.
Let's use this chance to catch Lee Kang Joon, too.

653
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:28,580
Rather than the police, I'd feel better catching him myself.

654
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,480
Are you really okay?

655
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,880
Of course. I'm not alone now.

656
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,560
If we're together, we're invincible.

657
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,040
Of course.

658
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,720
We can do it if we're together. We have nothing to fear.

659
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:59,760
We've changed, like this, after meeting each other.

660
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,340
Ajumma became a strong person,

661
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:07,850
and I'm not afraid of facing my past.

662
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:14,610
Alone, we're weak, but together, we have nothing to fear.

663
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:20,700
This is the very strength of love.

664
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:41,550
♫ I'm going to erase all the sad memories now ♫

665
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:43,060
My decision to marry you, Ajumma,

666
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,600
I feel like I totally made the right decision. Do you know that?

667
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,960
You want Han Tae Hee, don't you?
I'll call him out to a secret location.

668
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,940
Instead you have to listen to one of my requests.
I'm thinking to go to Iran.

669
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,710
I'm going to ask him to find a way for me to live,
no matter what. Oppa Tae Hee can't refuse me.

670
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,120
By chance, do you recognize this watch?

671
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,700
This looks like a Winner Group employee watch.

672
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,520
Then, would it be possible to find out who this watch belongs to?

673
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,200
Tomorrow, there will be an explosion
in the Winner Foods materials warehouse.

674
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,500
Han Tae Hee is the target.

675
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,730
I need a counterfeit passport.

676
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:09,670
Come to the Winner Foods materials warehouse
by eleven am tomorrow.
