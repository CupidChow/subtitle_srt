1
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,200
Episode 2

2
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,880
Ajumma, just having a pretty face is not enough.

3
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,070
These days having a health regimen like
Athlete Kim Yun is the trend.

4
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,190
A body mass index of 7.4% and a body fat percentage of 10%.

5
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,460
We're going to attempt the challenge for
attaining a waist size of 24 inches.

6
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,550
That was good.

7
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,210
One, two, three!

8
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,670
Let's do light 20 times.

9
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,050
Now.

10
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,360
One.

11
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,600
Oh, good.

12
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,860
It's good.

13
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,730
Two.

14
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,350
Aigoo, you are doing well.

15
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,940
Three.

16
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,100
Seventeen.

17
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,430
Eighteen.

18
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,860
One more. Twenty.

19
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,430
Aigoo, you are good.

20
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,250
Aigoo.

21
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,360
Here. Here.

22
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,070
This is the point. Let's do some whirlwind studying.

23
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,750
You can't just memorize celebrities' names.

24
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,870
Aside from the humanities, economy, society, politics.

25
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,000
Become an intelligent woman whose brain is sexy.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,750
♫ I will still like you ♫

27
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,170
♫ It feels like my heart is going to burst ♫

28
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,880
Here, one, two.
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you. The seasons will change. ♫

29
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,320
Good!
♫  Everything will seem different. ♫

30
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,280
It's light! One more! One, two!
♫  I never noticed the sky was so blue and beautiful. ♫

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,730
♫ Even though I'm watching a sad movie, I start laughing.  ♫

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,630
In 2014, a new comprehensive channel was
launched in a merger with the Winner Group.

33
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,740
HBS's newest CEO of the youngest broadcasting
station of the Republic of Korea.

34
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,220
I will seek to bring Mr. Lee Kang Joon to you.

35
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,560
I'm glad to see you. I am Lee Kang Joon.

36
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,900
Congratulations on becoming the new CEO.

37
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,250
He is the youngest CEO in broadcasting history.

38
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,610
As for the inaugural address, since he is
releasing it through the Internet,

39
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,450
attention is being focused on this unconventional move.

40
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,230
I want to share one thing through the inaugural address.

41
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,940
What you see is not everything.

42
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,370
Body mass index 16.

43
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,700
Body fat percentage 9%.

44
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,150
You've accomplished the target objective.

45
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,740
Thank you, Doctor.

46
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,720
Doctor, I can eat Kim Dduk Soo now, right?
(Kimbap, Ddukbokki, Soondae)

47
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,900
You said that if I reached my goal, I could eat them as
my prize.

48
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,700
So I only brought them here, didn't even eat them, and just drooled!

49
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,390
Eat. Eat.

50
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,600
Eat all the kimbap, ddukbokki and
blood sausage you want today!

51
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,290
Let's go.

52
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,880
Doctor.

53
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,270
Isn't it beautiful?

54
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,830
However, there is more than meets the eye.

55
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,430
Yes, I'm right now in a 21st century
new technology integration.

56
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,800
I am in the 3-D Magic Virtual Studio.

57
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,140
HBS may have been one of the later starts
in the TV programming broadcast world,

58
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,490
but if we have the ability to see
what everyone else can't see,

59
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,570
we will soon be able to bring about
a paradigm shift in broadcasting.

60
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,670
What you see isn't everything.

61
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,670
Keep that in mind.

62
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,540
Ajumma!

63
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,940
Where did everything go?

64
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,650
I already ate them all, Doctor.

65
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,290
Have you forgotten the intelligent sexy woman
(you're supposed to be)?!

66
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,430
A woman with a sexy mind does not do these things.

67
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,690
Yes, I'll keep that in mind, Doctor.

68
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,200
But I have to eat like this once in a while

69
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,120
or the beast in my might pop out.

70
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,010
I'll organize the gym equipment and will be back.

71
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,660
Ajumma, what is wrong?

72
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,650
Are you feeling bloated from eating too much?

73
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,600
Do you have an upset stomach?

74
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,390
Not my stomach, but something ruptured in a different place.

75
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,670
Different place?

76
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,390
Where?

77
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,950
I think the silicone implant in my breast ruptured.

78
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,520
I heard a pop.

79
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,980
Here, touch it.

80
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,960
Why are you doing this?

81
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,600
Hurry up and confirm it.

82
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,220
What if it ruptured? Do I have to have another surgery?

83
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,430
Do you really think it ruptured?

84
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,190
I wouldn't know. I said I heard a popping sound.

85
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,730
Doctor, please massage it and see. Hurry.

86
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,050
Why are you doing this?

87
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,890
Aigoo, really!

88
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,280
Oh, oh dear.

89
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,490
Oh dear.

90
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,420
To tell you the truth,

91
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,860
I am not a doctor.

92
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,840
What kind of unbelievable thing are you saying?

93
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,980
What do you mean you are not a doctor?

94
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,480
You were definitely wearing a doctor's gown at the hospital.

95
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,550
If you're not a doctor, then who are you?

96
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,800
What is it that you do?

97
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,790
Oh, ho!

98
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,750
You don't have to exercise your tongue. You talk too much.

99
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,630
I don't think it burst judging by their symmetry,
and there isn't any sag.

100
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,900
Quickly organize this, and let's go.

101
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,800
If you're not a doctor, then who are you!?

102
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,730
Today, celebrity announcer Gyo Chae Yeon
made a surprising wedding announcement.

103
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,310
Gyo Chae Yeon?

104
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:59,020
The beautiful HBS announcer, Gyo Chae Yeon's,
announcement of a surprise wedding became a hot issue.

105
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,820
This news is being announced to you by HBS's
'Dating Information Town.'

106
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,860
As the image of their affectionate entrance was released,
Announcer Gyo Chae Yeon's love news became much talked about.

107
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,480
The love news between the two set a record as the number one Internet search and was raised as a hot topic.

108
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,580
Also, today they announced their wedding plans.

109
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,040
CEO Lee Kang Joon and Gyo Chae Yeon, the rumors are
correct, right? That the two of you are getting married?

110
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,250
From the pictures taken of the two of you at the airport,
it's true that you were on a trip together, isn't it?

111
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,480
So that you can relax, hurry and tell us now.
Is it true that you will be marrying?

112
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:51,110
Well, first of all, I'm sorry for not telling you sooner
and for revealing it so suddenly.

113
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,380
Yes, we are getting married in three weeks.

114
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,100
Marriage... in three weeks?

115
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:08,340
Popular announcer Gyo Chae Yeon's marriage news,

116
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,050
with the image of new bride and groom on the horizon...

117
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,630
No.

118
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,120
Ajumma!

119
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,790
♫ Go, I don't want to listen anymore. ♫

120
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,620
♫ You don't want a woman like me. ♫

121
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,200
♫ You screamed while telling me to leave. ♫

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,910
♫ You, who wanted to end things, ♫

123
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,900
♫ I resented ♫

124
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,500
♫  Because I felt it was unfair ♫

125
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:20,370
♫  You said it so easily, like it's not a big deal,  ♫

126
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,070
♫ The words, "let's break up." ♫

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,050
You were married to me.

128
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,200
How many days has it been since the funeral that you already...

129
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,720
Was I nothing to you?

You won't be able to get married.

134
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,080
I will stop you.

135
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,610
♫  I didn't know♫

136

139
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,660

141
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:51,590
♫ Like other people, I couldn't break up.  ♫

142

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:21,810
♫ Even while knowing that this was farewell.  ♫

145
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,490
Why are you looking at this?

146
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,070
It's Gyo Chae Yeon right? What happened?

147
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,800
Did you two know each other? What kind of relationship?

148
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,980
Did you two have a special relationship?

149
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,810
What is your identity?

150
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,050
I thought that you were a doctor, but you are not! What is your identity?

151
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,090
Who is the person who operated on me?

152
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,000
The doctor who appeared on 'Change' is
my younger brother.

153
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,670
I heard of your story and asked him.
My brother operated on you.

154
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:06,120
Then why did you act like you are the doctor? You could've
told me that it was your brother from the beginning.

155
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,800
I didn't want questions like this to be asked.

156
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,340
There are words that I don't like to say.

157
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,300
Although I have over a thousand questions to ask you, I won't.

158
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,640
But I need to know one thing. Why did you do it for me?

159
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,350
You did a total body makeover, after service, delirium
treatment, diet and even exercise!

160
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,250
It's not easy. Why did you do it?!

161
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,570
I was going to sell you after making you pretty.
I'm a human trafficker.

162
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,910
Why would a human trafficker help with revenge?
It doesn't make sense.

163
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,770
Gyo Chae Yeon is the reason, right?

164
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,380
Were you dumped by her?

165
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,450
It's more complicated.

166
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,180
You got dumped.

167
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,570
She was stolen away from me!

168
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,630
Six of one, half a dozen of the other.
It's the same thing.

169
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,060
It's different! Your husband took Chae Yeon.

170
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,370
Anyway, your husband and Chae Yeon's
wedding can never happen.

171
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,230
That's good then.

172
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,470
What is?

173
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,540
We have something in common.

174
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,780
You don't want them to get married right?

175
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,000
Let's only think of that.

176
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,180
We only have three weeks until the two are married.
We don't much time.

177
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,390
Let's skip the previews and prologue and go
directly to the highlight.

178
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,330
Seduce Lee Kang Joon.

179
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:01,220
Go directly R-rated and use that to break up the marriage.

180
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:09,200
If you have the mind of General Lee Soo Shin,
who fought 130 ships with 12 ships, we can do anything.

181
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,960
"To retreat is instant death,"
was Lee Soo Shin's fearless mindset!

182
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,850
Okay?

183
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,130
I understand. In the game of go-stop,
you can lose everything trying to avoid one thing.

184
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,600
Don't be scared and go!

185
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,010
I like it!

186
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,050
Commemorating HBS Launch.
Children's Foundation Charity Fundraiser.

187
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,440
A man with the status of Lee Kang Joon
will not do something risky.

188
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,890
To seduce that kind of man, an official reason is the best way.

189
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:14,120
Attend Lee Kang Joon's party, as a VIP, in that dress.

190
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,570
V.I.P.

191
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,450
Ajumma, get your senses together. Relax. It shows.

192
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,720
What if he recognizes me?

193
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,520
He's my husband. It seems like he'll recognize me.

194
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,760
He won't be able to recognize you. You are perfect!

195
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,670
I get it.

196
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,710
But.. what do I do.

197
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,780
Think about what you like the most.

198
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,500
Kim Dduk Soo. Think about Kim Dduk Soo.

199
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,900
Kim Dduk Soo.
(Kimbap, Ddukbokki, Soondae)

200
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,930
Who is she?

201
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,460
Honey...

202
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,170
He saw you.

203
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,460
You remember the picture, right? Venus's neck line!

204
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,570
Sharon Stone's smile! Smile!

205
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,690
Now. Action!

206
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,420
What do I do?

207
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,260
This won't do, Ajumma.

208
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,950
Let's go to Plan B.

209
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,870
The hundred thousand dollars strategy?

210
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,020
If you donate hundred thousand dollars to the charity.
You will have a chance to talk to Lee Kang Joon alone.

211
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,230
Where do we have a hundred thousand dollars?

212
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,710
Is that the problem here?!

213
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,620
Okay, Ajumma.

214
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,200
Come here.

215
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,130
You said that you have a thousand things
that you are curious about me.

216
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,440
I'll tell you one thing.

217
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,910
It's about my identity.

218
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:07,580
You know which group has a tight grasp of entertainment, the
business of Eating Out Culture and even cultural arts in Korea.

219
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,550
Winner Group? HBS was taken over by Winner Group.

220
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,080
I am that Winner Group's son.

221
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,530
How is it? $100,000 wouldn't be anything much, right?

222
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,670
Ah, seriously.

223
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,460
Doctor, good job! Thank you.

224
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,610
I feel more relaxed now. Fibs are best
for releasing tension, right?

225
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,420
Ah, this ajumma. I'm serious.

226
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,440
Ajumma!

227
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,350
Now, isn't the time to be laughing.

228
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,810
In order to give you a bit of pressure,
I will announce the mid combined totals.

229
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:09,300
Total funds donated in HBS Founding Celebration charity event

230
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,240
exceeds $37,000.00

231
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,380
Thank you for the donations!

232
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,920
I am thankful for all the people that came today.
Please enjoy your time.

233
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,590
Thank you.

234
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,500
Donate the hundred thousand dollars.

235
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,040
If Lee Kang Joon tries to talk to you,
pretend to trip and make something happen.

236
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,540
Like we practiced.

237
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,720
A special person came today.

238
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,190
There is somebody who donated a hundred thousand dollars.

239
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,790
That person is named Sara. Could I introduce you, Sara?

240
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,600
Miss Sara.

241
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,240
You are Sara, right?

242
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,650
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Kang Joon.

243
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,680
Yes, nice to meet you. I'm Sara...

244
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,470
Are you alright?

245
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,960
Yes.

246
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,190
Ajumma, flirt with him!

247
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,110
Flirt!

248
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,540
Damn it!

249
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,360
Bring a warm cup of water and please find
us a few caramel candies.

250
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,420
It will work.

251
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,080
Honey, this is a warm caramel sweet.

252
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,510
This is the best remedy for hiccups.

253
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,130
Kang Joon.

254
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,220
TBS's CEO has arrived.

255
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,550
Excuse me. I thank you deeply for today.

256
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,520
Do you know how important that place was? How can you just leave?

257
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,250
Their relationship is too good.

258
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,950
Even though I'm this pretty.

259
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,960
He didn't even look at me.

260
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,190
You married before.

261
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,760
You know how happy you are three weeks before the wedding.

262
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,480
You should know that it won't be easy to get between them.

263
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,440
Why are you crying?

264
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,120
Your husband was taken away because you were too nice!

265
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:27,010
It's fine. We can work on him again when
Chae Yeon isn't near him.

266
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,810
Let's find a place when Lee Kang Joon would be alone.

267
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,940
Cheer up, Ajumma. You know we have three weapons.

268
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,800
We have Korea's best beauty and genius together,

269
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,560
and we also have the desperate drive
from the hole in our hearts!

270
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,400
Okay?

271
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,470
CEO, the dress for the bride is ready.

272
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,200
How is it?

273
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,670
It's pretty. Very.

274
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,580
Aren't you going to say the most important words?
I'm waiting for them.

275
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,870
Thank you.

276
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,900
You really don't say the words, "I love you."

277
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,240
You know even if I don't say it.

278
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,020
I don't know.

279
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,820
Chae Yeon and Oppa say that they've arrived
at the basement parking lot.

280
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,210
Really?

281
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,050
You are finally getting your wish!

282
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,310
You said that you wanted to cut steak and
watch opera with your daughter-in-law.

283
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,460
Are you happy now that you have a
sophisticated daughter-in-law?

284
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,470
If I answer twice, my mouth will hurt.
If I answer three times, I will run out of breath!

285
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,250
Do you think that I just like an announcer
who was Miss Korea just because of her status?

286
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,980
If Chae Yeon has a child, how amazing would those genes be?

287
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:34,460
Going around with Geum Ran, we only managed to
collect points in the markets.

288
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:41,020
If we go around with Chae Yeon, we'll be treated like
VIPs in the department stores.

289
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,650
Does she only have one or two good points?

290
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:47,210
Why are you bad mouthing a daughter-in-law who died?

291
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,020
I'm not bad mouthing.

292
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,400
I'm just saying the truth, Honey.

293
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,800
Then just say good things.

294
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,130
That's respect for the dead.

295
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,250
Yes.

296
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,900
I could only talk well about her
if there had been any good points.

297
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,980
She was good at housekeeping, Mom!

298
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,190
She played the piano quite well.

299
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,910
Right, Dad?

300
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,870
Piano?

301
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,190
-You're practicing, right?
-Yeah, yeah, let's start.

302
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,540
Yes.

303
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,390
Father-in-law.

304
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,980
Mother-in-law.

305
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,190
It broke!

306
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,710
Why are you like that?
- The chair broke!

307
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,790
The chair broke!

308
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,270
The chair broke!

309
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,570
You!

310
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,820
That was so funny.

311
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,850
Everyone was really serious back then.

312
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,480
But I was laughing so hard I thought I was going to die!

313
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,850
In order to not ruin the singing, she was working hard.

314
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,060
Why are you two laughing when she was being responsible?

315
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,220
Yes, of course, Dad.

316
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,680
Min Yeong, you!

317
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,200
It's Chae Yeon and Oppa.

318
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,300
Hello, Mother-in-law.

319
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,300
Fishing?

320
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,490
Before he left for America, my husband
always fished every Wednesday.

321
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,090
He is probably still fishing every week.

322
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,660
Have you ever fished before?

323
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,530
I always watch fishing programs every week.

324
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,050
This is my first time, but I'll try.

325
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,330
That's the right attitude!

326
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,190
I will try to gain confidence since I'm very pretty.

327
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,530
Of course! Of course! Easy as pie.

328
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:45,860
Let's fish out Lee Kang Joon like shooting fish in a barrel.

329
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,220
You need to succeed at skinship.

330
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,750
A woman's forward skinship

331
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,160
will make a man tense.

332
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,880
He will let his guard down.

333
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,750
But skillful skinship will work every time.

334
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,930
You can do it, ajumma!

335
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,200
What should I do?

336
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,550
Sara?

337
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,650
CEO Lee Kang Joo?

338
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,460
I'll help you.

339
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,960
Here.

340
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,630
You have to loosen your wrist.

341
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:21,940
Try to hold the handle as loosely as possible.

342
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:26,820
I will help you, so let's see how the fish come out.

343
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,880
Like this?

344
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,080
Okay, on three.

345
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,430
We two, at the same time, will lift the pole.

346
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,400
Here.

347
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,480
One, two, three.

348
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,280
Pull!

349
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,770
That's right! That's it! Hook him in.

350
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,080
Hook Lee Kang Joon well!

351
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,300
You caught a big one! You're amazing!

352
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,590
CEO, I'll carry it.

353
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,640
But...

354
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,420
Aigoo.

355
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:34,920
Why are you carrying it? Put it down!
Let your husband hold it!

356
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,740
It's heavy.

357
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,540
Oh, this is nothing.

358
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,710
Ajumma!

359
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,160
Aigoo.

360
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,860
You're very strong.

361
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,710
I don't have that much strength. But I suddenly
feel stronger because I ate eel.

362
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,700
The eel was very energetic. It was even moving inside
my stomach.  Eel is supposed to be an aphrodisiac.

363
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,600
Sa Geum Ran, what are you saying?
(Eel is supposed to be a man's aphrodisiac.)

364
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,830
(Eel is supposed to be a man's aphrodisiac.)

365
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,520
Oh my.

366
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,550
I'll do well.

367
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,780
No!

368
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,290
I'm doing well!

369
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,570
Aigo!

370
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,880
This...

371
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:06,020
If you do this, your husband will like it.

372
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,630
- Geum Ran!
- Grandmother!

373
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:12,090
I'm hungry. Let's mix rice and eat it together.

374
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,830
Shin Hee Ja

375
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,430
Is this yours?

376
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,560
It's my grandmother's.

377
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,900
She passed away last month.

378
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:33,530
She loved me, so I wanted to carry some part of her with me.

379
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,560
She passed away?

380
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,180
Your grandmother?

381
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,450
Yes.

382
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,780
You are so pretty!

383
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,800
Like this.

384
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,490
It's hot. Be careful.

385
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:10,690
You have to eat with the spoon!

386
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,910
Eat slowly.

387
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,850
It's hot!

388
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,570
It's delicious.

389
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,660
Are you crying?

390
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,180
Geum Ran!

391
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,520
Are you crying?

392
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,500
Why?

393
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,220
Kiss.

394
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,800
Don't cry.

395
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,230
Sara?

396
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,280
Here you go.

397
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,160
Grandmother!

398
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,720
No! What are you doing?

399
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,100
Sara!

400
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,550
Sara!

401
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,480
I found it! Here it is!

402
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,090
I found Grandmother's bracelet!

403
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:53,600
Aigoo, if she was going to fail,
she should have failed at something else.

404
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,480
Does she know how much I prepared for this for her to fail?

405
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,270
I should have known since her husband got taken away.

406
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,860
What can this kind of Ahumma do?

407
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:07,220
Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo.

408
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,430
Why did you do that?

409
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,200
Why did you run into the water?

410
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,060
I, too...

411
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,680
had a grandmother.

412
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,160
She had dementia,

413
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:37,290
but because I took care of her,

414
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,880
she was very special.

415
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,050
But since she passed away...

416
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,470
I'm sorry for surprising you.

417
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,140
Sara.

418
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,110
What kind of person are you?

419
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,070
Sara, you are a stunning beauty.

420
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:33,590
And that kind of woman donated
one hundred thousand dollars without a thought.

421
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:40,630
It was different. However, that was a twist
that I didn't need to pay attention to.

422
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,870
But now it is fishing.

423
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:52,290
And you ran into the water to save a bracelet.

424
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,300
The three sides of you are all different,

425
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,880
but there is a feeling that resides in all of them.

426
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,310
What is it?

427
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,110
A warm feeling.

428
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,270
Could we meet...

429
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,220
one more time?

430
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,860
What is this? They look somewhat sweet together.

431
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,120
Are they flirting?

432
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,230
That's right.

433
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,920
She did it!

434
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,790
Yes. Yes!

435
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,710
You didn't make this move,
but you were awesome, Ajumma.

436
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:21,240
You scored a date without any skinship!
Good job, good job!

437
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,600
I know, Doctor.

438
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,370
Oh, I'm still shaking. I still can't believe it.

439
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,600
My husband says he wants to get to know me.

440
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,670
He stared right at me.

441
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,910
My heart is still pounding.

442
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,850
Ajumma, you look really pretty.

443
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,090
What?

444
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,460
You're pretty.

445
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,030
You are really pretty.

446
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,080
Is that so?

447
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:21,290
Thank you, Doctor. It's all because of you.

448
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:29,730
Did you get elected to be a member of the Assembly
or something? Why are you so thankful?

449
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:34,650
It's because I'm really thankful!
If it comes from the heart, it's like this.

450
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,420
Anyway, it's fine since we got to Seoul.
(We achieved our objective.)

451
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,680
Let's move on to the next step.

452
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,570
The date is this Sunday.
Seduce Lee Kang Joon with powerful skinship.

453
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,690
We'll make Chae Yeon see that, and
let's also plant some reporters.

454
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,760
"Director of HBS is found two-timing."

455
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,600
"He's the one who left his devoted wife."
We're going to light up a scandal!

456
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,270
Then Lee Kang Joon will be ruined,
and we'll be successful in our revenge.

457
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,190
We just barely succeeded!

458
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,560
We just barely succeeded. Barely.

459
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,200
Ajumma, what's wrong?

460
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,970
Perhaps, plastic surgery regret?

461
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,140
Nothing.

462
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,760
What is it?

463
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:36,430
It's nothing. I'm going to go get some fresh air.

464
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,180
Huh?

465
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,170
This weekend we can destroy your husband.
Why is your face like that?

466
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,200
What is it, Ajumma?

467
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,130
Tell me.

468
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,610
Truthfully, Doctor...

469
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:29,600
I don't have any thoughts about seeking revenge.

470
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,520
What?

471
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:36,650
I don't want to seek revenge against my husband.

472
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:40,110
That part of my heart disappeared.

473
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:41,680
Then...

474
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,090
Then what!

475
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,100
I knew it when I saw that person's eyes.

476
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:56,330
I truthfully still love my husband.

477
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,120
I want to be his wife again.

478
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,760
Not Goo Chae Young, I want to go to
my in-laws as their daughter-n-Law again.

479
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:14,580
Ah, there must be something wrong with my ear.
I didn't hear that.

480
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:19,650
Ajumma... what did you just say?

481
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,830
I want to be his wife again.

482
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,290
Ajumma, don't you look in the mirror?

483
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,120
You should know how pretty you are.

484
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:35,980
With this beauty... you want to be that family's kitchen staff?

485
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:41,820
If you have the heart, you can have any man.
Why is it still that guy?

486
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,460
Why that bad man?!

487
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:50,100
He's the only man who swore to God that
he would love me "till death do us part."

488
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,340
In my entire life, there won't be another man.

489
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,850
I felt like he was thinking about me.

490
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,420
I'm the one who told him how to stop hiccups.

491
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,340
It's just because I'm dead. I'm sure he thinks of me.

492
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,620
Oh my god!

493
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,880
You have nothing to lose, either.

494
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,620
How do I not have anything to lose? Why don't you
think of the things I did for you?

495
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:20,980
If I seduce my husband and marry him,
Goo Chae Yeon will be single.

496
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,730
Then you can get Goo Chae Yeon. Won't that do?

497
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:42,760
Hello?

498
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,860
Oh, Ji Hoon.

499
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,780
Hey, Brother! I arrived back in Korea.

500
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,970
Oh, I'm at the airport.

501
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,980
You're coming home? Right now?

502
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,070
Why are you like this? Who's coming?

503
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:36,920
The house owner! The house owner! Hurry up and run away.

504
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,430
This wasn't your house?!

505
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,000
This isn't my home. Hurry, hurry! Pack!

506
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,330
What is this. You're not a doctor,
and this isn't your house either?

507
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:50,460
Just hurry up and pack your things!

508
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,950
He's a total fraud! Everything is a lie.
Nothing about you is true!

509
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:57,400
Why do you keep talking about "Kim Seon Dal"?

510
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,500
Who's Kim Seon Dal?

511
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,140
Oh, Miss, you're pretty. Get in.

512
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:28,240
No, but thank you. Thank you.

513
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,860
Aren't going to go, boy!!

514
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,540
Even a young man like that likes you.

515
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,350
Even then you still want to go and cook for in-laws?

516
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,960
Fine. Do as you want.

517
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,620
Anyway, I just need Chae Yeon's and
Lee Kang Joon's wedding to be broken.

518
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,480
Get up.

519
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,620
- Why?
- You said you wanted to enter your in-laws place?

520
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:18,150
To catch a tiger, you must go into the den!

521
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,220
You live in this house? But the place is...

522
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:52,370
That's right. Over there. The house that we
see down there. That's your in-law's house, isn't it?

523
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:57,470
You keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

524
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:00,080
The Art of War strategy.

525
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:05,540
Hide nearby, and let's catch the tiger.

526
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,370
Ah, I feel like I'm going to die.

527
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:18,060
Performance for the Benefit of Incurable Diseases

528
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,920
What's wrong with her?

529
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:00,250
For what you did back there, thank you.

530
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:03,780
If you hadn't helped, we would've been in trouble.

531
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,190
You play the piano well. Earlier I saw that
you didn't even look at the sheet music.

532
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:11,910
I learned it as a hobby.

533
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,790
It's nice to meet you. I'm Sara.

534
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,550
I'm Lee Jeong Sik.

535
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:24,330
Volunteering should be done like the shade of a shadow.

536
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:29,260
Oh my, that's my husband's motto.

537
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:34,630
The image of you always exercising thrift and
conservation left an impression, so I joined as a member.

538
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,360
Please take care of me.

539
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,620
For a young person, you're amazing.

540
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:43,670
Nowadays, young people have no interest
in community service. Isn't that so, Honey?

541
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:47,290
We come here every weekend. So, see you again.

542
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,690
I, too...

543
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,280
had a grandmother.

544
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,410
She had dementia,

545
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:24,960
but because I took care of her,

546
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,280
she was special to me.

547
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:32,220
But since she passed away...

548
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,360
This is the schedule for this week's broadcast.

549
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,970
It's holds the meaning of using small breaks

550
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,280
to have coffee together.

551
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,900
Kang Joon.

552
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,330
Is something wrong?

553
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:05,830
Nothing. I was just thinking of something else.

554
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:23,660
I brought some rice cake.
I moved into the house up there.

555
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,260
Oh, yes.

556
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,250
Dad!

557
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,470
Why did you come out?

558
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,800
Wait a moment.

559
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,410
You are...

560
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,590
Do you know each other?

561
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,900
She moved into that house up there.

562
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,120
Really?

563
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,550
Oh, hello.

564
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,080
Why aren't you guys coming in? Your father
is going to complain that the food is not ready.

565
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,640
Oh, you came?

566
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:17,400
Oh my... It seems like we met before.

567
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,860
Yes, Madam. Hello.

568
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,100
Hello.

569
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:37,160
The woman who helped with the performance turns out
to be our neighbor... That's quite an amazing coincidence.

570
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:41,160
Honey, from now on let's ask that young lady for help
with the performance accompaniment.

571
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,110
That sounds good.

572
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:46,070
Her name is Sara, you said?

573
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,600
She lived in America, it seems.

574
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,700
I heard that she attended the HBS charity event

575
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,660
that you created.

576
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,830
Oppa.

577
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:59,460
That woman has a pretty face, but her body is amazing too!

578
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:03,150
She's skinny, but the parts that need to be out are out,
and the parts that need to be in are in!

579
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,200
Her body is awesome.

580
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,950
Sara

581
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,650
Lee Kang Joon

582
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:05,040
Ajumma.

583
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,210
It's your husband.

584
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,480
I heard that you moved.

585
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,820
The white house that you came to earlier is my house.

586
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,180
How could that be! What a coincidence. How amazing.

587
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:36,050
How could that be? What a coincidence. How amazing.

588
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,150
I know we originally planned to have dinner on the weekend,

589
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,800
but since you became my neighbor,
should we see each other for a moment?

590
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,070
Chae Yeon

591
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:27,690
The person you called is not answering the phone.
You will be directed to voicemail.

592
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,640
Kang Joon, you're not home?

593
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,270
I'll stop by your house, since the broadcast ended early.

594
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:38,100
I brought some opera tickets that your parents will like.

595
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,410
Sara.

596
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,360
CEO!

597
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,230
Honey...

598
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:36,390
An old essay by Mr. Yoo Ahn Jin, called "To Dream
of a Sweet and Noble Friendship", comes to mind.

599
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,940
The story is about a person's fantasy concerning someone
who lives very close-by and that he wants to see.

600
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,700
Person that you want to see?

601
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:55,590
Are you saying that to me?

602
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,250
Yes.

603
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,900
I started to want to see you, Sara.

604
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,860
Kang Joon?

605
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,550
What you see is not everything.

606
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:06,500
If you want to know how is the current situation
that is happening in front of your eyes,

607
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,090
know the past.

608
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:11,900
The present is the result of the past.

609
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,040
Then the future...

610
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,930
Our future...

611
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:24,260
cannot be predicted.

612
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:34,080
♬ Oh I'm in love with you, it seems like we fit the puzzle♬

613
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:38,840
♬ Oh I'm in love with you. You are my ideal type. ♬

614
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,770
♬ I never noticed that the sky was so beautiful and blue. ♬

615
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:44,210
Preview

616
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,000
Chae Yeon is a step ahead of you.

617
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,270
One-night stand?!

618
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:49,400
That's the only thing that can send Chae Yeon away with one punch.

619
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,530
Yes! Awesome!

620
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,660
Ajumma!

621
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,530
I get to sleep with my husband? I like it so much!

622
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:58,670
Let's stop here. I want to cherish you.

623
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:02,480
Why would you cherish? If you do, everything
will become like poop. Don't cherish.

624
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,400
This is Tae Hee Oppa. Han Tae Hee. Because of a
situation, we grew up in one house together.

625
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,240
- I heard a lot about you. I'm Lee Kang Joon.
- I'm Han Tae Hee.

626
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,680
Don't you dare touch Chae Yeon.

627
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,600
If you meet Gyo Chae Yeon, I won't leave you alone.

628
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,560
There was a woman named Sa Geum Ran.

629
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,380
- Sa Geum Ran?
- She was Kang Joon's ex-wife, but she killed herself.

630
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:22,640
Kang Joon threw away his wife, who was
taking care of his parents, for me.

631
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,340
What are you to him? A one night stand?

632
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:29,010
Beauty, brains, and desperation.
We can do it! Just go for it!

633
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,110
I can do it!

634
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:32,740
At night, all sultry like...

635
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:38,300
Suicide? Why is it suicide? Not an accident?

636
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,160
Sara, are you okay?

637
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:44,780
When I think about it, there was a car next to
