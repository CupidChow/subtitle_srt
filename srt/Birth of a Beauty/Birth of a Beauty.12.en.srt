Episode 12

2
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,920
Why didn't you tell me about Lee Kang Joon's release?

3
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,660
I didn't want to make you afraid.

4
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,320
I wanted to protect you.

5
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,530
There is something I want to hear from you.

6
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,380
A word that begins with the letter 'L'.

7
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,770
For me to love someone again,

8
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,240
it's a scary thing to me.

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,860
Hurry and tell me.

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,710
But, if it's you,

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,880
The words that I want to hear.

12
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,620
I love you.

13
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,800
♫ Even though nothing has happened. ♫

14
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,500
♫ Even though I'm not sad. ♫

15
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:59,050
♫ It hurts without a reason. It feels like something's missing. ♫

16
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,620
♫ I don't know what it is. ♫

17
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:08,800
♫ It feels like my heart is completely empty. ♫

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,700
♫ Nothing feels joyful. ♫

19
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,890
♫ Each one of my days without you, ♫

20
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:26,660
Ajumma, why did you fall asleep here?
♫ I had no idea how hard it would be. ♫

21
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,750
♫ I think I must have liked you a lot. ♫

22
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:39,420
♫ I think I must have loved you a lot. ♫

23
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,760
♫ I miss you more than you could imagine. ♫

24
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,280
♫ Your face, the way you speak, everything. ♫

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,930
♫ If perhaps, you feel the same way I do, then just like me, ♫

26
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,920
Since the husband she trusted for eight years killed her,
♫ if perhaps, you're hurting a lot also. ♫

27
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,040
just seeing his face would scare her.

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,120
♫ I want to be embraced in your arms. ♫

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,990
♫ Without you, I'm nothing. ♫

30
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,690
♫ Because I love you. ♫

31
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,200
Doctor.

32
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,270
Doctor.

33
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,910
Why are you sleeping here?

34
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,310
You slept in my room, too.

35
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,300
Now we are even.

36
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,360
Ajumma, you don't know this, right?

37
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,940
Last night, you didn't have a nightmare.

38
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,890
It seemed like you were having a nightmare
for the whole night last time.

39
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,640
Was that so?

40
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,550
That's right. After Lee Kang Joon
searched the house and left,

41
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,600
I thought I was definitely going to have
nightmares the whole night.

42
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,650
You don't know the reason, right?

43
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,970
When you were sleeping,

44
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,210
I held your hand.

45
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,160
Seeing how you don't have nightmares when I'm around,

46
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,250
you have no choice, but to have me sleep with you.

47
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,740
- What do you think?
- Huh?!

48
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,030
You can't.

49
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,880
I can't? Why can't I?

50
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,890
Don't you remember?!

51
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,550
It's okay. I won't gobble you up.

52
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
It wasn't that long ago that you came on to me
like you wanted to sleep with me.

53
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,340
What's the difference between then and now?
Then, I did, so why can't I now?

54
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,700
Tell me what's the difference!

55
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,910
Ajumma, what are you thinking of right now?

56
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,420
I have pure intentions to protect you from your nightmares.

57
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,130
By chance...

58
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,850
Were you thinking of something "adult?"

59
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,420
You're a sly devil, you are!

60
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,170
It's not!

61
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,620
What do you mean no when your face is turning red.

62
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,780
Because it's early morning, so the sun is shining on it!

63
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,140
Ah seriously, I don't know. Get out quickly!

64
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,060
Seriously.

65
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,740
Actually, you were troubled by
nightmares all night long.

66
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,790
My eyes met with our husband's. It was truly frightening.

67
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,740
Since the husband saw the revenge plans,
he won't stand still.

68
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,300
He's going to start suspecting you.

69
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,760
What's he thinking? He probably
doesn't think I'm Sa Geum Ran, right?

70
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,360
It won't ever be that. There's no one
who has found that out up to now.

71
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,500
Don't be scared! Our husband is a bad man,
so he's scary. That's true.

72
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,700
But still. Let's not be scared.

73
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,010
He's the one who sinned, not me.

74
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,400
That's right. There's no reason for me to be scared.

75
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,980
When you feel scared, think of
all the things I went through.

76
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,820
Being in the car accident and
falling into the cold sea water.

77
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,470
I crawled up that high cliff.

78
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,440
It's not easy to survive that. It's uncommon.

79
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,680
Plus, on top of that, general anesthesia ten times.

80
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,370
I received anesthesia so much
that I even had delirium.

81
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,380
The fact that we're enduring like this is amazing.

82
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,230
Do you know where our strength to endure comes from?

83
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,570
It's because I'm an ajumma.

84
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,730
I'm good with a knife. And everyone I meet
instantly becomes a brother or sister to me.

85
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,410
If I get angry, my eyes flip inside out, and I can't see anything—an ajumma on the same level as a gangster thug.

86
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,790
Now that I know that Lee Kang Joon is a bad man,
I can deal with it.

87
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,650
I will protect my love and my mom too.

88
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,650
We're going for it.

89
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,860
What were you going to tell me?

90
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,410
Things were going so well for us,
so how did we become such a mess?

91
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,270
I feel like I've lost even my last (ace) card.

92
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:30,470
Why this happened... I thought all night
about the things that happened to us.

93
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,930
So?

94
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,000
The things that happened to us during this time,

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,150
and the things that happened to you...

96
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,590
All these things that happened to us,
could they all be a coincidence?

97
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,550
You were even arrested for murdering Sa Geum Ran.

98
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,610
All of those events happened in too timely and too
short of a span in time for them to be a coincidence.

99
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,720
It seems like someone's plan.

100
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,570
I found documents regarding me at Sara's house.

101
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:07,620
It's not Sara. Would Sara report you
to the police out of jealousy?

102
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,630
You killing Sa Geum Ran, how would Sara know?

103
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,540
It doesn't make sense.

104
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,640
Then who is it?

105
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,460
Someone who hates us to death.

106
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,170
Sa Geum Ran!

107
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,030
But Sa Geum Ran is dead.

108
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,330
There's another person who has that much of a motive.

109
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,740
Tae Hee Oppa. Tae Hee Oppa, he loves me.

110
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,210
That's why he wanted to stop the wedding with you.

111
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,710
Oppa Tae Hee, who envies us,
and Sa Geum Ran who loathes us...

112
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,540
We need to find the connection between the two of them.

113
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,670
For now, you find out who reported you to the police.

114
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,620
If the one behind it really is Tae Hee Oppa,

115
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,640
then after that, we just need to figure out
Oppa Tae Hee's relationship to Sa Geum Ran.

116
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,780
When you, a murderer, attacks Oppa Tae Hee,

117
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,210
I will protect Oppa Tae Hee and become his savior.

118
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,080
I will never give up on Tae Hee Oppa.

119
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,690
There we go.

120
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,520
You can't see my face at all?

121
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,170
The best costume is one where you can't be seen at all.

122
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,710
Because of Lee Kang Joon?

123
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,650
It's fine when I'm around. But it bothers me to think that
you might run into Lee Kang Joon when you're by yourself.

124
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,490
Here, this is a means of assistance.

125
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,610
I've equipped it with a GPS locator,

126
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,580
so that I can find you anytime I want.
No matter where you are.
- Oh.

127
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,990
It's a completely impenetrable in-depth defense.

128
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,460
There's no need to be scared. I'm here, right?

129
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,440
Lee Kang Joon will never harm you again!

130
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,190
Doctor, you can go now; nothing will happen.

131
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,830
Always stay mixed in where there are a lot of people,
and go directly to the recording location.

132
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,880
Don't forget the walkie talkie.

133
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,040
Sara? Why are you so bundled up today?

134
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,620
It's because she's a celebrity! It's the "celebrity disease."

135
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,860
CEO,

136
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,290
what did the Prosecutor Han say?

137
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,250
The one who reported you
is a man named, Choi Yong Suk.

138
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,240
He's Han Tae Hee's secretary.

139
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,090
You can go now. Yes, okay.

140
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,090
It's true that Han Tae Hee reported me.

141
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,500
So one of our deductions was correct.

142
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,360
Oppa Tae Hee made us this way.

143
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,190
Now, if we can just figure out how Oppa Tae Hee
and Sa Geum Ran are involved,

144
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,300
our mystery will be solved.

145
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,160
The elder doesn't want to eat.

146
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,460
I think it's a good idea to take anything to the study room.

147
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,780
Let's do that. However,

148
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,090
if she's forced to eat when she doesn't want to,
she'll become ill.

149
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,110
Don't force her to eat.

150
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,980
Let's eat, Min Hyeok.

151
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,440
Those vile ones.

152
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,520
Since she was released for medical reasons,
to be treated at home,

153
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,340
we have no official arguments to make?

154
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,540
Then, we have to find a way
to bring Grandmother home safely,

155
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,080
no matter what.

156
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,080
There is a way for us to file for an injunction at the court.

157
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,710
- Will I be able to see her then?
- We can submit a request.

158
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,770
However, there is a very low chance of Han Min Hyeok complying.

159
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:33,010
We have to try! We have to try everything!

160
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,590
Hello.

161
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,540
I'm chef challenger, Sara

162
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,300
After today's filming, your cooking will be introduced.

163
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,140
Oh my, I'm so excited.

164
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,140
The judges are from Jong Ga House's daughters-in-law.

165
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,740
Sara, you should be nervous.

166
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,660
I'll prepare for it diligently.

167
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,230
- Now, the camera rehearsal is going to start.
- Okay, let's go!

168
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,670
-What's wrong?
-The fact that you're going to challenge the chef is pathetic,

169
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,410
because this isn't for a celebrity.

170
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,070
I feel like you're going to be very humiliated.

171
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,320
Right now, are you worrying about me?

172
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,420
Then, I should worry about you too.

173
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,200
I heard you got hit by your husband.

174
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,120
What is marriage to you two?

175
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,060
Your husband is having an affair with me, and

176
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,620
you, Gyo Chae Yeon, are holding onto Han Tae Hee.

177
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,950
Since marriage was so easy,

178
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,690
that's why you tore apart someone else's marriage.

179
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,090
If you like Han Tae Hee,

180
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,000
you should divorce first and then call for him,

181
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,620
married woman, Gyo Chae Yeon.

182
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,250
I want to reveal that you're Sa Geum Ran right away,

183
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,290
but I'm going to endure it.

184
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,410
You can't end it with Lee Kang Joon yet.

185
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,810
When you become really famous,

186
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,950
I'm going to reveal your affair to the world.

187
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,680
After that, I'll become a pitiful victim.

188
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,460
Sara, I'm going to make blood run down your eyes.

189
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,600
I'll make sure that I get to see that happen.

190
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,560
Today's main dishes are abalone and chicken.

191
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,700
With the two ingredients, we are to choose
how to cook them on our own.

192
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,290
- I'll make a special chicken soup.
- Special chicken soup?

193
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,710
The ingredients are hedysarum, chicken...

194
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,680
Look there! Chicken!

195
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,840
Hey, Tae Hee Hyung!

196
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,280
Oh. Hey, Ji Hoon!

197
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,690
Is this person 'A J M'?

198
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,970
What are you talking about?

199
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,310
Hello, Sister-in-law.

200
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,880
Sister-in-law?

201
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,370
In-law?

202
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,590
I'm Gyo Ji Hoon.

203
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,910
I grew up with Tae Hee in the same house
from the time we were little.

204
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,430
I really wanted to meet you.

205
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,950
A J M, in other words,

206
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,860
is my future sister-in-law.

207
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,040
Hey!

208
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,900
You can't just use the word sister-in-law so easily!

209
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,150
You can end up embarrassing a person
who has no marital relationship!

210
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,090
Only the people who are family related
should be using those kind of terms.

211
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,610
Why do you take my comment so seriously?

212
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,570
It's so obvious. You're my older brother
and she's my sister-in-law.

213
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,580
Shopping for groceries together
is only what married couples do.

214
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,440
Married couples?

215
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,280
Sara definitely wrote that.

216
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,410
The timing of that was unbelievable.

217
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,010
It can't be a coincidence.

218
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,190
There's no way it isn't a coincidence.

219
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,350
An eavesdropping device?

220
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,290
- I'm home.
- Kang Joon, you're home!

221
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,070
Kang Joon, you...

222
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,510
Are you proceeding with the building matter
like I told you to?

223
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,930
I'm in the middle of a discussion about it with Mother.

224
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,810
What?!

225
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,660
Kang Joon, I have something to say.
Can you come see me?

226
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,240
What? They're not fighting anymore?

227
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,780
I really can't figure out their relationship.

228
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,140
They fought so much, but now they've made up?

229
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,600
Seeing this, Geum Ran was indeed
the best to live with.

230
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,790
An eavesdropping device?

231
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,570
They went this far to separate us.

232
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,290
And, it worked according to Oppa Tae Hee's plan.

233
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,050
Han Tae Hee.

234
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,830
Do you remember

235
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,650
what I said at the beach?

236
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,800
I saw you here before,

237
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,230
the day your previous wife died.

238
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,280
Don't worry.

239
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,000
I felt the same way.

240
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,360
We're destined to be together.

241
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,740
Since you and I are both realists,

242
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,020
let's temporarily set aside our feelings of dislike
that we've had for each other lately.

243
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,700
Let's figure out Tae Hee and
Sa Geum Ran's relationship.

244
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,850
Let's work together.

245
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,990
We have to figure out everything about their relationship.

246
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,390
Tell me the situation at Tae Hee Oppa's company,
and Sa Geum Ran's weaknesses...

247
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,950
Tell me everything you know.

248
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,190
Married couple?

249
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,520
Married couple?

250
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,440
Married couple?

251
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,040
Honestly,

252
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,340
when you heard the word 'married couple,'
you were embarrassed right?

253
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,580
Even the word 'sister-in-law' was astonishing.

254
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,010
So, the word 'married couple'
was even more surprising.

255
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,200
But frankly,

256
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,040
don't we look like a married couple?

257
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,980
I wasn't that surprised.

258
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,160
It seems like you were.

259
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,420
You weren't surprised?

260
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,190
I was worried that you wouldn't feel good about it,
so I looked at you.

261
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,770
Why would I feel bad?

262
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,880
Doctor, you're a bachelor while I'm an ajumma.

263
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,420
You said so.

264
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,800
You were worrying about how you would
get married with me around.

265
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,510
Well, we've already cleared that up.

266
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,110
I've already accepted you as Sa Geum Ran.

267
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,870
And, you've accepted the fact that you're single now.

268
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,610
I thought you would be more uncomfortable
when you heard that.

269
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,090
No! Not at all.

270
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,420
Then, was it good to hear?

271
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,940
What about you, Doctor?

272
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,960
I felt good.

273
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,430
What about you, Ajumma?

274
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,250
I felt okay with it too.

275
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,280
Oh, really?

276
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,340
So you're saying that you liked to hear the
word 'married couple,' right?

277
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,150
While we're on this subject,

278
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,570
do you want to experience what it actually
feels like to be a married couple?

279
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,080
In order for us to see if we're compatible
as a married couple.

280
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,600
You already said we're like a couple, so why this?

281
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,790
So we can experience things
that we've never done before.

282
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,510
Just like real newlyweds. Hmm?

283
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,680
It's okay.

284
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,610
Is that so?

285
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,830
Do we look good together?

286
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,780
Of course!

287
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,330
Our chemistry puts even Brangelina's (Brad Pitt and
Angelina Jolie) chemistry to shame.

288
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,970
Say, "Ah."

289
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,590
Ah.

290
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,310
You say, "Ah," too.

291
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,300
We're newlyweds...

292
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,430
Say, "Dear."

293
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,360
Dear? I'm getting goosebumps.

294
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,680
Hey! That insensitive "ajumma standard" is coming out again.

295
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,110
Newlyweds usually are about goosebumps (act nauseating).

296
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,440
Newlyweds are so nauseating that they do
even more goosebump-worthy acts than just this!

297
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,950
Hurry...

298
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,890
Dear, ah.

299
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,360
Ah.

300
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:57,520
I'm asking, since the topic of couples and families came up, but...

301
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,690
What do you think about children?

302
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,090
- Children?
- Yeah.

303
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,150
- Do you want to have children?
- Yes.

304
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:10,190
I was an only child, so I want to have many children.

305
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,380
Me, too.

306
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,180
Then do you want a daughter or a son?

307
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,310
Son.

308
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,270
If I have a daughter, she'll probably have a hard life like me.

309
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,480
I also want a son. Sons can protect their mothers.

310
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,040
Sons are dependable too.

311
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,660
Who do you want him to resemble?

312
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,810
If we have a boy, he has to resemble you.

313
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,090
What about the daughter?

314
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:51,020
If we have a daughter, she has to resemble me.

315
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,230
Ah seriously.

316
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,380
The daughter should also resemble me.

317
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,120
How could...

318
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,250
Are you going to be like this?

319
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,450
Hey!

320
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,780
Why are you suddenly like this?

321
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,590
It's not that.

322
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,560
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,390
Why are you like this?! Huh?

324
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,460
I've come to my senses.

325
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,260
What marriage? What couple?

326
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,950
You seem completely startled.

327
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,370
To me getting married and becoming a couple isn't...

328
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,810
a story that I can leisurely laugh about.

329
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,480
Since he's a bachelor, he's all smiles, but...

330
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,610
I've already been married before.

331
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,600
Of course, you have, and it was a complete failure.

332
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,390
How could I smile about becoming a married couple again?

333
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,180
I'm different from him.

334
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:22,080
You still smiled for a bit.

335
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,570
I did.

336
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,200
That's because it still felt nice.

337
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,400
But I'm still a married woman. Legally, it hasn't been settled yet.

338
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,270
You're right, but why are you so angry?

339
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,020
I know, right?

340
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,570
Why am I like this?

341
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,510
Isn't it because you're angry that you
can't imagine such a sweet thing?

342
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:53,110
Of course I can't. I'm not supposed to.

343
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,200
If I was really Sara and Kim Deuk Soo, I would be happy.

344
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,880
Then I, too, can enjoy marriage.

345
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,200
But to Sa Geum Ran, who failed in marriage,

346
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,970
marriage is definitely not a joking matter.

347
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,980
Isn't that so?

348
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,170
You're right.

349
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,530
I'm not going to dance to his tune anymore.

350
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,760
No, I can't go along with him.

351
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,880
I'm an ajumma. And there are a thousand things I need to resolve.

352
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,010
- Ajumma, where are you going?!
- Ah, you scared me!

353
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,600
Where are you going so early?

354
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,670
Today's the first day of the cooking competition.

355
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,630
I'm going to practice at the restaurant before I go.

356
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:54,940
I also have to go to cooking class. I'm busy today.

357
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,340
I'll give you a ride there.

358
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,860
That's alright.

359
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,150
Why are you being like this?

360
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,680
It's not that.

361
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,820
I'll just go by myself today.

362
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,170
There's a lot to do.

363
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,060
Ajumma, did I do something wrong?

364
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,300
Tell me, why are you like this?

365
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:29,500
It's correct that we're dating, but it would be nice if we
kept an appropriate distance between us.

366
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,910
It's burdensome if we become close so suddenly,

367
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:38,490
like last night.

368
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,260
What?

369
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,860
Huh?

370
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,350
So you're saying that it has become awkward
with Sister-in-law because of me?

371
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,670
Stop the sister-in-law talk! It's all your fault!

372
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,060
You were prematurely pushing with the sister-in-law bit
and married couple relationship, so she was repulsed.

373
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,860
She doesn't like marriage.

374
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,780
I know what's wrong now.

375
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,960
Hyung, did you propose?

376
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,940
You haven't, right?

377
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,610
Propose?

378
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,420
This, this is it.

379
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,050
You haven't even proposed.

380
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,340
Yet, you keep talking about marriage and married couples.
Of course, Sister-in-law would be angry!

381
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,370
The process is very important to women.

382
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,820
Just make up your mind,

383
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,040
don't be vague,

384
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,130
and propose!

385
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,290
When do I have to propose?

386
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,840
The moment you want to get married!

387
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,480
When is the moment that I want to get married?

388
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,780
I don't know that,

389
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,240
since I've never been married either.

390
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,030
I brought some more vegetables.

391
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,600
You're competing in a cooking competition?

392
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,500
I want to try it.

393
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,740
Today's the first day of recording for the competition.

394
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,650
Wow, you're so cool! Congratulations, Sara.

395
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,730
I...

396
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:36,120
asked to see you because I wanted to tell
you to be careful of Lee Kang Joon.

397
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,040
It would be good if you don't meet him for awhile.

398
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,490
Don't do the placard demonstrations either.

399
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:47,180
There are many things making Lee Kang Joon
quite sensitive recently, so please be extra careful.

400
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,100
Thank you for purposefully taking care of us.

401
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,670
You also hold your cup like that?

402
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,850
Geum Ran held her cup like that too.

403
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,970
What? Really?

404
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,240
Because of judo, Geum Ran's fingers always hurt.

405
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,620
So it was her habit of trying to warm her fingers on her mug.

406
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,820
Are we taking up too much of your time?

407
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,320
Since today's an important day, go first.

408
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,710
Gyeong Joo and I will take our time.

409
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:34,980
Because of the recording time, I'll go first,
if it's not a discourtesy.

410
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,800
Please do.

411
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,350
I have a coupon.

412
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,910
How can a young lady whose face is so pretty,
also sure to remember such things.

413
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:03,560
I think of Geum Ran when I see that girl,

414
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,120
even though they don't look anything alike.

415
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,300
Mom...

416
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,230
Ah, I remember something because you mentioned Geum Ran.

417
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:27,390
Geum Ran would be startled if she saw this dish.

418
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,130
Peanuts! She had a peanut allergy.

419
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,640
Don't worry about bad guys. I will appear and rescue you again.

420
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,440
My name is Han Tae Hee. I know your daughter well.

421
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,540
He said he knows Geum Ran.

422
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,460
What? Who?

423
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,110
The man who saved me, Han Tae Hee.

424
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,790
He talked about Geum Ran,

425
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,120
but then he said he's Sara's manager.

426
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,040
Does Sara know Geum Ran as well, then?

427
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:07,500
- I really hope you enjoyed the tasting here.
- Thank you, thank you.

428
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,030
Okay, bye.

429
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,520
How can you be so fun to talk with, Sara?

430
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,870
Am I asking you an obvious question?

431
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,520
- Mother.
- Oh, Min Hyeok.

432
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,640
Miss Sara.

433
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,190
What's going on? Do you know each other?

434
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,220
You two know each other?

435
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,500
This is Sara. And, this is my mom.

436
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,910
It was you who invited Sara?

437
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:39,120
So you had a reason to make me come, even though
I said I'm not interested in cooking.

438
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,700
Yes.

439
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,880
Thank you for coming to see us. It's a small gift.

440
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,840
I brought the two people I like the most in one spot.

441
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,700
Sara, was the food okay?

442
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:59,100
It was amazing.

443
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,500
It's my first time coming to a VIP tasting.

444
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,970
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

445
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:09,380
No, it's alright.

446
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,660
This is to express my gratitude.

447
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,050
You weren't able to taste the food.

448
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,330
Thank you for today.

449
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,130
So there are times when you're interested in a woman?

450
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,180
For now, I half approve of her.

451
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,270
I feel good about Sara.

452
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,340
But it's mainly because this is the first time
I've seen you like this.

453
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,810
I'm not worried about the remaining half.

454
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,620
If Sara comes one more time,

455
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,580
the remaining half will be resolved too.

456
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,920
Look at this kid. You're completely smitten!

457
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,240
This is Tae Hee Oppa's phone number.

458
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,040
Sister-in-law, Mom wants to see you

459
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,070
about the building.

460
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,620
Doctor, you have a call!

461
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,530
Lee Kang Joon?

462
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,650
This is Sara.

463
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,730
Why are you looking for Han Tae Hee?

464
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,710
Talk with me.

465
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,150
This has nothing to do with Han Tae Hee?

466
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,670
I collected the documents I had about you in my room

467
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,390
because I like you.

468
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,550
You have no reason to meet with Han Tae Hee.

469
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,490
Do you know who this woman is or not?

470
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,950
- Why are you asking?
- You must know

471
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,690
because Han Tae Hee knows Sa Geum Ran.

472
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,690
Sa Geum Ran and Han Tae Hee . . .
What is their relationship?

473
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,170
Answer me.

474
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,450
I don't know.

475
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,610
You really don't know?

476
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,800
I don't know.

477
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,810
Then I will ask Han Tae Hee myself.

478
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,800
I said Han Tae Hee doesn't know anything!

479
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,400
I need to find out what kind of relationship
Han Tae Hee and Sa Geum Ran have.

480
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,600
And you, keep this in mind.

481
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,240
Since I was born, you are the first woman

482
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,300
who I thought I loved.

483
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,360
I won't let this end easily.

484
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,040
Got it?

485
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,700
Where did you go without telling me?

486
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,340
Ajumma!

487
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,350
What's going on?

488
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:10,390
I went to the restaurant because of the cooking competition.

489
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,310
Then you should have told me. I was worried!

490
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,690
You left the walkie talkie and you didn't answer
your phone. Why did you do that?

491
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,790
We're at war with Lee Kang Joon!
Why are you making me worry?

492
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,320
Is it because you said we should keep our distance?

493
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,320
If it's because I approached you quickly, then, don't worry.

494
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,980
Until you say I can come closer to you, I won't even touch you.

495
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,860
I understand.

496
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,230
Sa Geum Ran and Han Tae Hee.

497
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,390
What kind of relationship do they have?

498
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,830
It could become dangerous for Doctor.

499
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,890
I will have to deal with the Lee Kang Joon problem.

500
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,320
Birth of a Chef, which received a lot of love in November.

501
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,080
And, the winner of the third round

502
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,360
is Chef Kim Joon Young from Soyeon Hotel.

503
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:28,160
We've invited a new challenger
to go against Chef Kim Joon Young.

504
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,940
And, that person is Sara.

505
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,150
Hello, I'm Sara.

506
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,410
I anticipate your cooking skill.

507
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,630
I'll do my utmost.

508
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,520
Teacher,

509
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,940
the next ingredients were originally abalone and chicken.

510
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,360
I want to propose something.

511
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,680
I've heard that farmers are worried because
peanut crops this year are not so good.

512
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,390
To help our farmers,

513
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,650
I was thinking of including peanuts as one of the ingredients.

514
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,850
- It's a good idea.
- Peanuts?

515
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:06,010
Then how about making the topic be . . .

516
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,110
"Dishes Made with Fish and Peanuts?"

517
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:12,440
Great. Then, Sara and Kim Joon Young,

518
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,580
I will anticipate your dishes made with fish and peanuts.

519
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,950
Sa Geum Ran has a peanut allergy?

520
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,790
Her peanut allergy was serious.

521
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:34,110
Her mouth becomes paralyzed. Then, she goes into
anaphylactic shock and loses consciousness.

522
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:44,000
- You've worked hard.
- Great job.

523
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,420
Peanuts...

524
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,000
I'll anticipate your peanut dish, Sara.

525
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,150
It's worth your face going pale over this,

526
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:01,310
since you can't make anything with peanuts.

527
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,390
Peanuts... What should I do?

528
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:14,460
Hello, I'm looking for Madame Son Ji Sook.

529
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,520
This is Gyo Chae Yeon.

530
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,480
I have something to tell you.

531
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,440
Tell that man about Oppa Tae Hee.

532
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,620
We have to understand their movements,
so I can respond accordingly.

533
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:32,290
Han Tae Hee is in a battle with Han Min Hyeok
because of his grandmother.

534
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,070
It will get noisy soon.

535
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:39,110
Grandmother? Tae Hee Oppa has a grandmother?

536
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,800
Tell me in detail about Tae Hee Oppa, Han Min Hyeok

537
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,460
and that grandmother.

538
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,140
What's the occasion? What do you have to say?

539
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,740
I came to see Park Man Deok.

540
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,940
Why would you

541
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,550
want to see my mother-in-law?

542
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,510
Tae Hee Oppa and I

543
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:09,470
grew up in one house when we were young.

544
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:13,990
So she's also like a grandmother to me.

545
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,510
I came because I wanted to meet her.

546
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,680
This isn't a good time to do that.

547
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,160
Grandma will like me.

548
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,000
I'll be of help to you too, Madam.

549
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,180
I can be your messenger.

550
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:46,630
Leave. I am not going eat anything,
so everybody leave.

551
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,530
How are you, Grandmother?

552
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,620
I'm the younger sister of Tae Hee Oppa.

553
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,180
Who did you say you were?

554
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,530
I am Gyo Chae Yeon, working as an announcer.

555
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,690
After Tae Hee was hurt in the accident, the first person he met

556
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,190
was my father.

557
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:19,020
From then, Tae Hee and I grew up in the same house.

558
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,070
The household that took in Tae Hee...

559
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:26,920
Then, is the deceased Gyo Hong Jin...?

560
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,340
That is my father.

561
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:33,780
I heard about it. Although your household
was in a difficult position,

562
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,160
I heard that your household took in Tae Hee.

563
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:43,780
I couldn't be any more thankful.

564
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:48,620
If you are their daughter, aren't you my savior as well?

565
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,880
But how did you end up coming all the way here?

566
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,490
Tae Hee couldn't come, so

567
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:01,920
I came to be the bridge between you and Tae Hee.

568
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,750
You met Grandmother? How did you get inside?

569
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,740
You know Kang Joon and Han Min Hyeok
are on the same side.

570
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:24,720
Since I'm Kang Joon's wife, Han Min Hyeok
and his mother trust me.

571
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,990
Is Grandmother okay?

572
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,670
She's not eating at all.

573
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,120
Grandmother...

574
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:43,500
Don't worry too much because I encouraged her
to eat and she ate a few spoonfuls.

575
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,190
From now on, I'll make sure she eats.

576
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:04,220
I'll be your messenger to Grandmother,
so think more comfortably about her situation.

577
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,330
You're having a tough time, right?
Especially because of Lee Kang Joon.

578
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:13,490
Lee Kang Joon? What are you talking about?

579
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:16,360
He called you to meet with him.

580
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,460
He called you a few days ago and

581
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,190
I thought I heard you guys talking.

582
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,660
Wasn't that so?

583
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,830
Lee Kang Joon

584
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,700
December 6, Saturday 5:22 PM.

585
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:59,180
You met Lee Kang Joon? Alone?

586
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,890
Lee Kang Joon's number was on my call record.

587
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,310
Yes. I met him. Why?

588
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:12,430
I told you not to meet him by yourself.
Why won't you listen to me?

589
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:17,670
Also, he called my phone. I was supposed to go
meet him. Why would you go to see him?

590
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,650
Nothing happened, right? Did he threaten you or anything?

591
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,410
What did you guys talk about?

592
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,700
You don't have to know.

593
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,130
Why can't I know?

594
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:39,220
From the start, Lee Kang Joon has nothing to do with you.

595
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,400
What?

596
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,890
Lee Kang Joon is my past.

597
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:44,950
That's what I don't like.

598
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:48,740
He worries me. And, I don't like you being mixed up with him.

599
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,810
Do you know how angry I was when I heard it from Chae Yeon?

600
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,650
Gyo Chae Yeon?

601
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:55,110
That's right.

602
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,240
Who is getting mad at whom now?

603
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,420
You ran to Gyo Chae Yeon when she got into a car accident
and when she said her husband hit her.

604
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,600
Since you meet Gyo Chae Yeon that often,

605
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,720
why are you telling me to cut off my past?

606
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,210
What do you want me to do now?

607
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:11,620
You are going to be dragged around by
Lee Kang Joon for the rest of your life.

608
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:16,610
I cannot erase my past.

609
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:20,880
This is the reason why I hesitated when you
brought up the topics of marriage and couples.

610
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,560
That's what a past is. Until you die, you can't cut it off.

611
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,520
Ajumma, do you have lingering feelings
for Lee Kang Joon?

612
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:33,160
Why? Did I just hit the bullseye?

613
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,240
That's why you were provoked upon hearing
the words, married couple.

614
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,530
It's because you cannot imagine using that word with me,
and unless it is with Lee Kang Joon.

615
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:43,550
From now on, don't ever involve yourself
with Lee Kang Joon issues.

616
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,890
It's my problem. I will take care of it.

617
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:51,260
Fine. If that's your wish, I won't care. Will that do?

618
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,940
You hold onto that proud past and

619
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,610
hold onto it until you die.

620
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,090
The building?

621
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:17,520
Yes, I'm thinking about returning it, since it's not ours.

622
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,090
I already told Kang Joon.

623
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:24,310
What greed would I have about money at this point?

624
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,700
I'll just think about Geum Ran's legacy.

625
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:33,490
The one who reported Kang Joon, as a murder suspect,

626
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:37,830
was you, right. I am rather shameful, but

627
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:41,230
Kang Joon is not that reckless of a person.

628
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:43,770
Let your anger go.

629
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:48,130
Lee Kang Joon is a murder suspect?

630
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:52,950
He killed my daughter? Really?

631
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:57,940
Oh my. Is that true? Who turned him in?

632
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:03,110
Then, you didn't report him?

633
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,380
Grandmother.

634
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:18,630
Grandmother, I'm here.

635
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,660
What? Han Tae Hee is here?

636
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:47,530
It's an injunction. The court accepted our request.

637
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,650
I need to meet Grandmother now.

638
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,710
Grandmother doesn't want it.

639
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:04,570
Liar.

640
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:08,360
Release Grandmother.

641
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:14,220
If you don't bother Grandmother, and you send her to me,
I won't go through with the worst scenario.

642
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:17,830
As you know, I need her right now.

643
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:20,260
To an aged elder, you can't be doing this.

644
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,330
You seem to be in a bind.

645
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:26,170
Just like how I showed up here twenty years ago,

646
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:30,660
you showing up now won't destroy what I've built
for the last twenty years.

647
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,260
Leave quietly.

648
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,670
Han Min Hyeok,

649
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,290
do you know what you are misunderstanding?

650
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:46,050
That you think this house, Seweondang, and

651
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:49,950
Winner Group was retained through your efforts.

652
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:53,630
But it wasn't through effort. It was through stealing.

653
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,020
And I gave you two warnings already.

654
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,400
I said I will not appear if you safely release Grandmother.

655
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,840
But you disregarded me both times.

656
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,990
For pissing me off,

657
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:12,930
I'll make you regret it.

658
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,510
I'm sensitive today because of the
cooking contest tomorrow.

659
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:33,260
Stop talking about Lee Kang Joon
and the past. Don't provoke me.

660
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,090
You're not the only one with a temper.

661
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,390
Let me apologize.

662
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:45,970
You are right. The past is a part of me that I can't cut off.

663
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:48,850
Whether the past is good or bad,

664
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:52,170
I shouldn't have, nonchalantly, said for you to cut it off.

665
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,620
I'm the same way.

666
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:59,270
Like you, my past stinks.

667
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:02,060
Let's step on those and stand up.

668
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,570
I'm sorry.

669
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:10,010
I'm really sorry.

670
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:27,460
You have peanut allergy, but a peanut cook off?

671
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:31,600
Okay, how about this?

672
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:39,290
To counter any peanut allergic reaction, number 1,
you cook without tasting the food.

673
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:43,260
Number 2, take the allergy medication
before you start cooking.

674
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:47,650
Number 3, you replace the ingredient with a similar ingredient.

675
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:53,260
Number 4, I don't know. There are no real answers.
Just act as the situation arises.

676
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,970
I'll give it a try.

677
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,700
♫ As if the season changed. ♫

678
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:02,340
♫ Oh I'm in love with you, everything seems different ♫

679
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,240
♫ Was the sky always this pretty and blue? ♫

680
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:12,900
♫ Even when I watch a sad movie, I laugh. ♫

681
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,660
Birth of a Chef. Kim Joon Yong, who won the third round.

682
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,580
The newest challenger, Sara.

683
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:31,070
The contest will be Sara's tuna and sweetened peanut
against Kim Joon Yong's almond dish.

684
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,130
Sara,

685
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,350
do you like peanuts?

686
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,970
Yes?

687
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,500
Yes, I like them.

688
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,430
Then, it's a relief.

689
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:46,770
I know someone who has a peanut allergy.

690
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:50,450
For that person, a peanut dish would have been difficult for her.

691
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:55,160
Did she find out something about Sa Geum Ran?
Is she saying that on purpose?

692
00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:00,830
Now, we will start the challenge.

693
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:47,910
That's right. My weakness is that I am Sa Geum Ran.

694
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:53,290
However, my advantage is also that I am Sa Geum Ran.

695
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:56,830
The truth that does not to need to be thrown away or erased.

696
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:09,380
Because someone likes the person, Sa Geum Ran,

697
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:14,860
I will not throw away my true self,
but embrace it deep within me, and rise again.

698
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:36,600
♫ Like a magnet, all of them follow her. ♫

699
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,810
♫ Even though she knows you're there, pretending not to know, you saying how pretty. ♫

700
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:48,430
♫ The gifts that you buy, making sweet talks, I'll pass on those. ♫

701
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:56,930
♫ All I need is a heart that won't change easily. ♫

702
00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:01,550
♫ Oh new world! Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh! ♫

703
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:05,700
♫ Oh new world! ♫

704
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:10,180
♫ Even without me knowing, I've been hurt many times ♫

705
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:15,130
♫ I really don't want to bring it up. ♫

706
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:21,610
♫ Isn't a pretty face and good figure enough? ♫

707
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,750
♫ For long days ahead... ♫

708
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,760
♫ Oh my dream! Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  ♫

709
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:40,080
♫ I'm going to start over, like it's all new ♫

710
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:45,590
♫ With my heart... ♫

711
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,710
Sara, how is it?

712
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:05,060
The food that you made,

713
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,680
have you tried it?

714
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:43,050
Since Han Tae Hee left like that, he wouldn't stay still.

715
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,200
Today, he called for a shareholder's meeting.

716
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,700
There is nothing that Han Tae Hee can do right now.

717
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:54,380
The only way Han Tae Hee can become the largest
shareholder is to get Moonhwa Foundation's shares.

718
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,840
However, he needs to go through the proper procedures.

719
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:00,250
While Han Tae Hee is struggling . . .

720
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,930
I'm thinking of getting rid of Moonhwa Foundation.

721
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:12,140
Manager.

722
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,500
It's Han Tae Hee,

723
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,880
Hello to all of you 35,000 employees
of Winner Group, I am Han Tae Hee.

724
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:23,410
I've lived separated from Winner Group for a while, but

725
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:25,800
due to the people who will become my family,

726
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,920
I've returned to take back my position.

727
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,000
Whether I am fit to be in that position,
all of you can judge me.

728
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,380
I believe that trying to take over the company as a major
shareholder, without having putting effort is not right.

729
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,550
I...

730
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,980
will not take the shares of Moonhwa Foundation.

731
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,620
After a month,

732
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:50,260
Winner Group's CEO will be chosen
at the shareholder's meeting.

733
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:56,220
Today, in this spot, I am announcing that I will be
a candidate for the position of Winner Group's CEO.

734
00:59:56,220 --> 01:00:02,240
I look forward to your thoughtful decision in
choosing the future leader of WInner Group.

735
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,030
I'll rely on you.

736
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,090
Now, let's see how the judges ranked the food.

737
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:17,970
Shall we proceed?

738
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:20,760
I was very moved by your cooking, Sara.

739
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,220
She made a dish that elders can eat
with a batter; frying the outer layer.

740
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:28,860
It's crunchy, but she made it so that
a person with bad teeth can eat it.

741
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,790
Her cooking shows her thoughtfulness toward families.

742
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:35,160
To me, her cooking is the best.

743
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:43,200
Then,

744
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,280
we'll find out who is the winner of Birth of a Chef.

745
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,610
We will announce the judges' decisions.

746
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,090
Based on the food's taste, ingredients, nutritional content,

747
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,980
the dish's uniqueness and artistic presentation,

748
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:15,020
the final result has been revealed
by totaling the scores of each category.

749
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:20,800
For this dish, taste: 3 points. Usage of ingredients: 20 points.

750
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,950
Nutritional content: 20 points.

751
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:26,760
And the food's uniqueness: 20 points.

752
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:30,760
Adding the scores together, the winner is Sara!

753
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:35,660
♫ Oh I'm in love with you. I've solved the puzzle ♫

754
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:40,220
♫ Oh I'm in love with you. You're my ideal type. ♫

755
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:44,740
♫ Was the sky always so pretty and blue ♫

756
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:49,140
Doctor! First place! First place!

757
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,420
How can this happen, huh?

758
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:55,750
When she was announcing it,
I thought my heart was going to burst.

759
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:59,490
I knew it all along.

760
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:02,080
You knew it all along? How did you know?

761
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:05,620
When I first met you, I ate your food.

762
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:09,060
Wow, it was amazing. I knew it at that moment.

763
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:16,330
This ajumma is one of Korea's best chefs.

764
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:21,850
But you said you went to cause a big ruckus. What happened?

765
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,650
I also got first place.

766
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:31,300
So we're both winners!

767
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,310
Then we should celebrate!

768
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:36,520
Sounds great!

769
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,470
Slowly, Ajumma.

770
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:41,170
I have something to do, so I'll come back after.

771
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:43,400
You said we're celebrating.
So where are you going now?

772
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,220
After taking care of everything,
I'll see you at the restaurant.

773
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,640
I have to finish something that's urgent.

774
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,060
I understand. I understand.

775
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,440
I'll see you later.

776
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:03,210
Were you certain when you told me?

777
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:06,360
Is Sa Geum Ran actually allergic to peanuts?

778
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:12,070
Besides that, I am curious about something.

779
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:15,320
Why do you need information about Sa Geum Ran?

780
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,030
She's dead, as you know.

781
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:21,210
Are you certain about her death, too?

782
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:37,540
I love you, Ajumma.

783
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:41,140
I love you, Ajumma.

784
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:47,180
A reason a man wants to get married

785
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:50,340
is not only because he loves her.

786
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,430
With this woman,

787
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:54,410
happiness and even sadness,

788
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,970
will be shared. When that feeling overwhelms you,

789
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,890
a man proposes.

01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:09,300
Doctor, I'm on my way.

791
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,420
I'm waiting really eagerly.

792
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,240
Hurry up, Ajumma!

793
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,520
I'm in the parking lot. I'll be there soon.

794
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:25,650

01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:58,670
Is that true?
