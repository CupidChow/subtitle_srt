Episode 7

2
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,240
You're saying we should sleep together? The two of us?

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,430
It's because your room is locked, and my mother-in-law, sister-in-laws and husband are sleeping in the living room.

4
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,450
So, the two of us have to sleep here.

5
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,270
It's okay! I won't eat you up.

6
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:10,960
Han Tae Hee is in love with Sara.

7
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,560
Fine, Ajumma.

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,220
Although we are going to sleep in one room,

9
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,270
there is a pecking order to sleeping.

10
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,350
When there is only one bed, where does Party B sleep?

11
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,930
I will sleep on the floor.

12
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,770
Aioo, why can't I fall asleep?

13
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,580
You are dreaming, right?

14
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,780
About the death scene...

15
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,740
It's like that, right?

16
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,650
Ah, this Ajumma, seriously

17
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,150
When I'm Party A.

18
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,080
When I'm the supersize Party A.

19
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,280
Why are you here so late in the middle of the night?

20
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,770
It's three in the morning right now, Hyung!

21
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,060
You told me to come over whenever. Let me impose on you.

22
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,570
I missed you!

23
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,390
Oh. Okay, okay.

24
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,730
Oh yeah, tell me about your psychological evaluation. What did they say?

25
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,800
[Comprehensive Analysis of Results]
After the analysis, Han Tae Hee is

26
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,140
in love

27
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,320
with Sara.

28
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,060
Who is she? The woman whom you love?

29
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,710
Hey, I'm getting goosebumps. What do you mean "love"?

30
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,410
It's not to that degree. Never.

31
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,600
You just admitted it, right now. You admitted it.

32
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,970
By saying "not to that degree," you are saying you are doing something similar to love?

33
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,780
Who is it? What kind of a woman is she?

34
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,240
No, it's not!

35
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,960
She just seems kind of pretty and

36
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,440
my heart beat quickly a couple times.

37
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,000
I just took care of her once or twice...

38
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,230
That's it! How is this love?

39
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,100
That's right! That's it! That is all. That is love right there.

40
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,400
No it's not!

41
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,590
Aigoo, just wait a little bit now.

42
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,130
You are going to be taking her side regardless.

43
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,030
Hyung, if you are to this degree, you fell for her already. You now have a woman.

44
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,900
Hyung, it's not that ajumma, right?

45
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,930
That A-j-m saved in your cell phone.

46
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,030
Why do I keep thinking that's associated with Ajumma?

47
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,720
I'm sorry Hyung. This is insulting to you. What's an ajumma?

48
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,060
Why am I sleeping on the bed?

49
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,730
While I was sleeping, I must have come up.

50
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,620
If the Doctor found out, he'll throw a fit.

51
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,190
Doctor.

52
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,960
Where did he go?!

53
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,160
This is the bathroom, right?

54
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,420
Hey, the more I think about it, I hate Chae Yeon.

55
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,140
Did she have to tell your father that I poured water on Geum Ran's mother?

56
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,160
If we gave her the Canvas Building, she should be licking our house floor [be thankful].

57
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,360
Where does she get off fooling around?

58
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,630
Do you know how much effort Mom and I put forth to make Geum Ran's land ours?

59
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,160
It's a relief that we made the land a joint ownership when we persuaded her.

60
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,090
If we hadn't, it would have been difficult to resolve the land issue after she committed suicide.

61
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,780
We did all the hard work, but Chae Yoon ended up getting the land.

62
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,170
Stop talking about the land.

63
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,560
Since we were talking about the land, Geum Ran really was naive.

64
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,440
She believed until the end that you married her because you loved her.

65
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,390
Kang Joon, you were in debt and you couldn't find a job, so you used Geum Ran as a proxy.

66
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,140
There is the concept, "give and take." There are better expressions, you know.

67
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,330
Also, was I the only one who got land?

68
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,980
Geum Ran had a husband. It's enough that she got married once.

69
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,540
Hey, that's right; she did get married.

70
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,170
It's actually a relief that Geum Ran is dead.

71
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,820
How unfair would she have felt it was if she had known everything while she was alive?

72
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,200
What do you mean unfair?

73
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,940
Even in heaven, she'll probably get suckered by someone.

74
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,800
What, Ajumma?

75
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,150
What?!

76
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,930
Ajumma.

77
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,640
Did you kill them?

78
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,830
Did you give them poison or something?!

79
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,130
They're asleep.

80
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,390
I put sleeping pills in their food.

81
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,680
For 2-3 hours, they won't even know if you carry them off.

82
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,590
I even gave them food poisoning. Especially for my husband,

83
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,970
he will also have a hard time walking.

84
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,730
If he eats abalone, he'll have diarrhea immediately.

85
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,560
Doctor, go with me to some place.

86
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,440
I called you over because we have to go somewhere.

87
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,780
You want to become a bad wench?

88
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,750
How my in-law family members are such despicable human beings,

89
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,430
I found out for sure.

90
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,490
They only sucked on the sweet water (used me for what they needed) and threw me away.

91
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,860
No. They even killed me.

92
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,670
Those trash...

93
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,470
If I want to face those cruel people, I have to become more malicious.

94
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,790
I stole the house keys from my mother-in-law.

95
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,320
Everything is fine, but this is breaking and entering.

96
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,260
We will get caught on the CCTV right there!

97
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,320
That is just for looks. It's been broken.

98
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,690
Ajjumma! Still, let's keep to the mindset of being law-abiding citizens.

99
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,520
Why does a model citizen like me have to suddenly become a burglar?

100
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,600
Ah, I seriously don't know.

101
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,110
They bring in an announcer for a daughter-in-law and look at them now!

102
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,560
Even if something breaks, nobody would be able to tell!

103
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,510
Ajumma, this is property destruction.

104
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,960
Ajumma, us doing this... criminal penal code 319.1.

105
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,960
It's a three-year prison sentence and a five-million won fine!

106
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,740
This is aggravated burglary!

107
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,160
It's not aggravated burglary!

108
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,940
I provided their livelihood with the money my father left me!

109
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,390
I saved and I saved! I was the one who brought this house to this point!

110
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,180
This is my house!

111
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,010
Ajumma, Ajumma! In a marriage, gifts are considered separate property!

112
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,850
This is larceny! Larceny, I tell you!

113
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,760
It's mine!

114
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,700
Wait a minute.

115
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,300
You'll get three years for property destruction.

116
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,250
Breaking and entering is three years. On top of that,

117
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,780
burglary is at least 3-6...

118
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,350
Settlement... if we can settle...

119
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,500
Then I get aiding and abetting... the criminal penalties.

120
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,040
Ajumma!

121
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,490
Degree? Doctorate, my ass!

122
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,380
Become a human first, you murderer!

123
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:05,010
I know that you

124
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,440
killed Sa Geum Ran.

125
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,350
Ajumma...

126
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,660
you're going to leave this.

127
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,290
This is too bold! Our identities will be discovered if we're not careful!

128
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,540
When they've concluded that Sa Geum Ran will live as a pushover in the next life, why would we be found out?

129
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,780
Aggravated burglary? Robbery?

130
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,590
I'm going to do even worst things.

131
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,640
I'm going to become the worst woman in the world!

132
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,500
I got it. Do whatever you want.

133
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,620
If your heart is so stifled, how can you live?

134
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,910
If you want to live, you have to open it up. I'll take the consequences.

135
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,670
Go ahead and break everything!

136
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,020
Yes!

137
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,770
You're doing well.

138
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,910
Now just wait a bit. You will definitely take that woman's side.

139
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,670
Hyung, when that happens, you've totally fallen for her! That means she's already your woman!

140
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,800
Kang Joon didn't show up to work?

141
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,220
Unbelievable.

142
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,570
He stayed out and also didn't come to work?

143
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,680
How about a phone call? Where does he say he's at?!

144
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,020
Truthfully, I don't know.

145
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,400
General Manager Ha Min Yeok is looking for him as well. I really don't know what to do.

146
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,330
Eleven o'clock!

147
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Hello.

148
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,680
Kang Joon, where are you right now?

149
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,510
I'm busy right now. I'll call you later.

150
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,330
Kang Joon!

151
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,960
Mom, Mom, Noona, get up.

152
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,150
It's eleven o'clock.

153
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,600
Why does my stomach feel like this?

154
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,840
Huh?

155
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,440
Oh my goodness, what happened. Why did I sleep for so long?

156
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,370
Oh, my stomach!

157
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,080
Oh, my stomach hurts! Why do I feel like this?

158
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,630
Did you say eat... as much as I want?

159
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,020
Eat.

160
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,340
What's the occasion that you're allowing me to eat?

161
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,640
You have your in-laws at the house.

162
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,260
The moment you see them, you'll lose your appetite!

163
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,910
Are you taking care of me?

164
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,360
That's not it.

165
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,590
We're reaching the highlight of sending Lee Kang Joon to prison.

166
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,430
I'm giving you a push to stay strong!

167
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,290
Ah... yes.

168
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,710
Yes Doctor, I'll cheer up.

169
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,590
That person must be sent to prison.

170
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,720
Add the cost of this meal to the contract also.

171
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,450
The restaurant will open soon, and I will work my ass off to pay you back!

172
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,420
Eat my rice, too!

173
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,830
I'm going out to meet someone, so stay here and eat.

174
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,400
CEO, mission complete.

175
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,260
Jongro district Pyungchang # 80, we accomplished the mission at CEO Lee Jeong Sik's house.

176
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,650
I took a variety of equipment into CEO Lee Jeong Sik's home to rectify the situation.

177
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,470
We straightened out the framed picture of the newlyweds, cleared the fingerprints, and even stray hairs.

178
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,470
I completely erased the trace of anyone ever being there.

179
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,120
CEO, you won't even be able to tell if there were an ant in the house!

180
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,820
Good job.

181
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,030
But, you left that there, right?

182
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,620
Yes, I left it as it was.

183
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,750
Ahh, but CEO... what is all of this about?

184
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,500
Can't you give me a small hint?

185
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,020
There is nothing you need to know. It'll be over soon.

186
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,950
Ah, CEO, there is one more thing.

187
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,300
It's regarding the errand you sent me on to retrieve information about your grandmother, Park Man Deok.

188
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:59,220
Winner Group Madame Park Man Doek is operating a Food Truck by day and is in front of Cheongmae Playground.

189
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,690
I am looking for Dong Geul

190
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,610
Good job. You can leave now.

191
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,810
Winner Group, Madame Park Man Deok.

192
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,820
Wow, she's so pretty.

193
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,810
She's so skinny, but how can she eat like that? She's the best.

194
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,080
Wow, she's really pretty.

195
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,340
If we post pictures on the Internet it will be daebak (awesome)! She's totally pretty!

196
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,140
Even if they call her pretty,

197
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,870
she is only happy when she eats.

198
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,860
The title is birth of a mukbang (food broadcast) beauty.

199
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,400
Doctor.

200
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,320
I finished it all.

201
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,330
You bought me delicious food to eat. Now you even bring me here.

202
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,520
Is today some special day?

203
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,130
So old-fashioned, really.

204
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,930
Other people come to places like this all the time.

205
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,640
Your order of two cappuccinos.

206
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,910
I'm fine with coffee from a vending machine.

207
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,580
Ajumma, this is the problem.

208
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,570
You saved all that money, only doing good things for the family, and you're still trying to save?

209
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,190
I thought you said saving only turns into sh*t! Who's going to benefit from this if you're always saving?

210
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,580
It's because it's expensive.

211
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,300
Just drink that.

212
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,850
Yes, Doctor.

213
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,950
It's a present.

214
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,880
Buying me food and coffee?

215
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,090
Yeah.

216
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,830
And I'll help you catch Lee Kang Joon.

217
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,860
We'll get him to confess to your murder,

218
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,540
and then put him in prison within four days!

219
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,690
Is that possible?

220
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,420
We can rush our plans.

221
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,070
That's why I erased all the other traces at your in-laws place,

222
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,460
but I left your threat for Lee Kang Joon alone.

223
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,570
I know that you killed Sa Geum Ran.

224
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,090
We're going to mentally torture Lee Kang Joon.

225
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,990
I'm going to make him confess to your murder.

226
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,830
This is the present I'm giving you.

227
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,480
There's no need to like it so much.

228
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,070
This the first

229
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,690
and last present.

230
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,230
Why is it the last present?

231
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,360
When Lee Kang Joon is in prison,

232
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,730
I'm going to leave.

233
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,920
Leave?

234
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,700
Where to?

235
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,000
Then I won't ever see you?

236
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,800
Did you expect me to follow Lee Kang Joon around forever?

237
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,790
This genius who only listened to FM channels...

238
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,930
what is this with listening to wireless wiretaps?

239
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,330
Also until when do I have to keep living with you

240
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,480
under one roof? Now, we're even living in the same room.

241
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,670
If this gets out, do you think I can get married?

242
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,520
I'm someone who never spoke to ajummas before in my life.

243
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,640
Look at us now, we are doing the oddest things together.

244
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,730
We spend all day together.

245
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,540
I've done so many strange things. I'm likely to have a mental breakdown!

246
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,360
I'm doing things I've never done, and thinking things I've never thought about before!

247
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,030
I can't do it anymore.

248
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,270
Let's end this.

249
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,540
Doctor...

250
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,720
I see you must have been really stressed.

251
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,640
It's understandable.

252
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,730
Okay, Doctor.

253
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,700
The financial arrangement,

254
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,980
I'll take responsibility for it, and I will spend the rest of my life paying it back!

255
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,870
Just drink your coffee!

256
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,400
No...

257
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,830
you can't fall deeper.

258
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,180
- Hey! What are you watching?
- Hey, look at this!

259
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,570
- What is it?
- There are 200k views a day!

260
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:34,730
Totally awesome!
This has over 200,000 views.

261
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,410
Look at her eating. There's nothing to say about it.

262
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,760
Isn't she the woman that ate the vegetable and rice rolls, spicy rice cakes, and blood sausage?

263
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,100
Oh, but there wasn't anything captured of her eating that before!

264
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,470
- Really?
- I'd better post this! How awesome!

265
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,720
The views will increase quickly.

266
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,070
Awww, I'm so envious!

267
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,240
We don't have any women employees on our security team?

268
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,390
The women employees are all in the fifties, and there is no one matching the description you gave me.

269
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,200
But, I did find something suspicious.

270
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,040
What?

271
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,960
The employees at the commemorative ceremony were not our employees.

272
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,630
The woman you mentioned happens to be one of those suspicious employees.

273
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,100
Ah...I..

274
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,450
I have another job.

275
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,740
I'm a chef.

276
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,600
What's her identity?

277
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,500
Kang Joon...

278
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,060
It's time that we take grandmother to a quiet place

279
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,600
Have you moved up your plan?

280
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,900
Expose Winner Group's corruption.

281
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,780
On the news and the business program. On the same day, as a surprise attack.

282
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,940
Yes, General Manager!

283
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,620
Frame grandmother for the irregularities found in Winner Group.

284
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,260
We'll send her to prison.

285
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,140
If she goes to prison,

286
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,950
she won't live as long as she wished.

287
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,620
Secretary Son!

288
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,060
Has she still not come in yet?!

289
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,550
Ajumma!

290
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,600
Did you call me, Mother-in-law?

291
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,160
What the...

292
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,100
What's with all these people?

293
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,560
From now on all the people working here

294
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,860
are changed to my people.

295
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,430
According to whom?!

296
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,500
According to me.

297
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,170
Show your respect towards the elder.

298
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,570
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,130
Damn it!

300
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,150
I don't feel well, so I'm going home early. Organize everything.

301
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,510
Kang Joon, where did you sleep last night?

302
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,760
Don't mess with me. I don't feel well.

303
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,820
Ever since I married you,

304
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,400
the nights you come home are less than those that you stay out. Do you know that?

305
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,820
Is that my fault?!

306
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,860
Is it my fault, then?

307
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,010
Am I the one staying out and having an affair?

308
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,680
I'll be at home. You finish with work, and I'll see you there.

309
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,160
If you're going to be that way,

310
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,570
I also have a thought.

311
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,480
What do you mean?

312
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,080
You're avoiding me instead of trying to make peace with me.

313
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,970
Am I insignificant?

314
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,560
Then I have something to show you as well.

315
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,560
Where is everyone?!

316
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,430
I said where is everyone?!

317
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,660
This house is a real disaster!

318
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,110
Where are you?!

319
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,450
Honey, we're all at the hospital.

320
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,730
We got an upset stomach from falling asleep too soon after eating today.

321
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,050
We shouldn't have eaten and fallen asleep right away.

322
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,370
The three of us are unable to move because we can't get our anal muscles to work.

323
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,140
I dare you to even try to come home! I'm hanging up!

324
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,660
Oh! What do I do?

325
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,460
Sara, all three of us had serious stomach aches,

326
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,270
so we left by ambulance.

327
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,040
It went as planned.

328
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,970
Then I'm going to notify Gyo Cha Yeon that my in-laws stayed over.

329
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,770
I have a selca (selfie) we took together last night.

330
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,830
Right now?

331
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:57,870
It's not time yet. "I know that you killed Sa Geum Ran."

332
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,930
There will very soon be a huge explosion for Lee Kang Joon.

333
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,540
It will just muddy the water. Just wait.

334
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,550
That's right.

335
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,780
Then I'll go upstairs to the second floor and spy on them, Doctor.

336
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,030
Do well.

337
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,050
That way even if I'm not with you, I'll feel assured.

338
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,010
Yes.

339
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,880
You really

340
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,400
are leaving in a few days, right?

341
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,900
That's right. Why?

342
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,480
After I've always been around you,

343
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,230
without thinking, I

344
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,420
lived not thinking that one day we will have to separate.

345
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,890
If we separate,

346
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,520
it seems like it will feel a bit weird.

347
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,460
It's even weirder that we were always together.

348
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,660
We're people who totally don't fit together.

349
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,740
Go and monitor them!

350
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,050
I know that you killed Sa Geum Ran.

351
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,920
I also have an idea.

352
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,270
I have something to show you too.

353
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,650
[I know you killed Sa Geum Ran]

354
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,150
Come home right now.

355
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,800
[I know that you killed Sa Geum Ran]

356
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,160
Let go. Let go of me.

357
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,660
Are you crazy!

358
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,840
The crazy one is you! Look!

359
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,500
"I know

360
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,620
that you killed Sa Geum Ran."

361
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,560
With just a couple of fights,

362
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,410
you're threatening me?

363
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,080
Does this make sense?

364
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,460
How could I write this?

365
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,620
I'm also involved in Sa Geum Ran's death.

366
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,690
She's involved in my death?

367
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,020
The moment Sa Geum Ran's car fell into the ocean,

368
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,000
I was also there.

369
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,710
I saw that woman die.

370
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:04,870
If I had called the rescue team, Sa Geum Ran could have lived.

371
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,600
If you are a murderer,

372
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,920
then I'm an accomplice. So then,

373
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,500
would I have left that there?

374
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,720
You threatened that you would show me something!

375
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,790
I was saying that I'd do something.

376
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,690
Gyo Chae Yeon!

377
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:38,380
How can you suspect me?

378
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,420
Well, it's because you're this much of a psycho

379
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,740
that you killed your wife.

380
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,060
I hate the idea of even one more day.

381
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,330
I won't stay

382
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,820
even one more day with you.

383
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:31,160
Where are you Ajumma? I brought the package we're going to deliver to Lee Kang Joon.

384
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,140
Is she in the room?

385
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,500
Let go. I said let go.

386
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,950
Chae Yeon's happiness is always my first priority.

387
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:57,130
I can't let Chae Yeon live with a murderer. I have to save her.

388
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,310
What is it? What are you doing?

389
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,950
Why did you break this, Ajumma?

390
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:18,480
This is my present for you.

391
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,340
This is the first and last present.

392
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Chae Yeon, what's wrong?

393
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,650
It's me Hyung, Ji Hoon.

394
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,120
Chae Yeon came to your house?

395
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,320
Is something wrong?

396
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,670
Yes, Hyung.

397
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,760
Chae Yeon is having a hard time.

398
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,000
Hyung, can you come right now?

399
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,680
Chae Yeon used to depend on you a lot.

400
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,410
I got it, Ji Hoon.

401
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,810
This is my present for you.

402
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,180
It's the first and last present.

403
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,160
Doctor, I brought the pen you asked for.

404
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,990
Ajumma...

405
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,870
Write your husband a letter in your handwriting.

406
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:31,330
Send a letter and let him know that you are alive. Here.

407
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,910
Skipping the third stop,

408
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,510
we're going right to Lee Kang Joon's mental breakdown.

409
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,600
Scary Hell ~ Mental Breakdown

410
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,340
Let's get a confession out of a mentally broken Lee Kang Joon.

411
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,390
What exactly are you hiding, Ajumma?

412
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,560
Not one day.

413
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,560
Even one day...

414
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,810
I know that you killed Sa Geum Ran?

415
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:55,300
With only a couple of fights, you are threatening me?

416
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,830
Does that make sense?

417
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,220
How can I do this?

418
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,320
I'm also involved in Sa Geum Ran's death!

419
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,670
The moment Sa Geum Ran's car fell into the ocean,

420
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,820
I was also there.

421
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,060
I saw that woman die!

422
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,610
If I had called the rescue team, Sa Geum Ran would have lived.

423
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,880
If you are a murderer, then I am an accomplice!

424
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,920
So would I really leave that there?

425
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,830
[Hubby.]

426

Doctor...

427
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,610
You can't find out.

428
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,660
If you find out about Gyo Chae Yeon

429
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,760
you will

430
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,860
have a really hard time.

431
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,210
When you find out

432
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,120
that the person you love is a bad person,

433
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,030
how hurtful it is, I know.

434
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:10,810
I hope that you won't have to experience that feeling.

435
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:14,800
It is a really hard experience.

00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,850

Did the scene-making ajumma finally find out about Kang Joon's affair?

446
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:27,880
When the previous in-law came, Mother-in-law drenched her in water.

447

This really...

448
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,940
In-law, are you well? This is Kang Joon's father.

449
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:52,300
Is it possible to meet?

450

Disclose the truth of my daughter's unjust death.

451
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,400
Did you say the circumstances surrounding Geum Ran's death are strange?

452
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,810
Yes.

453
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,230
The morning of her death, she went to see a gynecologist about getting pregnant.

454
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:10,540
Why would she then commit suicide?

455
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,560
Then there's the fact that Lee Kang Joon was already with another woman.

456
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,280
It's all so very strange.

457

462
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,780
Certified? Who sent it?

463
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,280
Sa Geum Ran sent it.

Congratulations on your wedding!

470
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,750
I wanted to see how the bride and groom looked, so I went to the wedding hall.

What do you mean threaten?

480

Aren't you the least bit afraid of heaven? Geum Ran who died is watching you!

481
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,510

00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,820
Is that you, Mother?

484
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,600
Shim Yeo Ok.

485
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,880
So do I have to catch this woman and throw her into a mental hospital?

486
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,720
Her one and only daughter died, and she's gone insane!

487
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,170
It's an important time for the company, so keep this quiet.

488
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,530
This is the consent for hospitalization and the evidence of family relationship.

489
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:13,740
Since I am her son-in-law and her family,

490
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,580
this will be plenty to have her committed!

491
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,980
Yes, I understand.

492
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,130
The location where Sa Geum Ran's car fell off the cliff...

493
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:37,150
I was there, too!

494
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,610
I watched her die!

495
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,350
If I had called the rescue team,

496
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,430
then I suppose Sa Geum Ran could have lived.

497
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,010
It's me, Sara.

498
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,540
To commemorate everyone sleeping over at my place,

499
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,510
I took a photo!

500
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,930
Chae Yeon!

501
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,940
Manager Jung?

502
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,900
I need you to do me a favor!

503
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:51,030
There's someone I need you to punish!

504
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,810
Doctor, everything's ready!

505
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,000
Cooking for a broken heart?

506
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,490
Yes, Doctor!

507
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,520
These are foods that are good for the heart.

508
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,370
Shiitake mushroom casserole, almond and walnut anchovy stir-fry, brown rice,

509
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:11,800
steamed cod with tomatoes, steamed egg, grilled mackeral, and I've even blended soybean milk.

510
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,900
Are you saying there's a chance my heart will have another episode?

511
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:25,770
Is there something I don't know about that you aren't telling me?

512
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:29,730
Oh, absolutely not! It's nothing like that!

513
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,090
Whether it's you or me,

514
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:37,280
we often find ourselves heavy hearted!

515
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,860
That's right!

516
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:43,520
Especially you, Ajumma. The first thing, when you wake in the morning, your heart is all in it!

517
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,270
Or, something like that.

518
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,200
Yes, you're right, Doctor!

519
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,700
That's why I'm saying let's prevent it regularly.

520
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,600
Doctor, please eat!

521
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,620
Since tomorrow is the grand opening, I am going to go clean the restaurant.

522
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,010
This is...

523
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,510
dessert!

524
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:41,720
Hey, look at this. Look at the comments.

525
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,350
One million?

526
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,890
This is a total jackpot!

527
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:48,260
Look at this comment:
 Who could this beauty be?

528
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,010
How you seen the views? Daebak!

529
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,210
Producer.

530
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,540
The Birth of a Mukbang (eating broadcast) Beauty.

531
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,530
The video is awesome.

532
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:04,510
Vegetable and rice rolls, spicy rice cakes, blood sausage!

533
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:10,510
The netizens made cuts of the video of her eating potato stew, and they're making the rounds.

534
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:14,890
In one day the views have exploded.

535
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,450
She's pretty!

536
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,320
The Winner Group, with it's subsidiaries such as an entertainment agency, broadcasting compay and food service,

537
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,660
is being investigated by the prosecutor for creating a slush fund worth millions of dollars.

538
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,700
Mmm! The scent is nice!

539
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:36,910
Do you like it that much?

540
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,440
From here on out, all we have to do is enjoy it!

541
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,470
Everyone, I'm in front of the Prosecutor's Office right now.

542
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:52,860
Currently the prosecutors are investigating Park Man Deok of Winner Group

543
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:56,650
They are in the midst of investigating the slush fund.

544
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:02,800
There is information that indicates Park Man Deok, as Winner Group's biggest shareholder, managed the Winner Culture Foundation herself.

545
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,940
What kind of person is Park Man Deok?

546
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,790
She is the largest shareholder of the company.

547
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,730
She is the grandmother of Han Myeong Woo.

548
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:15,670
She holds one of five seats in managing the company.

549
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,280
Have them take Mother to the villa.

550
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:25,780
Now, the prosecutors will very soon forcibly arrest Grandmother.

551
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,990
It's going to be rough for a few days. Please lay low.

552
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:33,580
I'd love to see that old woman get dragged away

553
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,360
with my own eyes!

554
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,100
It's a pity that I won't be able to!

555
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,390
These days there is a video circulating the Internet, called Birth of a Mukbang (eating broadcast) Beauty.

556
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:53,040
The video entitled Birth of a Mukbang Beauty, that was uploaded,

557
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,480
is becoming widespread at a very fast rate.

558
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,640
Different than her well-eating image, her looks are gorgeous,
(Birth of an Eating Broadcast Beauty)

559
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,520
and this beauty, with her svelte body that doesn't have any excess flab...

560
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,990
Get in here!

561
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,810
Yes?

562
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,760
She's the one!

563
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,990
"Birth of a Mukbang Beauty"

564
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,610
She's the woman that I have been looking for!

565
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:27,110
♫ What is wrong with my age?

566
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:31,340
♫ It's a perfect age for me to love.

567
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:51,500
Not bad.

568
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,540
There are seven different types of spaghetti,

569
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,900
and five of them are perfect.

570
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,700
Now, all I have to do is test the remaining two.

571
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,680
Is this that woman's restaurant?

572
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:25,410
I know because the sisters-in-law work here.

573
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:29,430
Since tomorrow is the opening, she must be here.

574
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:33,930
♫ My heart is but one.

575
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:37,550
♫ My feelings are also one.

576
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:40,540
♫ I really do love...

577
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,230
What is it?

578
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,820
Since you do immature things like this,

579
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,820
I came to warn you.

580
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,960
A warning to not bother me.

581
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,420
Scaredy cat.

582
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,740
You, alone, are scared.

583
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,580
You can only say something when your manager's here, right?

584
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,680
This lady's so arrogant.

585
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,170
Are you the lady that's bothering Gyo Chae Yeon?

586
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:20,820
Yeah, I did it. Why?!

587
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,220
What kind of woman is this?

588
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:30,630
You saw it right! My High School nickname was, "a must-see King Kong."

589
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:33,610
I'm not a woman, but "a must see King Kong!"

590
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:36,220
Come at me! Come at me!

591
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,960
I was only going to talk, but you keep fooling around.

592
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,550
Apologize to her before it gets out of hand.

593
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,220
Come at me! Just come at me!

594
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:55,360
Who is she? I guess we shouldn't let her off the hook because she's pretty.

595
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,880
I know. Come here.

596
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:03,550
What should we do with her?

597
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,660
Let go of that hand!

598
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,770
Who is he?

599
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:14,590
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you, it's as if the season has changed ♫

600
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:15,750
Tae Hee Oppa...

601
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,600
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you. You're my ideal type.

602
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,860
Are you all right?

603
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,170
- Doctor!
- Doctor?

604
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:28,440
♫ It seems my heart is stopping. ♫

605
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,710
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you. ♫

606
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,210
Stand back!

607
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,560
I can't do that.

608
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,250
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you. Everything looks different.  ♫

609
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:42,170
♫ I never noticed the sky was so beautiful and blue  ♫

610
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:46,920
♫ I can smile even when I'm watching a sad movie.  ♫

611
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,210
Seriously...

612
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:52,680
♫ Oh I'm in love with you, Oh I'm in love with you ♫

613
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:59,340
♫ Oh, I'm in love with you. I love you. I love you. ♫

614
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:05,000
♫ the loneliness must be ending. ♫

615
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,530
Oppa Tae Hee ...

616
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,910
♫ Happy ending

617
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:19,780
Oppa Ji Hoon, meet me immediately.

618
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,930
I have something to ask you.

619
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,570
What happened?

620
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,790
You know that woman?

621
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,270
I told you already.

622
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:42,400
This is my restaurant, and she is the chef.

623
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,800
When and how? You shouldn't know each other.

624
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,080
At the family meeting. You invited all of us.

625
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,650
Because of that, you two are working together?

626
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,290
It turned out that way. Let's talk later, Chae Yeon.

627
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,480
Next time.

628
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,370
Oppa Tae Hee has a woman?

629
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,490
Since when? Was it recently?

630
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:27,160
Yeah, I think so. Recently, he wanted know how he felt, so he even did a psychological analysis.

631
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,880
I even saw communicating with her.

632
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,250
What is her name?

633
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:34,430
- Was it Sara?
- Sara?

634
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:38,350
No, that name wasn't it.

635
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:42,580
He listed the name in abbreviation: A. J. M.

636
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,070
A, J, and M?

637
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:47,130
In that moment,

638
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:49,850
I thought of 'ajumma.'

639
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,190
But it probably isn't ajumma.

640
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,610
There's no way he would meet an ajumma.

641
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,230
Ajumma?

642
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:58,850
Anyway, Chae Yeon,

643
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,780
go back now to your in-laws.

644
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:06,110
Being separated isn't good.

645
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,080
Lee Kang Joon, you assh*le.

646
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,590
This time I'll get you by e-mail...

647
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,800
It hurts, right?

648
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,910
Hurt? With this little thing?

649
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:29,030
If I did as I usually did, I would have used only one arm. But,

650
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:33,300
I used both of my arms, and the muscles got shocked all of a sudden.

651
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,530
Ajumma,

652
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:43,950
I'm telling you this because time has passed a bit.

653
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:47,450
There were lot of men, but how can you face them so directly?

654
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:49,850
You could have been in big trouble.

655
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:54,910
I know you are strong, but you might get hurt. So, be careful.

656
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:59,960
Then, how about you, Doctor? You might get hurt, too.

657
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:06,450
Did you do it to show off in front of Gyo Chae Yeon?

658
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:09,230
I did it to show off in front of Chae Yeon?

659
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:12,710
I did it to save you, Ajumma.

660
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:16,580
So senseless. What a waste.

661
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,460
But, Doctor.

662
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:29,080
Why are you being nice to me?

663
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:36,350
You buy me food and coffee,

664
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:42,200
and you accelerated the date to catch my former husband,

665
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,070
saying that it was a gift for me.

666
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:51,540
Today, you saved me in front of Gyo Chae Yeon as well.

667
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,340
It was in front of Gyo Chae Yeon, but

668
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,090
will that be okay?

669
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,270
Why did you do that?

670
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:14,610
Perhaps

671
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:20,020
you like me?

672
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,640
I... I like you, Ajumma?

673
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,700
Ajumma, are you delusional?

674
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:31,610
Oh, it must be a fantasy.

675
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,360
The television is a problem.

676
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:38,180
These days there are too many stories about young men liking ajummas. The ajummas are losing their sense of reality.

677
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,500
Because of that, they think as they like.

678
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:53,370
You should stop watching TV. Become a single who has a sexy brain.

679
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:56,530
What do you mean, I like you? What a thing to say.

680
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,130
Comprehensive Psychological Analysis?

681
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,260
Han Tae Hee likes Sa ...

682
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,150
Sara?!

683
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:27,680
♫ Oh I'm in love with you, it's as if the season's changed ♫

684
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:32,530
♫ You're my ideal ♫

685
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:42,820
♫ It seemed like my heart stopped. Oh, I'm in love with you. ♫

686
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:49,050
♫ Like the season has changed, oh I'm in love with you, everything seems different. ♫

687
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,350
Preview

688
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:51,920
Where are you putting your hands?

689
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,500
Separate!

690
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,180
Promise me that you won't leave me.

691
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,420
All right, Kang Joon.

692
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,660
It's Sa Geum Ran. She's alive.

693
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:01,900
Where do you think this is? This is my house, my bedroom.

694
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,560
It seems like it will be my house soon.

695
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,500
What did you do to Geum Ran's mother?

696
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,380
You can't contact mother? Since when?

697
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,300
- But this ajumma...
- Ajumma?

698
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,380
- Why is Sara, Ajumma?
- Please help me look for my mom.

699
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,000
They can't contact my mom.

700
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,620
Mom?
