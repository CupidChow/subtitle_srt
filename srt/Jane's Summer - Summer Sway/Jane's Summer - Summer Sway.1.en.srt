1
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:24,435
SUMMER SWAY

2
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,481
Audition results are out!

3
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,822
Dance Company JIN's FANTASIA Casting
Charlotte – Han Seo-yoon Leah – Shim Jane

4
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,540
I thought you'd
get the principal role.

5
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,416
Why?

6
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:49,335
Seo-yoon was sobbing,
saying she messed up her audition.

7
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,673
Our company's lead is
either you or her.

8
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,427
- Seo-yoon, congrats!
- Congratulations!

9
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,844
Seo-yoon, you did good.

10
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,097
You're absolutely our best dancer.

11
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,727
Seo-yoon, congratulations!
You really are awesome!

12
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,064
There's no mention of your backup,
did the director mention anything?

13
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,858
How'd I know that?

14
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,067
You really don't?

15
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,485
Can you ask him then?

16
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,154
Just ask him.

17
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,603
Can you come to my
school reunion tomorrow?

18
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,811
Why should I?

19
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,523
What? Aren't we not
starting over?

20
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,649
Nope.

21
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,694
Then why did you
call me here today?

22
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,821
Because of your name.

23
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,365
What do you mean?

24
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,617
Alphabetically,

25
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,203
your name is on top
of my contact list.

26
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,962
So you're gonna call
'Kang Seok-jin' next?

27
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:21,964
Maybe.

28
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,676
You were always like this.

29
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,806
I'm the idiot for
expecting a change.

30
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,810
But you don't mean Seok-jin
from our dance company?

31
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,562
Mind your business.

32
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,231
I'll head out first.

33
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,566
Get some rest here.

34
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Welcome home.

35
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,952
Eat all that?

36
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,288
Sure, you need to eat
fruits of all colors.

37
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,291
These will make you more beautiful.

38
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Sit down.

39
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,215
I found something amazing today.

40
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,013
It's like you in high school,
isn't it amazing?

41
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,309
I loved it when you did ballet.

42
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,729
You should've sucked in,
the foot pain.

43
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,982
How could I?

44
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,651
My toes were a bloody mess
after losing toenails.

45
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,736
I remember.

46
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:30,616
Your dad saw that,
and made you quit ballet.

47
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,037
He was a big man,
who shivered at the sight of blood.

48
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,415
He was tender-hearted.

49
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,002
Pray to him for once.

50
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:46,048
And you're doing so well
after switching to modern dance.

51
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:50,386
Mom, should I quit the company?

52
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,055
Are you nuts?

53
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,558
You don't need to shout!

54
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:01,230
Did you fail the audition today?

55
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,481
Not again?

56
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,357
It's not that.

57
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,525
Then what?

58
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
Did you pass?

59
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,737
Yeah.

60
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,619
Jane! My gosh!
My dear Jane!

61
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,413
My darling!

62
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,458
I knew you could do it,
that's good news!

63
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,668
I'm so happy!

64
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,129
Thank you, Jane!

65
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,563
Ji-woo

66
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,318
Hey.

67
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,738
What are you doing?
Still on duty?

68
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,616
Yeah, a night flight.

69
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,410
Sounds kinda sexy.

70
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,372
You're still the same.

71
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,252
Failed an audition,
and a bout with mom,

72
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,546
so you're chugging a beer?

73
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,258
You should've become
a fortune teller instead.

74
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,055
But there's one problem.

75
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:20,560
I can't tell other people's fortune.

76
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:28,025
I can only see yours.

77
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,445
Where're you flying this time?

78
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,366
Bangkok.

79
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,226
Excuse me.

80
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,188
Could you lower the volume?

81
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,323
Your name?

82
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,744
What's your name?

83
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:07,958
What?

84
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,960
That's a rare copy...

85
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,171
Rare...

86
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,050
I'm so sorry.

87
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,468
I'll compensate you for it...

88
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,470
Forget it.

89
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,769
Are you a celeb or something?

90
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,523
Yes, I'm a singer.

91
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,109
A singer?

92
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,492
What did you sing?

93
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,079
It's called 'Soulmate'.

94
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,664
How does it go?

95
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,588
Why did you come to me so late,

96
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,175
so late, soulmate

97
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,969
You're my eternal home base,

98
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,389
soulmate, soulmate

99
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,981
Why did you come to me so late,

100
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,608
so late, soulmate

101
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,278
You're my eternal home base,

102
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,114
soulmate, soulmate

103
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,575
Why did you come to me so late,

104
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,327
so late, soulmate

105
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,955
You're my eternal home base,

106
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,584
soulmate, soulmate

107
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,600
Someone I've been looking for

108
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:53,481
I wish I'm that someone
you've been looking for

109
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,401
Hey!

110
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,235
My gosh!

111
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,112
You startled me!

112
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,199
- Jeez!
- I missed you!

113
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,744
- Did you get some shut eye?
- Yes.

114
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,662
You must be tired.

115
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,582
You came without
much convincing.

116
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,626
You told me to come.

117
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,461
Let's go!

118
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,379
Do you know Rainfall?

119
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,131
Rainfall?

120
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,551
The hip hop rapper?
He's popular nowadays.

121
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,554
Why mention him all of sudden?

122
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,264
He was sitting near me
on the plane.

123
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,768
Really? Did you get his autograph?

124
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,312
Did you?
Let me see!

125
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,940
I didn't!

126
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:36,941
Let's go!

127
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,733
I think you did.

128
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,108
I really didn't.

129
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,403
So late, soulmate

130
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,405
You're my eternal home base,

131
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,951
soulmate, soulmate

132
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,661
Why did you come to me so late,

133
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,248
so late, soulmate

134
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,083
You're my eternal home base,

135
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,128
soulmate, soulmate

136
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,019
This place hasn't changed at all.

137
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,528
It has, it looks different
every time I come here.

138
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,118
You must be hungry,
shall we eat something?

139
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,330
I don't want room service...

140
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,957
Let's go out!

141
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,626
What do you feel like?

142
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,588
Super high calories
and something fattening.

143
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:45,009
Dripping with grease
with lots of spices.

144
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,262
I know you won't
even touch those.

145
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,597
Aren't you on a diet?

146
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,098
Nope.

147
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,277
When did you get here?!

148
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,407
I'll make you pay!

149
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,334
Dude!

150
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,587
Stop, I mean it.

151
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,139
What about the company?

152
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,395
I'm sick of it, I'm gonna quit.

153
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,903
I envy you that you can quit
when you're sick of it.

154
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,411
It feels like we're celebrating
being here like this.

155
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,164
Celebrating you quitting
the company?

156
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,335
Nah, we're celebrating today!

157
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
Cheers.

158
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,222
Try it, it's good.

159
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,515
I'm good, you go ahead.

160
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,684
Just taste it.

161
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,814
Good, right?

162
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,231
Help yourself.

163
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,409
Don't you...

164
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,162
have something to tell me?

165
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,290
Nope.

166
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,120
Damn...

167
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,677
What's up?

168
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,845
Nothing.

169
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,351
Looks like you're productive,
you really are the boss.

170
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,978
It's all trash.

171
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,235
Boss, this place feels like a fortress.

172
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:38,242
You've set up a studio here
instead of flying back home.

173
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,042
Should I give it all up
and stick around here with you?

174
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,585
Piss off.

175
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,420
Your manager will kill me.

176
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,714
Will you stop calling me 'boss'?

177
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,634
I'm less than 6 months older.

178
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,803
Do you have to say that?

179
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,389
But I got mad respect for you.

180
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,600
You're the turning point
of my life.

181
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,814
My life is split into
before and after I met you.

182
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,983
Don't ever change
what you just said.

183
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:12,693
Okay...

184
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,152
Don't you dare!

185
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,821
That hurts, dude.

186
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,072
Did it hurt? Did it?

187
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,449
Stop it!

188
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,702
I'm hungry, let's get dinner.

189
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,704
Okay.

190
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,424
So hungry!

191
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,050
Yeah? We're here.

192
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,926
Let's order the good stuff.

193
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:39,720
Are you buying?

194
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:40,761
Of course!

195
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,763
Nice!

196
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,515
Bang!

197
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,516
What was that?

198
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,688
So cool here.

199
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,690
Right?

200
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,039
Are you a regular here?

201
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,458
You can say that.

202
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,585
You gotta work harder.

203
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,255
She doesn't recognize you, Rainfall.

204
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,134
Come on!

205
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,304
Oh man...

206
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,306
Eh?

207
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,560
He's Rainfall, isn't he?

208
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,969
That really looks like you.

209
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,278
That's Aung's dance studio.

210
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,530
She runs a dance studio?

211
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,240
I didn't know.

212
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,200
It's her main business.

213
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,037
But it's not profitable,
so she works here to make up.

214
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,416
Why doesn't she give it up
if it's not profitable?

215
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,796
She's not running
the studio for money.

216
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:05,884
She comes from a family of dancers,
including her grandma and mother.

217
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:11,973
'Jane's Dance' was established
almost a hundred years ago.

218
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,266
A hundred years?

219
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,645
She's awesome, isn't she?

220
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,399
How do you know
so much about her?

221
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,151
This is my regular joint.

222
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,780
I come here every time
I fly to Bangkok.

223
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:31,826
Aung always welcomes me warmly
so it feels so comfy here.

224
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,662
Is that right?

225
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,748
He's a regular here too.

226
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:38,874
Right?

227
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,585
Yeah.

228
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,512
Jane, you'll have to
visit that place.

229
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,931
Jane's Dance...

230
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,059
What a coincidence
that we meet again here.

231
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,353
I know, it's amazing.

232
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,356
It's meant to be,
Bangkok is a big city.

233
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,983
I got a pretty good hunch.

234
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,278
Are you a hip hop singer too?
A rapper?

235
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,114
I am in the industry but...

236
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,950
Don't google me, that'd be lame.

237
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,620
You two are best friends?

238
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,831
Yeah, we were middle
and high school classmates.

239
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,917
And up to 1st year in college.

240
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,544
We both majored dance,

241
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,006
but I dropped out and
became a flight attendant.

242
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,758
I see.

243
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,596
I can tell you're a good dancer,
too bad you quit.

244
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,265
Me? On what grounds?

245
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:41,855
Let's say your aura that
oozes from your body?

246
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,356
What's with you?

247
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,361
So you're a dancer?

248
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,614
A bona fide dancer.

249
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,911
Yeah, you can say that,
my dance company pays my salary.

250
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,332
But she danced better than me.

251
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,753
I should've quit,
and she should've danced.

252
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,844
These look so good,
we should eat.

253
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,845
Okay.

254
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,348
Go ahead.

255
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,226
Try it.

256
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,244
What are you doing?
Are you nuts?

257
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,454
See that? She's fantastic.

258
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,455
Right.

259
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,875
Ji-woo, you're so hot!

260
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,545
Are you interested in her?

261
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Sure.

262
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,843
What a pity, she's not
interested in you.

263
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,056
I'm quite popular with the ladies.

264
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,566
You shouldn't have dropped out.

265
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,861
I had family issues.

266
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,281
Jane actually paid
my tuition too.

267
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,575
Is that right?

268
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,579
She's a really good friend.

269
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,681
I googled you,
you're quite famous.

270
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,851
Jeez, I told you not to...

271
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,023
Then now you know
why I'm hiding out in Bangkok.

272
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,776
A famous songwriter exiled
after caught getting high...

273
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,195
A sob story, really.

274
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,031
We all experience slump.

275
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:25,745
Feels like you're in an endless hole,

276
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,456
wallow in self-pity,
feeling so useless.

277
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:36,297
Whether with alcohol or drugs,
you want to fill that void.

278
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,385
Isn't that how you felt?

279
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,806
I didn't expect you
to understand that feeling.

280
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,393
What do you fill that void with?

281
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,353
Well...

282
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,360
I've actually heard
a lot of your songs.

283
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,362
What's your favorite?

284
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,948
'Somebody'.

285
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,199
I'll be damned!

286
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,369
I'm sorry.

287
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,954
It's never anyone's
favorite song.

288
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,333
I like very expressive songs.

289
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:17,589
A song with powerful beats
and intense lyrics like 'Somebody'.

290
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,218
What else do you like?

291
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,388
'Dawn with Citron Tea'.

292
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,225
You only love sleepers.

293
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,437
I finally get to meet somebody
who mentions 'Citron Tea'.

294
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,356
It feels good.

295
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,985
Excuse me, where's the restroom?

296
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,613
Over there.

297
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,047
Mom!

298
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,617
Where are we going?

299
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,051
Dude, where did you go?

300
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,386
I needed some fresh air.

301
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,723
Where's Jane?

302
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,184
She's not back yet?

303
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,269
She went to the restroom earlier.

304
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,024
Ji-woo, your hotel pool is
under construction, right?

305
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,779
I got a pool at my place,
come by tomorrow.

306
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,906
Jane said she would come too.

307
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,534
Jane said that?

308
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,536
Please come.

309
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,956
Cheers!

310
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:38,957
Cheers.

311
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,906
So, you didn't come here for me.

312
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,701
What do you mean?

313
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,248
When you said
you were coming here,

314
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,084
I thought you might want it again.

315
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,336
You were the one
who friendzoned me.

316
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,591
Only because I knew
you were different than me.

317
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,763
I'm up for it, if you are.

318
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,351
Why is everything
so easy for you?

319
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,508
It's really awesome.

320
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,553
Everyone gets psyched.

321
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,181
Cheers!

322
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,475
Okay.

323
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:21,476
Cheers!

324
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,149
I told you, it's nothing.

325
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,904
She's just an old friend.

326
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:38,159
Don't take it the wrong way.

327
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,496
I'm flying in tomorrow.

328
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,165
Yeah, okay.

329
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,322
How long have you dated her?

330
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,454
About 3 months.

331
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:25,915
Is she pretty?

332
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,794
Very.

333
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,505
Prettier than me?

334
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,093
Yeah.

335
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,888
I see...

336
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:48,104
I haven't met a girl,
who's prettier than you.

337
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,239
Will you really quit school?

338
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,993
This is my last practice.

339
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,538
It's all over.

340
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,046
Dude.

341
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,755
You're finally up?

342
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,757
Yeah.

343
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,176
What are those?

344
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,594
These?

345
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,928
I bought some fruits
and something to eat.

346
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,266
And some souvenirs as well.

347
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,186
I see...

348
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,482
Look, isn't it pretty?

349
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,401
Yeah, it is.

350
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,863
I snatched up the last one.

351
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,615
Is it for Jane?

352
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,244
You know that you two
don't feel right, no?

353
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,747
It's not like that.

354
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,999
I just thought this place
felt too stark.

355
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,089
You need to eat more fruits,
it's good for you.

356
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,669
You gotta take care of yourself.

357
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,838
I've told you before,

358
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,593
don't touch my things
so recklessly.

359
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,262
I just...

360
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,140
I'll put these in the fridge.

361
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,729
You know what I'm talking about!

362
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,483
Put them back!

363
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:14,281
You can write good songs
even without drugs.

364
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,867
You know what?

365
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,165
I haven't written
a single song in a year here!

366
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,043
Not a single one!

367
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,255
I believe in you,
you can do this.

368
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,966
Believe in yourself too!

369
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,011
Believe in myself?

370
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:47,106
If you keep acting like this,
I won't come by anymore.

371
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,234
Do you know how many shows
I cancelled to be here?

372
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:54,905
Or do you want to live
without family, friends and music?

373
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,576
Then say so,
right here, right now!

374
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,398
Dance Newsletter – FANTASIA
to be the greatest show

375
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,526
Is the JJ Foundation's
sponsorship finalized?

376
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:33,319
Director Kim Gyu-sik

377
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,361
Why?

378
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,364
What is it this time?

379
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,368
They know shit about shows,
but talk like artists!

380
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,413
Okay.

381
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,998
Follow up tomorrow then.

382
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,000
Thanks.

383
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,174
You still don't get it?

384
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:59,886
I need to know why Seo-yoon
is better than me.

385
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,430
You really don't know,
or are you playing dumb?

386
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,599
I really don't know.

387
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,188
Have a seat.

388
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,622
Take it.

389
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,460
Put it back.

390
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,545
Give it a try.

391
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,896
It's ridiculous, right?

392
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,525
Why put something back
when it'll only crumble?

393
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,360
What are you trying to say?

394
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,363
Prep to be Seo-yoon's backup,
and start practicing tomorrow.

395
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,198
I've already played
backup 3 times.

396
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,284
Then do it for the fourth time.

397
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,079
I don't want to do it anymore.

398
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,086
What?

399
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,255
I won't do it anymore!

400
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,470
Are you saying
you're quitting the company?

401
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:34,148
Interview with Director Kim Gyu-sik
'Fantasia will be Irresistibly Elegant'

402
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,582
Jane isn't here yet?

403
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,585
Not yet.

404
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,088
Okay, get ready.

405
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,345
Begin.

406
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,317
Hello?

407
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:50,784
Over here.

408
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,661
Have a seat.

409
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,037
You came early.

410
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,497
Yes.

411
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,960
Aren't you hot?
This just came out.

412
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,132
So refreshing.

413
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,553
You smile a lot.

414
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,930
You're always smiling.

415
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,683
It's certainly better
than frowning.

416
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,227
Do you prefer this?

417
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,733
Why did you want to see me?

418
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,115
No reason...

419
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,775
Watch out!

420
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,319
Go ahead.

421
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,289
So fascinating.

422
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,010
Your hotel pool is
still under construction?

423
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,181
It's hot and sticky,
how about a swim?

424
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,663
Dude! Come join us!

425
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,374
Come on!

426
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:08,714
Is it cold?

427
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,016
Wanna try this?

428
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,267
Try what?

429
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,563
This is called 'side balance',
try it.

430
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,730
Like this?

431
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,652
That's too painful.

432
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,238
I prefer something like this.

433
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,197
Like this.

434
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,575
Jump?

435
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:37,576
Yeah.

436
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,493
Wanna try it?

437
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,493
Me?

438
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,790
It's best to jump in the water.

439
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,168
You won't get injured
even if you fall.

440
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:49,588
Lift me up on three.

441
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,215
One, two, three!

442
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,176
Jesus! I'm sorry!
Are you okay?

443
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,260
I'm fine.

444
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,305
I'm so sorry,
let me help you up.

445
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,434
One, two, three!

446
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,319
I got a show next week in Korea.

447
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:17,616
I'd like to invite you,
will you come?

448
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:25,998
You know,

449
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:30,170
it's the first time
inviting a girl to my show.

450
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,672
The first time.

451
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,052
You promised,
so you have to come.

452
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,948
Do you cook well?

453
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,121
Wanna taste it?

454
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:06,872
Sure.

455
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,595
It's delicious.

456
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,475
Live alone for a year,
this is no big deal.

457
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,603
All done?

458
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,397
Yeah.

459
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:33,191
Could you clean this up
and set the table?

460
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,400
Okay.

461
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,366
Dude.

462
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,953
Did you throw this out?

463
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,413
It's so precious.

464
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,876
Look at her face, she's smiling.

465
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,752
Do you like it?

466
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,547
Yes, it's pretty.

467
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,449
Morning.

468
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,158
Hey.

469
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,123
You're going out
to buy that figurine again?

470
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,709
Handcrafted stuff are
hard to come by.

471
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,295
You said it was the last one.

472
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,463
So I'm gonna go to
the weekend market.

473
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,091
I looked up online,
they sell wooden dolls there.

474
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,386
It's a half-day trip
with all that traffic.

475
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,679
I'll be right back.

476
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,222
Hey! Wait!

477
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,975
What a moron...

478
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,106
Were you startled?

479
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:01,983
It's nothing.

480
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,571
Would you like
to get some coffee?

481
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,531
Okay.

482
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,590
Isn't it nice?

483
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:32,222
I didn't see Rainfall,
did he go somewhere?

484
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,224
His girlfriend from Seoul came.

485
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:38,144
She wasn't going to make it,
but I guess things changed.

486
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,648
He didn't mention that
he had a girlfriend.

487
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,110
You didn't tell him about us neither.

488
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,784
Where did Ji-woo
fly out to this time?

489
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:56,871
She's not flying,
she went to see her lover.

490
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,589
Do you come here often too?

491
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,759
Yes, it's got a great view.

492
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,345
Coffee's good, right?

493
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,306
It's one of my few regular spots.

494
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,312
I've been to this café before.

495
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,690
You have? When?

496
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,319
Before my dad passed away,

497
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:32,907
I came here with my family.

498
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:38,997
It was our first and last family trip.

499
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:46,004
We were so happy back then.

500
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:53,887
After he passed away,
my mom only wears black clothes.

501
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:58,850
People might think that
she's still grieving, but no.

502
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,061
She's just angry.

503
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:08,234
She was his second mistress,
not even his first.

504
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,200
She couldn't even attend his funeral.

505
01:05:58,788 --> 01:05:59,788
Hey!

506
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:13,928
You okay?

507
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,954
Bud, listen to me, okay?

508
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,538
Let go!

509
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:45,204
Jane, what are you doing?

510
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,581
Can't you see?
Emptying my locker.

511
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:51,460
I was away for a week,
I'm sure I'm fired.

512
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:55,089
You should still talk
to the director though.

513
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,466
What will you do when you quit?

514
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:00,970
Who knows, get married?

515
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,222
No way.

516
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,182
How could a girl like you?

517
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:08,102
What do you mean?

518
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,437
It's nothing.

519
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,023
Jane, the director wants to see you.

520
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,164
Take it off.

521
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:30,915
Excuse me?

522
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:37,423
Change into your uniform,
and come to the practice room.

523
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,348
You're not a backup.

524
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:52,146
You and Seo-yoon will be
dual principals for this show.

525
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:08,453
Stop!

526
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,100
Your body's too stiff.

527
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:31,936
I'm sorry.

528
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:34,521
I didn't get to practice properly.

529
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:40,819
Okay, do the first part again.

530
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:42,738
Yes, sir.

531
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:21,819
Rainfall has Disappeared!
Tour Cancellation Imminent

532
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:33,496
Did you hear?

533
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:36,374
They're importing hologram tech
from Britain for this show.

534
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,209
That damn director must be excited.

535
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,962
It's all thanks to Jane.

536
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,588
I heard it's like $100,000 per.

537
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:44,591
Is Jane that rich?

538
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:47,176
No, that's not it.

539
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:48,469
Then what is it?

540
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,637
I'll tell you later.

541
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,764
Just spill it.

542
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,391
No, not now...

543
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:53,726
Why not?

544
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,702
What the hell are you doing?

545
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:13,996
Don't worry.

546
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:16,498
I won't ask you to date me,
let's do it your way.

547
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,992
I'm still practicing here.

548
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:58,332
That's enough,
I'll drive you home.

549
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,057
Where are we going?

550
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:21,355
My place is the other way.

551
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:49,550
You know how important
this show is to our company.

552
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:54,930
Even if there are 2 principals,
it's your first starring role.

553
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:58,099
It'll be a launching pad
for your career.

554
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,478
Yes, I know, thank you.

555
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,314
Speaking of which,

556
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:09,486
I heard you're close
with our male dancers.

557
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,574
Is it serious?

558
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:17,744
No, it's all meaningless.

559
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:20,914
Meaningless?

560
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:25,461
Right, I knew you'd say that.

561
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:31,717
Director, what did you
want to talk to me about?

562
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:36,179
You know that JJ Cultural Foundation
is our main sponsor.

563
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,974
We almost couldn't put this
show on without them.

564
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,769
But soon,
we'll hit jackpot with it.

565
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:51,111
JJ wants sexual favors
in return for their support.

566
01:14:58,577 --> 01:14:59,578
Hey!

567
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:06,125
Shim Jane.

568
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,463
Son of a bitch...

569
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:11,650
Mom...

570
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:13,735
Welcome.

571
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:17,364
I had so much trouble
finding this.

572
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:18,949
She looks exactly like you!

573
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,744
I found your replica this time.

574
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:29,585
No, I don't look like her.

575
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:37,551
Stop that!

576
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:41,388
I am me, I'm Shim Jane!

577
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:46,602
What are you doing?

578
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:49,061
I'm quitting the company.

579
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:52,441
What? Are you crazy?

580
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:56,361
How could you give up
the principal role now?

581
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,830
Kill yourself, if you want to.

582
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:10,334
I'll never be the great dancer
you want me to be.

583
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:14,296
So if you want to throw me out,
just do it already.

584
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,708
Ji-woo

585
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:06,472
Where are you?

586
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:07,808
Night flight.

587
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:10,227
That sounds kinda sexy.

588
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,812
Not again.

589
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:21,488
Are you crying?

590
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:27,661
What do I do?

591
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,714
I was so scared.

592
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:45,220
I know, you'll be fine,
it'll all work out.

593
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:52,728
Ji-woo... I... I...

594
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,405
Everything is messed up.

595
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:15,584
You might think that
you're hurting others,

596
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:22,549
but you're the one
who's hurt the most.

597
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,765
I went there.

598
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:32,267
Jane's Dance.

599
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:37,647
Yeah?

600
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:40,399
Yeah.

601
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:44,196
It was very old
and a little messy...

602
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:47,073
but it was good.

603
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,661
I met Aung's mother
and her grandma.

604
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:53,455
Must've been nice.

605
01:19:56,833 --> 01:20:01,129
So I wanted to tell you something.

606
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:04,800
You're not filling the void.

607
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:09,596
Our life is about...

608
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:15,060
filling our heart.

609
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:57,805
Hold it!

610
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:08,692
Pose.

611
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:10,275
Great work!

612
01:23:10,276 --> 01:23:12,861
- I'm so tired!
- So hungry.

613
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:14,823
Who's up for snack?!

614
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:27,252
- It's crazy!
- It's so close!

615
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,883
Why aren't you guys practicing?

616
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,760
Exam is approaching.

617
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:38,638
Miss, there's going to be
a concert near here.

618
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:40,097
What concert?

619
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:42,391
To commemorate
Rainfall's new single.

620
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:44,601
Could we practice harder
after getting his autograph?

621
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:46,687
Rainfall is cute AF!

622
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:47,688
Rainfall is mine.

623
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,565
Screw you, he's mine!

624
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:50,607
Let's go!

625
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:53,570
- Bye, Ms. Shim!
- See you tomorrow.

626
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:33,193
Message

627
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:47,415
I'm happy for you.

628
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:32,460
Honesty. mp4

629
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:02,073
I remember that day

630
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:05,034
Ever so clearly

631
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:12,124
We avoided each other

632
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:16,796
But I knew, we felt each other

633
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:22,802
I still feel you

634
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:26,639
Trying to lock eyes,

635
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:29,726
wanting the other to say a word

636
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:38,693
Hoping it wasn't a delusion

637
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,738
When I laid my eyes on you,

638
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:47,702
my entire world lit up

639
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:59,422
I turned into a naïve boy

640
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:07,472
Take me back,

641
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:13,228
to that innocent day

642
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:35,375
I turned into a naïve boy

643
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,591
Take me back,

644
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:49,180
to that innocent day

645
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:24,215
I turned into a naïve boy

646
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:31,306
Take me back,

647
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:37,437
to that innocent day
