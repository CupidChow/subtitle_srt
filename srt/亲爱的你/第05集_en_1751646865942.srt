1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240
sword

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the love letter you wrote.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I watch the butterflies dance with the wind.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I wait for the sunset to fill the grass.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am lonely and lonely.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I have to go through so many hardships to accompany you.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I am thinking of the beautiful girl who is like a flower in the morning and night.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I am walking through the wind and rain.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I have been through so many hardships.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I have known since I was a child that I can be with you.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I hope we can be as happy as before.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 10

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This one?

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This one.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Sister Yun has her own workshop.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why does she come to our team?

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Where is the director?

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Where is the director?

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Here he is.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Go to the theater.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Turn on the lights there.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Xiao Mi.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Find your sister.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why should I do it?

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You are so capable.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You are not capable.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Why are you here?

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't want to be isolated.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I am afraid that you will change me.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was rude at the theater yesterday.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No one is better than you in Ba Su Zhen.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Go.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I can't dance Ba Su Zhen in your heart.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What do you mean?

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I want to dance my own Ba Su Zhen.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't go.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Just make it clear.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You don't have time to be upset.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There are fewer and fewer audience in the team.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The new play is the same.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why is there no one watching?

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why?

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Traditional classics should be related to modern people.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How many years of re-enactment?

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Only work on music and choreography.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
For decades, I held the original idea.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I thought it was an experience.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The idea is to be updated when I get old.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Otherwise, everyone will be eliminated.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You are right.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You mean I should be eliminated.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I just want to dance.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
OK.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't want to talk alone.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What do you think?

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What do I think?

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yang Yun wants to turn Ba Su Zhen into a relationship between Bai Su Zhen and Xiao Qing.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You are Xu Xin.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Do you agree?

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I am also a democratic person.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Then we are all democratic.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
OK.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Come on.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
OK.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Come on.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
OK.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
OK.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
OK.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
OK.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
OK.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Come on.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Come on.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
OK.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
OK.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Come on.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When we rehearsed the day before yesterday,

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yang Yun had different opinions about Bai Su Zhen.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What does Bai Su Zhen mean to you?

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Tell me.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't want to say anything wrong.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Xiao Mi, you go first.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What's the situation?

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What's the situation?

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You talk the most.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What does Bai Su Zhen mean to you?

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why do you want me to say it?

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I am too stressed.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Xiao Yao.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Xiaoruo.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Xiaoruo, you say.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I didn't think about it.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Impossible.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You have learned the Bai Su Zhen made by the director.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
White Snake.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What does it look like?

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
A lot.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I can't say it at once.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You can say it now.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
A thousand years wait for a time

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Wait for a time

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A thousand years wait for a time

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't regret

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Who is in the ear

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Love me and don't change

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What unit are we in?

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
ballet troupe

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You work hard.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, there are a lot of male units in the male unit.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This is the most obvious.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Bai Su Zhen and Xiao Qing for a thousand years

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And Xu Xian for a dozen years

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Ten years

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The love between men and women is more moving.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Or the sister's feelings are deeper.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I have a disagreement with the director.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The public performance in nine days

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's not too late to adjust now.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
How can it be too late?

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Director wants to hear everyone's opinions.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I also want to agree with Xiao Qing and Bai Su Zhen.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
On the left side

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Agree with Xu Xian and Bai Su Zhen

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
On the right side

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Xiaoru

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Grandpa

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Put it on both sides

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Put it on both sides

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Half and half

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Just right

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Which side are you on

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Am I going to stand right?

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I am Xu Xian

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No back-up

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Can't get through

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I listen to the director in art.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I listen to Sister Yun in feelings.

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Anyway, you can see it.

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Xiaoming

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I am Xiao Qing

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hurry up

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Actually, I don't want to agree with Sister Yun.

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Brother Yin speaks better

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I support Sister Yun emotionally

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Director-General in art

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Mei Xiaoyao

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Sister Yun

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's your turn

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
My mother is playing Bai Su Zhen.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Then fell in love with my father

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I haven't seen my father

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hangzhou Lei Feng Tower

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
My mother died when I was in school.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I haven't been to Hangzhou.

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So what?

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I like Bai Su Zhen and Xu Xian.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why don't you just say it?

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You want to pick Bai Su Zhen

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Ok

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Ok

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But I don't want to rehearse today.

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
rest

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let me adjust

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How long do you adjust?

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Now announce the close of Bai Su Zhen

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Mei Xiaoyao

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Can you?

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Sister Yun

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Can

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So great

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Rehearsal for three people tomorrow

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Bai Su Zhen, Xiao Qing and Xu Xian

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Come on

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Miss

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Xiao Wei has arrived

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What are you doing?

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Really something

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What did I tell you yesterday?

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Make a plan

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What plan?

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Take Wen Xiaoyang

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Various tricks

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I fill it up for her every day

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's not a big deal

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Row

188
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Haven't seen it yet

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The girl you like

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's quite advanced

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's not that

192
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Ren Ni girl, right?

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Just cooperate with Ren Jin

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't be so embarrassed

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I mainly think so

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Just six days

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What's the matter after six days?

198
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Blow you

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Come on

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Come on

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Come on

202
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Come on

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm sorry

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I will practice more next time

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Already very familiar

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I've seen you before

207
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Who is she?

208
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
She?

209
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yin Yin

210
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Who is she?

211
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Xu Xian

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Put attention on the role

213
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Put it in action

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Put it in action

215
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Pretty good

216
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Shut up

217
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So much talk

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Stop

219
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm talking bad

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
From Xu Xian, Bai Shui Zhen

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The first drag start

222
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I have a relationship with Ying Ying for the first time

223
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sorry, sister

224
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I will continue to work hard

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What's the use of working hard

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Can this work?

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You don't believe her at all

228
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You don't want to rely on her

229
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You don't believe her

230
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What's the point of working hard

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
This is what you can solve

232
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You don't believe her at all

233
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You don't want to rely on her

234
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You don't believe her

235
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You don't believe her

236
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You don't believe her

237
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You don't want to rely on her

238
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You don't believe she is Xu Xian

239
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You have to go from the heart to every muscle

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You have to fully cooperate with her

241
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Whether it's a fall or not

242
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You have to completely believe her

243
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Cooperate with her

244
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You don't even do it

245
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Just for the love of men and women

246
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Afraid of falling

247
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Not afraid of death

248
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Eternal thunder and thunder are more serious than death

249
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Never turn over

250
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You love her so much

251
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Move your arms and legs

252
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This is the dance

253
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Just line up here today

254
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I can

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's okay

256
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't line up

257
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's okay

258
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry

259
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Disappointment

260
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Hello, director

261
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Director

262
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
On the field

263
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Director

264
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Director

265
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Director

266
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Director

267
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Director

268
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Director

269
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Where is Yang Yun

270
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't say you don't know

271
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
6 o'clock, I have an appointment to play ball

272
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Play ball

273
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Looking for injured

274
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
There are still eight days of performance

275
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He said anyway

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Anyway what

277
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Each one has a personality

278
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What's the situation

279
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Are you together

280
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Look at the situation

281
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He's in a bad mood these days

282
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Just like me

283
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's good for the wind and water

284
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Just like me

285
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Just say i found

286
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Where is the ball

287
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
His house

288
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Playing games on the TV

289
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Can you tell me

290
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Can you tell me

291
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm afraid you can't

292
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I think you can't

293
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Hello, lady

294
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Do you want to know about the East Cang'an house

295
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Fanhai's four-room

296
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You're also in the business capital

297
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
In a hurry

298
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Ignore you

299
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you don't need a house

300
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Make sure you know about insurance

301
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
If insurance doesn't need it

302
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We still do shopping

303
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I also do shopping.

304
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Socks, backpacks, water bottles,

305
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
everything.

306
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I have everything.

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If you are a fairy,

308
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
you don't need anything,

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
then look at the schedule I sent you.

310
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What schedule?

311
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Every day, I'll practice with you.

312
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What did you say yesterday?

313
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What did I say?

314
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yesterday, when we were drinking,

315
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
we practiced a very silly conversation.

316
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What did you say?

317
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I said

318
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
it's too awkward.

319
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You took it seriously?

320
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I didn't take it seriously.

321
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Okay, okay, okay.

322
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We don't take it seriously.

323
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So what?

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Let's continue practicing today.

325
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
First stop, Gu Gong.

326
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What?

327
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
There are 35 minutes left.

328
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Gu Gong's closed.

329
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
See you at the Shenwu Gate.

330
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll wait for you.

331
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
How can I go if it's closed?

332
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I took the promotional photos of Gu Gong.

333
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I took them every year.

334
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Today is a good day.

335
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You can take some sun.

336
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Hurry up.

337
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll wait for you.

338
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll wait for you.

339
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
See you tomorrow.

340
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Xiao Mi, Mr. Song is here.

341
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Mr. Song, coffee or tea?

342
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Is there fruit juice?

343
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Freshly fried.

344
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Fruit juice.

345
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Aunt, let's sit down and talk.

346
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Let's sit down.

347
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Where's Xiao Yao?

348
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
She went home.

349
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But my son

350
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
seems to have fallen in love with her.

351
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What's the gift?

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
My dad is very picky.

353
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
This is for you.

354
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're still so stingy.

355
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I like you.

356
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You like me, but you don't come by yourself.

357
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You even let your daughter come.

358
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I have to know the situation.

359
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What situation?

360
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
How old are you?

361
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You call me aunt.

362
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You don't know how old I am.

363
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Did your dad ask you to come?

364
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
No.

365
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Did your dad buy this ring?

366
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You really like my dad.

367
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Not bad.

368
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Then don't let my dad

369
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
be so stingy.

370
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Xiao Mi, you're a rich kid.

371
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You learned to dance.

372
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You're also very stubborn.

373
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You're not a big talker.

374
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Just this ring

375
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
is so stingy.

376
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I didn't mean that.

377
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Then you think

378
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm not suitable for your dad?

379
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
No.

380
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Be honest.

381
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't think so.

382
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's the problem.

383
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I also think it's not suitable.

384
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The ring is expensive.

385
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Take it back. Don't lose it.

386
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll have a drink with your dad later.

387
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Have a good chat.

388
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He can't help much.

389
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
He needs to take a break.

390
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll take two cups of snake wine every day.

391
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Didn't you say

392
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
that you would order fruit?

393
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This drink.

394
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Drinks are also fruits.

395
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

396
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What's wrong with him?

397
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What's wrong?

398
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I always give him fruit.

399
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
He said he wanted to go to the store.

400
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Why is he like this?

401
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Just say it.

402
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
He's so stubborn.

403
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Hello,Xiaomian.

404
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Where are you?

405
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Walking.

406
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm not happy.

407
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What's wrong?

408
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I was told by the big ghost that there was no power.

409
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What are you doing?

410
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm almost in the ancient palace.

411
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'll tell you when I get home.

412
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm here.

413
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm here.

414
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm here.

415
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm here.

416
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm here.

417
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Xiaomian.

418
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Why are you not happy?

419
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Tell me.

420
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Nothing to say.

421
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Where is the sunset?

422
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Well.

423
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It was a bit of a sunset just now.

424
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Isn't it suddenly raining and windy today?

425
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The plan can't be changed.

426
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Let's take a walk together.

427
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Right?

428
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You

429
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
have a lot of work to do.

430
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll go to the store.

431
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'll go to the store.

432
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll go to the store.

433
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll go to the store.

434
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'll go to the store.

435
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'll go to the store.

436
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'll go to the store.

437
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Have you been here before?

438
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
No.

439
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That's right.

440
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
There are many people.

441
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's all people who come here.

442
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Unlike today,

443
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
we can fully experience

444
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
how big the emperor's house is.

445
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I didn't come when there were many people.

446
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
How many years have you been in Beijing?

447
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I just haven't been here.

448
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Don't come over.

449
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Stop.

450
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Don't move.

451
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Make it clear.

452
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What?

453
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The plan can't be changed.

454
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
What do you mean?

455
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The plan is like this.

456
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I haven't been in a relationship.

457
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You are the first time.

458
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We both have no experience.

459
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I actually just wanted to avoid embarrassment.

460
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So I listed the list.

461
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
There are time, location, and scenic spots.

462
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You have seen them all.

463
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So it doesn't matter.

464
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
If you feel vulgar,

465
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
we can change it to something exciting.

466
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Are you like this to others?

467
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
What kind?

468
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Why don't you speak properly?

469
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
All like this.

470
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Why are you nervous?

471
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I...

472
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Don't misunderstand.

473
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm like this to everyone.

474
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Did you get hurt in the fight yesterday?

475
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Let me tell you.

476
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's the first time we meet.

477
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm on the right.

478
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yesterday, I got hit on the left.

479
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
If I kick my head off now,

480
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll be like Nezha.

481
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Two big bags on both sides.

482
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Mr. Song also told me.

483
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
We might have a little conflict.

484
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
We met twice and hurt twice.

485
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So the third time,

486
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
there might be life-threatening.

487
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So I put this location

488
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
on the central line of the city.

489
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm trying to avoid the danger.

490
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
What about avoiding?

491
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Avoid?

492
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Unless you're my end.

493
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm your end?

494
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm your end?

495
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's a date.

496
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Let's talk about something hard.

497
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What about after the meeting?

498
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
After the meeting, I'll take you to visit.

499
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Let me tell you.

500
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Don't be so impatient.

501
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's just this day.

502
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You really can't stay.

503
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
This six or seven hundred years old house

504
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
is in the shade, raining, and windy.

505
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's very humid.

506
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
If you meet anything, you'll climb.

507
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Are you afraid?

508
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Don't scare me.

509
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm not.

510
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm not scaring you.

511
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And it's only thirty minutes.

512
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The inn is not clear.

513
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Let's go for a walk.

514
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll go too.

515
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Let's go now.

516
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
No?

517
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
No.

518
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Let's go.

519
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Then...

520
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'll go.

521
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'll leave you alone.

522
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
No need.

523
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm really leaving?

524
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm leaving.

525
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm leaving.

526
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm leaving.

527
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm leaving.

528
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm leaving.

529
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm leaving.

530
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm leaving.

531
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm leaving.

532
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm leaving.

533
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm leaving.

534
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm leaving.

535
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm leaving.

536
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm leaving.

537
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm leaving.

538
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm leaving.

539
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm leaving.

540
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm leaving.

541
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm leaving.

542
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm leaving.

543
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm leaving.

544
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm leaving.

545
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm leaving.

546
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm leaving.

547
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm leaving.

548
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm leaving.

549
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm leaving.

550
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm leaving.

551
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm leaving.

552
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm leaving.

553
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm leaving.

554
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm leaving.

555
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm leaving.

556
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm leaving.

557
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm leaving.

558
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm leaving.

559
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm leaving.

560
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm leaving.

561
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm leaving.

562
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm leaving.

563
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm leaving.

564
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm leaving.

565
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm leaving.

566
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm leaving.

567
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm leaving.

568
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm leaving.

569
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm leaving.

570
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm leaving.

571
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm leaving.

572
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm leaving.

573
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm leaving.

574
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm leaving.

575
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm leaving.

576
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm leaving.

577
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm leaving.

578
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm leaving.

579
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm leaving.

580
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm leaving.

581
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm leaving.

582
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm leaving.

583
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm leaving.

584
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You don't have a progresskey right?

585
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Where are you?

586
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You don't need to ask me where I am!

587
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Don't mind where I am.

588
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,600
Anyway, you're at Kunning Palace now.

589
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
West Square.

590
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,600
Didn't you ask me to leave?

591
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,400
I don't understand what you mean.

592
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,000
But I can't be ungrateful.

593
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'll take you to the Palace of the Apes from afar.

594
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Go forward.

595
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Keep going up the stairs.

596
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,600
Okay, okay, okay. Be careful not to fall.

597
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
And then?

598
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Now, go to your right.

599
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,600
Yes, yes.

600
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,600
The hall in front is the Palace of the Apes.

601
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,800
The door in the east of the Palace of the Apes

602
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,400
goes through there.

603
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,200
East. Right hand, right hand.

604
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,600
Yes, yes, yes. To your right.

605
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Okay.

606
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
I'm out.

607
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Now, it's the dry pool of Qian Qingkong.

608
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
See?

609
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,000
Go ahead is the Palace of the Apes.

610
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,400
The Palace of the Central and the Palace of the Tai.

611
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,000
After the Tai, the door will be the gate.

612
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,200
Where are you? Come out.

613
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,400
Zhou Tong.

614
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm telling you.

615
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,200
You really have to go faster.

616
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,600
I saw the Sky Kingdom.

617
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,800
There's going to be a heavy rain tonight.

618
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,200
I'm ignoring you.

619
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,800
You're the one who told me to go, right?

620
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Come out.

621
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,400
We two are like a bunch of bugs.

622
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,600
I'm afraid I'll stay with you for a while.

623
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,000
If I stay for a while, I'll have to go out again.

624
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,800
Get out.

625
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,000
Zhou Tong.

626
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
Zhou Tong.

627
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Zhou Tong.

628
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,400
Oh, my.

629
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Zhou Tong!

630
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Zhou Tong!

631
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,200
Zhou Tong.

632
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Zhou Tong!

633
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Come out!

634
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Zhou Tong!

635
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Hey, hey, hey.

636
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,400
Hey, over there.

637
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,800
Who are you calling?

638
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
What are you doing?

639
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,200
How did you get in?

640
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,600
My friend came with me.

641
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,400
Zhou Tong.

642
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,200
He's taking pictures.

643
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,400
Zhou Tong?

644
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,600
There's a wedding here.

645
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,000
You go out first.

646
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You go out first.

647
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,800
He's still here.

648
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
It's already cleared.

649
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,000
Let's go. We'll take you out.

650
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,400
Let's go.

651
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Let's go.

652
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,400
Okay, stop looking. Let's go.

653
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,800
Let's go.

654
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,800
Brother Tong, why didn't you go up today?

655
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Okay.

656
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,200
Give me a drink.

657
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,800
Okay.

658
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,000
You were saying

659
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,400
after a long time, the truth came out.

660
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Now after long time,

661
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,800
knowing that I like you

662
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,000
is true.

663
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
You lived your life.

664
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,200
I already jumped in.

665
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,400
It's kind of embarrassing.

666
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,600
So,

667
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,000
I won't dare to see you again.

668
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Let's

669
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,700
just go with the flow.

670
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,600
Plans are all set.

671
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,500
The photos

672
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,900
You are the one who took the photos in the morning.

673
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,820
I don't have the copyright.

674
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,980
A total of ten photos.

675
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,060
Don't ask me what's the situation today.

676
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,100
What's the situation?

677
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,060
I think

678
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,340
it's not right.

679
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,100
Don't be so self-conceited.

680
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,740
I'll eat.

681
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,700
Do you think I'm not good to Uncle Hui?

682
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,460
Qin Haodan

683
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,660
always orders him to do things.

684
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,540
I should indulge him.

685
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,380
What do you want?

686
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,060
He should do it.

687
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,300
He shouldn't make things up.

688
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,740
What?

689
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,020
His love for Aunt Song

690
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,020
is complicated.

691
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,380
I don't know what to say

692
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,020
if I give this ring to my dad tomorrow.

693
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,860
Uncle Hui and Aunt Song are so good.

694
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,380
Do you think it's appropriate?

695
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,780
It's not appropriate.

696
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,420
Right?

697
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,940
What do you think?

698
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,380
Aunt Song also thinks

699
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,020
what should I do with my dad?

700
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,020
It's a comfort to Uncle Hui.

701
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,540
What are you looking at?

702
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,140
Zhou Butong?

703
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,580
Did you go to Zhou Butong?

704
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,660
Aunt Song said so.

705
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,820
It was a temporary decision.

706
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,020
She called me

707
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,740
and said she wanted to apologize.

708
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,660
She made trouble when she was drunk.

709
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,660
Did she fall in love with you?

710
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,020
It's useless.

711
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,460
She's in love with Zhou Butong.

712
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,780
She's observing men in love secretly

713
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,780
and she's feeling our little mood.

714
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,180
She said she won't see you again.

715
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,940
What?

716
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,540
It's impossible to be in trouble, right?

717
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,100
She even made a plan.

718
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,380
From now on,

719
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,300
Beijing will be closed every day.

720
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,820
What about your trip?

721
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,580
She's in trouble.

722
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,140
I have to hold myself back.

723
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,220
If you fall in love with her,

724
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,660
you'll be like your mom.

725
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,020
Really?

726
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,740
Aunt can't play Bai Suzhen.

727
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,060
You haven't even lost Bai Suzhen.

728
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,300
You're still young when you're in love and married.

729
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,780
I'm not old enough.

730
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,860
I want to tell you.

731
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,220
Yeah.

732
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,660
See.

733
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:53,340
I never knew we're

734
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,260
no longer worth it when we chinese fight for him.

735
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,700
I've taken it out for a long time.

736
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,620
Jiang alive.

737
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,180
Aren't you going somewhere to practice?

738
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,060
You'd better hurry up.

739
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,380
Get well quickly.

740
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,540
OK.

741
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:11,940
Go home.

742
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,260
Then I'm leaving.

743
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,220
Get in.

744
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,060
Space station?

745
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,340
Do practicing tomorrow.

746
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,420
What's going on between you and Yingye?

747
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,860
He's quite nice.

748
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,020
He's nice?

749
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,180
The kind I like.

750
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,620
Are you sure?

751
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,060
I'm slowly getting it.

752
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,020
He's younger than you.

753
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,820
Only three years old.

754
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,820
Not suitable.

755
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,020
Fengjian.

756
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,060
It's just about you.

757
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,500
You're so old-fashioned.

758
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,580
You can't even listen to your heart.

759
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,180
These are all your problems.

760
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,860
Is there anything wrong?

761
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,380
I didn't respect you.

762
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,980
I don't respect you.

763
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,180
I'm a director.

764
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,340
I'm your teacher.

765
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,820
You don't respect me.

766
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,900
You just don't respect yourself.

767
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,860
You don't respect me.

768
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,780
You just don't respect yourself.

769
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,820
I'm telling you the truth.

770
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,060
You told me to respect you.

771
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,140
I know.

772
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,460
The Eighth Route Army has been updated for generations.

773
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,300
It's a natural rule.

774
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,460
This may be the last time I've done a big show in the Eighth Route Army.

775
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,300
You're too young.

776
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,220
I can't do it without you.

777
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,700
I've been your teacher all the way from the five-year period.

778
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,540
You're old enough.

779
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,740
You can help me out.

780
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,420
I'm gonna get a marry license.

781
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,660
Even if you can't get married,

782
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,900
who does he ruin his dream?

783
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,620
He does that at every house.

784
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,300
I'm the first wife.

785
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,900
Wasn't it quite fishy?

786
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,900
That looks like a correct one.

787
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,420
Be novel.

788
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,920
Don't spend money on a random.

789
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,700
This is all about the mood.

790
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,180
Try to look pretty.

791
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,380
Mycam's Bai Suzhen

792
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,740
makes me feel upset again.

793
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,700
I think it's nice of you

794
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,960
to communicate so comfortably in person.

795
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,520
Is he also comfortable?

796
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,080
Yes, indeed.

797
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,740
You mentioned Song Jian on your rehearsal today.

798
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,220
How much that is?

799
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,500
Not very good.

800
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,060
Think 60 like you do every day.

801
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,080
It's got nothing to do with it.

802
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,120
You and Director Song mentioned it.

803
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,880
What did you mention?

804
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,560
You're not feeling well.

805
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,840
I'm embarrassed to say it again.

806
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,360
I'm not talking in a polite way.

807
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,120
You can say it to me.

808
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,640
You can say that I don't have any feelings for you.

809
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,440
I don't have feelings for you.

810
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,600
I can't cooperate with you.

811
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,400
There's no firework between us.

812
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,680
You've been together for so long.

813
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,520
I think there's a firework between us.

814
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,960
I said we're rehearsing.

815
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
If you don't mention it,

816
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,320
there will be no other firework.

817
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,160
What is this about?

818
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,480
We...

819
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,480
You have to stay at the final stop.

820
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,080
Take care of the scale.

821
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,880
Again.

822
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,360
Slow down.

823
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,440
Don't move.

824
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,320
Come on, have a rest.

825
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,640
Everyone is surprised,

826
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,640
What do you want to say?

827
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
Then I'll say it

828
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,640
I think sister Yun is more strange

829
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
How strange?

830
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Manager didn't make a promise

831
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,640
No feelings

832
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Can't cooperate

833
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,640
I have no fire between her

834
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
Yes

835
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Not at all

836
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,640
Right?

837
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
Can you still jump?

838
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
Can't

839
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
Yang Yue rest

840
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
Wait for me in the sky

841
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Yan Yan, can you still jump?

842
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
I can, director

843
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
Yang Yue

844
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Yes

845
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
You jump the white-hose needle and continue rehearsing

846
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
Music

847
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
Start from the second

848
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,640
Sister, let's go to the human world together

849
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,640
I can't get over it

850
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
The wing is really hard

851
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,640
You gave me the wing

852
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,640
You are my teacher

853
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,640
It's good to know

854
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,640
You are 54 years old

855
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
One less play

856
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,640
I am 31

857
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
One year less jump

858
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,640
I am not a good person

859
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
I am not a good person

860
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,640
I am not a good person

861
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,640
I am not a good person

862
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
Can you say something psychological?

863
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
Heart peace

864
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
I am not a good person

865
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
I am not a good person

866
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
I am not a good person

867
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
I am not a good person

868
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,640
I am not a good person

869
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,640
I am not a good person

870
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,640

I am not a good person

872
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
I am not a good person

873
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,640
I am not a good person

874
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,640
I am not a good person

875
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,640

I am not a good person

879
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640

883
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,640
I am not a good person

884
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,640

885
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,640
