1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Friends of the Three Kingdoms

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the hall

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wait for the sunset to spread the grass

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my heart into a song and sing it gently

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Loneliness is like a long journey

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Accompanying is the return

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like a dream, the beautiful girl is left behind

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Wind and rain, the road is complicated

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Time is long, from small to big

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
May you and me be together

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Beijing is big and crowded.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's getting dark from the hotel.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Why do you come to see her?

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Wen Xiaoyao.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I will see her sooner or later.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Building 2, 201.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will wait for you outside.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Beijing

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Beijing

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Beijing

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Mom

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Xiaobian

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What?

27
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Get in the car.

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I won't.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hurry up.

30
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What are you two asking?

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Nothing.

32
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Why?

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Tomorrow is the first day.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
One is Xiaoqing, the other is Xiaobai.

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What a good thing.

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What's the problem?

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Bai Suzhen and Xu Xianhao.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Xiaoqing can't be convinced.

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We are both in trouble.

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We are both feeling.

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What do you think I am?

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Why are you sitting here?

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Did you go up?

44
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No.

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No.

46
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No one.

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Do you want to try?

48
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is the window.

49
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Tell me.

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Why did you bring me here?

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why did you disappear at noon?

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I saw her.

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Who?

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
She.

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The bridge near the hotel.

56
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I followed her.

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I thought I was following you.

58
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Then I saw Wen Xiaoyao holding her hand.

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And then?

60
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
She got on the bus.

61
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I followed Wen Xiaoyao to the ballet troupe.

62
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
She will perform tomorrow.

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Bai Shouzhuang, Bai Suzhen.

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What a coincidence.

65
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We made such a big effort in Hangzhou.

66
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We checked the surveillance cameras.

67
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We met in Beijing.

68
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We will watch her girlfriend's Bai Shouzhuang tomorrow.

69
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Her mother is Jia Sulan.

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You...

71
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You asked her?

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How can such a coincidence happen in the world?

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What kind of person is Wen Xiaoyao?

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You will see it yourself later.

75
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I will be there.

76
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Tell me.

77
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's the reason?

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I told you.

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Nothing.

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Xiaoyao.

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Zhou Tong.

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why are you so unlucky?

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You two met each other.

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's all your fault.

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You asked me to arrange it.

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Zhou Tong's child is pretty good.

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes, she is.

88
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Dad, don't interrupt me and Xiaoyao.

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't dislike Zhou Tong.

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But they really got along in just two days.

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Do you know?

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's normal.

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What's your problem?

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't have a problem.

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't tell.

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Xiaoyao has a problem too.

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Why don't you talk about her?

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You are so mischievous.

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You bully people.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
How dare I bully you?

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's normal that you bully me.

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You can't bully Xiaoyao.

103
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I didn't.

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Uncle Hui.

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We are fine.

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's okay.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You two.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You grew up together.

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You can't get through it.

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Apologize to Xiaoyao.

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry, Xiaomi.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Apologize.

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Stop it. Dad asked me to apologize to you.

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Apologize.

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Don't say it.

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't look for me.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm so anxious.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Say sorry.

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm a good girl.

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I have no evil intentions.

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's all my fault.

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Come back.

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Xiaomi.

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Xiaomi.

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Xiaoyao.

127
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Get in the car.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Xiaomi is missing.

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Get in the car.

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
She can't treat herself.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let uncle think about it.

132
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Not only go back to the park,

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
but also go back to me.

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Get in.

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Tomorrow is the first day.

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Go home and rest.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm going to the park.

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll go with you.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll go with you.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll go with you.

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll go with you.

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll go with you.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll go with you.

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll go with you.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll go with you.

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll go with you.

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll go with you.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll go with you.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll go with you.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll go with you.

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll go with you.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll go with you.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll go with you.

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'll go with you.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll go with you.

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll go with you.

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll go with you.

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll go with you.

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll go with you.

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll go with you.

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll go with you.

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll go with you.

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll go with you.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll go with you.

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll go with you.

166
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll go with you.

167
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll go with you.

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's meet again.

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You should go first.

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't be afraid.

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hurry up.

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll go.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't know when he'll be back.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If you get tired,

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,180
I just feel like this would be normal between us.

176
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,900
Dian Dian,

177
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,720
do you know why...

178
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,320
we're getting together so quickly?

179
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,220
Time is so short.

180
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,060
Tell me.

181
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,940
Since I was ten,

182
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,260
I've been living alone.

183
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,960
I took care of things for myself.

184
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,960
I met you later.

185
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
I really like being arranged by you.

186
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
I also like you

187
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
to treat me as yours.

188
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,960
It's easy and safe.

189
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
I know

190
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
you once

191
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
lost a gun.

192
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,960
I was afraid.

193
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
But think about me.

194
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
I was afraid too.

195
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
I was afraid

196
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
because I lost you

197
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
by accident.

198
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Or

199
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
you didn't want to remember me.

200
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,960
What will my future be?

201
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
If what you said

202
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
is really a pre-destruction,

203
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
then I'll see you now.

204
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,960
You don't want to see him?

205
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
I might

206
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
just want to see

207
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
the same person as me.

208
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
I don't want to see him.

209
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
But he

210
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
has nothing to do with me.

211
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Really?

212
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Actually,

213
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
when you said you would take me to see him,

214
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
I was thinking

215
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
how to make you feel at ease.

216
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
You said you wouldn't come.

217
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
That makes you feel even more at ease.

218
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Wait another ten minutes.

219
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
He won't come, we'll leave.

220
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Fifteen minutes.

221
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Fifteen minutes?

222
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Fifteen minutes in your life.

223
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Okay.

224
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
If you're sleepy,

225
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
lie down.

226
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Xiao Xiao.

227
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
You've been

229
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
so close to me for so many years.

230
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Don't treat yourself like a stranger.

231
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
I'm not.

232
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
You have to be like Xiao Mi.

233
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
You have to be brave enough to yell at me.

234
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
In my heart,

235
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
you're the same as Xiao Mi.

236
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Thank you, Uncle Hui.

237
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
You're still close to me.

238
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
And

239
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
you're the one in my heart.

240
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm not as good as you.

241
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
She's too dependent on you.

242
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
As her sister,

243
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
you should be more lenient with her.

244
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
If Xiao Mi doesn't talk to me anymore,

245
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
I'll be so sensible that I'll be dead.

246
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
That's not enough.

247
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
She'd rather not talk to me

248
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
than talk to you.

249
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Wait a little longer.

250
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
She's the one who finally surrenders.

251
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Uncle Hui, I'm going up.

253
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
Have a good rest.

254
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Her clothes

255
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
are almost the same as the one inside you.

256
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Aren't they the same sweater?

257
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
The same color.

258
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
How many minutes?

259
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,960
It should be ten minutes.

260
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Three years ago,

261
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
there was a company check-up.

262
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
I think I met her

263
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
when I was about to catch a cold.

264
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
I know.

265
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
She's a salesperson.

266
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
She's not in Ningbo usually.

267
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,460
She said she wanted to

268
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
meet you through her database.

269
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
What about then?

270
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,940
She frequently goes on business trips

271
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,960
so she can only call you the video call.

272
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
The longer you call,

273
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,960
the more empty you feel.

274
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,320
All right.

275
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,400
At some point,

276
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,520
My point is

277
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,960
You have to appreciate there is always a forever

278
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
comrades

279
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,240
You are the one

280
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,840
Who cloud me

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,840
There is only one

282
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,240
The약

283
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,520
My Rhyme

284
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,400
With you

285
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,480
In this night

286
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,520
Someone drained the bank

287
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,160
I think you get the母ер

288
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
We are together

289
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,640
And��겠습니다

290
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,480
It's so nice to meet you again.

292
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,360
Actually, the first time I saw you,

293
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,320
I had a good impression of you.

294
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,360
Do you like flowers?

295
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,240
You told me before that

296
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
when your mother died...

297
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
I like it.

298
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,400
Then why don't you keep it at home?

299
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,000
Flowers are flowers.

300
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,280
Then why didn't you turn off the light at the bedside?

301
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,000
The light is the light.

302
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,400
Are you a partial person?

303
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,960
Yes.

304
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,320
Then you said two partial people

305
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,680
are perfect for each other.

306
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,800
Perfect.

307
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,640
Have you been here for 15 minutes?

308
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,960
Almost.

309
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,280
Are you going back?

310
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,960
Do you want to see the West Sea tomorrow?

311
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,080
No.

312
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,040
Thank you for being so nice to me.

313
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
Do you want more water?

314
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,000
No.

315
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,560
Then I won't take it.

316
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,640
It's heavy on the way.

317
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,720
Hello, is this the girl you are looking for?

318
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,400
No.

319
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,560
Sorry.

320
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,040
Not a call, her number is busy now.

321
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:02,640
ores Korean

322
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,280
Mom.

323
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,480
Have you seen my phone?

324
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,520
I didn't see it!

325
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,120
You look for it by yourself.

326
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,660
my feelings at that time

327
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,200
I was glad that you meant well

328
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,000
Dearest,

329
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
we deploy them,

330
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,320
promise to createmore resilient

331
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,120
family

332
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,020
if you really love your hidden love

333
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,760
please treat me better

334
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
from now on

335
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,400
Now let it be

336
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,200
I promise

337
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,660
I will keep dreaming

338
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,100
I'm asleep. I'm not thinking about it.

339
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,860
Xiao Yao.

340
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,140
I'll drive Xiao Min to pick you up tomorrow.

341
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,500
No need, Uncle Hui.

342
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,700
Your auntie just called me.

343
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,500
She's crazy. She's so loud. She's afraid something might happen.

344
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,940
We're the first in safety.

345
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,220
I'll send you two to the troupe.

346
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,380
We'll rehearse at noon.

347
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,540
We'll do an interview and make up in the afternoon.

348
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,940
Understand?

349
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,260
I heard you.

350
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,220
I've got two ideas.

351
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,700
A green snake and a white snake. All in one.

352
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,140
I'm so excited.

353
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,980
Sleep well.

354
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:23,800
Sound of Scratching

355
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,980
I'm reading the book you love

356
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,980
Your back is so busy

357
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,980
You make me some hot tea

358
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,980
How ordinary but I can't help it

359
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,980
I'm happy

360
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
I don't need much

361
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,980
I just want to have the satisfaction of my heart

362
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,980
I met you in the crowd

363
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,980
It's a good thing

364
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,980
Even if time is blurry

365
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,980
And the temperature of the palm

366
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,980
I take the bill as a city

367
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,980
Slightly speaking

368
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,980
I want to be with you

369
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,980
A smile brings every protection

370
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,980
Stay with me for a long night

371
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,980
Make the heart count

372
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,980
A year of writing a piece of memory

373
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,980
Every move

374
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,980
I take your eyes as if you were in the past

375
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,980
I hope time will be like the past

376
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,980
I'm sorry

377
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,980
I'm sorry

378
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,980
I'm sorry

379
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,980
I'm sorry

380
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,980
I'm sorry

381
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,980
I'm sorry

382
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,980
I'm sorry

383
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,980
I'm sorry

384
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,980
I'm sorry

385
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,980
I'm sorry

386
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,980
I'm sorry

387
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,980
I'm sorry

388
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,980
I'm sorry

389
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,980
See you on the street

390
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,980
Chatting in the car

391
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:47,660
Happy for the name of the company

392
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,540
Red light

393
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,420
Not you

394
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,100
Early or late

395
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,820
I got up so early in the morning

396
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,340
Brush teeth

397
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,500
Brush teeth

398
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,460
Brush teeth in the early morning

399
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,100
OK, you are great

400
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,180
Really hygienic

401
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,540
You have something to do

402
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,980
Hurry up and find a man

403
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,420
I'm alone all day

404
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,060
How dangerous is the light?

405
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,420
I'll help you hang the light bulb

406
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,660
Brother Hong

407
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,780
Your old man is really annoying

408
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,940
Most of the time

409
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,460
Hurry up and vomit

410
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,180
Don't be so cruel

411
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,100
I'll grab it later

412
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,140
Mom

413
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,380
Come here

414
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:34,900
Come

415
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,940
I cooked porridge

416
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,340
It's okay, don't be busy

417
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,980
Hot tofu and beef strips

418
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:40,940
Come

419
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,820
What are you doing here?

420
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,300
I'm not doing anything

421
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,580
I just feel sorry for mom

422
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,980
I've been working hard for you these years

423
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,020
Later

424
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,980
I'm going to the rehearsal room downstairs

425
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,100
Wipe the floor

426
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,260
Otherwise you go

427
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,300
No problem

428
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,140
I'll go after eating

429
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,140
Come

430
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,620
Hot

431
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:09,900
God

432
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,300
This is better

433
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,860
We can save it if we can

434
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,500
I am willing to clear the table

435
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,780
Though it's not out of stock

436
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,540
A simple thing

437
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,660
Birthday

438
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,340
until

439
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,700
I force your child to do it

440
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,140
between

441
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,460
I only in my mind

442
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,580
It's okay

443
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,020
Why should I put it like this

444
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,340
At least you and your memories

445
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:26,860
like

446
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,740
I have an idea

447
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,020
I'll give you land

448
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,860
when you start living

449
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:28,980
Just turn it over

450
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,700
OK

451
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,220
This

452
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,540
circles

453
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,060
so

454
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,500
Just stick it all out

455
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:35,820
like that

456
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:36,980
OK

457
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,260
Any other special experiences

458
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,780
It's good to walk around

459
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,900
I'm not in the human world

460
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,340
Don't look for a boyfriend

461
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,780
I have to heal

462
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,460
How long

463
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,660
Don't talk about me

464
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,100
You always go home alone

465
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,620
I think you should find one

466
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,700
Don't look at me

467
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,740
I'm serious

468
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,220
I support you to find one

469
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,820
Look at me for your girl

470
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,420
I can see it

471
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,020
Why do you need to see her

472
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,460
Five horses and a long gun

473
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,700
I know it when I cut the ground

474
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,060
Isn't this good?

475
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,060
OK

476
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,140
Don't pull on mom

477
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,500
Mom is old

478
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,940
I really didn't pull

479
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,020
You said you alone

480
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,500
Raise me up from small to big

481
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,620
Not easy

482
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,420
If you really meet someone you like

483
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,540
Good

484
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,300
Just find one, what's wrong

485
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,660
I look at you happy

486
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,980
I feel comfortable

487
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,660
You have to continue to fall in love

488
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,660
what happened

489
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,780
look

490
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,380
This is not a few days

491
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,260
You are cold and hot

492
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,900
Talk to me

493
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,460
How long haven't you talked to mom

494
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,300
That still has to

495
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,140
Still have to feel someone's kiss

496
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,900
very serious

497
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,300
I think it's good

498
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,020
I just think, even like this

499
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:23,340
You should think it

500
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,980
if you want to sit

501
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,780
Huh

502
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,500
what

503
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,020
This one

504
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,420
I think how about you

505
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,900
If I were you

506
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,660
I would will

507
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,660
Take back your thoughts.

508
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,660
At noon,

509
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,660
Lin Yin Yin and Xiao Mi

510
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,660
will repeat those actions.

511
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,660
After the afternoon,

512
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,660
you can rest.

513
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,660
I'll take Yang Yun's dressing room

514
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,660
to you.

515
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,660
Get in the car.

516
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,660
Okay.

517
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,660
Get in the car.

518
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,660
Get in the car.

519
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,660
Uncle Hui,

520
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,660
where is Xiao Mi?

521
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,660
She went to find Zhou Tong.

522
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,660
I want to find Zhou Tong too.

523
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,660
You can't go anywhere.

524
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,660
I'll give you a good surprise.

525
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,660
Uncle Hui,

526
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,660
do you have a charger?

527
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,660
I don't have one.

528
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,660
What's up?

529
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,660
I want to see you.

530
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,660
I want to invite Zhou Tong.

531
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,660
Please.

532
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
Why are you so handsome?

533
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
He's the one who's handsome.

534
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,660
I'm the weak one.

535
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
What did you want to say?

536
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,660
You should know that.

537
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
You should respect me

538
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,660
in my place.

539
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,660
You're not going to be able to

540
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,660
go to the party tonight.

541
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,660
I'm not going to be able to

542
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,660
go to the party tonight.

543
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,660
You're going to live here?

544
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,660
I'm going to live in the back.

545
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
Sister,

546
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
I'm really in a hurry.

547
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,660
I'm apologizing to Zhou Tong.

548
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,660
I admit that I made a mistake.

549
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
Why?

550
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,660
For my best friend, Xiao Yao.

551
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,660
I made a mistake and they got engaged.

552
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,660
Sister, I'm really in a hurry.

553
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,660
Brother Tong,

554
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,660
Xiao Mi is looking for you.

555
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,660
Who?

556
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,660
It's the one who's picking up the ballet.

557
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
I heard you were looking for me.

558
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,660
What's up?

559
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,660
I have limited time.

560
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,660
I'm just doing my job.

561
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,660
What a coincidence.

562
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,660
I have limited time,

563
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,660
but I don't have time to fight with you.

564
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,660
Then why did you come down?

565
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,660
Then why did you come to our place?

566
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,660
Let me hear it.

567
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
Why do you have limited time?

568
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
It's good.

569
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,660
I have to squat.

570
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,660
After I squat,

571
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,660
I can do the ballet.

572
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,660
I'm not going to do the ballet.

573
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,660
Do you have any business tomorrow?

574
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,660
Not dating, but playing everywhere.

575
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,660
No business, just playing.

576
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,660
You're an adult.

577
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
You don't do anything serious.

578
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
I really don't know where Xiao Yao likes you.

579
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
I have no need for her to like me.

580
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660
You talk nicely.

581
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,660
I have a low attitude.

582
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,660
Wait a minute.

583
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,660
What did you say just now?

584
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,660
I said

585
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
I have a low attitude.

586
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
Go.

587
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,660
You are not allowed to go to Malaysia today.

588
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,660
Come to see the performance in the afternoon.

589
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,660
I don't have time.

590
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,660
I can't go.

591
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,660
I have to go.

592
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,660
Don't make me mad.

593
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
I don't want to see you.

594
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
Don't come early.

595
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,660
I'm going to go.

596
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
What else?

597
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,660
Apologize to me.

598
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,660
I'm going to apologize to you.

599
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,660
So you have to apologize to me first.

600
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
Little sister.

601
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,660
You said you got up boldly.

602
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,660
You've been through everything.

603
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,660
Are you full of food?

604
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,660
I don't even know you.

605
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,660
It's me, right?

606
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
You should tell her last time.

607
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
Why?

608
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,660
To make up for the mistake with Xiao Yao and Brother Tong.

609
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,660
That's not good.

610
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,660
My attitude hasn't completely changed.

611
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,660
Her attitude is still so evil.

612
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
Why did you do that?

613
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,660
I'm sorry.

614
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,660
Hey.

615
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,660
I'm leaving. I have to rehearse.

616
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,660
It's okay. I'll be busy.

617
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Brother Peng, do you have tickets?

618
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,660
No.

619
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:56,320
In the rest room, there's cork dust and a

620
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,160
to recall it carefully, okay?

621
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
Right now,

622
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,600
I have more psychological trauma.

623
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
Control?

624
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,980
Yao Yao, what are you doing?

625
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,820
Do it again.

626
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Come.

627
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,660
Yao Yao, you're dancing very well.

628
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,860
There's joy, anger, love, sorrow, joy, and happiness.

629
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,860
There's everything.

630
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
You're really working?

631
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
Come, let me wipe it.

632
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,060
No need, no need.

633
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,560
I said I'd do it.

634
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,860
Don't worry, before I go,

635
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,060
I'll definitely make sure

636
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,460
that you don't get dirty.

637
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,400
Are you going to wipe the mirror?

638
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,460
I'll wipe it, I'll wipe it every time.

639
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,460
Okay, I'll clean it up right away.

640
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,660
The mirror is very dirty.

641
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,160
I want to wipe it.

642
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,860
I'm going to wipe it all over too.

643
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,060
Okay.

644
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,560
I'm going to wipe it.

645
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,060
I'm going to wipe it.

646
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,660
I'm going to wipe it.

647
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,860
I'm going to wipe it.

648
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,560
I'm going to wipe it.

649
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,560
I'm going to wipe it.

650
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
I'm going to wipe it.

651
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,520
I'll clean it up tonight.

652
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,640
From top to bottom.

653
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,840
I'll make it very clean for you.

654
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,720
What are you doing?

655
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,920
Why are you looking at me?

656
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,880
How awkward I am.

657
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,680
What's wrong?

658
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,280
I can't look at you anymore.

659
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,680
Okay, okay, let's eat.

660
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,480
Look.

661
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,720
Qiao Bin, what time is it?

662
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,680
I'm stuck in traffic.

663
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,680
You're stuck in traffic with the audience?

664
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,520
I haven't played it yet.

665
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,080
Yan Yan.

666
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,320
Are you tired?

667
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,600
I'm not tired.

668
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,400
Look at Xiaoyao.

669
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,600
You're not tired?

670
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,640
I'm not tired.

671
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,080
I'm not tired.

672
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,680
I'm not tired.

673
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,760
Don't stretch your body.

674
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,120
But you have to have feelings.

675
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,800
Use your feelings to bring a position.

676
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,360
Be sure to be careful.

677
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,920
Let's do the three tasks

678
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,840
of the two stages,

679
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,520
the rafting and the bridge.

680
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,640
Come on.

681
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,040
Did you go to see Zhetong?

682
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,480
What did you say?

683
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,120
Increase friendship.

684
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,320
Connect feelings.

685
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,120
Then I'll ask him to come to the show tonight.

686
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,920
I called him too.

687
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,760
Yan Yan.

688
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,120
It's none of my business.

689
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,280
He and I are on the stage.

690
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,760
Five sentences.

691
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,000
Sorry, Brother Ying.

692
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,280
Can you give me your feelings?

693
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,720
You two are goddesses.

694
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,080
Okay.

695
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,280
Go on.

696
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,600
Let's start with the bridge.

697
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,400
This store is quite good.

698
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,960
Do you want to go see him?

699
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,200
I watched the show and saw him.

700
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
I don't want to do anything after returning to Hangzhou.

701
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,680
It's weird.

702
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,280
What's so weird about it?

703
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,400
Dian Dian.

704
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,000
Are you fat?

705
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,080
Ask Xu Tian.

706
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,200
He's an expert.

707
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,080
No, I'm fine.

708
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,760
Let's go eat.

709
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,360
After returning to Hangzhou,

710
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,120
ask Xu Tian to make one for you.

711
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,960
He made one for me before.

712
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,080
It's very beautiful.

713
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,960
Why didn't you bring it?

714
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,280
Mom.

715
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,280
Xu Tian and I are not going to eat.

716
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,800
Give me the address.

717
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,640
I don't think it's necessary.

718
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,160
I think it's necessary.

719
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,680
Listen to you or listen to me?

720
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,360
Listen to Xu Tian.

721
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,040
It's actually good to see him.

722
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,560
I'm not going to eat.

723
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm going to eat.

724
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,120
I'm going to eat.

725
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,400
I'm going to eat.

726
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,600

I'm going to eat.

730
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,080
I'm going to eat.

731
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,280
I'm going to eat.

732
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,480
I'm going to eat.

733
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,680
I'm going to eat.

734
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,800
I'm going to eat.

735
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm going to eat.

736
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,280

I'm going to eat.

740
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,400
I'm going to eat.

741
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,680
I'm going to eat.

742
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,960
I'm going to eat.

743
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,240
I'm going to eat.
