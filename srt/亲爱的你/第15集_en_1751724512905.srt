1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the love letter you wrote.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I watch the butterflies dance with the wind.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I wait for the sunset to fill the grass.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am lonely and lonely.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have to go through so many hardships.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to accompany you to go back to the old days.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to think of you in my dreams.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I want to keep you in my heart.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am lonely and lonely.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I have to go through so many hardships.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want to walk through the years with you.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I want to be with you from childhood.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I want to be with you forever.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 10

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hello, President Fang. I am Xu Tian.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Where are you?

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We are going to have dinner.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Where is Dian Dian?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I am waiting for her.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Where did she go?

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't know.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Did you two have a fight?

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How could it be possible?

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't go.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can't go.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It will be bad if she can't find me when she comes back.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Send a location. I will come.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Who are you?

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What are you doing?

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I am here.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't move.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Where is my son?

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Doctor.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Son.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mom.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I saw Xia Liao's performance.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What is this?

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This...

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This is...

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is...

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This is...

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is...

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This...

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why are you here?

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How did you do this?

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This...

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It hurts.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's okay. Don't be emotional.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Save my son.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hurry up.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't be emotional.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hurry up.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Save my son.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Save my son.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What's wrong?

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Can't you move?

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I am asking you.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Who are you asking?

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I am here to see my patient.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000

Thank you.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Mom, come and pick me up.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't remember the way.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I am afraid that I will forget everything.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I am afraid that I will forget everything.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay, you are with Xu Tian, right?

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Xu Tian just gave me the location.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You have the location, but I have nothing.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay, don't worry.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Where are you?

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Xiehe Hospital.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Where is Xiehe Hospital?

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Where is Xiehe Hospital?

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
East Gate.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
East Gate.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
East Gate of Xiehe Hospital.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay, Xiehe Hospital is east gate.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Are you okay?

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Take Xu Tian and me to the luggage.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We will go home on time.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Go home.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay, we will go home.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Dian Dian, what happened?

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Xu Tian and Zhou Tong met.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Zhou Tong had a car accident.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I am afraid that Xu Tian will have an accident.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No, Dian Dian.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No matter what happens,

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you don't get excited.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You know your old man.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Come and pick me up.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hurry up.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, stand still.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't move.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay, stand still.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't move.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Be careful.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
rapidly

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Not big!

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
야 Formula 보세요

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,360
Jiaming, Jiaming.

126
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,440
You're a star.

127
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,840
A great love is so beautiful.

128
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Thank you, thank you.

129
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,840
Why isn't Zhong Qing here?

130
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
He can see us.

131
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
Dad will be here soon.

132
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,480
Jiaming.

133
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
I hope you don't get off your feet.

134
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
I have an interview in the dressing room.

135
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,000
Really?

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm famous.

137
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,240
Then we can be a couple.

138
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
I hope so.

139
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Come on, come on.

140
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
Don't rush.

141
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Our actors are easy to deal with.

142
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Easy to deal with.

143
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
I know.

144
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
I know.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Easy to deal with.

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Don't get up.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't get up.

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Thank you.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Wait, wait, wait.

150
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Don't rush.

151
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Let's take turns.

152
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Let's have a discussion.

153
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
You're a dancer.

154
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
You're a dancer, right?

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm a dancer.

156
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Yes.

157
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
And you're a model.

158
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Yes.

159
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
We'll have a discussion.

160
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I'm sure you'll have a discussion.

161
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Let's have a discussion.

162
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Let's have a discussion.

163
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Okay, let me take a look.

164
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Uncle Wei.

165
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Okay.

166
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Don't rush.

167
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Here, here.

168
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
This way.

169
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
This way.

170
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
This way.

171
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
This way.

172
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
You're so good at dancing.

173
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Can I have a look?

174
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Can I have a look?

175
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Okay.

176
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Don't get up.

177
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Don't get up.

178
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Yao.

179
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Yao.

180
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Yao.

181
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
You're still in the hospital, Comrade Zhou.

182
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Don't say it.

183
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Don't say it.

184
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Let go.

185
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,760
Well, regarding the hospital,

186
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:13,080
you're a little smaller than the ex Williams of

187
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,160
pi.

188
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,660
You can definitely take notes on everything.

189
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,660
Look at her.

190
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,660
Do it quickly.

191
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,660
Take it easy.

192
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,660
You're so good at that.

193
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,160
Do it quickly.

194
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,280
Chengabai

195
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,100
Are you also playing in theAn proszę friend Session any time!)

196
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,540
I don't think it is any good

197
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,460
Yeah

198
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,860
That's good. You'll still like it.

199
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,460
Are you okay?

200
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,860
I'm fine. I can still call you.

201
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,860
You're done acting? How was it?

202
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,460
I'll be right there.

203
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,460
Don't worry. Slowly.

204
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,460
Where are you?

205
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,060
Wait for me.

206
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,860
Don't worry.

207
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,860
Can you do it? The doctor said you have blood in your brain.

208
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,260
Bai Zi, you can't be late for this.

209
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,060
Qiao Zi, don't worry. I'm fine.

210
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
It's true.

211
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,460
Besides, if something really happened,

212
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,260
I'd have to see him. What if I can't see him again?

213
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,460
You're not done yet?

214
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,660
Hold it.

215
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,260
I'm just a little dizzy.

216
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,260
The doctor will measure me and see if I have a fever.

217
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,460
Mr. Song,

218
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,460
before,

219
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,260
you used that thermometer to put it in the hot water.

220
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Actually, I feel like I'm in a good mood.

221
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,260
I've caused you a lot of trouble in your life.

222
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
What are you talking about?

223
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,060
From now on,

224
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,460
your son won't go anywhere.

225
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,060
After you marry Xiao Xiao,

226
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,460
you have to be more relaxed.

227
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,860
You'll be more effective.

228
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,660
Are you happy?

229
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,260
Are you happy?

230
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,060
He's here now.

231
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,260
If you let him ask her right away,

232
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,460
she'll be so pretty.

233
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,460
Mom, don't help me. Don't scare him.

234
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,260
It's okay.

235
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,460
Come here.

236
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,260
The first time I saw you,

237
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,660
I was dizzy.

238
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,260
It's good to meet you.

239
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,660
The patient is here.

240
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,860
Go back.

241
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,460
The patient hasn't passed the danger zone yet.

242
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,460
I'm here.

243
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,460
Hurry up. It's just a meal.

244
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,260
I'm here.

245
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,460
Hurry up. It's just a meal.

246
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,460
Hurry up.

247
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,860
Look.

248
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,660
I'm here.

249
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,460
Niannian.

250
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,260
Niannian.

251
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,660
Niannian.

252
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,260
I'm your mother.

253
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,540
Xu Tian?

254
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,260
Xu Tian is waiting for you inside.

255
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,740
Where is he?

256
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,860
Who am I?

257
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,660
Mom.

258
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,420
I'll take you to find Xu Tian.

259
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,260
Okay.

260
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,020
Okay.

261
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,460
Did you bring the medicine?

262
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,580
He's gone.

263
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,220
Xu Tian will go crazy if he knows.

264
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,060
Gone?

265
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,180
Seeing him is like seeing Xu Tian.

266
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,140
All he has is blood.

267
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,740
He is him.

268
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,100
Xu Tian is Xu Tian. How can he be gone?

269
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,340
Didn't he go to the hospital?

270
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,660
Should we tell Xu Tian?

271
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,820
What?

272
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
What do you mean?

273
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,780
If he's gone, Wen Xiao Yao will go to find Xu Tian.

274
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,140
If not?

275
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,300
Xu Tian has a photo.

276
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,900
Their mother was together before.

277
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,460
Everything is already arranged.

278
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,620
You're crazy.

279
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,700
I know I'm annoying.

280
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,100
But I can't control it.

281
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,220
You'll lose Xu Tian like this.

282
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,660
And it'll be quick.

283
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,340
You'll lose him right away.

284
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,740
Who can stand you?

285
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,940
What should I do?

286
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,020
Zhou Tong is in the hospital.

287
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,700
It's okay.

288
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,260
It's all in vain.

289
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,660
Go back to Hangzhou.

290
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,540
Live a good life with Xu Tian.

291
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,020
Will he be okay?

292
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,380
He has a mother and Wen Xiao Yao.

293
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,820
Do you want to live a life that's just for a few days?

294
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,020
We've tried our best.

295
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,260
Please be safe.

296
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,420
It's gone.

297
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,580
Did you clean it up?

298
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,140
It's a bit over.

299
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,460
I haven't finished it yet.

300
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,460
Song Tong.

301
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,900
Bai Zhi Fang Quan.

302
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,220
What procedure should we do now that he's gone?

303
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,900
Can you be a bit more factories?

304
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,380
Only I got stage enough.

305
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,620
and the medical records.

306
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,580
The death notice must be signed by the doctor.

307
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,180
It must be changed to

308
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,220
the hospital death certificate and the certificate of merit.

309
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,780
Why do we need to change the certificate of merit?

310
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,940
The police station is a residential area.

311
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,700
We need to change the certificate of merit.

312
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,980
Dad, stop talking.

313
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,780
Xiaoyang.

314
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,460
Yang Yang.

315
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,740
What are you doing, Xiaoyang?

316
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,540
Yang Yang.

317
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,300
It's past one o'clock.

318
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,380
We still have to perform tomorrow.

319
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,340
What are you doing?

320
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,540
The official is inside.

321
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,620
Your son is gone.

322
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,180
What are you doing?

323
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,740
Duan Yan.

324
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,180
I believe Zhou Tong is in the hospital.

325
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,460
I hope you can perform.

326
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,460
He loves you.

327
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,180
He wants to see you well.

328
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,140
Son.

329
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,300
Just one?

330
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,620
Did you sign the doctor's notice?

331
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,940
Yes.

332
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,940
Don't forget to go to the medical office

333
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,700
and change the medical certificate tomorrow.

334
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,300
Sign it.

335
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,420
Do you want to kiss me?

336
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,820
Please.

337
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,220
Mrs. Song.

338
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,380
I'm not.

339
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,380
I'm not.

340
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,380
Why did he leave?

341
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
He's been in the main role.

342
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,380
Why did you let him leave?

343
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,380
Why did you let him come back to see your performance?

344
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,380
Why did you let him leave?

345
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,380
Why did you let him come back to see your performance?

346
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
It's strange.

347
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,380
This is the first time the child has been so obedient.

348
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,380
Auntie Su.

349
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,380
I made a mistake.

350
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,380
I made a mistake.

351
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,380
There's no more mistake.

352
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,380
It's all my fault.

353
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,380
What's the use of blaming you?

354
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,380
Blame you.

355
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,380
My son can come back.

356
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,380
I don't want to see him again.

357
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,380
Auntie.

358
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,380
Auntie.

359
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,380
Auntie, don't go.

360
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,380
It's all my fault.

361
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
It's all my fault.

362
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,380
It's all my fault.

363
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,380
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,380
I'm sorry, son.

365
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,380
Uncle.

366
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,380
Old Qiao.

367
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
Uncle.

368
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Hurry up.

369
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,380
I'm going to see him.

370
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,380
I know you're fast.

371
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,380
Don't be too fast.

372
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,380
What's the matter?

373
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,380
It's not a big deal for you to stay here.

374
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,380
I'm back.

375
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,380
Zhou Feng, you're a fool.

376
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,380
I'm practicing with you.

377
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,380
I've told you several times.

378
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,380
You still take it seriously.

379
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,380
I'm on the white-sand needle.

380
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,380
Thank you, Fei He.

381
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,380
See you.

382
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,380
Blame me.

383
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,380
Or you wouldn't have known Song Guang Guang's son.

384
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,380
Auntie.

385
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,380
Auntie.

386
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,380
I'm sorry, Auntie.

387
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,380
It's all my fault.

388
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,380
I'm sorry, Xiao Yan.

389
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,380
I'm sorry, Uncle.

390
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,380
I'm sorry.

391
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,380
It's all my fault.

392
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,380
Go away.

393
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,380
Xiao Yan.

394
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
Take care of Yao Yao.

395
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,380
I'll see her off.

396
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,380
I'm sorry.

397
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,380
I'm sorry, Xiao Yan.

398
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,380
I'm a fool.

399
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,380
I'm a big bad guy.

400
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,380
I'm a super bad bad guy.

401
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,380
Don't forgive me.

402
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,380
Director.

403
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,380
There are two more performances.

404
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,380
Do you think I can dance?

405
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,380
You don't dance.

406
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,380
Who will dance?

407
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,380
Yao Yao.

408
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,380
People are sometimes cruel in this life.

409
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,380
Life is very difficult.

410
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,380
You have to go through it one by one.

411
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,380
When the sun doesn't come back,

412
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,380
the sun will come out.

413
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,380
You can delete the video.

414
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,380
I don't want to dance anymore.

415
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,380
What do you mean?

416
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,380
Do you think Yao Yao will catch me easier?

417
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,380
Stop pushing me.

418
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,380
Stop now.

419
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,380
Stop.

420
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,380
Xiao Yan.

421
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,380
Xiao Yan.

422
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,380
Stop.

423
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,380
Stop.

424
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
Stop.

425
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,380
Stop.

426
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,380
Why so?

427
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
It's okay, little alone.

428
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,580
I'll give you

429
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,220
Go away

430
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,100
Don't come in, go away

431
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,420
How far is it to walk alone at night?

432
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,540
What if

433
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,740
What if

434
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,100
What if it's all over

435
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,980
What else is there

436
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,340
Go away

437
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,540
Why are you yelling at me

438
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,980
Do you have to live well in the future

439
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,500
See yourself

440
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,420
What are you doing

441
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,140
Go away

442
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,940
Go away

443
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,780
Go away

444
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,500
Go away

445
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,260
Go away

446
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,020
Go away

447
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,660
Go away

448
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,340
Go away

449
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,940
Go away

450
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,540
Go away

451
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,100
Go away

452
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:24,260
That is an Athletic

453
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,540
Look on the gate

454
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,500
See what you see

455
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,180
Just a pose

456
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,020
All of your parents

457
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,780
Knowing fans

458
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,860
Knowing your brothers

459
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,500
The more you care about your health, the more you care about your health.

460
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Do you understand?

461
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
A living person must be a living person.

462
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,100
Don't play with me.

463
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,900
I'll get you a bag.

464
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,100
You want to come alone and pretend I'm empty.

465
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
There's someone over there. Be safe.

466
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,100
If you're in pain or anxious, you can kick me.

467
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Get in the car.

468
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Get in the car!

469
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
Don't touch my phone, okay?

470
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,100
I'm talking to you. Let me rest for a while.

471
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,100
I'm sorry.

472
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
I'm sorry.

473
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,100
Xiao Yao, come up and sleep.

474
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,100
I'm not sleepy.

475
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
You need to rest.

476
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,100
You have a performance tomorrow.

477
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
Xiao Mi.

478
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,100
Is my white suit really good?

479
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,100
It's very good.

480
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Then you're worthy of your mother.

481
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,100
You can come up and sleep.

482
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,100
You can lie down.

483
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
You can lie down.

484
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,100
Otherwise, you won't have the strength to dance tomorrow.

485
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,100
Even if I don't sleep all night,

486
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,100
I'll dance two rounds with all my strength.

487
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
What do you mean?

488
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,100
I won't dance anymore.

489
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
Why?

490
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,100
I dance the white suit because of Zhou Tong.

491
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,100
He's not here now.

492
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,100
I can't stay in Beijing anymore.

493
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,100
On the street, in the subway,

494
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,100
in the Great Wall, in the Palace of the Ancient.

495
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,100
I miss him wherever I go.

496
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,100
What do you mean?

497
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Your home.

498
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,100
Your home is right here.

499
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,100
I want to go back to Hangzhou.

500
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,100
When?

501
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,100
After these two performances.

502
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,100
Luo Xiaoyang

503
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,100
->

504
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,100
Xiao Jing, I'm on the subway.

505
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,100
Come back immediately.

506
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,860
You didn't get to leave fromụ

507
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,640
Xiangyang, I'm boarding

508
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,760
I'm ready

509
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,380
Xiangyang, I'm boarding

510
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,880
Afraid of liars

511
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,940
You come and sit for a while

512
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,180
I'll come over

513
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,100
You get on first

514
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,220
Why

515
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,440
I don't like to eat

516
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,040
It's

517
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,040
I'm sorry.

518
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,040
I'm sorry.

519
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,040
I'm sorry.

520
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,040
I'm sorry.

521
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
I'm sorry.

522
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
I'm sorry.

523
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,040
I'm sorry.

524
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
I'm sorry.

525
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,040
I'm sorry.

526
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
I'm sorry.

527
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,040
I'm sorry.

528
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
I'm sorry.

529
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,040
I'm sorry.

530
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
I'm sorry.

531
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,040
I'm sorry.

532
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,040
I'm sorry.

533
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,040
I'm sorry.

534
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,040
I'm sorry.

535
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
I'm sorry.

536
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,040
I'm sorry.

537
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
I'm sorry.

538
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,040
I'm sorry.

539
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
I'm sorry.

540
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,040
I'm sorry.

541
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
I'm sorry.

542
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,040
I'm sorry.

543
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,040
I'm sorry.

544
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,040
I'm sorry.

545
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,040
I'm sorry.

546
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

549
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,040
I'm sorry.

550
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,040
I'm sorry.

551
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,040
I'm sorry.

552
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
I'm sorry.

553
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,040
I'm sorry.

554
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,040
I'm sorry.

555
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
I'm sorry.

556
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,040
I'm sorry.

557
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,040
I'm sorry.

558
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,040
I'm sorry.

559
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,040
I'm sorry.

560
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,040
I'm sorry.

561
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,040
I'm sorry.

562
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,040
I'm sorry.

563
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,040
I'm sorry.

564
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,040
