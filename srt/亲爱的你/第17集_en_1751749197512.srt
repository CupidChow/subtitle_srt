1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
Coming Up...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the canteen

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When the sun is full of grass

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Loneliness is like a lonely man

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Accompanying you is like returning to the old days

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like a fantasy, we are like a beautiful couple

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind and rain are the same, we have been through ups and downs

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The path of time, from small to big

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
May you and me be together

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 2

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's about three minutes away.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't be angry.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're wrong.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Go, watch the road.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You don't drink so much.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Are you okay?

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm fine.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm fine.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The plane is at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You don't have to come and sleep.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I have to send it.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Mr. Fang is still waiting for you in the hotel.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Come back soon.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The door is here.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll go to the hotel.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No key.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Password lock.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why?

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The days we met again.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Through this way.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What a joke.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Only this old thing is left.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Sister Ding Ding, get in the car.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Is she angry?

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why is she angry on such a happy day?

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Sister Ding Ding, get in the car.

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Sister Ding Ding, get in the car.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sister Ding Ding, get in the car.

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Sister Ding Ding, get in the car.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Sister Ding Ding, get in the car.

65
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Sister Ding Ding, get in the car.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Sister Ding Ding, get in the car.

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Sister Ding Ding, get in the car.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Sister Ding Ding, get in the car.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Sister Ding Ding.

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Get in the car.

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Get in the car.

72
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You go first.

73
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Where's the photo?

74
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What photo?

75
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That photo.

76
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Where did you put it?

77
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Ding Ding.

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Everything in the house is new.

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't want the old one.

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Where's the photo?

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's with me.

82
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll find you a new one.

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't move around at home.

84
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Give me the car.

85
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Do you have a driver's license?

86
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
On me.

87
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Do you want me to tell you something?

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Give me the car.

89
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What's so surprising?

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Just one photo.

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's not thrown away.

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Put it in the drawer.

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can take it out when you want.

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm nervous when you're angry.

95
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Not nervous, but afraid.

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What are you afraid of?

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Afraid you don't want me anymore.

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I was wrong.

99
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How am I wrong?

100
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If you like it,

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
just put that photo in the cabinet.

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is so beautiful.

103
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So beautiful.

104
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Thank you, Ming.

105
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you like it?

106
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I do.

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But you don't like it, right?

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't like it.

109
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I didn't tell you that it was my fault for Zhou Tong.

110
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But you understand what I mean.

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
When I saw that photo,

112
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I remembered Wen Xiaoyao.

113
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I remembered Zhou Tong.

114
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,400
That night, his blood

115
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,200
was all over my hands.

116
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,260
it hurts!

117
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,260
I'm tired.

118
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,260
I told you to stay at home and don't move.

119
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,460
I'm not tired yet.

120
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,620
It must be the cold wind.

121
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,340
Get in the car.

122
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,700
I didn't drive the car.

123
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,780
I drove the car.

124
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,420
Is it useful for you to do this?

125
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,540
Get out first.

126
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,900
Please find

127
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
Fengqi Road, 2-star building, north entrance.

128
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,100
3072-A60, 10 minutes before the surveillance.

129
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,900
My car didn't arrive.

130
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,220
He's already there.

131
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,140
The time is clear.

132
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,380
If you have a code,

133
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,780
you can see it quickly.

134
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
Comrade,

135
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,300
I did drink.

136
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,700
But I didn't drive the car.

137
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,540
You two stay here.

138
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,540
Don't move.

139
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,180
Don't go down.

140
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,980
I can't find it if I drive too far.

141
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,700
You would check the security camera anyway.

142
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,700
Still angry?

143
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,380
That photo can't move.

144
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,780
The second safeanners

145
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,180
in the bedroom motif cabinet

146
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,140
under the light bulb drawer.

147
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,940
From the start of the first generation,

148
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,300
I feel very strange.

149
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,180
Why?

150
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,420
Since the first time we drank,

151
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,940
I didn't know what I was thinking.

152
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,620
I drank every cup.

153
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,180
I didn't know how many cups I drank.

154
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,740
You know I never drink.

155
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,540
But today,

156
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,780
I can't help it.

157
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm leaving tomorrow.

158
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,940
You should go to Beijing.

159
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,780
Is it necessary?

160
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,060
I'm not saying I miss him.

161
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,340
What did you say when you saw him?

162
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,540
I took a picture

163
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,780
and told him that was his mother.

164
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,780
You two had a relationship 20 years ago.

165
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,500
He was in Miss Jusulan's belly at that time.

166
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,060
You four were in that picture.

167
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,420
Actually, I think

168
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,780
it's better to draw a blood.

169
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,820
Why?

170
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,060
If I draw blood,

171
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,020
I'll be clear-headed.

172
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,580
You're not clear-headed now.

173
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,540
I'm confused by you.

174
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,540
I said I was thinking of Zhou Tong.

175
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,260
You told me it was Wen Xiaoyou.

176
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,660
You're so mischievous.

177
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,100
You're the mischievous one.

178
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,100
I was wrong.

179
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,260
Do you like the ring on your hand?

180
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,300
Yes.

181
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,420
Wait.

182
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,060
Do you like it or not?

183
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,860
Yes.

184
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,940
I'll push this off tomorrow.

185
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,140
See if the one with you

186
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,460
is sold.

187
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,700
No.

188
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,900
It's cheap.

189
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,940
Sit here.

190
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,020
Then we'll continue to act.

191
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,620
You go first.

192
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,580
It's not right.

193
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,580
I was so mean to you just now.

194
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,540
It's all because of the wine.

195
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,060
I won't drink it anymore.

196
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,780
It's mainly because of me.

197
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,020
I'm careful.

198
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,060
I'm thirsty to death.

199
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,340
You two treat this place as your home?

200
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,780
Come down.

201
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,980
Come down.

202
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,260
Come.

203
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,220
Come on.

204
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,260
Blow it.

205
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,460
Me?

206
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,420
You're the driver.

207
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,540
You're the one who blew it.

208
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,860
Come on.

209
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,420
Blow it.

210
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,860
Move your hand.

211
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,380
Don't move.

212
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,260
Is this you?

213
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,020
This is me.

214
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,420
This is you.

215
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,780
Which one is not you?

216
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,140
Wait for me.

217
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,900
Is there a water?

218
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,340
On your right.

219
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,380
dominated.

220
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,500
What?

221
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,340
My hand is so cold.

222
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,860
Raise it on your right.

223
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,140
Your hand is so cold.

224
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,900
Put your hand on your right hand.

225
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,940
Do you feel better now?

226
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,020
I can do it forever.

227
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,020
But I have to leave tomorrow.

228
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
Otherwise, I will keep driving.

229
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,020
This song is pretty good.

230
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,020
I will drive you back to the hotel first.

231
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,020
I will take a taxi home.

232
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
I will take you to the airport tomorrow morning.

233
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,020
Then I will go to the lighthouse.

234
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,020
I will take you to the lighthouse tomorrow morning.

235
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,020
Sunset.

236
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
Raining days.

237
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,020
Don't make any difference.

238
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,020
Xiao Mi.

239
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,020
Tomorrow, go to the group and take a picture of the phone number of the 10 o'clock registration.

240
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,820
Why are you looking for him? Who is he?

241
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,620
I don't know who he is.

242
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,820
Ask him why he sent Zhou Tong to the hospital.

243
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,620
Why he went to the group to look for me.

244
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,020
It didn't take long for him to get out of the group.

245
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,420
OK, OK, OK.

246
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,720
Give us everyone one.

247
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,820
One solo picture.

248
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,220
The group took a picture.

249
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,820
One solo picture.

250
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,220
A solo picture.

251
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,780
Thank you.

252
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,340
Thank you.

253
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,820
You're welcome.

254
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,340
Come on, let's stand up.

255
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,020
Mr. Zhao will be here soon.

256
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,220
What's going on?

257
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,100
Mr. Zhao called me last night

258
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,220
to inform me.

259
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,220
Sister,

260
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,580
it's not that lively for two months.

261
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,220
This is Zhou Tong's towel.

262
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,220
It's a toothpaste.

263
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,220
Do you want to throw it away?

264
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,220
It's uncomfortable to throw it away.

265
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
It's even more uncomfortable

266
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,220
if we don't look at it.

267
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
I...

268
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,220
I'm also uncomfortable.

269
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,220
I'm not going to throw it away.

270
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,220
I'm also uncomfortable.

271
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,220
Mr. Zhou is here.

272
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,220
Hello.

273
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,220
Mr. Zhou is here.

274
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,220
I'm going upstairs.

275
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,220
Can I say no to this kind of value?

276
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,220
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

277
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,220
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

278
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,220
Come on, take your time.

279
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,220
Okay, Mr. Zhou.

280
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,220
Come on, let's stand up.

281
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,220
Let's stand up.

282
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,220
Let's stand up.

283
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
Let's stand up.

284
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,220
Let's stand up.

285
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,220
Don't rush.

286
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,220
Let's stand up one by one.

287
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
The rest of the students, step back.

288
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
Let's stand up.

289
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,220
Come on, let's stand up.

290
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,220
Your main role is Mr. Song.

291
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,220
Call him here.

292
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,220
Okay.

293
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,220
Mr. Song, Mr. Zhao is calling you.

294
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,220
I don't have time.

295
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,220
Mr. Zhao said it was mainly you.

296
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,220
Come on, Mr. Song.

297
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Come on, Mr. Song.

298
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,220
Come on, come on.

299
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
Mr. Song is here.

300
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
Come on, come on.

301
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,220
Mr. Song and I sit together.

302
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,220
Come on, Xiao Tian, you take a picture.

303
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
Come on, Mr. Song.

304
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,220
Come on, kids, stand up.

305
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,220
Hello, Mr. Song.

306
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,220
Okay, come on.

307
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,220
Look ahead.

308
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,220
Yes.

309
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,220
Will Xiao Guanghui force you?

310
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,220
Yes.

311
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,220
Okay.

312
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,220
You contacted the little girl yourself.

313
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,220
They took the initiative to call me.

314
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,220
I still have a place in the Paris area.

315
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,220
Okay, you shoot.

316
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,220
I won't interrupt.

317
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,220
What do you mean I shoot?

318
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,220
Do you think I'm willing?

319
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
Qiao Guanghui said

320
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,220
you must be happy to come today.

321
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
How much?

322
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,220
You can pay me.

323
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,220
Yes.

324
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,220
I can't find my dignity in the Paris area.

325
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,220
I came here to find my dignity.

326
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,220
Why are you so sarcastic?

327
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,220
I don't know either.

328
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,220
Come on, everyone, look here.

329
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,220
Are you happy?

330
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,220
Happy.

331
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,220
If you're happy, call me one more time.

332
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,220
Are you happy?

333
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,220
I'm not happy.

334
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,220
Qiao Guanghui is not happy.

335
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,220
I came for nothing.

336
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,220
One, two, three.

337
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,220
Qiangzi.

338
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,220
Qiangzi.

339
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,220
It's your turn.

340
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,220
I'll go to Hangzhou tomorrow.

341
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,220
Under the double-bar.

342
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,220
The bureau agreed to play the white-car tour.

343
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,220
I'll come.

344
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
Come on, take your time.

345
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,220
Take your time.

346
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,220
I'll be with you.

347
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
Okay.

348
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,220
Take your time.

349
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,220
Okay.

350
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,220
You can hire more students.

351
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,220
And you can also

352
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,220
raise the price.

353
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,220
Can you talk to me?

354
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,220
It depends on your brain.

355
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,220
Okay.

356
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,220
I promised them

357
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,220
to give a class every week.

358
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,220
This plastic bag

359
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,220
is Zhou Tong's toothpaste.

360
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,220
Do you throw it away?

361
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,220
Did you throw away

362
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,220
the other things?

363
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220
I'm an artist.

364
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,220
I'm a researcher.

365
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,220
Do you want me

366
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
to comfort you?

367
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,220
Do you want some tea?

368
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,220
No.

369
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Just a few words.

370
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,220
No need to drink.

371
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,220
Say it.

372
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,220
Life is full of ups and downs.

373
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,220
The sun rises and the sun sets.

374
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220
But the sun

375
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
also makes up for the ups and downs.

376
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,220
The one who wins the game

377
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,220
will be able to win the game.

378
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
But one thing

379
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,220
is the most important.

380
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,220
What?

381
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,220
Faith.

382
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
Family, friendship, love,

383
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,220
career, and survival

384
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,220
are all based on faith.

385
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,220
As long as you have faith,

386
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,220
you won't be sad

387
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,220
if you have toothpaste and toothbrush.

388
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,220
Are you done?

389
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,220
The truth is simple.

390
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,220
It depends on when you have faith.

391
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,220
Have you?

392
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,220
When did you have faith?

393
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,220
I wanted to live and die

394
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,220
like I did back then.

395
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,220
Chang Ying.

396
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Did Qiao Wenhui tell you?

397
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,220
Who?

398
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,220
My love.

399
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,220
For her, I can

400
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
not eat,

401
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,220
not sleep,

402
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,220
and not dance.

403
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,220
Even if I'm wandering around,

404
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,220
of course,

405
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,220
I won't wander around.

406
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,220
But when Chang Ying left,

407
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
I shot her.

408
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,220
You shot her after you dumped her?

409
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,220
Yes.

410
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,220
You're an artist.

411
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,220
You don't have a reliable one.

412
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,220
I'll go to Hangzhou tomorrow

413
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,220
to find Youying.

414
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,220
When she comes back,

415
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,220
I'll let her see you.

416
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,220
It's best to find Zhou Cong.

417
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,220
Director won't come?

418
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
No.

419
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,220
I'm not used to it.

420
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,220
I've been scolded since I was a kid.

421
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,220
I'm not used to it either.

422
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,220
But he won't come.

423
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,220
Sister Yun.

424
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,220
Brother Ying.

425
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
This is the music of Jinse.

426
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,220
Emotions are the core

427
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,220
of sister Bai and sister Xiaoqing.

428
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,220
The love that has been inseparable for a thousand years

429
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,220
meets Xu Xian in the lower world.

430
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
Exploring the love of the world,

431
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,220
division,

432
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,220
and doubts.

433
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,220
The love of mortals

434
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,220
tests the love of the immortal world.

435
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
Understand the love of the mortal world.

436
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,220
Fight for it.

437
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,220
Understand.

438
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,220
Reunite.

439
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,220
Accept the reincarnation of the mortal world.

440
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,220
Xu Xian is just a mortal.

441
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,220
Life is short.

442
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,220
It's like passing by.

443
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,220
After the separation of Bai and Xiaoqing

444
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,220
for a short time,

445
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,220
they wait for the next thousand years

446
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,220
to be inseparable.

447
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,220
We've had Xu Xian.

448
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,220
Can they still be reunited?

449
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,220
Let's try it.

450
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,220
Okay.

451
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
You said you could be reunited.

452
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
I can dance.

453
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
Can...

454
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,220
This is the movement of the jade.

455
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,220
I'm a passerby.

456
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm a passerby.

457
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,220
Let's play earwax first.

458
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
I didn't make a wish.

459
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,220
Help me record videos with my phone.

460
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,220
I'll send it to Xiao Yao.

461
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,220
Thanks, Brother Ying.

462
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,220
Why do I need to change my soul power?

463
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,220
Can you stop talking?

464
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
I don't have to dance

465
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,220
as you made it.

466
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
Okay.

467
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
It's just a jade now.

468
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,220
Just like the memory of you and Xiao Yao last time.

469
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,220
It has the meaning of what I just said.

470
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
Love in the mortal world.

471
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
Separation.

472
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Suspicion.

473
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Gratitude.

474
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Struggle.

475
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
Reunification.

476
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,220
Missing.

477
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
I know.

478
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
The According.

479
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,220
Love.

480
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
The Incident.

481
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,220
The Pass.

482
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,220
The Capitulation.

483
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,220
The Dream.

484
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
The Accident.

485
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,220
Arrogant.

486
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
счасть...

487
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,220
pap...

488
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,220
Buy me god.

489
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,220
Okay.

490
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,700
You can get the wedding leave

491
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,660
and you can get the certificate.

492
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,060
By the way, when will we register when you come back?

493
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,300
Today is the 11th.

494
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,100
Come back on the 3rd and the 14th.

495
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,180
Register on the 15th.

496
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,620
Okay.

497
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,740
No.

498
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,940
Come back on the 4th and the 3rd.

499
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,580
No ceremony.

500
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,700
Then on the 5th.

501
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Then on the 6th.

502
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
On the 6th, okay?

503
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,700
What day is the 6th?

504
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,220
The 5th on the 17th.

505
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,620
What do you think?

506
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,460
I'll listen to you.

507
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Then on the 6th, the 17th.

508
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,820
Okay.

509
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,500
You don't have any idea about such an important thing?

510
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,300
We are not always like this.

511
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,300
We listen to you in all things.

512
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,700
I've set myself a rule.

513
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,700
So we can be safe.

514
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,900
I saw a game online this morning.

515
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,700
We talked.

516
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,700
You started with luck, and I started with bad luck.

517
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,700
For example, I was lucky today.

518
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,700
I won the lottery.

519
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,700
Unfortunately, the lottery was gone.

520
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:00,180
I found the lottery in your pocket.

521
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Unfortunately, the lottery was broken.

522
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:10,180
I was lucky to get a ticket to Beijing.

523
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,180
Unfortunately, the plane went wrong.

524
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,180
You landed on the deserted island.

525
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,180
I was lucky to get a ticket to Beijing.

526
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,180
You accompanied me on the plane.

527
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Unfortunately, I didn't catch the plane.

528
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,180
You were the only one on the plane.

529
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,180
I was lucky to have someone on the deserted island.

530
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
There's another person.

531
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,180
Unfortunately, that person is a man.

532
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,180
And he's from the Human Clan.

533
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,180
You can't continue.

534
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,180
Say it. It's fun.

535
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:01,180
The lucky thing is, the Human Clan is persistent.

536
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Unfortunately, he can't hold on.

537
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,180
He's going to have a wedding.

538
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:11,180
The lucky thing is, Beijing came to me on the plane.

539
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,180
Who?

540
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,180
The one in the center.

541
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,180
It's always Beijing.

542
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,180
The one in the center.

543
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,180
The unlucky thing should be me first.

544
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,180
Let's go.

545
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,180
Let's go.

546
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,180
I'll do it myself.

547
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,180
Xu Tian, you don't have to go in.

548
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,180
Just go back in the car.

549
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,180
Dian Dian.

550
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,780
What is it?

551
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,780
Mom, Xiao Yue is here.

552
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,780
Let's say it again.

553
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,780
This time, you said you were lucky.

554
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,380
I was lucky to meet you.

555
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,380
I'm the same.

556
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,380
You have to say something unfortunate.

557
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,380
Nothing unfortunate.

558
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,380
Okay.

559
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,380
You're so stubborn. You're not not coming back.

560
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,380
Call me when you arrive at the tower.

561
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,780
When I arrive at the tower, your plane will take off.

562
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,380
I'll call you when it takes off.

563
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,380
Don't forget to pay for the boarding ticket.

564
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
Okay.

565
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,380
There's an umbrella in the car. Remember to take it.

566
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,380
Okay.

567
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,380
Let's go, Xitian.

568
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,380
I'm sorry.

569
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,380
I'm sorry.

570
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
I'm sorry.

571
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,380
I'm sorry.

572
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,380
I'm sorry.

573
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,380
I'm sorry.

574
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,380
I'm sorry.

575
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,380
I'm sorry.

576
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,380
I'm sorry.

577
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,380
I'm sorry.

578
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,380
I'm sorry.

579
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,380
I'm sorry.

580
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,380
I'm sorry.

581
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,380
I'm sorry.

582
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,380
I'm sorry.

583
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,380
I'm sorry.

584
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,380
I'm sorry.

585
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,380
I'm sorry.

586
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,380
It's open.

587
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,380
It's open.

588
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,380
It's open.

589
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,380
It's open.

590
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,380
It's open.

591
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,380
The umbrella.

592
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,380
Thank you.

593
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
Thank you.

594
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,380
Are you there?

595
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,380
I just got off the car.

596
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,380
I'm going to take off soon.

597
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,380
I'll call you when I land.

598
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,380
It's okay.

599
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,380
You don't have to call me.

600
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,380
Then I won't call you.

601
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,380
I won't call you for three days.

602
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,380
Then I'll call you.

603
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,380
I'll turn off the phone.

604
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,260
Mom.

605
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,260
Brother Lan.

606
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,060
Sister Dian.

607
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,380
Why do you always make gold?

608
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,460
Mom has money to make a business.

609
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,980
I can't afford to earn money.

610
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,100
Sister Fang's money is your money.

611
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,260
That's different.

612
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,780
I have to save money.

613
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,020
I just told her I was closed.

614
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,900
How do you know I'm not closed?

615
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,180
Is it 10 o'clock?

616
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,020
Who are you?

617
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
Wen Xiaoyao.

618
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,580
I also once thought

619
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:15,060
that we'd think much more needed than before.

620
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:22,100
Theroad of your eyes

621
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:28,340
grey like the sunset in my head

622
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:36,420
Her and I have changed

623
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,420
Lost direction

624
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,420
Love is coming, but it's going on for a long time

625
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,420
It turns out that there is no need to write down the wind

626
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,420
Remember you have the look I love

627
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,420
Run forward together

628
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:13,420
The journey is a pain, the return is a laugh

629
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:22,420
Not afraid of the years, no fear

630
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:32,420
The real us

631
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:38,420
It's the same time

632
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,420
Accept everything you say

633
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:51,420
No matter how you write

634
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,420
We can reach the far distance

635
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,420
Don't have to be forced

636
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:11,420
Two hearts are like the eyes of a wild flower

637
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:17,420
The light is bright, love is free

638
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,420
No fear
