1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the love letter you wrote.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I watch the butterflies dance with the wind.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I wait for the sunset to fill the grass.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am lonely and lonely.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have to go through so many hardships.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to accompany you to go back to the old days.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to think of you in my dreams.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I want to keep you in my heart.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am lonely and lonely.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I have to go through so many hardships.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want to walk through the years with you.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I want to be with you from childhood.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I want to be with you forever.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 16

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Slow down.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The performance will be over in a few days.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If you get hurt, you'll be in a mess.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not in.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Otherwise, I'll go in.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
How can Tang Lin have a war?

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I didn't see it coming.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't tell Hu Weishu and the director.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Not a word.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I said I couldn't go home.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Then what are you doing here?

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Waiting for you.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I can taste the taste of love.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Something is wrong.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Nothing is wrong.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Where did you kiss?

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How is that possible?

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You kissed someone.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You kissed someone?

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, no.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Half a house.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What?

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hurry up.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This will be my property from now on.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I won't see Zhou Ting anymore.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you sad?

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A little.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Then,

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
why are you laughing?

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Actually,

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I was a little sad at first.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But now I'm fine.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't be fine.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I won't see him anyway.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What about him looking for you?

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I won't see him.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you sure?

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sure.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is that you?

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Mo Yao.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Mo Yao.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What's going on?

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm drunk.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm drunk.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're sober now?

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Not me.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I've been sober since those people were drunk.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Is Xiao Yao

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
having a fight with you?

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have to look at his birth date.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I've seen you twice.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I only have two big bags on my head.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It doesn't stink.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's quite harmonious.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well,

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll tell you what.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going to Malaysia.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I won't go there first.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And then?

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
date with Wei Xiao Yao.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She'll be performing in seven days.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm afraid I'll have to

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
spend more time on this experience.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Do you really think she'll date you?

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Anyway,

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have to cooperate first.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Wei...

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Are you happy for me?

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
On the one hand,

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm happy for Jin Xiao.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
On the other hand...

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't say anything.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What?

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
She's a nice girl.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't be too shy.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Right?

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're into her this time, right?

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No, no, no.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's not like that.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have principles.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Are you kidding me?

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm asking you.

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm working.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't come in without knocking.

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Lock the door.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Whose house is this?

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
waht's attraction of her?

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,440
I have to buy즈

107
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,840
Theseptiddas?

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Suchź

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,720
Five days off.

110
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,400
Go to the property management bureau to transfer the goods.

111
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,720
Who will I transfer it to?

112
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,280
Me.

113
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,160
Otherwise,

114
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,360
dad will give the house to someone else in a few days.

115
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,600
As long as Uncle Hu Yicheng is happy.

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,480
I have to take care of him.

117
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,680
Where is Yang Yun?

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,920
Didn't he come today?

119
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,680
I don't know.

120
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,280
OK.

121
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,040
Sorry.

122
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,680
Let's start.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,880
You want to grow from the bottom of your heart to the body,

124
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,880
to the space,

125
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
to the other person.

126
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Stop!

127
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,760
This is a love drama. Don't you have a number in your heart?

128
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Again!

129
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Music, wait for me.

130
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Is the stage yours or the character's?

131
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
The stage is not only yours,

132
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
but also the character's.

133
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
The better the skill, the farther you go.

134
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
You think you're the most brilliant.

135
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Aunt Gang, I dance.

136
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Express my heart.

137
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
You want to be Bai Suzhen.

138
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Can you make Bai Suzhen become you?

139
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Can you discuss it?

140
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
What's there to discuss?

141
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
And you're also called Aunt Gang.

142
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Everyone calls me that.

143
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
I don't mean to disrespect you.

144
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Can't we discuss the creation?

145
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Do you have to decide it alone?

146
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Do you think it's easy to decide it alone?

147
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
You don't like it, you can stop.

148
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
This is old.

149
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Everyone knows about Bai Suzhen and Xu Xian.

150
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Can't we be a little innovative?

151
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Director.

152
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
That's right.

153
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
You decide the group or I decide it?

154
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
I want to make a suggestion.

155
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
I disagree.

156
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Then just teach it.

157
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
I dance.

158
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
You said happiness should grow from the heart to the body.

159
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
I can change a Bai Suzhen.

160
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Change the chief.

161
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Who is willing?

162
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Everyone is willing.

163
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Who is willing?

164
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Are you two willing?

165
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
I think it's good.

166
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Where is good?

167
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Bai Suzhen, you dance well.

168
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Or the director is so good.

169
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
To be honest.

170
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
What do you think?

171
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
I.

172
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
I think.

173
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Wen Xiaoyao is willing.

174
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
I follow what you mean to the director.

175
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Xiaoyao especially asked for the director.

176
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
The director made Bai Suzhen dance in private.

177
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Less than anyone.

178
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Less than anyone.

179
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
Director.

180
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
That's it.

181
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
The chief always needs to be changed.

182
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
The audience is watching the drama.

183
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
It's not the chief.

184
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Yang Yu.

185
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Did I say anything?

186
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Did I say anything?

187
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
Qiao Min.

188
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
What are you doing?

189
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
I'm going to call you.

190
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
I'll call Yun back.

191
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
No.

192
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Yun.

193
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Why are you talking about me?

194
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Your mother is Bai Suzhen.

195
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
You have to try too.

196
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Even if I try, my mother won't know.

197
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,760
You become Bai Suzhen, she will know.

198
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
God of steel must find my dad.

199
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
He listens to my dad twenty percent.

200
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
My dad listens to me thirty percent.

201
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
He listens to me.

202
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Fifty percent?

203
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
You don't want to choose your own shoes.

204
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
You don't want to choose your own shoes?

205
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
I'm so happy.

206
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
I'm content.

207
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Content.

208
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
I'm so hungry.

209
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
I want to eat.

210
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Where should I go?

211
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
I have no idea.

212
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Maybe I should go somewhere else,

213
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
after the meal.

214
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
I should go somewhere else.

215
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
I should go somewhere else.

216
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Where should I go?

217
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
I'm so full.

218
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
I'm so full.

219
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
I'm so full.

220
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
I'm so full.

221
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
I'm so full.

222
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,760
You're a womanizer.

223
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,760
You're serious?

224
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,760
I'm already trapped in the love and uncivilized love.

225
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,760
What kind of monster made you trapped in the uncivilized love?

226
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
I'm on the side of the real world with you guys.

227
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,760
I'm doing dance training.

228
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Brother Gang, you're a serious boss.

229
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,760
You're the most famous prince of the palace.

230
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Here, help me support the factory.

231
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,760
I'm serious with you.

232
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
You're trying to get in my way.

233
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
If you don't help me make things clear,

234
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,760
and make me lose my impression in front of the emperor,

235
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,760
I'll lose 3 million a year.

236
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Emperor?

237
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
You're in trouble.

238
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Forget it.

239
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,760
I'll get used to it when you mention him.

240
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
Tang.

242
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Where are you going?

243
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,760
I'm going to be a soldier in the Qing family.

244
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
I'm willing to die for him.

245
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
I understand.

246
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,760
You'd rather die than be a soldier in the Qing family.

247
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,760
He's a few years older than Xiao Mi.

248
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,760
You can't get a daughter to agree to a little mom.

249
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
I'm tired.

250
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,760
I'll go to sleep.

251
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Sister, let them send you the fruits later.

252
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Okay.

253
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
Sister.

254
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Don't call me sister anymore.

255
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
I'm doing business upstairs.

256
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
I only have the money for the subsidies.

257
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
You'll only be late for a month?

258
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
I've been late for half a year.

259
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Let's go.

260
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Let's go.

261
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
Mr. Qiao, pour yourself some water.

262
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
You're old.

263
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
I'm afraid you'll forget.

264
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
Just look around.

265
00:16:52,760 --> 00:17:11,940
Ba ges the

266
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,380
You haven't introduced this person yet?

267
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,580
Song Guan Wang. There's someone written on the door.

268
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,020
The owner of Guan Wang Entertainment.

269
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,180
He's older than Qiao Guang Hui.

270
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,620
What do you mean?

271
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,900
You don't understand?

272
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,780
Then I'll say it in a more detailed way.

273
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,340
Qiao Guang Hui, Boss Qiao,

274
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,060
suddenly fell in love with me.

275
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,980
I don't know what that means either.

276
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,180
The motivation is very simple.

277
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,180
It's just that I hope that you're in good health,

278
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,740
good career, and good mood.

279
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,700
As long as you're well, I'm well.

280
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,500
What's wrong?

281
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,900
The situation in your eyes is a bit biased, right?

282
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,700
Brother Gang is a bit arrogant.

283
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,060
I've been training for four years.

284
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,700
No, five years.

285
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,220
Every year, I sponsor three million.

286
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,540
He agreed to come to our place to supervise.

287
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,020
He personally taught the kids to dance.

288
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,900
Thank you.

289
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,300
Aren't you joking?

290
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,660
Twice a week.

291
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,500
Once is fine.

292
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,740
As long as Wang Zi appears here,

293
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,700
the parents of the kids will be very happy.

294
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,780
No, I'm a bit sensitive.

295
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,180
What did you mean just now?

296
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,700
What kind of joke is that?

297
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,540
Did I say that he fell in love with me?

298
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,020
Or did I say that

299
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,660
I wanted you to come here and make the parents happy?

300
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,260
Xiao Qiao, I'm leaving first.

301
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,940
My breathing is a bit sleepy.

302
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,300
You're so annoying.

303
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,940
You're even calling me Xiao Qiao?

304
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,340
You're so strong.

305
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,220
Why are you so serious?

306
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,460
This person...

307
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,860
He's been learning dance since he was little.

308
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,940
He's quite gentle.

309
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,820
He's quite naughty.

310
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,620
He's Zhao Gang.

311
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,180
He's very strict.

312
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,540
Do you know why I rarely come to this kind of place?

313
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,780
President Qiao, your brother is angry.

314
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,740
No, no, no.

315
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,780
Barley is a high-end food.

316
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,940
It needs life to persist and love.

317
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,540
People in this kind of place

318
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,140
rarely know about Barley.

319
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,220
In the name of a high-end food,

320
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,540
you earn money.

321
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,460
You must earn money.

322
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,300
But until now,

323
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,100
neither upstairs nor downstairs have earned money.

324
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,060
I don't know much about it.

325
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,420
I only want to play dance.

326
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,980
Business is a game of entertainment.

327
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,300
Life is short and there are no obstacles.

328
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,140
I love to play.

329
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,940
My son loves to play more than I do.

330
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,620
I have to get used to it now.

331
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,540
It's not annoying to take pictures while the whole world is running around.

332
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,140
I should play something extreme.

333
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,380
What is extreme?

334
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,700
You're not leaving?

335
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,060
What do you mean?

336
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,060
I won't come to this kind of place to teach.

337
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,780
What do you do in the bar?

338
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,580
Director.

339
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,140
Isn't it Wang Zi?

340
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,340
From the past.

341
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,100
What is director?

342
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,380
Art.

343
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,980
I didn't see it.

344
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,700
You're over fifty years old.

345
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,380
You haven't started yet.

346
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,900
Look at your breath.

347
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,060
You keep talking about it.

348
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,260
You'll be tired sooner or later.

349
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,540
It's ridiculous.

350
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,460
Ignore him.

351
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,060
What is extreme?

352
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,700
To fall in love.

353
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,980
It's indeed extreme.

354
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,780
Your son is angry with me.

355
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,500
He's old and can't fall in love.

356
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,980
Don't care about what others think.

357
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,500
You're old.

358
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,780
Then you should agree to talk.

359
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,020
Talk about what?

360
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,420
We're all old.

361
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,660
You said you were in love when you played extreme.

362
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,020
Jiang Guanghui, stop teasing me.

363
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,420
I said I was playing extreme.

364
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,980
That's my son.

365
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,940
It's okay.

366
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,420
I just want to see you often.

367
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,780
I can care about you.

368
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,620
Why do I feel you're holding back?

369
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,460
Hello.

370
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,860
Forget it.

371
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,220
He doesn't like you.

372
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,740
Does he like anyone else?

373
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,660
Go back.

374
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,620
Go back.

375
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,900
Okay, I am gonna get it today.

376
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:59,420

377
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,860
It's okay.

378
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,060
Xu Tian, you're busy?

379
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,580
Yes.

380
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,380
Just you?

381
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,900
Yes.

382
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,340
I...

383
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,700
I'm a bit embarrassed to say this.

384
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,180
It's a bit of a surprise, isn't it?

385
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,540
It's okay, you're a real-life person.

386
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,460
How are you two?

387
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,820
We're not really good.

388
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,620
We're pretty good.

389
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,700
Then I'll tell you.

390
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,300
Tell me.

391
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,780
I have a relative.

392
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,860
She wants to make cheongsam.

393
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,900
I want to ask you to make a set for her.

394
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,060
You know it.

395
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,700
In my shop, it's a size of one, three, five.

396
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,460
Just call her anytime.

397
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,940
The price is the same.

398
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,580
I'll give you the name.

399
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,740
It's getting cold now.

400
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,260
Okay.

401
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,420
Let me say one more thing.

402
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,340
My relative has a weird temper.

403
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,100
You should be more responsible.

404
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,860
Making cheongsam has nothing to do with temper.

405
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,980
I'll call her in.

406
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,980
I'll tell her that you have to make cheongsam.

407
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,780
Will she measure my size for me?

408
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,220
Were you this good-looking when you were dating?

409
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,020
I have no objection.

410
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,900
At 9.40 in the morning,

411
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,260
I woke up and thought about what you said in bed for an hour and a half.

412
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,300
What did I say?

413
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,860
Your mom, Bai Su Zhen, is a thunderbolt.

414
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,860
The teacher said you wanted to make cheongsam.

415
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,100
It's getting cold now.

416
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,300
Okay.

417
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,740
I have to go.

418
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,500
I'm going.

419
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,480
Over here.

420
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,740
All right, that's fine.

421
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,220
Please take your несколько.

422
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,540
Shipping Wrestling.

423
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,400
I'm sorry.

424
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,600
Okay.

425
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,980
Have you thought up your own approved?"

426
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,060
No.

427
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,980
I have more than a hundred variants.

428
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,160
You can choose based on the ones that you like.

429
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,180
textured hand kn offenses.

430
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,720
Teacher disse放在纸上

431
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,040
It's different.

432
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,880
It's better if you take a paper.

433
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,760
Red is good but red is bad.

434
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,600
I know 551.

435
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,780
Everybody knows 书生

436
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,700
Gelle Eau Le Carine

437
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,320
that black plastic is better.

438
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,560
I've worked on it since тогда

439
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,240
In the days

440
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,440
whenever we saw Jia年

441
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,040
After seeing Jia Suolan's show

442
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,080
she fainted on the stage

443
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,280
Later she disappeared

444
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,640
so I didn't bring her out

445
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,240
Can I wear it?

446
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:50,420
I'll expect

447
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,920
I'm not someone who looks like you.

448
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,760
So,

449
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,760
what do you want to say?

450
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,320
Are we friends?

451
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,960
We're good friends.

452
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,760
I have two ways to deal with your psychological problems.

453
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,560
One is to be warm-hearted,

454
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,600
and the other is to be fierce.

455
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,920
Then, tell me about being warm-hearted.

456
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,920
Transfer your past feelings

457
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,080
to another new relationship.

458
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
It's best to be in love,

459
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,800
get married and live together.

460
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,080
I said I was treating your illness, not me.

461
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,840
Has no one told you that before?

462
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,960
The night before,

463
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,520
you told me that.

464
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,800
I think

465
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,280
we're depending on each other.

466
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,520
That's probably what I meant.

467
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,240
You don't hate it, do you?

468
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,800
Not at all.

469
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,520
But,

470
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,800
I don't need it right now.

471
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,080
Then, be fierce.

472
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,840
I...

473
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,200
The things in this shop

474
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,560
are the same as before.

475
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:02,920
The same?

476
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Change the old things,

477
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
change the old habits,

478
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,360
and rearrange them into a new place.

479
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Don't put the two chequers

480
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,200
in the kitchen window anymore.

481
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,040
Sell them.

482
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,200
I'll buy one.

483
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,200
Actually, I thought about it before.

484
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,880
Is that the changing room?

485
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,080
Yes.

486
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,360
I have!

487
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,960
Not unhappy right?

488
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,800
No.

489
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,080
Don't want to change your life.

490
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,680
Pick out the unhappy things

491
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
and force yourself to forget.

492
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,040
Forced myself?

493
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:48,800
safety for left

494
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,360
or鳩 to me it's okay.

495
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,760
You know these things?

496
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,880
Can you control your own past?

497
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,680
Pre-consciousness is control.

498
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,440
After thinking about it,

499
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,920
you will be determined to go against the past.

500
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,120
That's why it's a strong medicine.

501
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,400
You should change your cheongsam.

502
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,880
It doesn't match your size.

503
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,760
I'll change it later.

504
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,840
Can I go upstairs to take a look?

505
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,580
Her height is impressive.

506
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,200
Can you switch to your text rather than this?

507
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,180
You look great in this.

508
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,560
Do you always get this wrong in your chat?

509
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,360
Get lost.

510
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,360
Teacher Zhang, Bai Su Zhen.

511
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
These are old furniture.

512
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,560
Twenty years. I haven't changed them.

513
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,560
This is my room.

514
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
This is my room.

515
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
This is my room.

516
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,560
The headlight is not turned off.

517
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,560
I lighted it up on purpose. I never turn it off.

518
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Don't be angry.

519
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,560
I'm sorry.

520
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,560
Don't turn it on today.

521
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
You'd better not care about it the day after tomorrow.

522
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Hold on for two days.

523
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
I'll go back after changing my clothes.

524
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
I'm sorry.

525
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,560
I'm sorry.

526
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
I'm sorry.

527
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
Your ID card.

529
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Oh, I forgot.

530
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
If you still want to find that person,

531
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,560
you can stay here.

532
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,560
I can expand the scope and find the record of two or three days before and after the sixth.

533
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,560
I want to see hundreds of monitors and hundreds of hours.

534
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
Thank you so much.

535
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,560
We're all friends. You're welcome.

536
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
Thank you.

537
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Do you like candy?

538
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Eating so much is bad for your health.

539
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Should I help you or should I help you?

540
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
I'm sorry.

541
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
I'm sorry.

542
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,560
I'm sorry.

543
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,560
You didn't leave?

544
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,560
It's so far. How can I leave?

545
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,560
Let's go.

546
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
It's ridiculous.

547
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,560
We've been in love for so many years.

548
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
You just want a...

549
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
She's older than you.

550
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
We're the same age.

551
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,560
I asked you to help me.

552
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
I asked you to work part-time and earn money.

553
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Do you know how to do that?

554
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Look.

555
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
This is typical of making money in the name of art.

556
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
You're not making money with art.

557
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Even if the factory is bigger and you earn more,

558
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
you can't look down on the one who makes less money.

559
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,560
Qiao Ganghui, you don't understand art.

560
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,560
You only have three million a year.

561
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
You don't understand?

562
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,560
Let me tell you.

563
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Don't affect the position and image in my heart.

564
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,560
Otherwise, three million is gone.

565
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
I don't want to talk about money with you.

566
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Qiao Ganghui is a bastard.

567
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,560
What will she say?

568
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
You're so petty.

569
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
She told me

570
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
that she's going to talk about White Lady.

571
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,560
What did she say?

572
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
Tell Yao Yao to try it.

573
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Bastard!

574
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
She's a bastard.

575
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
You're a bastard!

576
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
You're a bastard.

577
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
I'll ask her to do it.

578
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
You're a bastard.

579
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
I'll ask her to try it.

580
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
The eight-legged girl is yours.

581
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Don't pretend to be a big man.

582
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,560
You also danced from group dance to bamboo dance.

583
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
Qiao Ganghui, you're so embarrassed.

584
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,560
Xiao Mi is nine years old. Yao Yao is ten years old.

585
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
You care more about eating and drinking.

586
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
I care more about you.

587
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Fine. Three million.

588
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
I don't want to represent the eight-legged girl.

589
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
If you don't want it, give it to me.

590
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
No, no, no.

591
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
If you don't want it, you can't.

592
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
I'm not going to believe you.

593
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Our business is getting better.

594
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
We're getting more and more money every year.

595
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Tell me.

596
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
Is there anyone in the world

597
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,560
who is as righteous as me

598
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
about art?

599
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
Stop it.

600
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
You're going to be a loser.

601
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
Can you do it?

602
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,560
Slow down.

603
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,560
The sky you looked at

604
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,560
The color of the sunset

605
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,560
I always want to chase

606
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,560
We've become a little different

607
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Lost direction

608
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
I'm in love with you

609
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,560
But I'm going to the end

610
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,560
No need to write down the windfall

611
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,560
Remember you have the look I love

612
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,560
Run forward together

613
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:45,560
The journey is a pain for you

614
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,560
Don't be afraid of the years

615
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
No matter

616
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,560
The real us

617
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,560
The pain of meeting that time

618
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,560
Accept everything about you

619
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,560
No matter how hard it is

620
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,560
We can reach the faraway

621
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,560
Don't be afraid of the years

622
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Two hearts are like the scenery on the way

623
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,560
Love is a free scene

624
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
No matter
