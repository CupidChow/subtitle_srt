1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
A Designedus Actuallyream

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the hall

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wait for the sunset to spread the grass

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Loneliness is like a lonely man

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Accompanying is the custom

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like a fantasy, the beautiful girl is left behind

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Wind and rain, we walk through the ups and downs

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The path of time, from small to large

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
May you and me be together

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Can you say something psychological?

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Calm and calm

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I am calm

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Ballet is beautiful

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Beauty comes from calmness

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Calmness comes from relationship

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Bai She and Xiao Qing have been together for a thousand years

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There is another thousand years

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Xu Qian is just a mortal

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The reason why they are so close is that they have three roles

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Xiao Qing and Bai She

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The love between a man and a woman, the fairy and the fairy

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They are all the same

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What kind of new tricks can they make up?

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You have a few days to talk about the reality

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Can you make up the dance and the music?

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No need to make up the music

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Music is not the whole thing

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's mainly the two sides of the lake

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You mean you can make up

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can make up, but you need a new idea

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Bai She and Xiao Qing have such a foundation

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You go and ask Qiao Mi and Xiao Yao

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Their relationship

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What's wrong with them

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
They are Bai Su Zhen and Xiao Qing

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Go back first

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Go back to the theater first, okay?

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hello, Brother Gang

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't forget to stick to your job

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Bring guests to the children

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let the children be happy in their hearts

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm so annoyed

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's annoying about doing art?

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You should be happy every day

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hurry up and go to Mr. Song

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't be careless

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Qiao Guanghui, you are a bastard

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go to Mr. Song after work

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going to work

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to work

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm going to work

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm going to work

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Go to Mr. Song after work

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Leave me alone

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You asked me to say

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Brother Ying

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Not happy

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh my god

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Two three four five six seven eight

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
One more time, keep sending people

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
One two three four five six seven eight

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mr. Song Mr. Song

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Your phone

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mr. Song, your phone

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, thank you

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hello

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The gift will be here in a while

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What gift

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I prepared you a big gift

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Send it to me in a while

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mr. Song

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So polite

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm not polite, I'm sincere

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What gift

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't ask

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You said you had to work with me again

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What gift did I ask you

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll work

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
OK, remember what I said

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hang up

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What dance did you learn

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Are you Xiao Bai

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Thank you, thank you

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm talking, thank you

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Good

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Slow down, slow down

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Mom

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What did you write today

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Teacher Zhou, this is the letter

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Goodbye teacher

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Goodbye, goodbye

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Goodbye, goodbye

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Dad

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What are you doing

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Stand

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Look at you, that Han Di Ba Cong

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm tired of being with the earth for minutes

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Tired

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Can you respect people

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't be too high

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's what happened

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Qiao Guanghui asked you to come and send gifts

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I am the gift given by Qiao Guanghui

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Qiao Guanghui is sincere enough

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What is your relationship

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hair

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why is it so different

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I have been practicing ballet since I was a kid

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He has been playing the knife since he was a kid

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What is your gift

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How do i use

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Stick to it

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But not with guests

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
When I have time, I will come and see

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What to see

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
See you all dance

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What else

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Can also be taken as a photo

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But can't put the first floor

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Can't put this either

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Can you hang three floors

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What is the environment

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My bedroom

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Where to sleep

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Can the bedhead

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Otherwise, you can check it out

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's just that my son is not at home today

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Boring

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Boring

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I really didn't expect

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How about meeting a store with someone like you

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You didn't think about coming here

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Where to make money by art

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm not making money

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why are you always disrespectful to me

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Because you came to me for the first time

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I look down on me

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
OK, OK

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I won't give you a general view

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Just think it's fun

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I see you are so good

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I think it's funny

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
OK, sorry

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I apologize

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Not so easy

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What else

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mr. Song

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Can you sign here

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Here

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Thank you master

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Thank you

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Thank you

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
OK, there are fans

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't carry it

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Go back, I'm sorry

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I am asked to stick to the hard work

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You can't bear it, I can't help

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I have a teacher

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It has nothing to do with me

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I am an employee friend

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You and Qiao Kanghui are quite reserved

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If I stick to it, I have to have a program

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Tiantian

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What program did you come with when you were engaged?

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Just dance

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I want you to see

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What is the real art

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
music

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
music

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Mr. Zhou

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Help me call a car

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I have a car

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Call the kids to make money

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Mr. Song, how is your treatment?

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You are shaking your waist

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Can it

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't bend your feet and get a pillow

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We should put on insurance before dancing

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You are boring

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I am for your good

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I am kind

188
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm afraid of bending my feet

189
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's it

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm afraid of bending my feet

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's the feet

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Mr. Zhao is because there is no warm-up

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Professional

194
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm old

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm not saying you can't

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My mouth

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Hurry up

198
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Slow down

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm so sorry

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I broke the gift

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Can I go back to do art?

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Don't delay going to work

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I am already aware

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Whether I need it or not

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's the right that Qiao Guanghui gave you

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Absolutely not

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No, I mean

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I want to come to work every week

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Didn't you marry you again?

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Just when you are in the heart

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Send him home

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
rest assured

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'll be back

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll be back

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll be back

216
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Director

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You are injured

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Where are you hurt?

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Dried wound

220
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The wound is fire

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You have to walk more

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Don't lie

223
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What about his500ienza picture?

224
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It doesn't hurt

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't want to take it

226
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'd like to show you

227
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Come and check

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,480
Don't bring yourself I am not

229
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,320
Means

230
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
it's impossible

231
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,300
Why is the performance in the heart without competition?

232
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
I'll be back.

233
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,900
Can I use the prop?

234
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
Whatever.

235
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Do you understand?

236
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,500
Yun Jie must have moved Aunt Gang.

237
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,700
She wants to change the choreography

238
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
into a relationship between Xiao Qing and White Snake.

239
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,700
Really?

240
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,100
It's not a good thing.

241
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,700
You've been in love for nothing for so many days.

242
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
I'm not going to talk about it anyway.

243
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,500
If Sister Yun and Aunt Gang,

244
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,100
you'll definitely get a chance to change the choreography.

245
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,500
I'll work hard.

246
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Work hard?

247
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,700
How do I answer it?

248
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,900
Don't worry about me. There's nothing.

249
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
You have a call.

250
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
I won't answer it.

251
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,300
What's wrong with you?

252
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,300
I'm not working. I'm working.

253
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
You're hurt?

254
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,500
Your female hero got hurt.

255
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
You hurt yourself?

256
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
You're already hurt like that. Then why...

257
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,500
Let me tell you.

258
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,100
If you dare to hurt her...

259
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
What did you say?

260
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,100
Qiao Feng Kui, if you have the guts,

261
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,700
push me down from here.

262
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,900
I'm going to get angry.

263
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,500
Let me tell you.

264
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
I'm a man of my word.

265
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,900
You're a traitor.

266
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Try this.

267
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
One card.

268
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,100
Don't match the one you're wearing today.

269
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
I knew you'd be good at changing choreography.

270
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,300
I brought one more.

271
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,100
How did you get in the car yesterday?

272
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,700
Everyone has a temper.

273
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,300
Why is it gone now?

274
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,100
It's because your temper is getting better.

275
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,500
What are you two doing?

276
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,900
I'm going to the bathroom.

277
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,700
What are you two doing?

278
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,300
I'm going to the theater.

279
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,100
What's in this bag?

280
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,900
A shopping bag.

281
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,900
So everyone in the troupe

282
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,500
uses your products?

283
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,300
Not just me.

284
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,500
They also use...

285
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,100
I have to earn money, Director.

286
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,300
I bought a new car to be more proactive.

287
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,900
You don't have to do shopping.

288
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,100
You can go out and teach the kids to dance.

289
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Really?

290
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,700
Is it embarrassing?

291
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,500
You're going to be late for the end!

292
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,700
Yang, you better not go.

293
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,100
Right now, I'll have to go see Yao Yao and Xiao Mi.

294
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,300
We've got a 10-minute给我 variance of the day.

295
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,100
Brother Yang, my religious education isn't doing well.

296
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,500
Peng Yang, hello?

297
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,100
Hey?!

298
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,700
Brother Jiao, what's wrong?

299
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,700
I'm fine. How are you?

300
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
은

301
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,320
truth

302
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,580
I also recommend the Eertos

303
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:31,860
thanks

304
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
directly

305
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,580
Guangeden

306
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,120
my

307
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,640
are you in the hospital

308
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,500
I'm OK

309
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,780
Why go to the hospital?

310
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,460
What happened to Zhao Gang?

311
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,180
His legs are all broken?

312
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,180
You can do it.

313
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,860
Can I move him?

314
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,540
It was you who sent Da Li to let him come to the interview.

315
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,380
I said that he was going to the interview.

316
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,860
He jumped up.

317
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,260
He has old arms and legs.

318
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,860
I can't blame him.

319
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,380
He did it himself.

320
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,780
I was so scared.

321
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,420
I thought I was going to face the most difficult choice in my life.

322
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,660
What choice?

323
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,740
To meet a good friend.

324
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,980
Let me tell you.

325
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,340
I'm really that kind of person.

326
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,500
Enough. Don't talk nonsense.

327
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,700
When you ask him out, I'll apologize to him.

328
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,180
Let's just be friends.

329
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,900
Okay?

330
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,740
He's also quite pitiful.

331
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,540
Okay.

332
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,740
I'll buy the medicine.

333
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,260
You don't need to buy the medicine.

334
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,620
Just ask him out.

335
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,340
Okay. Don't worry.

336
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,500
Okay.

337
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,900
Mr. Tao.

338
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,780
Hello, Ms. Yao.

339
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,340
Come, sit.

340
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,780
Where are you going?

341
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,980
To the training hall.

342
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,980
Okay.

343
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,340
There's still time.

344
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,900
I'll push you wherever you go.

345
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,780
You're all married.

346
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,460
I'm so proud of a friend like you.

347
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
I've been in a bad situation for eight lifetimes

348
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,540
for a friend like you.

349
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,180
Don't talk nonsense.

350
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,900
What are you two doing?

351
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,660
Director, Ms. Yao.

352
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,780
We're moving the props.

353
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,980
Go.

354
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,820
Are you ready?

355
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,020
Yang Yun suggested this self-practice.

356
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,220
So he's here too.

357
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,500
It has nothing to do with me.

358
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,980
I'm just here to see you.

359
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,020
Dad.

360
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,420
Don't stand there. I'm working.

361
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,620
Okay.

362
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,020
I'm leaving.

363
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,660
Don't go.

364
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,540
I have something to tell you.

365
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,420
Call me.

366
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,100
Are you ready?

367
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,340
No.

368
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,940
We just moved the bed for ten minutes.

369
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,940
Why do we need a bed for a double-person dance?

370
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,140
We spend the most time on the bed.

371
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,660
We're either lying down or lying down.

372
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,940
Let's start.

373
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,740
Wait.

374
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,140
Mr. Sheng.

375
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,740
Ten minutes have passed.

376
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,140
Music.

377
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,940
Music.

378
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,260
Today is the day of the game.

379
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,220
I'll be home late.

380
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,180
You play the game.

381
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,780
I'll go see mom.

382
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,580
What? Today?

383
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,180
The seventh day of the game.

384
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,780
Ms. Yao.

385
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,180
I'm calling you to the theater.

386
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,780
Coming.

387
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,780
Ms. Yao.

388
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Don't you feel it?

389
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,380
We have a tacit understanding.

390
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,380
The tacit understanding is because of their relationship.

391
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,580
If you change another person's relationship,

392
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,380
you can't express the tacit understanding

393
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,980
by only doing body movements.

394
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,780
You have a relationship with the film industry, too?

395
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,380
It's different.

396
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,980
They've been together since they were little.

397
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,980
Of course it's different.

398
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,780
Bai Zhezhen is Bai Su's wife.

399
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,780
She never changes.

400
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,580
Nothing is never changing.

401
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,380
Nothing is never changing.

402
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,780
Then it's never changing for me.

403
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,780
I asked Yao Yao and Xiaomi to remember the stars for you today.

404
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,180
Otherwise, you wouldn't give up.

405
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,380
The rehearsal starts the day after tomorrow.

406
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,980
The leaders will come to see it.

407
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,980
Go back.

408
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,580
Today is the last rehearsal.

409
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,580
Rest tomorrow.

410
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,180
The rehearsal starts the day after tomorrow.

411
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,580
Music.

412
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,180
Please.

413
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,080
Thank you.

414
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,580
Alright, off to the technology department now.

415
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,980
Your feelings about Gu Jia15 will wait in the car.

416
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,080
It's ok, let me be yourmate.

417
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,380
I feel at ease now.

418
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,180
Copy what's happened.

419
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,580
bau.com

420
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,540
I'm not sure.

421
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,580
What you said

422
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,780
is different from what you think.

423
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,980
How do you know?

424
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,580
I've experienced it these two days.

425
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,780
I'm sad.

426
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,180
Don't be like this

427
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,580
when you think about it.

428
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,180
No.

429
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,980
It's not me.

430
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,980
Zhou Botong?

431
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,380
No.

432
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,180
When I get the letter,

433
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,180
tell him

434
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,580
whether you like him or not.

435
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,580
We all like him.

436
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,980
Of course.

437
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,380
But

438
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,380
don't you really go to see Zhou Botong?

439
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,580
I'm not going.

440
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,780
You're talking

441
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,780
differently from what you think.

442
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,580
No.

443
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,180
Where is

444
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,180
his daily tour today?

445
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,380
Guangming Pavilion.

446
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,380
Is it too old?

447
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,780
It's too old.

448
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,580
I'm almost at the subway station.

449
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,980
Go to see his mother on the Internet.

450
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,980
Okay.

451
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,380
Buy a bunch of flowers for me.

452
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,380
I'll bring them too.

453
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,380
Okay.

454
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,380
I'll go with you.

455
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,380
Okay.

456
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,380
Bye.

457
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,180
Okay.

458
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,180
Hello, Xiaomin.

459
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,380
Hello, dad.

460
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,580
Where are you?

461
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,580
I'm working.

462
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,980
Didn't the group say

463
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,180
they would come to you?

464
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,180
Is there an emergency?

465
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,380
You've retired.

466
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,380
Your business is closed.

467
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,380
What's the emergency?

468
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,980
I'm at a big place.

469
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
I won't talk about it.

470
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,980
Where are you?

471
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,580
I'm at the door.

472
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,580
I'm at the door.

473
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,580
I won't talk about it.

474
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,580
There's a place

475
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,580
in the first floor of the game room.

476
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,580
It's called the stone statue.

477
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
Did you see it?

478
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,580
What did you see?

479
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,580
Don't pretend.

480
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,580
There's someone in the game room.

481
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,580
Go in and sit.

482
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
I'll be there in half an hour.

483
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,580
What are you looking for me for?

484
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,580
If you go up there today,

485
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,580
you won't see Mr. Sun again.

486
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,580
What if I don't go up?

487
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,580
What if I don't go up?

488
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,580
Then I and Xiao Liao

489
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,580
will always be nice to you.

490
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
Did you see

491
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,580
Yi Tuo's handsome sister?

492
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,580
That one.

493
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
There's one.

494
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Give him the phone.

495
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
My daughter.

496
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,580
Hello.

497
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,580
This is my dad.

498
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,580
Mom.

499
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,580
Come on.

500
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,580
Get up.

501
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,580
I'll give you a massage.

502
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,580
This is a good massage.

503
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,580
Commander has in the name on this.

504
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,580
Yes, sir.

505
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,580
It's all right.

506
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,580
Sit down.

507
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,580
Okay.

508
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,580
Wore.

509
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,580
Come on.

510
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,580
Teacher, please house it.

511
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,580
Make a card, please.

512
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,580
lack of money

513
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,140
Liuying is like a horse in the sky.

514
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,940
The name is on the west.

515
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,940
Congratulations to me.

516
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,300
Who is the one

517
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,300
who is the first in the blue sky?

518
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,060
Brother,

519
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,180
I have something to discuss with you.

520
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,820
Can you ask Mr. Cheng to sign the table?

521
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,260
I'll sign the table.

522
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,260
Yes.

523
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,180
Your friend hasn't come yet.

524
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,820
Fine. I don't want to.

525
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,060
No.

526
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,620
I'm not good at this.

527
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,620
Please sit down, Brother Tong.

528
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:38,780
Beijing Peking Opera,

529
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,780
the blue-skinned boy.

530
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
I'm better than him.

531
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,620
You're bragging.

532
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,700
You always brag.

533
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,620
You've said it several times.

534
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,260
I didn't.

535
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,220
Didn't you say you were going to be in school?

536
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,540
Yesterday, someone said the plan was cancelled.

537
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,220
I didn't.

538
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,420
These two things

539
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,420
are so happen to us first times.

540
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,700
I didn't realise that either.

541
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,140
And I didn't know that you would come, either.

542
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,660
I'm here to experience life.

543
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,580
What if I'm not around?

544
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,740
Experience the feeling of being away?

545
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,020
How it'll feel to be around?

546
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,820
I'll leave in five minutes.

547
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,820
Where are you going?

548
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,820
Mount Pa Bo.

549
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,820
No need. Don't look down on me like that.

550
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,820
I'll see my mom once a month.

551
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,820
Then, I'll go with you.

552
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,820
I'll go with you.

553
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,820
I'll go with you.

554
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,820
I'll go with you.

555
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,820
We're in the same boat.

556
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,820
Okay.

557
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,820
Then, let's go.

558
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,820
Brother Tong,

559
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,820
do you still want to keep the seat?

560
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,820
No, you can keep it.

561
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,820
I'll see you later.

562
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,820
I'll go with you.

563
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,820
There was a man from outside.

564
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,820
He had two maids at home.

565
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,820
The man thought that he had to spend the money.

566
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,820
He didn't feel bad about spending it.

567
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,820
So he bought a diamond ring.

568
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,820
He wanted to give it to someone.

569
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,820
You have to give a woman a ring like this.

570
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,820
But Yuan Wei found a woman.

571
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,820
He thought that he had to give her a proper reason.

572
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,820
Yuan Wei thought of love.

573
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,820
Then, Yuan Wei connected love

574
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,820
with this woman.

575
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,820
He went out with the ring.

576
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,820
Fortunately, the two maids

577
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,820
found out Yuan Wei's logical mistake in time.

578
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,820
One of them told Yuan Wei,

579
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,820
you either give the ring back

580
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,820
or you forget about the woman.

581
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,820
Then, Yuan Wei's brain would be normal again.

582
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,820
You and Yao Yao are not maids.

583
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,820
That's not the point.

584
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,820
Yuan Wei's brain is normal.

585
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,820
Yuan Wei's brain is not normal.

586
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,820
You have a fever.

587
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,820
Are you going to pay the bill?

588
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,820
Dad,

589
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,820
I will be sad if you get hurt.

590
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,820
Your dad is a strong man.

591
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,820
Are you hurt?

592
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,820
Do you want me to tell the truth?

593
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,820
The ring can't be returned.

594
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,820
You don't have to worry about women.

595
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,820
I don't object to finding a stepmother.

596
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,820
But she has to be willing to be a stepmother.

597
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,820
What do you mean?

598
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,820
I came yesterday

599
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,820
and sat on the table with Aunt.

600
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,820
I wanted to give you the ring.

601
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,820
There were two maids on the table.

602
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,820
But I didn't have the bandage.

603
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,820
Are you nagging?

604
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,820
I was just taking a break.

605
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,820
Aunt made a conclusion yesterday.

606
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,820
It's not appropriate for you.

607
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,820
She doesn't have to say anything against me.

608
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,820
And she looks like that kind of person.

609
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,820
I'm her daughter. She knows.

610
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,820
Once she says that, she will know what to do.

611
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,820
She can't get it together anymore.

612
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,820
And Aunt made a conclusion for me.

613
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,820
She wants me to pass on the message to you.

614
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,820
It's inevitable to be sad.

615
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,820
Let's enter the comfort stage.

616
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,820
Don't worry about Aunt.

617
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,820
She's too young to care about that.

618
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,820
This is mine.

619
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,820
This is Xiaomi's.

620
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,820
I came this time

621
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,820
to tell you about a few things.

622
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,820
Didn't we say last time

623
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,820
that the band was starting to record the White Snake Tour?

624
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,820
I thought you were going to say that.

625
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,820
I didn't want you to mention it.

626
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,820
I didn't want you to mention it.

627
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,820
I was so jealous.

628
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,820
I was so jealous.

629
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,740
Didn't you say last time that the group started to shoot the White Snake Tour?

630
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,620
You shot me to the White Snake Wall a few days ago.

631
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,940
Are you happy?

632
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,140
There's one more thing.

633
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,100
Mom.

634
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,380
I met someone named Zhou Tong.

635
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,700
He's quite nice.

636
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,020
I won't like him.

637
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,700
But I want to know what love is.

638
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,980
If you're here, just tell me.

639
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,540
Then I'll know what Bai Su Chun thinks.

640
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,580
What did you bring here?

641
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,860
Orange. I bought it on the way.

642
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,820
You bought it for me?

643
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,860
No, I bought it for myself. I didn't expect you to go back.

644
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,540
Are you still thinking about it?

645
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,260
About what?

646
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,980
You don't know how long you've been living.

647
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,740
You're going to be single.

648
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,940
You remember it well.

649
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,620
Yesterday, the

650
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,300
director said that the love at first sight is real.

651
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,940
Is it to cooperate with me?

652
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,340
You're serious again?

653
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,620
No.

654
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,420
Mom can't dance Bai Su Chun because she loves her dad.

655
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,340
I'm going to dance Bai Su Chun sooner or later.

656
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,940
I won't repeat the same mistake.

657
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,100
I hate the moment when we meet.

658
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,420
You learned it so quickly.

659
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,820
Carbonated water box.

660
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,820
Two identical leaves.

661
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,020
There are no two completely the same leaves in the world.

662
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
And there are no two identical people.

663
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
Who said that?

664
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,420
German philosopher Leibniz.

665
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,820
Is he great?

666
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,820
What he said is right.

667
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,820
That's not sure.

668
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,220
Then what you said is right.

669
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,020
Are you happy?

670
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,420
What if I meet someone like you when I go out?

671
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,020
Then you mean

672
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,420
you like someone like me again?

673
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,620
I don't like you yet.

674
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,020
Then tomorrow I'll be the same person as me.

675
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,620
Okay?

676
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,220
Why are you going down the mountain so fast?

677
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,420
It feels like walking for a long time when we go up the mountain.

678
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,620
That's because the earth rotates from west to east.

679
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,020
It's the east when we go up the mountain.

680
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,820
We are happy when we go down the mountain.

681
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,820
The earth is so big, I can't feel it.

682
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,220
Liar.

683
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,020
You always stand here like a native.

684
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,020
Don't you feel it?

685
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Do you feel it?

686
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,620
No.

687
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,620
That's because you are not old enough.

688
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,820
You didn't wear my shoes.

689
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,420
When you go back, wear my shoes.

690
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,020
His body is like a watermelon.

691
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,820
It's different.

692
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,020
I'm lost.

693
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:35,820
I'm in love but I'm going to the other side.

694
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,420
I'm back.

695
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,420
No need to write down the wind and the waves.

696
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:49,420
Remember you have the look I love.

697
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:55,020
Let's run forward together.

698
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,420
Listen to the pain of the earth.

699
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
See what I said?

700
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,820
Let's go down.

701
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,820
Go down and move.

702
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,020
Bullshit.

703
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,420
It's the same as the earth.

704
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,820
I'm going to the national treasure.

705
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,420
I'm going to Fuqing Gate.

706
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,420
You didn't have any problems today.

707
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,420
Did you get along?

708
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,420
Not necessarily.

709
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,420
I fell on the horse yesterday.

710
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
I didn't see it.

711
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,420
You played tricks on me yesterday.

712
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,420
I haven't taken revenge on you.

713
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,420
It's over.

714
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,420
You still don't get along.

715
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,420
You are going to take revenge on me.

716
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,420
I can ask someone.

717
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,420
How are you going to take revenge on me?

718
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,420
I think...

719
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,420
Don't think too long.

720
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,420
Or it's too cruel.

721
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,420
This is a subway.

722
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,420
If someone calls the police,

723
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,420
we will be done.

724
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,420
You are blind.

725
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,420
You are a blind person from now on.

726
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,420
I can't control my eyes.

727
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,420
You are blind.

728
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,420
When you touch it, your eyes will open.

729
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,420
You are blind.

730
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,420
It's better to be blind.

731
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,420
I have blind eyes.

732
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,420
Where are you going?

733
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,420
I'm on your side.

734
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,420
Don't lie to me.

735
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,420
Then...

736
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
Okay.

737
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,420
Then...

738
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,420
Use your pen.

739
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,420
I'm afraid of darkness.

740
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,420
I'm here.

741
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,420
Tell me when to lift my feet.

742
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,420
Tell me when to lift my feet.

743
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,420
Yes, this way.

744
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,420
Slowly.

745
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,420
Backward.

746
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,420
Yes.

747
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,420
Lean back.

748
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,420
Yes.

749
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,420
Backward.

750
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,420
Yes.

751
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,420
Backward.

752
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,420
I...

753
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,420
I...

754
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
I...

755
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,420
I...

756
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,420
I...

757
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,420
I...

758
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,420

771
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Remember you have the look I love

772
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:14,420
Run forward together

773
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:21,420
The journey is the same

774
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:27,420
Don't be afraid of the time

775
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,420
Don't be afraid

776
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,420
The real us

777
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:45,420
From the time we met

778
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,420
Accept everything about you

779
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:58,420
No matter how hard you try

780
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:06,420
We can reach the faraway

781
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,420
Don't be afraid

782
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,420
Two hearts are like the scenery on the way

783
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,420
We know love is a free and unwavering thing

784
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,420
It doesn't matter
