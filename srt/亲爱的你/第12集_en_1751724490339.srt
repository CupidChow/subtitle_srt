1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
As the Ancient Poeline

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the hall

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wait for the sunset to spread the grass

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Loneliness is like a lonely man

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Accompanying is the custom

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like a fantasy, the beautiful girl is left behind

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wind and rain, the road is long and the time is long

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
From childhood to the next life, may you and me be together

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Have some tea.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Dian Dian's father is in charge of Shaoxing's business.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm in charge of the business outside.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll be in charge of everything at home.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
President Fang, Dian Dian knows you're here.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll know later.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Before she comes, she'll ask you about the situation.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Her temperament and personality, she never understands.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Dian Dian never tells me.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How about this?

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll tell you about Dian Dian's situation.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You can see me as a helper.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Helper?

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sister Dian.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Xiaoyue.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Sister Fang is here.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is the room card for you and Xu Tian.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Where is Xu Tian?

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He's drinking tea in Sister Fang's room.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Do you want to go up?

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Dian Dian's situation.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
She told you everything, right?

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
President Fang is like this.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Actually, I don't think I have to tell the past.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Dian Dian and I have been together since...

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a matter of time.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Dian Dian's personality has been different from others since childhood.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Everything is here.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's a sense of insecurity.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Either left or right.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
There is no line in the world that can make things clear.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've been talking to that young man for a year.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm not talking to Dian Dian.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The young man's spirit is like a prison cell.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't look at other women.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's developed so much that I can't stand it until I think about it.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I've been insisting for a year.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The young man just followed a girl and ran away.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
President Fang.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Actually, what you said has nothing to do with me.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's about you.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's about you right away.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The young man ran away.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Dian Dian's theory is all right.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's not the end.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's because I'm not tolerant and confident.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We can't figure it out.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The line between the lungs and the lungs has to run out.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I've forgotten the stage.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let Xu Tian go.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The brain is not reformed by itself.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The heart is temporarily deleted.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All the people who are suitable for those two years.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's recovered this year.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But I still don't admit it in my heart.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
President Fang.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
President Fang.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Not admitting it means not willing to face it.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The brain must be reformed.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And it's reformed at home.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
President Fang, it's like this.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I've lived alone since I was a child.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now I have Dian Dian.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Dian Dian is my everything.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I've promised her.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No matter what happens in the future, I will...

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No matter what happens, it's impossible.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I know you're good to Dian Dian.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Today, I want to tell you in advance.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If one day you don't want to be with Dian Dian.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll stand on your side.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm yours now.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Give it back to me if you don't want it.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
President Fang, how can you say that?

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Dian Dian.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Dian Dian.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The new machine I designed is not ready yet.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Dian Dian.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I only have two positions in the new machine.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you want to be together, you can't do it.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't go out.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Xiao Yue has booked the hotel room.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Everyone together.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
When will Xu Tian come down?

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's thirty steps away from here.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll come down now.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
2805.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Mom, I hang up.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is your room card.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Thank you.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
President Fang, I'll go down first.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Go down and tell Dian Dian.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I told you about the past two years.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You ask him what he thinks of you now.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't hide from me.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Come in.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The suitcase.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You still have the bed sheet?

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't bring that photo.

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Your mom and Mr. Jia Sulan.

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I didn't bring it.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Mr. Jia Sulan is a musical actor, right?

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
White snake and white snake.

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I brought one more bed sheet.

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Do you want it?

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't want it.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We'll go back after we finish the work tomorrow.

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Change the night machine.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't watch white snake and snake.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Why?

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
White snake and snake again.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
In case of a situation.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why would I think about it?

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This is a dance.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The one twenty years ago is a musical.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It has nothing to do with it.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's okay.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't watch it.

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Dian Dian.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Dian Dian.

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Your mom.

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Ms. Fang.

141
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Just now.

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Tell me about your past.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Can you remember the past?

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I remember.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Can you remember?

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How can I not remember my own things?

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I remember.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But it's all in the past.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What else does he want you to say?

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's okay to say his original words.

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Now.

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What do you think of me?

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I was a fool in the past.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If I lost you like before.

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm a fool in the fool.

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I didn't tell you the truth before.

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's okay.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We don't have to say sorry.

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Besides.

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's not the past.

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Come to Shenzhen.

164
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You said you didn't watch it.

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We don't watch it.

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But.

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We still have to go to the park, right?

168
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm going to take a bath.

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Or you can go and take a bath.

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What are we going to do in the afternoon?

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll tell you when I think about it.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Go.

173
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The hotel biscuits are from Yan Mai.

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay.

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll go to the hotel.

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay.

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Hello?

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll come up.

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You told him about the past.

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I have to say.

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This is a thunder.

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I opened it myself.

183
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's better than a day of explosion.

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Do you love Xu Tian?

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sure I'll be with him in this life.

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Are you jealous of the people around him?

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Jealous.

188
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But I can still control it.

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Can you keep controlling it?

190
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No.

191
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What does the person next to him look like?

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He dances ballet.

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He's young and beautiful.

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Mom Xu always treats herself as Bai Su Zhen.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Twenty-one years ago.

196
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The fake Su Lan teacher who was in Bai Su Zhen disappeared.

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Mom Xu has been ill for three years.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hangzhou Lei Feng, he rebuilt the year he died.

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
From then on.

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Xu Tian will go to Lei Feng Tower every week.

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And there's a picture of his family.

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The fake Su Lan teacher.

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Mom Xu and Xu Tian.

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When I first met him.

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Xu Tian asked me to check the surveillance.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I checked and checked and checked Beijing.

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Everything.

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's all for meeting Wen Xiaoyao.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Wen Xiaoyao.

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Dance ballet Wu Bai Su Zhen.

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We came to Beijing this time.

212
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's also a white snake show he played.

213
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Xu Tian is thinking about the bedside table in his mother's room.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The lamp is never off.

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Thinking about it shows the scene.

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You two are quite compatible.

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Why?

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You and Xu Tian.

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You can't forget the past.

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
After a fear.

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
After a fear.

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's just right.

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Watch the show tomorrow.

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Xu Tian will see Wen Xiaoyao.

225
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I told him not to go.

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What if Xu Tian comes to Beijing by himself?

227
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm with him.

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He won't come.

229
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What if Xiaoyao comes to Hangzhou?

230
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Wen Xiaoyao.

231
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Help him.

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let him see Wen Xiaoyao earlier.

233
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
If he leaves with him.

234
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Leave early.

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's better to save the future.

236
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I've seen it.

237
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If he didn't leave, I'm relieved.

238
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The person in the future is yours.

239
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Has Xu Tian ever been in love?

240
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
No.

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Be fair.

242
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Why do you have the past?

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
He doesn't care about it at all.

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Answer the phone.

245
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Hello.

246
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Hello.

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm in mom's room.

248
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I hang up first.

249
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't worry.

250
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What's wrong?

251
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Wait for me in the lobby.

252
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I've decided where to go in the afternoon.

253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Leave now?

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Right away.

255
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm afraid I'll change my mind later.

256
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It doesn't matter.

257
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Anyway, it's my first time in Beijing.

258
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's the same wherever I go.

259
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's different.

260
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Okay, I'll go downstairs later.

262
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
See you later.

263
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay.

264
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Mom, I'm leaving.

265
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's not normal for people to be in love.

266
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You can't do this in the future.

267
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What's wrong?

268
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Xu Tian?

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Before coming to Beijing,

270
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
he asked me to help him find someone

271
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
who looks exactly like him.

272
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I saw him just now.

273
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Who did you see?

274
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He was seen on the street.

275
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I can't catch up with him at the bus station.

276
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So I followed Wen Xiaoyao to the ballet troupe.

277
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What does this mean?

278
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The person who always looks like him.

279
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Exactly the same.

280
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And he happened to be with Wen Xiaoyao.

281
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Don't be ridiculous.

282
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm not.

283
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Isn't this person

284
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
just right to be with Wen Xiaoyao?

285
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What are you afraid of?

286
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
He and Xu Tian are one person.

287
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What one person?

288
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Xu Tian is waiting for you in the lobby.

289
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Didn't you just make an appointment

290
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
to go there?

291
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Why did you change your mind?

292
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
How can there be people who look the same?

293
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Check it out.

294
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
There are several ballet troupe in Beijing.

295
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's a waste of money to earn money tomorrow.

296
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay.

297
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm here.

298
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,720
Don't have aceğim

379
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,600
I can see you

380
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,360
Come

381
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,880
hey

382
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,540
an EL

383
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
I'm almost there.

384
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,540
I'll be there soon.

385
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,540
Look at Yang Yuan.

386
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,540
Or they'll say we're not here.

387
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
Do you know?

388
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,540
Uncle Hui, I have something to do.

389
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
I'm hanging up.

390
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,540
He's looking for Zhou Botong.

391
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,540
Yao Yao and Zhou Botong are really a couple.

392
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,540
Yes.

393
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,540
But I got fired this morning.

394
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,540
Why?

395
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,540
Impulsiveness makes mistakes.

396
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
If they get back together,

397
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
I'll be the sinner.

398
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Little kid.

399
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
You're so stubborn.

400
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,540
Why do you buy flowers?

401
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
It's for Yun.

402
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,540
Yang Yuan is suffering from a wound.

403
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,540
Yao Yao kicked him.

404
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,540
You're really a good person.

405
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
I won't bring the flowers.

406
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,540
I'll give them to Yang Yuan at home.

407
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,540
Is that what you thought when you bought the flowers?

408
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,540
I thought the flowers were pretty when I bought them.

409
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,540
Stay away from her after you get in.

410
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,540
Don't make Yang Yuan unhappy.

411
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,540
You two.

412
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,540
I understand.

413
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,540
Where are we going?

414
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
To see a woman.

415
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Who?

416
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,540
Wen Xiao Yao.

417
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
I don't know her.

418
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,540
Bai Su Zhen.

419
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,540
Bai Su Zhen's birthday party tomorrow.

420
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
Don't touch my computer.

421
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
I'm talking about you.

422
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Let me rest for a while.

423
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,540
You didn't knock on the door.

424
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,540
And you're knocking on someone's computer.

425
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,540
You lost your love in this position?

426
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
What position?

427
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,540
I'm not in love.

428
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
I'm not in love.

429
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
I'm not in love.

430
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
I'm not in love.

431
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,540
You're not in love?

432
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,540
This position is thinking about problems.

433
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
What problems?

434
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Mom and your sister.

435
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,540
I don't know why I'm disappointed.

436
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,540
You're still not in love.

437
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,540
That's impossible.

438
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,540
She's experiencing life with me because she doesn't know how to act, right?

439
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,540
But she's acting so real.

440
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,540
She was like that in the long run.

441
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,540
What kind of person?

442
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,540
She's 100% real.

443
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,540
Then what else does she experience?

444
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,540
What are you against me doing?

445
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
Isn't she just one?

446
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
Why?

447
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
Isn't she 100,000?

448
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,540
That's 100,000 for one.

449
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,540
There are many details.

450
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
I can't explain it to you.

451
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,540
You said you should go dancing.

452
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
Hurry up.

453
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,540
I want to host you, okay?

454
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,540
Go dancing with mom.

455
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
I'm not going there.

456
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,540
You know, mom has been dancing the square dance for three years.

457
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,500
I've never been with my son

458
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,300
for a long time

459
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,740
If mom is gone one day

460
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,100
This kind of exercise

461
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,380
Didn't leave a picture

462
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,260
Is it appropriate

463
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,300
Don't you love taking pictures?

464
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,540
I'm old and changed my surname

465
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,900
You say the second floor of the rehearsal hall

466
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,940
How spacious the place

467
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,580
And come in and see yourself

468
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,500
Don't jump there

469
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,660
Fly to the outside

470
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,340
What I want is atmosphere

471
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,940
Broadcast the sky and nature

472
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,140
If you really like

473
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,380
Broadcast the sky and nature

474
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,300
Then

475
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,260
Malaysia tomorrow

476
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,140
Go with me

477
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,380
The bonus ticket is done

478
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,980
how about it

479
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,580
Just go like this

480
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,980
What's wrong with that child

481
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,900
Let's go

482
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,220
Dance with mom

483
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,900
What's wrong?

484
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,660
See it

485
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,060
Don't delay work

486
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,900
Leader, please understand the situation

487
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,700
Master Zhao just got injured in his ribs two days ago

488
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,740
How serious

489
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,660
Not serious

490
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,620
Hospital observation for two days

491
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,020
Go home and rest

492
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,900
is it

493
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,540
Yes

494
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,780
You guys go back

495
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,820
I'm still acting tomorrow

496
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,540
I'm sure I'm busy watching the show

497
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,700
I'm not busy

498
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,140
I'll stay for a while

499
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,620
Then you guys go back early

500
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,860
The patient needs to rest

501
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,740
Then I'll be busy first

502
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,460
Thank you

503
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,140
Thank you

504
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,540
Take care of yourself

505
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,380
OK

506
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,160
I will

507
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:27,780
Alright

508
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:28,860
What else

509
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,340
There's a demand

510
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,540
You will Panda

511
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:32,940
what

512
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,540
Later

513
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:52,500
When

514
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,060
You talk

515
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:55,520
The 2008

516
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:55,980
The 2008

517
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,300
That You

518
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,020
I don't need it

519
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,440
Say you

520
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,580
Why did you lose again

521
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,620
I'd like to die

522
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,740
Needs you

523
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,180
I

524
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,060
Nastily decide

525
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,860
What?

526
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,500
It's my phone.

527
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,180
Wait.

528
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,780
Wait.

529
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,460
Where is my phone?

530
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,100
Look at it.

531
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,980
Upstairs.

532
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,220
I'll go upstairs and get it.

533
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,300
Stop it.

534
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,900
You have a camera.

535
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,100
Why do you need your phone?

536
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,780
Wait for me.

537
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,500
I'm almost there.

538
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,220
What are you doing?

539
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,340
Why don't you help me?

540
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:42,940
Look at him.

541
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,860
He's so hard-working.

542
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,660
Get off.

543
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,340
Stop it.

544
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,260
You're falling down.

545
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,660
Be careful.

546
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,540
Slow down

547
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,380
I'll put a ladder for you

548
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,900
What are you doing here

549
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,460
Hang a winter coat

550
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,300
31 discount

551
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,500
Still discount

552
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,060
Can't pay the rent

553
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,460
Mom, don't always take money

554
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,740
Day to night

555
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,140
People can

556
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,700
Lifting is good

557
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,020
Thank you, Brother Tong

558
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,980
You are the owner

559
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,660
The door and the house are for nothing

560
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,300
For nothing

561
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:15,980
Just use it

562
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,500
It's okay

563
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,900
It's okay, listen to me

564
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,540
Brother Tong, go dance with you

565
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,060
The sun is out

566
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,340
Brother Tong is kind

567
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,660
Not really, listen to your heart

568
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,380
Come on

569
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,540
You talk well

570
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,820
Why are you still thinking about it

571
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,380
gone

572
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,740
Brother Tong went out with Mr. Song to dance

573
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,620
Where did they go to dance

574
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,460
I don't know

575
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,140
Sister Yun

576
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,460
Xiaoyao, where are you

577
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,220
I'll be right over

578
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,860
Is it far from the hospital

579
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,740
A little bit far

580
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,620
Then don't come

581
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,580
Not sister Yun

582
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,380
I just have something

583
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,180
Cherish the opportunity

584
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,980
Don't have psychological burden

585
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,660
My wound is not a big problem

586
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,460
You can go to the theater tomorrow

587
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,420
Invest in feelings

588
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,340
Love Xu Xian

589
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,620
Dance better than me

590
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,540
Xiaoyao

591
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,740
Sister Yun

592
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,460
Did you just hear it

593
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,980
I heard it

594
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,540
No need to come

595
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,380
I can't help you

596
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,580
Go home and rest

597
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,060
Brother is heavily injured

598
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,900
From now on

599
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,460
You are Bai Suzhen

600
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,620
Don't consider anything else

601
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,140
Thanks sister Yun

602
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,300
Too chubby

603
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,700
angran

604
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,180
At this time, her

605
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,340
She still has other things

606
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,140
Your spirit of high-spiritedness

607
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,460
is worth all the staff in our group.

608
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,060
I'm lying down.

609
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,500
I can't be high-spirited.

610
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,580
Mr. Yang is waiting for me in the group.

611
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,060
I will definitely react to him.

612
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,580
Your selfless encouragement

613
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,060
to the future generation.

614
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,980
Go to the meeting.

615
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,740
Okay, I'll go.

616
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,820
Mr. Qiao, if you keep standing,

617
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,620
I can't stand up.

618
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,420
Okay, I'll send Zhao Gang back to the group.

619
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,180
Don't think too much.

620
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,420
Your sister is a beauty.

621
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,380
She's important.

622
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,820
What's the matter?

623
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,980
I'll go find a bottle to check.

624
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,060
How is she doing?

625
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:13,480
She's sc咕r

626
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,140
She's getting cleaning.

627
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,140
Go back to your room.

628
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,300
Don't go there alone.

629
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:26,780
cm

630
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,540
He does the boyfriend thing.

631
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,220
Is it good?

632
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,700
Yes.

633
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,860
And it's still on the wall.

634
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,260
Well, mom.

635
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,060
Listen to me.

636
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,820
Where should I hang it after shooting?

637
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,380
Hang it in my room after shooting.

638
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,500
Come on.

639
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,380
Well,

640
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,580
what's wrong?

641
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,500
Take a break.

642
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,180
Wait for the light.

643
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,100
It's not good.

644
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,260
Come...

645
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,380
Get out.

646
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,860
Man.

647
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,780
Fast.

648
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,180
You are still upset.

649
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,540
I need more time to dilute it.

650
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,580
Stop tearing it.

651
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Put it back.

652
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,580
You take Yao Yao back.

653
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,580
Is Wen Xiaoyao here?

654
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,580
Of course.

655
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,580
Ask our director.

656
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,580
Which director?

657
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,580
I said Wen Xiaoyao.

658
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,580
My foot is not good.

659
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,580
My voice is loud.

660
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
You arranged it.

661
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Can't you understand the white lady without a relationship?

662
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,580
You have to be nervous.

663
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,580
You can't live with love anymore.

664
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,580
Okay, I'll pick her up.

665
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,580
Hurry up.

666
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,580
Take Wen Xiaoyao home.

667
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,580
Lie on the bed before you get up.

668
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,580
If you bump into her again,

669
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,580
I'll beat you.

670
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,580
The car to the corridor.

671
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,580
The other room.

672
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,580
Go.

673
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,580
Is it done?

674
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,580
It's done.

675
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,580
How can I persuade you?

676
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,580
I bought you a toy when you were a kid.

677
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,580
You forgot everything immediately.

678
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,580
You bought me a toy?

679
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,580
Look, you're a fool.

680
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,580
I know your dad will take you out to play.

681
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,580
I don't need to persuade you.

682
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,580
Yes, it's a pity.

683
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,580
It's a pity.

684
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,580
I'm going to the bathroom.

685
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,580
I'll be back in a minute.

686
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,580
I'll be back in a minute.

687
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,580
I'll be back in a minute.

688
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,580
I'm a good girl.

689
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,580
It has nothing to do with me.

690
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,580
It's been so many days.

691
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,580
The line is so deep.

692
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,580
Do you think

693
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,580
she's acting or real?

694
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,580
I told you before.

695
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,580
You have so many sisters.

696
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,580
Why are you so lazy?

697
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,580
Go and dance.

698
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,580
I'll go out.

699
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,580
Okay, let's dance with mom.

700
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,580
I'm not going to my mom.

701
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,580
You can't dance.

702
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
Come on.

703
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,580
I'm a man.

704
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,580
I'm with you.

705
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,580
What's going on?

706
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,580
No, it's difficult.

707
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,580
No, I'm young.

708
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,580
No,

709
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,580
I'm young.

710
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,580
You're so heartless.

711
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,580
I'm not going.

712
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,580
I'm sick.

713
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,580
Can't you dance with mom?

714
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,580
Didn't you say that?

715
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,580
Let me take a picture for you.

716
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,580
Why did I bring a camera?

717
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,580
Okay, take a picture.

718
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,580
Take a good picture.

719
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,580
Yes.

720
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,580
I'll go.

721
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
Come on.

722
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,580
I'll dance with you.

723
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,580
Come on.

724
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,580
I'll take a picture too.

725
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,580
Let my son take a picture for me.

726
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,580
Yes.

727
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,580
Come on.

728
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,580
Is Wen Xiaoyao upstairs?

729
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,580
No one.

730
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,580
Not even one person.

731
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
No.

732
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,580
Tell your Mr. Song.

733
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,580
What?

734
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,580
Forget it.

735
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,580
Why are you here?

736
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,580
I'm looking for you.

737
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,580
Is Brother San feeling better?

738
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,580
Why don't you ask me?

739
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,580
I didn't give him the key.

740
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,580
No, he's my employee.

741
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
You arranged it.

742
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,580
Whose car is this?

743
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
I don't know.

744
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,580
Let Brother Gan come to work earlier.

745
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,580
Don't think about me.

746
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
I haven't seen you for a few days.

747
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,580
I'm still thinking about you.

748
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,580
I arranged Wen Xiaoyao for your son.

749
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,580
Is it also arranged for you?

750
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,580
I also arranged a photo for you.

751
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,580
Look.

752
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,580
How jealous.

753
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,580
Hello, Brother San.

754
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,580
These two characters are not here at all.

755
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,580
I'm here to find Yao Yao.

756
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,580
She...

757
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,580
She's gone.

758
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,580
When did she come?

759
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,580
You two just danced.

760
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,580
She came by bike.

761
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,580
Bicycle.

762
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,580
The show is tomorrow.

763
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,580
She came from Hu Fangqiao to here.

764
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,580
Mr. Qiao will try to play Bai Suzhen tomorrow.

765
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
Yes.

766
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,580
What do you mean?

767
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,580
What is Xiaoyao doing here?

768
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,580
Little boy.

769
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,580
Didn't you finish your experience with my son?

770
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,580
At first, it was life experience.

771
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,580
Now it's like this.

772
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,580
They know what they're doing.

773
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,580
What do you mean?

774
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,580
You guys are doing art.

775
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,580
You're using my son to practice?

776
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,580
You guys are good.

777
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,580
My son is not good.

778
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,580
I wish you success.

779
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,580
Gao.

780
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
It has nothing to do with the child.

781
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,580
I'm here to tell you.

782
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,580
From now on,

783
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,580
let's not be friends.

784
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,580
Why?

785
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,580
If you can't do it, you'll be sad.

786
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,580
The mountains are long.

787
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,580
The rivers are long.

788
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
Let's talk about it after a while.

789
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Okay.

790
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
Then you should do it quickly.

791
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,580
We still have to be friends.

792
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Brother Ning.

793
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,580
Actually, I want to try

794
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,580
the violin and Bai Suzhen made by Sister Yun.

795
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,580
The kind that is similar to you.

796
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,580
Is it suitable now?

797
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,580
It's not suitable.

798
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,580
Which room is Sister Yun in?

799
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,580
She's asleep.

800
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,580
Let me see her.

801
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,580
She's asleep.

802
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,580
Where did you go?

803
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,580
I went to find Zhou Cong.

804
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
You came back in such a hurry?

805
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,580
You're really good.

806
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,580
You've used up all your energy.

807
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,580
What?

808
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,580
I want to make up for the second and seventh ward.

809
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580
Brother Ning.

810
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,580
She can't stay inside.

811
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,580
Let me see.

812
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,580
What are you talking about?

813
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,580
Tomorrow, she'll come to the theater to see the performance.

814
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,580
I'm going to see her.

815
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,580
I'll go with you.

816
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,580
I'll go with you.

817
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,580
I'll go with you.

818
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,580
I'll go with you.

819
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,580
You're asleep, right?

820
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,580
You've been out for a week.

821
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,580
You're dancing Bai Suzhen.

822
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,580
We should be very happy, right?

823
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,580
There are two reasons why we're not happy now.

824
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Sister Yun is injured.

825
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,580
You fell in love with Zhou Botong.

826
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,580
Right?

827
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,580
You're not happy.

828
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,580
You're not happy.

829
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,580
You're not happy.

830
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,580
You're not happy.

831
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,580
You're not happy.

832
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,580
You're not happy.

833
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,580
Let's go home.

834
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
You're happy to fall in love with Zhou Botong.

835
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,580
You're not happy to be injured by Sister Yun.

836
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,580
So we're still the same.

837
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,580
Let's solve Zhou Botong's problem now.

838
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,580
His name is Zhou Tong.

839
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,580
I'll call him Zhou Botong.

840
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
What are you doing to him?

841
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,580
What are you doing to him?

842
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,580
What?

843
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,580
He scolded me at home this morning.

844
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
You two are a team.

845
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,580
So you're apologizing to me.

846
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,580
Xiao Mi.

847
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,580
Why are you like this?

848
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,580
I can't apologize.

849
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,580
You're unreasonable.

850
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,580
Zhou Botong said I was bad.

851
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
I'm sorry.

852
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,580
No.

853
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,580
I didn't find him.

854
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,580
I'm sorry.

855
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,580
I'm sorry.

856
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,580
I'm sorry.

857
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,580
I'm sorry.

858
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,580
I'm sorry.

859
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,580
I'm sorry.

860
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,580
I'm sorry.

861
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,580
I'm sorry.

862
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,580
I'm sorry.

863
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,580
I'm sorry.

864
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,580
I'm sorry.

865
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,580
I'm sorry.

866
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,580
I'm sorry.

867
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,580
I'm sorry.

868
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,580
I'm sorry.

869
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,580
I'm sorry.

870
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,580
I'm sorry.

871
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,580
I'm sorry.

872
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,580
I'm sorry.

873
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,580
I'm sorry.

874
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,580
I'm sorry.

875
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,580
I'm sorry.

876
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,580
I'm sorry.

877
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,580
I'm sorry.

878
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,580
I'm sorry.

879
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,580
I'm sorry.

880
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,580
I'm sorry.

881
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,580
I'm sorry.

882
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,580
I'm sorry.

883
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,580
I'm sorry.

884
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,580
I'm sorry.

885
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,580
I'm sorry.

886
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,580
I'm sorry.

887
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,580
I'm sorry.

888
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,580
I'm sorry.

889
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,580
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

896
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,580
I'm sorry.

897
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,580
I'm sorry.

898
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,580
