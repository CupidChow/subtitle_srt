1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the hall.

2
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,040
I watch the butterflies dance with the wind.

3
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,040
I wait for the sunset to fill the grass.

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,440
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently.

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,160
I am lonely and lonely.

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,200
I go through ups and downs alone.

7
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,800
We are like a family.

8
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,040
We love each other like flowers.

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,600
We keep the beauty.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,040
We go through ups and downs alone.

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,040
We have been through ups and downs.

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,240
We know each other since childhood.

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,640
We are like a family.

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,440
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Episode 30

16
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,800
My name is Xu Tian.

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,960
I run the cheongsam shop with my mom.

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,760
I run it to help my mom run her legs.

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,280
My mom is beautiful.

20
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,400
Especially the way she wears cheongsam.

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,480
Dad.

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,280
Dad.

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,280
You have to go now.

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,640
Go.

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,000
Go.

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,600
She is still a marcher.

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,880
Her favorite is白蛇传.

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,360
She takes me to see the stars often.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,800
In fact, I often sleep while dancing.

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,040
Good.

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,800
Good.

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,760
Good.

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,160
Okay.

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,400
One more, please, Mr. Ma.

35
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,640
Okay.

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,400
Thank you.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,800
Here.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,040
Ready.

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,600
Be careful when you wash that photo.

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,560
Don't get it ruined.

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,600
Okay. Don't worry.

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,640
Oh, no.

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,320
I'm so nervous, Mr. Ma.

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,040
It's okay. It's okay.

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,760
Let me go.

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,400
Hurry.

47
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
I'll be right there.

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,400
That time on the backstage,

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,560
I saw Mr. Lan, the fake Su Zhen,

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,720
who played Bai Su Zhen.

51
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,080
He seemed to be in poor health.

52
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,200
That year,

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
my mom was ill, too.

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,160
It's been 18 years

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,480
since my mom passed away.

56
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,560
I come here every week.

57
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,720
Maybe this is

58
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,360
the closest place to my mom.

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,960
Mr. Ma.

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
It's clear.

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,080
Let's go.

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,200
It's sunny.

63
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,120
It's not sunny in the city.

64
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,080
What's up?

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,200
Many people came to the tower today?

66
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,760
More than 250 people came to the tower today.

67
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,560
Now there are no people in the building.

68
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,440
Brother 3.

69
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,120
Brother 3.

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,160
You always ask how many people are there.

71
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
But you don't go up to see them.

72
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,920
What do you mean?

73
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,800
There are many people, but the tower is heavy.

74
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,480
There are many people, but the tower is heavy.

75
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,120
It's heavy.

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,120
Who?

77
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,760
Hey, it's not true.

78
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,480
Do you really think that the white Su Zhen in the tower is real?

79
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,680
What's the fun?

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
It's just a fairy tale.

81
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,600
Do you take it seriously?

82
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,560
Come on, let's go.

83
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,160
Let's go.

84
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,680
Let's go.

85
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,360
The Su Zhen is clear.

86
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,600
Come on, let's go.

87
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,480
Hurry up.

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
The Su Zhen is clear.

89
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600

let me punish you.

144
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:37,640
Gen Niu,

145
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Lift the blocked door.

146
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Nichto van,

147
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
You're not doing business?

148
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
The weather is so bad, the monsters are coming out.

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Who said I'm doing business?

150
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
It's so dark.

151
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
It's only 2pm.

152
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,600
It's so dark.

153
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
It's so dark.

154
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Come here.

155
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Come here.

156
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Come here.

157
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Come here.

158
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Come here.

159
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Come here.

160
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Buddy.

161
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Who are you?

162
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Don't misunderstand, buddy.

163
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm a tourist.

164
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
You saw it too.

165
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
It's raining heavily outside today.

166
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm pouring water all over my shoes.

167
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
I saw the door of your house was open.

168
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
There was no one.

169
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I said I'd change into dry clothes and leave immediately.

170
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Don't worry, I didn't touch anything in your house.

171
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
You're a kind guest in Hangzhou.

172
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
You can't kick me out on this day, right?

173
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I'm not a good person.

174
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
I'm a good person.

175
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
You can't kick me out on this day, right?

176
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Buddy, buddy.

177
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm asking you.

178
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Are you the owner of this house?

179
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
How do you turn on the light?

180
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Wipe it.

181
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Thank you.

182
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Thank you.

183
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Thank you.

184
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Thank you.

185
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Thank you.

186
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Thank you.

187
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
The End

188
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Hurry up.

189
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Hurry up.

190
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
I think Gangsheng will be angry today.

191
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,600
He's not in a good mood these days.

192
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Anyway, he's not happy.

193
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,600
I almost didn't listen to Lin in the rehearsal the day before yesterday.

194
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
I can see it.

195
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Maybe I have to do it today.

196
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Thank you.

197
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,600
I don't want to practice.

198
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

199
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Xiao Ru, hurry up.

200
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
I'll go get it.

201
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,400
We're rehearsing.

202
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,600
I don't have time to rehearse.

203
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,000
Where's Yang Yun?

204
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't know.

205
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Aren't you two a couple?

206
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
I do think we're a couple.

207
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
You're Xu Xian and he's Bai Su Zhen.

208
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,800
You're not rehearsing together?

209
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,400
He's the god of the show, I'm the mortal.

210
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,200
He's been around for over a thousand years, I've been around for decades.

211
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,400
We rarely get together.

212
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,200
No need to talk.

213
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,600
That guy's got a sharp tongue.

214
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
Go get Yang Yun.

215
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,200
Go get him.

216
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I'll go get Yang Yun.

217
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,800
Second stage, the lake.

218
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Music, please.

219
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,800
Music, please.

220
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,600
Stop, stop, stop.

221
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,800
Qiao Min.

222
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Director.

223
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,200
You ate too much this morning.

224
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,600
Bai Su Zhen looks like Xu Xian from the lake.

225
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,200
They're not performing.

226
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,600
Yun doesn't know how to rehearse.

227
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,200
If he doesn't come, the troupe won't perform.

228
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
That's what I meant.

229
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,200
Or else we'll find someone to take Bai Su Zhen.

230
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,800
Or else Brother Yin will get sick.

231
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
Who's taking Bai Su Zhen?

232
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,400
It's not me.

233
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,200
I'm not taking him.

234
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,000
Bai Su Zhen.

235
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,200
I didn't find him.

236
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,000
Xiao Yao.

237
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,200
Tian.

238
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,600
I'll go.

239
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,200
Tian.

240
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
What's going on?

241
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
What's going on?

242
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,400
Last time,

243
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
you helped me introduce a girl.

244
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,200
Which one?

245
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,200
I only introduced one.

246
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,400
The one who's in charge of the data collection center and the backup.

247
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,200
Didn't you dislike that girl?

248
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Do you still have contact?

249
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,600
What do you want to do?

250
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,200
I want to see her again.

251
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,600
Your brain has finally started to work.

252
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,200
I want to ask her to help me.

253
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
Yesterday,

254
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,600
I left from your place.

255
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,200
After I went back,

256
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,600
I met a person

257
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,200
who's exactly like me.

258
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
You saw her, right?

259
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
You saw it too.

260
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Yesterday, the weather was very strange.

261
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,200
Then, the wind and rain stopped.

262
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
When the sun came out,

263
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,800
the person disappeared.

264
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,200
People won't disappear in the same place, right?

265
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,800
There's a camera at the entrance of my store.

266
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,200
There are two cameras at the entrance.

267
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,600
There's one here too.

268
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,000
Xu Tian.

269
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,200
You're always thinking about it.

270
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,800
Do you want it or not?

271
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,400
I just want to figure it out.

272
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Xu Tian.

273
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,200
Your mother left 20 years ago.

274
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,000
Stop thinking about it.

275
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
19 years.

276
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,800
You should hurry and get married.

277
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,000
Do you know that?

278
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,600
When you meet Dian Dian,

279
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
her name is Dian Dian.

280
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Look.

281
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
You even forgot her name.

282
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,800
Dian Dian is just like me.

283
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,600
I'll call her later.

284
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Call her now.

285
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
I'm here.

286
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Are you buying flowers?

287
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
You've been standing for almost five minutes.

288
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,400
I'm just looking at it.

289
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,200
Looking at what?

290
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,200
Flowers.

291
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Are you buying them or not?

292
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,800
You shouldn't cut it before selling it.

293
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,600
Cut the flowers from the branches.

294
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
You will separate a split in the wound.

295
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,000
After the customer buys it,

296
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,200
cut a 45-degree incision again.

297
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,400
Insert it into the water immediately.

298
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
It will take longer to keep it fresh.

299
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,800
I'll give you a cheaper price for this batch.

300
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
I don't need it. Thank you.

301
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
Hello, Dian Dian.

302
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,000
Little Grandpa.

303
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,800
Dian Dian,

304
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,000
the young man I introduced to you last time,

305
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
Xu Tian, do you still remember him?

306
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,600
He has a good impression of you.

307
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,200
Do you want to meet him?

308
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Who?

309
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,000
Xu Tian.

310
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,600
There's a phone call in your phone.

311
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,800
There must be no delete.

312
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I saved it for you.

313
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,000
Xu Tian?

314
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,600
That's right. Xu Tian.

315
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,400
Dian Dian, do you have any business the day after tomorrow?

316
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll make an appointment with you two, okay?

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,200
Okay.

318
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,600
I'll call you when the appointment is done.

319
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,200
Do you like flowers?

320
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,600
Yes.

321
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,400
Then will you buy it?

322
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I'll cry when I buy it.

323
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,000
Come here.

324
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,460
I was surprised, too.

325
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,500
But I've got to work in kinetic work.

326
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,900
So, I don't need any work for odd jobs,

327
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,260
except withManager Hu.

328
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,980
But I do need some work?

329
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,700
I should have the client smile

330
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,360
and friendly with her.

331
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,260
Can't I take over her job?

332
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Are you sure that he will die soon?

333
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,440
His life is on the line,

334
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,140
what else can we do beyond that line?

335
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,400
Since then,

336
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,400
people all want to gather goals.

337
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,120
Who would then decide on past events?

338
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,180
Right?

339
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,120
It's I,

340
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Jump.

341
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,120
What do you mean by moving one step forward?

342
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
You don't want the process anymore?

343
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Life is a turn-based cycle.

344
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
You don't want to go through it?

345
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
You're going to die if you're born?

346
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
You're going to die if you're born?

347
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
You want to jump the hand-to-hand?

348
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Yes.

349
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
But I'm not as good as Sister Yun.

350
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
What's good about her?

351
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Dancing has four levels.

352
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Basic skills can make you a dancer.

353
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
You can be full of inner strength and courage.

354
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
You can be a good dancer.

355
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
Love someone is loved by someone.

356
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,120
You can experience the bitterness and sweetness of love.

357
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,120
You can touch yourself and at the same time, you can also touch others.

358
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,120
You can finally experience separation and understand the world of harmony.

359
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Only then can you become a true artist.

360
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Then what level is Sister Yun in?

361
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Have you ever been in love?

362
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
No.

363
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
Nonsense.

364
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
It's too far.

365
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
A blank sheet.

366
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
I can work hard.

367
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
How do you work hard?

368
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
To fall in love.

369
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
With who?

370
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
You're so slow.

371
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
This is all your family's.

372
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Tangzhou isn't that noisy.

373
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
It's so wet.

374
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
You're in the water.

375
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
You little kid.

376
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
You said it's just the smell.

377
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Can you still wear it?

378
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Mom, can I discuss something?

379
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
In the future, if you keep being so straight and cold,

380
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
you can just leave the door open.

381
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
I don't believe you anymore.

382
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
You don't have to be too filial.

383
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Fine. I'll leave tomorrow.

384
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
I'll continue to leave tomorrow.

385
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Tomorrow, find a girlfriend and get married.

386
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Go wherever you want.

387
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Song Nuan, you're so annoying.

388
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
I'm not annoying.

389
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
I'm just being nice.

390
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
I'm just being nice.

391
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Where are you going?

392
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,120
It's really not that time, Song Nuan.

393
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
The tickets are booked.

394
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Then don't say filial piety.

395
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
No place for you.

396
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
It's all about feelings.

397
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
You're not looking for a job seriously.

398
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Why is there no job?

399
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
This is a job.

400
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
This job is so good!

401
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Take pictures and write games.

402
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
You left me being so low-key.

403
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,120
Your fans will play there for more than a million.

404
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Gosh!

405
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Is this taken by yourself?

406
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,400
I took it myself.

407
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,160
You took it yourself?

408
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,120
What?

409
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,360
So you have a partner when you go out?

410
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,920
Oh, is that so?

411
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,400
What kind of partner?

412
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
A man or a woman?

413
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,040
No, there's no woman.

414
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Is that a man?

415
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,200
No, there's no man.

416
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,240
I'm always alone. You know that.

417
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,640
What do you mean?

418
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,680
Look, isn't that you?

419
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,440
Oh, you took a picture of yourself?

420
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,000
Why are these photos in your camera?

421
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,760
Oh, my.

422
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,840
Mom, don't talk to me.

423
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,320
I'm a little dizzy.

424
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,640
Can you let me rest for a while?

425
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,960
Don't bother me.

426
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Dizzy?

427
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,160
It's a mistake.

428
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,960
I'll get you a thermometer.

429
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,680
It's weird.

430
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,120
Come on, open your mouth.

431
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Okay.

432
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,520
Sit down.

433
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,000
Look at you, you're over 20.

434
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,720
You're still single.

435
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,200
No, I'm not urging you to get married.

436
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,600
I just want you to find a girlfriend.

437
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,800
Okay?

438
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,200
Open your mouth.

439
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,720
I'll take the flight tomorrow.

440
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,920
Don't mess with me.

441
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,240
Don't go anywhere.

442
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,040
You have a fever of 39.1 degrees.

443
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,400
ؤ

444
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,800
Look.

445
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,040
39.1 tra��

446
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,040
Already prepared for fever?

447
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,000
You're crazy.

448
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,880
He's such a big shot.

449
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,840
We even buried the stone in the guitar box.

450
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,600
Polar Bear, you are awesome.

451
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,440
Qiao Min!

452
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Qiao Min!

453
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,840
What are you doing?

454
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,360
I'm going to play the violin.

455
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,000
What's this?

456
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,160
Wait a minute.

457
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,520
I didn't bring my guitar.

458
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,880
Tan...

459
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,760
What's wrong with you?

460
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,720
I'm more...

461
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,720
Big.

462
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,840
What are you doing?

463
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,000
What's wrong with you?

464
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,680
No.

465
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,520
Love?

466
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
If you don't write it down, you're afraid you can't make up your mind.

467
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,120
It's settled.

468
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,400
With who?

469
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,280
No one.

470
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,280
Don't come.

471
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,040
You haven't seen anyone for half a day.

472
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,000
Didn't you go to work this afternoon?

473
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,360
I danced to the white pine needle and was scolded by the steel aunt.

474
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,200
She said I had nothing in my heart,

475
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,040
and I didn't support you.

476
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,720
Who are you talking to?

477
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,560
Don't let my dad make you do it.

478
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,560
He's a social person.

479
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,400
Weumb appointed times.

480
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,520
Don't look at me.

481
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,120
So...

482
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,880
I wanted to say it fantastic.

483
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,440
I also didn't expect you to say it.

484
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,400
Small words or words to say.

485
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,200
But you don't understand me.

486
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,560
I'm having a nooooile.

487
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,960
We'll get huge benefits out of it.

488
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,360
What room?

489
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,960
By the way,

490
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,040
find a teacher for Xiaoyao.

491
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,080
A man.

492
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,920
He's willing to let her date.

493
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
Date?

494
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,640
What do you think your dad is doing?

495
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,760
Where should I find him?

496
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,080
Experience life.

497
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,440
It's been a few days.

498
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,400
I...

499
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,320
Can I find him?

500
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,360
You won't?

501
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,320
If you don't,

502
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,200
I'll take Xiaoyao to the police.

503
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,920
You're threatening me.

504
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,880
Come.

505
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,120
You see it?

506
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,880
A real strong man.

507
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,080
This is going well.

508
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,040
Yes.

509
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,840
Experience life.

510
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,800
Okay.

511
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,460
don't have to play it down?

512
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,740
This matter does'nt come easily.

513
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,480
I do not have the breaks to write it down.

514
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,840
No way you couldn't write it down on this?

515
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,500
It is very difficult to write..

516
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,300
So her的就把我谋明了

517
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,900
Why do you have to look for me?

518
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,900
You're a social person, you're also a person.

519
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,300
What impression did I leave you with?

520
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,500
Do you have any?

521
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,700
Yes, of course.

522
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,500
A blank paper, don't want to fall in love.

523
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
I knew it.

524
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,100
You have a lot of girls around you.

525
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,100
Don't misunderstand.

526
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
Hello?

527
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,300
Who is Uncle Wei arranging for me?

528
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,900
You're too anxious.

529
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,500
What if you run into someone who's a mess?

530
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Why do you think so much?

531
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,100
You have to make him like you.

532
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,300
Of course you have to like him.

533
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,300
The tea is still hot.

534
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,700
The leaves are full of sky.

535
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,900
Love shouldn't...

536
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,500
Brother.

537
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Brother Tong, wait for me. I'll get something.

538
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,700
What?

539
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,500
What are you doing?

540
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
It's the holiday?

541
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,900
I'm here to see Mr. Song off.

542
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,900
If you're going to see him off,

543
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,100
why don't you just drop him off?

544
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,300
Why give it to me?

545
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,700
It's heavy.

546
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,300
Are you sick?

547
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
I'm a little sick.

548
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,100
I have a fever.

549
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,100
Let's go.

550
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,100
Mr. Song.

551
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,900
Where did you get the fruit?

552
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,100
From the department store.

553
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,300
You haven't paid rent for four months.

554
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,500
You only know to give fruit.

555
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,300
The fruit is not cheap either.

556
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,900
What is this?

557
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,100
I bought some medicine.

558
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,700
I'm going to buy a thermometer.

559
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,700
They always say I have a fever.

560
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,700
I don't feel anything.

561
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,900
I guess our thermometer is definitely not good.

562
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,100
You can't eat this medicine.

563
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,700
How can you feel the fever?

564
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,900
I'm not dizzy either.

565
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,700
I think you're just a little dizzy.

566
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
Here. The thermometer is new.

567
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,100
You can use it after you wash it.

568
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,300
I'll give it to you later.

569
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,700
Okay.

570
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Here.

571
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,900
Here. Drink it.

572
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,700
No, Mom.

573
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,700
I have a cold.

574
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,700
I'll be fine after I take it.

575
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,900
I'll change the air ticket tomorrow.

576
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,500
Here.

577
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,900
Mr. Zhang.

578
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,700
Sit down.

579
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,700
I've said everything I said yesterday for nothing.

580
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,300
You don't worry about anything.

581
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,700
What am I worried about?

582
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,900
It's 9.30 a.m. tomorrow.

583
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,300
Guangping Pavilion.

584
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,300
What are you doing?

585
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,900
The girl has already made an appointment with you.

586
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,500
It's time to go.

587
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,900
Really?

588
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,500
I can't change the air ticket.

589
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
It's too late.

590
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,100
It's past 2 p.m.

591
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,100
Mr. Sun.

592
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,900
What problem can I have?

593
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,100
You're just a little bit of a genius.

594
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,500
There are three things that don't work.

595
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,100
You're still not married.

596
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,700
You're still being reasonable.

597
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,100
Here. Open your mouth.

598
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,700
Here.

599
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,900
It's 41 degrees.

600
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,300
You can't.

601
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,500
Huh?

602
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,300
The thermometer is broken?

603
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,700
You have to believe in science.

604
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,500
Drink it.

605
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
No.

606
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,900
It's 9.30 a.m. tomorrow.

607
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,700
What?

608
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,900
A blind date.

609
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:12,100
Didn't you ask me to arrange a man for you to fall in love?

610
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,500
A boss of an overbearing female president.

611
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,900
With culture.

612
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,100
A top-class man.

613
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,900
She agreed to meet me because she believed in me.

614
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,500
But don't take it too lightly.

615
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,100
You said you wanted to experience life.

616
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,900
It will hurt the heart of the young master.

617
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,500
It will also affect my business.

618
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,300
What will affect your business?

619
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,700
Do I need to report it to you?

620
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,500
There's a subway station ahead.

621
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,900
There really is?

622
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,300
Yes.

623
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,700
Let Dad ask Mr. Song for a photo.

624
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,900
What if it looks ugly?

625
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,500
Guess what it will look like.

626
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,700
Brother.

627
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Brother Tong.

628
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,100
Slow down, Brother Tong.

629
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,700
You're so loud.

630
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,700
Brother Tong.

631
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,100
You're so good.

632
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,100
You got up so early.

633
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,900
Why did you squat?

634
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
You almost fell down.

635
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,700
No.

636
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,300
Check the steel and wood twice.

637
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,300
What time is it?

638
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,700
There's no one on the stage.

639
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,100
To be honest, Brother Tong.

640
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,900
I really didn't come to the sound.

641
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,900
I met someone.

642
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,100
I came to pay you a visit.

643
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,300
Visit me?

644
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,900
You're here?

645
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,900
I'm tired.

646
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,900
I'll go get some tea.

647
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,500
Okay, thank you.

648
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,900
What's the proof?

649
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,500
I lied to him.

650
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,900
Or he would have to fly to Malaysia this afternoon.

651
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,300
You sent my son's photo to that girl.

652
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,900
Or I don't even know who it is.

653
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,900
He's the only one down there.

654
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,100
You sent him a photo too?

655
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,100
I'm worried he can't sit still.

656
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,700
He'll leave after he finds a place to stay.

657
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,900
I'll go.

658
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,700
Tea.

659
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,500
Thank you.

660
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,300
You're welcome.

661
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,300
Help yourself.

662
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,300
You're welcome.

663
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,500
It's you.

664
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,500
See?

665
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,900
Love officially begins.

666
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,600
Now with you in mind forever.

667
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,700
In thepants.

668
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:50,200
Was it

669
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Here's the photo.

670
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Look.

671
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Where is it?

672
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
It's not bad.

673
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,200
You're not that bad. It's not a performance.

674
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
I have more than a few photos.

675
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
This one.

676
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
This girl?

677
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,200
She's like a fairy.

678
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
She's really good.

679
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
Whether she's a fairy or not,

680
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,200
she's not as good as you in my eyes.

681
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
What do you mean?

682
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
What do I mean?

683
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
When I was young,

684
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,200
I always wanted to be in the heaven and love the fairy.

685
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
But now,

686
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
I'm a little bit old.

687
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,200
I only like the blind now.

688
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Who's the blind?

689
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
You.

690
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
In my heart,

691
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
you're the big blind.

692
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Just like the old woman.

693
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Enough. Stop it.

694
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Send me the photos.

695
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
I'll send them to my son.

696
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Okay. Let's go.

697
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,200
I told you I'll wait for you outside.

698
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
I've experienced it too.

699
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
I've been with you for a thousand years.

700
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,200
But you changed your mind and went out with someone.

701
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,200
I experienced life.

702
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
We experienced it together.

703
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
We have the same goal.

704
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
We must be the best.

705
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,200
We must be the best.

706
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,200
Come on.

707
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
The color of the sunset

708
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,200
always makes me want to chase it.

709
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,200
We've become a little different.

710
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,200
We've lost our direction.

711
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:41,200
We've been running in the path of love.

712
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,200
We don't need to write down the wind and waves.

713
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:54,200
Remember you have the look of my love.

714
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,200
We run forward together.

715
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,200
We've been running in the same path for a lifetime.

716
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,200
We don't fear that time will pass.

717
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,200
The real us

718
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,200
has been since we met.

719
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Accept everything you have.

720
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,200
No matter how many times we hold hands, it's okay.

721
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,200
We can reach the faraway place.

722
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,200
Don't be wronged and force yourself.

723
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:04,200
We've been running in the path of love.

724
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,200
We don't fear that time will pass.
