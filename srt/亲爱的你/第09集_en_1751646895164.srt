YoYo English Channel YouTube

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the hall

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When the sun is full of grass

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I write my feelings into songs

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Sing gently

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Loneliness

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Four seasons, repeated

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Accompanying is the return home

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Four flowers are like the morning fog

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Leave the beauty

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Wind and rain

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Walk through the ups and downs

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Time is slow

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
From childhood to the next

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
May you and me be together

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hungry?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why are you so hungry?

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not hungry

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Just the right place

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's okay

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll make some at home later

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I will make fried bamboo shoots with sesame seeds

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
When will I make it for you?

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Tomorrow, tomorrow I will make it at home

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You said it

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Today we will make everything well

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No more monitoring

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The police station gave me two tickets

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was going to Beijing

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I threw it away now

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We are clear

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Start from the beginning, okay?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hello, my name is Shi Dian Dian

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
28 years old this year

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Shaoxing people

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I like you

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Me too

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What is it too?

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Say it seriously

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hello, my name is Xu Tian

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There is a house in the children's alley

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Make cheongsam custom

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Business is still good

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A little savings

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Health

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yearly physical examination

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If you like me

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I dare not guarantee the future

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The life is big

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But what can be sure of you

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It will be very stable

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What I want is stability

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I won't say good words

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I won't say those very nice words

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But I know

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
As long as you are good to me

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have to be good to you

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There are returns and returns

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's not

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Do you like me

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
like

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Like that

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How to say this

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You have to say

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Otherwise i'm worried

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Just like

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Xu Xian likes Bai Su Zhen

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a bit like

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Xu Xian is a wood

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It was also the white lady who liked him first

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What if one day I change

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Change

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Bai Su Zhen became a white snake

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I scared Xu Xian half to death

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What are you going to be

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I said

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What I said

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Will count for the rest of my life

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No matter how you change

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I won't change

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Change another pose

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Put my dress on

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Take a picture for me

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Are you mine now

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Are you beautiful

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Must be

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Then I am now

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Start to exercise my rights

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Can it

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What rights

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You just saw that woman

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I didn't

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Look at the one in the dress

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I did

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But she is from my eyes

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Go

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't look at it casually in the future

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Because you are mine

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
it is good

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Go to Chun K

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Can you be healthy

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What is this

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I am 23 years old

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
25 years old

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What

00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Jump to the chief

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
King of dance who wants to meet the north and south of the Great Jiang

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I have also won awards

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's also a good thing to be able to meet the international

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Jump to the chief

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Steadily

118

Jumped for ten years

Change the script

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Chief and artist

Raised Yang Yun and Yin Ye

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Two apprentices

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Also brought out

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Xiao Ming and Xiao Yao

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
A group of apprentices

All over the country

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Life has reached the top

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You opened me

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
A few days ago you told me

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You are in love with Song Guan Wang

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Now there is a breakup

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is all the process

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There is a breakup, there must be a breakup

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There is cause and effect

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Life flowers bloom and fall

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Nature winds and rains

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There must be a cup of happiness

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The so-called sadness is the real life

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Do you understand

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Your life is too smooth

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Hit me and you will start to fall in love

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
By the time I am 36 years old

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Chang Ying went to France far away

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
One word is not anti

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you opening me

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What's good about Song Guang Guang

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I feel fake when you are here

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
wisdom

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I didn't know when I was young

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Just pay attention to the outside

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Not shallow

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He is wisdom

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Fanta, my order

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't listen here

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I still look for him

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Who else can I find him

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I am also a person

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You are self-hyping

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Pour wine, pour wine, drink wine

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Drink wine

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Drink wine

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You really treat me as a waiter

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Who is not a person

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't be a night owl

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Don't be a night owl

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You put it here

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Keep it well

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Drink wine, drink wine, drink wine

171
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Drink wine, drink wine, drink wine

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I am not happy

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Very miserable

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't step on it, it's embarrassing

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Xiao Yang is in love

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I am a man, I am a man

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I am a man

178
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Brother Rui, I have something to do later

179
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I will go first

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Where to go, what's the matter

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I just have two words

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Don't waste your time

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
First of all, I want to say sorry to you

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Actually, I didn't want to date at all

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Really

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
When I first met you

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Didn't I tell you

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What to say

189
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
My mom forced me to date you

190
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Actually meet you

191
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I just want to give her a smile

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm sorry

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Originally

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I have arranged a six-day life

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But I think

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If it goes on like this

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm not at ease

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And you have to perform

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I have to go

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And you have to perform

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let's go

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's it

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't know

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't know

205
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I just see your eyes

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You are really waiting

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
There are two days left

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Not practicing

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Extreme survival

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Big final

211
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I still want to go to the big final

212
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Go

213
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Forget it

214
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's good to stop here

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Thank you

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Xiao Yang

217
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Xiao Yang

218
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Xiao Yang

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What's the situation, Xiao Yang

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,560
When All Editor

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What should I do

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I can't do it

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:28,880
Why is grown-up

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,520
You don't have a car

227
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,920
Why are you here

228
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,080
Xiao Yuan

229
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,800
You don't talk

230
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
No, we don't do this

231
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,680
Not necessarily

232
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,480
I didn't just say it

233
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,920
Let's have a coffee and review

234
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,520
Pretend to have just met

235
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,320
You can reply to me on WeChat

236
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,000
Ok ok

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,800
There are WeChat evidences

238
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,880
Let's not turn our faces

239
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,160
And again

240
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,640
When we first met in the tea garden

241
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm not just chatting with you

242
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,560
Don't be angry

243
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Zhou Tong

244
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,080
Are you serious

245
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,880
I didn't

246
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,040
I

247
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,920
What's wrong

248
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,560
How many times have we met

249
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,800
Not many times

250
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,120
I am an actor and a dancer

251
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,560
Why are we together

252
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,720
You

253
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,680
Experience life

254
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,160
Now Bai Su Zhen must decide me

255
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,600
Thank you

256
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,880
I want to rehearse these two days

257
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,600
Are you here to see the first show

258
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
I

259
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,840
I

260
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,400
I'll leave you and aunt two tickets

261
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,240
If you can take a picture

262
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Send it to me, okay

263
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,760
Damn

264
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,800
you

265
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,720
I

266
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,600
Are you serious

267
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,280
One hug is one hug

268
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,880
You scared me to death

269
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm really serious

270
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,960
Who just scared me first

271
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,120
Ok

272
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,880
What are you going to eat with me

273
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,760
I'm blocking the way

274
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,640
Big bill

275
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
It's okay

276
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,440
Then you can only go home with me

277
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,720
Song Song's cooking

278
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
One shot

279
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,360
I should cook for aunt

280
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,200
Really

281
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,080
Really, what does she like

282
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,960
Fried rice cake with sesame seeds

283
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,560
Hangzhou

284
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,640
Can you

285
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,880
But i know

286
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,440
Is it a big show tomorrow

287
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,600
Have you been

288
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,520
Don't go

289
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,640
The rehearsal is over and go to your house directly

290
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,360
I love you

291
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,080
Really

292
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,880
You are serious

293
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,800
Really

294
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
What you say in the future

295
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,920
I'm serious

296
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
I am too

297
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,160
Everyone is relieved like this, right

298
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,440
Yes, there is one thing

299
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,320
Don't talk nonsense

300
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,800
I can't stand it

301
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,880
Bow to the dock

302
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,320
Dock

303
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,480
Xiaomi

304
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,320
If he doesn't recognize you

305
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,440
You have to go out

306
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
Then I have to please him

307
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
What's the matter

308
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
What to do

309
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,400
The atmosphere is a bit awkward

310
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,240
Are you sending the official forget

311
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,200
I won't send it long ago

312
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,920
Let's stop talking

313
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Come out

314
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,400
Xiao Emma keeps coming to your side

315
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,000
Don't hide from me

316
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,280
Why don't you meet

317
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,880
I'm not going to meet you

318
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,960
I'm not going to meet you

319
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
I'm not going to meet you

320
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
I'm not going to meet you

321
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
I'm not going to meet you

322
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
I'm not going to meet you

323
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,200
Where to eat

324
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,080
Go quickly

325
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,240
Don't be late

326
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,600
I drank too much

327
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,920
What should I do if I can't drive

328
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,360
Keep drinking

329
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,720
Why are you so polite to me

330
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,120
Do you understand me

331
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,400
Loneliness

332
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,400
After reading this

333
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,880
You will find a lot of her

334
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,120
Just like today

335
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,880
I will

336
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,640
See you

337
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,760
Beautiful

338
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,520
get in the car

339
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,040
You're crazy.

340
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,680
You're too loud.

341
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,560
Why are you here?

342
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,920
I went to your entertainment group.

343
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,520
A guy from the game hall downstairs told me you were there.

344
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,920
He's a girl, why are you looking at him like a man?

345
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,680
What's with the look?

346
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,200
Impossible.

347
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,240
Fine. You'll know when you're back at work.

348
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,880
How many times a week? One or two?

349
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,560
I haven't decided yet.

350
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,080
Is your leg better?

351
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,480
The medicine is good.

352
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,280
Not that bad.

353
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,840
It doesn't hurt that much.

354
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,080
Let's talk about Old Qiao.

355
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,160
Old Qiao? How can I talk about him?

356
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
What's wrong with him?

357
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,040
You rejected him in front of a girl.

358
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,440
He's a man.

359
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,520
I'm just dizzy and confused.

360
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,560
He's already like that.

361
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,560
I'm just a cold-blooded woman.

362
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,000
I can't be responsible if I'm not.

363
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Besides, he's an old man.

364
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,880
He can't handle this.

365
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,240
It's fine.

366
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,880
Old Qiao always says you have wisdom.

367
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,120
How can I not see it?

368
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,240
Wisdom is hidden in the hearts of the people.

369
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
It's not something that everyone can see.

370
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,680
You're quite happy.

371
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm happy.

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,560
If you're not happy, you can hang it on your face.

373
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,360
Is this dancing?

374
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,880
How long have you not been happy?

375
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,600
When you were young, you were a prince.

376
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,400
You should leave the work of a high-tech man to the young.

377
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,800
Now, you should lower your salary

378
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,840
and do something that's natural.

379
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,280
Nature is a wind and rain cycle.

380
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,720
The flowers bloom and fall.

381
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,800
If you're happy, you'll...

382
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,600
Go to the square dance.

383
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
You'll be happy.

384
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,920
What are you doing?

385
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,480
Keep complimenting Old Qiao.

386
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,160
Don't forget to apply the ointment.

387
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,560
Why is伊ве all south of the mall?

388
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,640
I have something important to tell Zhou Kai.

389
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,080
100,000.

390
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,520
Hello, Chief repent.

391
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,920
Hello.

392
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,520
Are you really entering my business?

393
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,920
I didn't give it much thought.

394
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,680
I'm interested in what you want to do.

395
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,520
What do you mean?

396
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,520
One is to rob my dad, one is to rob my Xiaoyao.

397
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Play a game with me.

398
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
My name is Xi.

399
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Xi?

400
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Xi from a drama.

401
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
One character.

402
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
What about you?

403
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
My name is Qiao Mi.

404
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
I'm an actress.

405
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
I'm not going.

406
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
What's wrong?

407
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Nothing.

408
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,520
My mom, you're still in the square dance.

409
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
You haven't finished dancing.

410
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
I'll cook for auntie tomorrow.

411
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Okay.

412
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
But you haven't eaten anything yet.

413
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
I won't eat.

414
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
You're not eating.

415
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,520
You're not with Qiao Mi every day.

416
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
You're so annoying.

417
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
I'm not going in.

418
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
Zhou Butong?

420
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
What's that?

421
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
What Butong?

422
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Do you know who I am?

423
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
I don't know.

424
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
I'm Qiao Mi.

425
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
The toilet.

426
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
I know.

427
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
What do you know?

428
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Go.

429
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
What's going on?

430
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Let's go.

431
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Let's go.

432
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
Hello.

433
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Where are you?

434
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
My phone is here.

435
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Tong.

436
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
Are you going to eat or pack?

437
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Eat or not?

438
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Eat.

439
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Eat.

440
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Okay.

441
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
What did you call me?

442
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Zhou Butong.

443
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Zhou Butong.

444
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Why did you call me Zhou Butong?

445
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
It's okay.

446
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
I'm happy.

447
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
I'm happy.

448
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
I'm happy.

449
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Let's eat.

450
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Not eat at all.

451
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
What do you want to eat?

452
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
I don't eat.

453
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
I have a rehearsal tomorrow.

454
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
10 o'clock.

455
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
Sister.

456
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Why do I smell you like you're drunk?

457
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Why didn't I smell it?

458
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
I didn't drink.

459
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
It's okay.

460
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
It doesn't matter.

461
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Are you nervous?

462
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,520
To be honest, I'm very nervous.

463
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Xiao Yao told me that I have to pass this level with her.

464
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
You two have already gone back and forth.

465
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
What did she say?

466
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,520
The horse head.

467
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
The horse head is me.

468
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
I know.

469
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
She also told me that she would never leave you.

470
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,520
If you don't like me, I have to go out.

471
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,520
So you have to please me.

472
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Please, please.

473
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
You must please me.

474
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
I'll sing a song for you.

475
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
Listen carefully.

476
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
The peach tree is on the shoulder.

477
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
I can't hear this.

478
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Then I'll give you a gift.

479
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
You tell me who you like.

480
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Right.

481
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
I'm here to see Aunt Song today.

482
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
I'm looking for your mother.

483
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,520
Take your time.

484
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Xiao Mi.

485
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
This.

486
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Okay, thank you.

487
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
Sit here.

488
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
Sit here.

489
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
We are partners.

490
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
I like Xiao Yao.

491
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
I like her.

492
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
It's okay to pass this level.

493
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,520
But we have to respect the elders.

494
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
We have to be polite.

495
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
No big no small.

496
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Ridiculous.

497
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Whose is it?

498
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,520
In terms of age, you have to tell me what age.

499
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
In terms of generation, after you get it right.

500
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
You have to write it for me.

501
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
You don't have to pass this level.

502
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,520
Just sit here and face me.

503
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
No, you face me.

504
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Face me accurately.

505
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
Where is he?

506
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
There.

507
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Thank you.

508
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Didn't you say you were going to school?

509
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
Yes.

510
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
I'm going now.

511
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
I keep going, I keep going.

512
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
I keep going until the end of my life.

513
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
Who's the end of life?

514
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
I'm the end of life.

515
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
You didn't count at first.

516
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
I'm the end of life.

517
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
I'm the end of life.

518
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
I'm the end of life.

519
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
I'm the end of life.

520
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,520
I'm the end of life.

521
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
We both didn't count.

522
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
How do you know he didn't count?

523
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
You, you, you don't scare me.

524
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Don't scare me.

525
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Don't test me.

526
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Come on, my uncle's clothes are exposed.

527
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
I'm sorry, I don't have clothes.

528
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
I'm telling you the truth.

529
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,520
I'm a sincere and honest little girl.

530
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
There should be a process.

531
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
It's been a few days, I can't say it.

532
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
You can say it and there is a process.

533
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
It's very short.

534
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
You understand it at once.

535
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
The first time, Guangming Pavilion.

536
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
He sits here and I sit here.

537
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,520
He owes me a glass of wine and I'm all drunk.

538
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,520
One love at first sight, just these two cups.

539
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
How did you pour the wine?

540
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,520
I can't explain it to you in one sentence.

541
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Pour a wine, can you pour it?

542
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Why can't I pour it?

543
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,520
So cute, everyone is cute.

544
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
One foot on the stool.

545
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,520
White and bright, the immortal guide.

546
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
You know what?

547
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Everyone is cute.

548
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
You can make us a martial arts.

549
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
I don't mean it.

550
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Anyway, I can't explain it to you in one sentence.

551
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
He is very professional.

552
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Ordinary people can't come.

553
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Pouring wine, right?

554
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Are you crazy?

555
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
Slow down, slow down.

556
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
It's okay.

557
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
You are a showman, you are a showman.

558
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
I drank it, why don't you drink it?

559
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Do you want to drink it?

560
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,520
Do you want to drink it?

561
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,520
I tell you.

562
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
I tell you.

563
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
What are you so stupid?

564
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
I drink it, you don't drink it.

565
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
I didn't let her drink it.

566
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
It's okay, she drinks it herself.

567
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
You said you wanted to shake your head.

568
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
You don't drink it.

569
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
Don't come over.

570
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
I don't need you to come over.

571
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
Don't come over.

572
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Don't come over.

573
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
I don't want to drink it.

574
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
I don't want to drink it.

575
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
What time is it?

576
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
Are you crazy?

577
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Tomorrow is the rehearsal.

578
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
I'm sorry for Mr. Gang.

579
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
I'm sorry for Xiao Qing too.

580
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,520
You are coming down.

581
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Good night.

582
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,520
I am reasonable.

583
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
I am reasonable.

584
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
But I feel bad.

585
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
Can you not feel bad when you are so old?

586
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Today is the 15th.

587
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
You only know the 10th.

588
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
It's obviously a practice.

589
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
I owe it.

590
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
It's hard to predict the future.

591
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,520
It's too dangerous.

592
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
It's already the 16th.

593
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
It's only a little more than one o'clock.

594
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Only six days.

595
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
How can you be happy?

596
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
Let me call him brother-in-law.

597
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
You just say.

598
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
You are a big fool at the end of the week.

599
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
I'm practicing with you.

600
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,520
I told you several times.

601
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
You don't believe me.

602
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
Goodbye.

603
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,520
I'm dancing on Bai Su Zhen.

604
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
Thank you for your cooperation.

605
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
I can't dance on Bai Su Zhen.

606
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
I feel bad when you say that.

607
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
I can't hold it anymore.

608
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
Go to bed early.

609
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,920
You go to bed early.

610
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,520
Bye-bye.

611
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
OK.

612
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,520
Safe trip.

613
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
OK.

614
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,520
The cross road isFE, F,ZH and TT ribs are Doctors' Style.

615
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
Have good night's sleep.

616
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
Why do you have F,ZH?

617
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,520
F,ZH is followers ofederd Bur insects themselves,

618
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Which only known it's a part of the B�ju project.

619
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,720
You're like Bai Suzhen.

620
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,200
Goodbye.

621
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,720
Thank you for your cooperation.

622
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,280
You're angry?

623
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,960
Let's sleep

624
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,300
PLACE OF noand

625
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,580
Grandpa,

626
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,500
when is the burly shop

627
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,780
This is the sun coming out from the west.

628
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,280
You still want to buy your own food?

629
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,280
It's from last week.

630
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,480
Is it not fresh?

631
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,480
This bamboo is well-cooked.

632
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,580
You can eat it after you open the front page.

633
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,280
Then forget it. I'll go to the supermarket.

634
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Ding Ding, don't go to the supermarket first.

635
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
What's going on?

636
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,880
Xu Tian is mine. I'll cook for him.

637
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,480
Xu Tian agreed?

638
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,280
There are bamboo shoots and silk.

639
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,280
No, I mean he's yours. He agreed.

640
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
How did he say it?

641
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,480
He's been good to me all his life.

642
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,280
From today on, he won't think about anything.

643
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
It's settled.

644
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Ding Ding,

645
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
isn't it too soon?

646
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,280
I want to listen to Xu Tian.

647
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,680
You're not me.

648
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,280
How could he tell you?

649
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,680
Ding Ding,

650
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
you're different from before.

651
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,280
Of course.

652
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,480
It's really different.

653
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
It's still different.

654
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
It's really different.

655
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
There's someone who's mine.

656
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,880
He is.

657
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,280
Good night.

658
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Good night.

659
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Terrific!

660
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Do you know the past已?

661
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
I'm here.

662
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I'm here just in time.

663
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
I didn't want to call you.

664
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
I came to eat dinner at home.

665
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
You and I have a little bit left.

666
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
I wanted to make a fish,

667
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
but now I want to be free.

668
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
Be free?

669
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
How can you be a fox?

670
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
I'm not a fox.

671
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
I'm a man.

672
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
I'm a man.

673
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
I'm a man.

674
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Dian Dian said you're his man.

675
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,280
Not really.

676
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
We're officially dating now.

677
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Is it too late to let go now?

678
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,280
You mean the fish or me?

679
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
You and Dian Dian are each other's husband.

680
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Why?

681
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Let's talk inside.

682
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
Let's talk inside.

683
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
Do you want to buy flowers?

684
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,280
Let's see.

685
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,280
You want money to buy flowers?

686
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,280
You want money to take me home?

687
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
당신

688
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
What's the matter?

689
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,240
Thank you.

690
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,720
Deng Deng

691
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,280
has been different from others since childhood.

692
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,200
She kept the things she wanted.

693
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,520
She was sad when she saw the business.

694
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,000
She never saw the exhibition or museum

695
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,520
when she was in school.

696
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,360
She didn't even go to the store.

697
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,400
She only had a cup and a dress.

698
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,280
She was so reluctant to throw them away.

699
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,680
She graduated from the university at the age of 25

700
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,200
and worked at Ningbo.

701
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,520
Then she had a wrong partner.

702
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,240
Dian Dian was very lucky.

703
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,440
She treated him

704
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,440
as her roommate.

705
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,480
They argued every day.

706
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,560
Then he couldn't stand it anymore.

707
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,440
He ran away.

708
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,360
Guess what happened to Dian Dian.

709
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:01,920
What happened?

710
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,880
She went home and slept.

711
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,880
The next day,

712
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,600
she was like nothing happened.

713
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,840
She didn't remember anything.

714
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,680
At first, everyone thought she was pretending.

715
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,880
But later,

716
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,600
her colleague from Ningbo came to see her.

717
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,000
She didn't recognize her either.

718
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,600
But everyone in that year

719
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,360
who had something to do with her

720
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,000
couldn't remember her.

721
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,160
I'm telling you. Are you listening?

722
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,040
Yes.

723
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,000
I'll go find Dian Dian.

724
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,560
Listen to me.

725
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,080
We're relatives.

726
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
But I just wanted to

727
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,720
get to know you.

728
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,560
I need to take the responsibility.

729
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,120
Then her mom

730
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,680
tried to send her from Ningbo

731
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,000
to Hangzhou,

732
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,600
to work in this department.

733
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,560
In the first half of the year,

734
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,560
you were taking her to see a psychiatrist.

735
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,040
The doctor said

736
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,080
she was

737
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,960
mentally injured

738
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,400
and had a stage fright.

739
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,240
You know?

740
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,000
I always say

741
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,760
to forget the unhappy things

742
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,040
is based on science.

743
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,680
The doctor said

744
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,880
she was not

745
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,320
a physical injury.

746
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,680
She won't be cured.

747
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,560
Didn't you take her

748
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,160
to see a psychiatrist for six months?

749
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,800
The doctor prescribed

750
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,040
a lot of nutritional drugs.

751
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:09,960
Dian Dian

752
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,200
was also actively

753
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,080
cooperating with the treatment.

754
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,640
In fact,

755
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,480
Dian Dian is back.

756
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,640
She just didn't admit it

757
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,840
and fell in love that year.

758
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,520
You know?

759
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,080
There's nothing we can do.

760
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,680
Dian Dian's illness

761
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,600
has been left behind since she was a child.

762
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,400
When she was nine years old,

763
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,400
her mother said she was gone.

764
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,720
She just disappeared.

765
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,880
Her mother is gone?

766
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,040
She's gone.

767
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,880
Poor thing.

768
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,520
When she was taken out of the hospital,

769
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,120
she was taken to the fire station

770
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
and was burned to death.

771
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,240
Dian Dian locked herself

772
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,680
in her mother's room.

773
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,440
She refused to come out.

774
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,560
Her mother is her stepmother.

775
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
We are relatives.

776
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,320
She is very nice.

777
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,320
She is young and pretty.

778
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,240
Think about it.

779
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,120
A nine-year-old child

780
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,720
can't stand

781
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,480
her stepmother's life.

782
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
She's gone.

783
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,280
Right?

784
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,680
At that time, she...

785
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,960
You are a man.

786
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,400
She is a woman.

787
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,080
At that time, her mother's room

788
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,520
had a big bottle of flowers.

789
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,840
She was staring at the sky

790
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,960
for nine days.

791
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,040
She stared at the sky for nine days.

792
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,800
She even threw a bottle of flowers

793
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,840
at you.

794
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,720
But after that,

795
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,560
Dian Dian

796
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,720
feels less and less safe.

797
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,560
The sky you looked at

798
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,120
always looked like

799
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,880
the color I wanted to chase.

800
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,760
We have changed

801
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,640
a little bit.

802
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,640
We have lost our direction.

803
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,560
We are on the road of love,

804
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,240
but we have to go through a long journey.

805
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,920
It turns out that

806
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,320
we don't need to write down the wind and waves.

807
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,720
I remember you

808
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,400
and the way I love you.

809
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,000
We run forward together.

810
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,040
We will return to the same place

811
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,760
for the rest of our lives.

812
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,720
Take the time

813
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,180
to 好好

814
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:22,480
他

815
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,760
We will be together

816
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,100
as a pair of lovers

817
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:24,760
Yi a

818
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,240
this

819
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,240
I'm sorry.

820
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,240
I'm sorry.

821
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,240
I'm sorry.

822
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
I'm sorry.

823
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,240
I'm sorry.

824
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
I'm sorry.

825
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,240
I'm sorry.

826
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,240
I'm sorry.

827
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
I'm sorry.

828
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,240
I'm sorry.

829
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,240
I'm sorry.

830
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,240
I'm sorry.

831
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,240
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
I'm sorry.

833
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,240
I'm sorry.

834
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
I'm sorry.

835
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
I'm sorry.

836
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,240
I'm sorry.

837
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,240
I'm sorry.

838
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
I'm sorry.

839
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,240
I'm sorry.

840
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,240
I'm sorry.

841
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,240
I'm sorry.

842
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,240
I'm sorry.

843
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
I'm sorry.

844
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
I'm sorry.

845
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,240
I'm sorry.

846
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,240
I'm sorry.

847
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,240
I'm sorry.

848
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,240
I'm sorry.

849
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,240
I'm sorry.

850
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
I'm sorry.

851
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,240
I'm sorry.

852
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
I'm sorry.

853
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
I'm sorry.

854
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,240
I'm sorry.

855
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,240
I'm sorry.

856
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,240
I'm sorry.

857

I'm sorry.

868
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
I'm sorry.

869
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,240
