YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the hall

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When the sun is full of grass

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I write my heart into a song

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Sing gently

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Loneliness

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Four seasons, repeated

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Accompanying is the return

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Four flowers are like the morning fog

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Leave the beauty

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Wind and rain

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Walk through the ups and downs

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Time is full

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
From childhood to the next

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
May you and me be together

Episode 16

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sorry, no need to return the money.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This year,

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He was much more cheerful than before.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But just arrived at the store,

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I found his eyes were glowing.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's Fang Lin's light, you know.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's the same as three years ago.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's raining.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's raining.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're dead.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I promised to be good to him.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So no matter what he used to be,

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What will it be like in the future,

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I will be good to him.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You have to keep your word.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
People can't talk.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
His eyes are glowing because of me.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Come for dinner tonight.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Come.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Come.

39
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Come.

40
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Come.

41
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This way, please.

42
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've registered.

43
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You still recognize me?

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We're in the director's office.

45
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You can't come in.

46
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll take you there.

47
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This way.

48
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is the date.

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This way.

50
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's it.

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm not going.

52
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You send me a message.

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I have something serious to talk to him.

54
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's fine.

55
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Wait for me.

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll go first.

58
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll go first.

59
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's right.

60
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's him.

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is my classmate.

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Really?

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll send you a message.

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's the only way to match me.

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's him.

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's him.

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I just got a little fat.

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll give you a little more.

69
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Today is hot pot day.

70
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's have a big meal.

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I've made a deal with Zhou Dong.

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll cook for Aunt Song today.

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're the head of the family.

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No, I'm not the head of the family.

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's go first.

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I want to go.

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Two enemies.

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm afraid of the scene.

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why are you the enemy?

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm kidding.

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Xiao Mi, the director called you.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay.

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're not even sad about dancing.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm not in the studio yet.

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm not in the studio yet.

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm not in the studio yet.

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you two a couple?

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Or open.

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Or break up.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Stop dancing.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Director.

92
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There's a guy called Song Guan Wang looking for you.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ignore him.

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Wait a minute.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Take him to the back door.

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay.

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Where did I say?

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Where did I say?

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I just came.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I didn't hear it.

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're still breaking up with me.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Xiao Qing and Xiao Bai's feelings.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You and Xu Xin's feelings.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You don't even understand.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I said, Yao Yao's words are all right with you.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yang Yu, you've loved everyone.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What is Grandpa in your heart?

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What is Xu Xin in your heart?

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You love yourself the most in the world.

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Today, the director, the director, the secretary are all here.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll talk to Grandpa tomorrow.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Do you need me?

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What do you say?

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Just want.

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I thought I could rest.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Xiao Qing is just a light bulb.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Where to light up.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's okay, dad.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm leaving.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm leaving too.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Did I tell you to go?

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I haven't been scolded yet.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You don't have to be so angry.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You can do it.

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What's wrong with me?

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I have love in my heart.

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Good good good.

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Look, this is the director's office.

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The director said to wait for him at the door.

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You must not go in by yourself.

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can go in.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You are Zhao Gang is the boss.

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Is the king.

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What about the prince?

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No, the one who carried the bag just now.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You go over quickly.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Today, the three young ladies in the factory, your problems are all out today.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Just wait for Mr. Yang to come out and show off.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Right?

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No, I have a objective reason.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But the objective reason is also the reason.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You can continue to scold.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I want to experience life.

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You brought him to the B section and arranged a task for him.

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He is learning to cook in the side wood.

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I was moved by that one look.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I was stunned at the time.

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He experienced life.

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What are you stunned about?

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm ashamed.

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He quickly learned to cook for art.

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Study love skills.

153
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Analyze the likes of opponents.

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Even don't hesitate to please his mother.

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Mother.

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Tonight, Xiao Yao will enter the other party's family and do the same.

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Then the three young ladies, Bai Su Zhen and Xu Xian, will not also live a family life?

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Stop talking to me.

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You are still crying.

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I feel guilty.

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The three young ladies in the factory.

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But Xiao Yao was so angry at the time.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I was really stunned when I saw it.

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If it were you, you would be stunned too.

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't want to let Xiao Yao show you now.

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Xiao Mi, Xiao Mi.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I watched you grow up since I was a child.

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I just say that until today, every time I listen to you,

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I can't figure out which is right and which is wrong.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Can you leave?

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll go to our sponsor, Qiao Guang Hui.

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He's already like that.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're not going?

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm going.

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Did you see the director?

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Where is the door?

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The director told you to wait at the door.

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If you can't see anyone, I'll come to scold you.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So easy.

181
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Director.

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're back to the new transfer?

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What new?

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Qiao Guang Hui.

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I didn't come for him.

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Then don't bother me.

187
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I have a lot of worries about the premiere the day after tomorrow.

188
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You are just a man in a cage.

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You care about yourself as much as you can.

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You can be at ease with whoever you like.

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You're dressed up today.

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I came especially for you.

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I came to ask you a question.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I just heard half of it.

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I want to hear you say it yourself.

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What question?

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Xiao Yao came home tonight.

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have to understand the son's life.

200
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Is the child really a heartless love?

201
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Or is it a play?

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Or do you prefer to experience life acting and practice acting?

203
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Is that it?

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I asked Yao Yao.

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
She didn't know you at that time.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
She didn't know that was your son.

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Qiao Guang Hui arranged it.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Qiao Guang Hui is so unreliable.

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Look, my son is just getting on his feet.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's a trouble.

211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You just tell him the truth.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You may be true.

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Can you experience this?

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You pretend to be true.

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You pretend to be true.

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're real.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Isn't that how your life is?

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Art comes from life.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But life is the source of art.

220
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Your actor touched the audience on stage.

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Then you say it's real or fake.

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I think there's only one thing.

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Stay away from people like you.

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Do you need help?

226
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll do it when Grandpa says so.

227
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll do it when I come back from work.

228
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't go to the kitchen.

229
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The fish is big.

230
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Isn't it called big?

231
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's not as big as the day on the sixth.

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is this your box?

233
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What's inside?

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What do you want to ask Dian Dian?

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
She asked me to come immediately.

236
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's okay.

237
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I won't ask if she doesn't say.

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Xu Tian.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You have to ask yourself.

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Do you really like Dian Dian?

241
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Is fate important or like it?

242
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No fate.

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's no use to like it.

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you like it or not?

245
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I like it more and more.

246
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Here, I'll touch you with tea.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Thank you, grandpa.

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay, have a drink.

249
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Wait a minute, there's me.

250
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You want to drink a cup?

251
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay.

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Pour a cup for Dian Dian.

253
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Thank you, grandpa.

254
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Come.

255
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Come, I wish you two happiness.

256
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Is it delicious?

257
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Delicious.

258
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I want a cooking pot most.

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Buy tomorrow.

260
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's too expensive.

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's too expensive.

262
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hong Mu, your new things are not expensive.

263
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They are not expensive at all.

264
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
They are all discounted.

265
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This cooking machine has many functions.

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If there is one, it's a relief.

267
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'll cook porridge for you in the morning.

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Fried rice for lunch.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Make red dates soup at night.

270
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Sugar and vinegar ribs on Monday.

271
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Fried shrimp on Tuesday.

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Three steamed fish on Tuesday.

273
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why are you looking at me?

274
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
How much?

275
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
More than ten thousand.

276
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Is it really so easy to use?

277
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's my life's dream.

278
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll wait for him to discount.

279
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Life's dream, still want to discount?

280
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Drink.

281
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Here it is.

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It looks delicious.

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Sorry, mom.

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'll have a bite first.

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Delicious, mom.

286
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Really delicious.

287
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Authentic Hangzhou taste.

288
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Maybe.

289
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Not at all.

290
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I just came back from Hangzhou.

291
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll give you a taste.

292
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Taste.

293
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Delicious.

294
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Did you put less soy sauce?

295
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Suitable.

296
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll learn more dishes in the future.

297
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Cook for aunt.

298
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No need.

299
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Go, sit down.

300
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Don't be busy.

301
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
There is a fried rice cake.

302
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
No need.

303
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Just a big bamboo shoot.

304
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
From the afternoon to now.

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm sleepy if I do it again.

306
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm not sleepy.

307
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Come on, sit down.

308
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What time is it?

309
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Right?

310
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Aunt, please drink.

311
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Okay.

312
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Mom, what are you doing?

313
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They all came home.

314
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I've done what you asked me to do.

315
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You know,

316
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I've expressed my feelings.

317
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'll cook for them for a long time.

318
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's effective.

319
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't mention this.

320
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
They'll be unhappy to hear it.

321
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm not happy to see your sister's life.

322
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What's wrong with this?

323
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What's wrong?

324
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Come on.

325
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Let's take a picture.

326
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What?

327
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Food.

328
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Take a picture.

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You can't take a picture.

330
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You can't wrap it.

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Right, the angle is wrong.

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Right.

333
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Right.

334
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Look, it's good here.

335
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Right?

336
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Congratulations.

337
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Congratulations.

338
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let's take a picture.

339
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Look at you.

340
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You look different and happy.

341
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
One more.

342
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Is it very sad?

343
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Not really.

344
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You're nervous.

345
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You think you did wrong.

346
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You think you're right.

347
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You're lost and lonely.

348
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't believe it.

349
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I...

350
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Sister.

351
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's too much.

352
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Xiaoyou.

353
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I like you.

354
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I like you the first time I saw you.

355
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're all at home.

356
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Put your phone down.

357
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Let's talk.

358
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's true.

359
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Aunt, please say.

360
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You're a poor child.

361
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's not easy to be a child.

362
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm not poor.

363
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Right, it's easy for me.

364
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's less than a week.

365
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Your girlfriend is coming to cook at home.

366
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Right?

367
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You're so confused.

368
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't know.

369
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Don't talk.

370
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Aunt, please say.

371
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Really?

372
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It looks like a dream.

373
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Aunt, please say.

374
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Aunt, please say.

375
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
How important is dancing to you?

376
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Most important.

377
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Who is the most reluctant in the world?

378
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The first and second.

379
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Qiao Min, mom.

380
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Zhou Tong, third.

381
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Third.

382
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's for sure.

383
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Not really.

384
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Mom, you...

385
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's eat and drink.

386
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
In the future,

387
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
we'll have a long time to review.

388
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You think the lab has a future?

389
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes, yes.

390
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Always.

391
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Aunt, what do you want to ask?

392
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Can I ask?

393
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This is the scene.

394
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'll report it.

395
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
No.

396
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Her best friend.

397
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Qiao Min.

398
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Enough.

399
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You have a brain.

400
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Qiao Min, what are you doing?

401
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I want to eat your food.

402
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm tired.

403
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'll cook for you when I get back.

404
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Are you angry?

405
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm just a little angry.

406
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I was affected by Uncle Hui.

407
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He's a loser.

408
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
All are negative energy.

409
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm here to accompany him.

410
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What is he doing?

411
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Lu Tie.

412
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You told him to be alone.

413
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't bother him.

414
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Dad was abandoned by Aunt Song.

415
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You're on the same side with them.

416
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Of course I'm not convinced.

417
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'll be back in a while.

418
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Qiao Min.

419
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Qiao Min, Qiao Min.

420
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Help.

421
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Qiao Min.

422
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Qiao Min, Qiao Min.

423
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Help.

424
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Sorry, auntie.

425
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
About the team,

426
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll take care of it later.

427
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll take care of it later.

428
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I know about your team.

429
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's okay.

430
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's okay.

431
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Then

432
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
we can use the bathroom.

433
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's a good idea.

434
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I just took a picture.

435
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I didn't take a picture.

436
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Eat.

437
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Okay.

438
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Xia Liao, go back.

439
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You've done what you should do.

440
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
There's a show tomorrow.

441
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Go back and rest.

442
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll go back.

443
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Qiao Min said she was in a bad mood.

444
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Go back and rest?

445
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'll send you back.

446
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Aunt, I'm leaving.

447
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Are you unhappy?

448
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
My mom is like that.

449
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
She's always so mysterious.

450
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
She says whatever she wants.

451
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
No.

452
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Aunt is nice.

453
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's good.

454
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Are you going to the big show tomorrow?

455
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Ten o'clock.

456
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Changhong Railway Station, northeast.

457
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What am I doing?

458
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Go back.

459
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I went to their bar today.

460
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I went to their director.

461
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Xiao Yao.

462
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
They arranged it.

463
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm in love with you just to dance.

464
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Look at that meal.

465
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
All kinds of photos.

466
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Just to report the experience of life.

467
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yes, I know it's an experience.

468
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Isn't that the beginning?

469
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's not the end.

470
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
How late is it?

471
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's only a few days.

472
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Son, you're in.

473
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You can still come now.

474
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Don't turn around.

475
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
When others say goodbye to you,

476
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
you can't stand it.

477
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Impossible.

478
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We were fine just now.

479
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We have an appointment for the big show tomorrow.

480
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
He's resting now.

481
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's okay.

482
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There's still one day.

483
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
We'll have to wait until the day after tomorrow.

484
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
He's not going to perform.

485
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
How do you know he's not going to perform?

486
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He's a good actor.

487
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
What a pity.

488
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The color and scent are good.

489
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Is it in the fridge or is it here?

490
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Long pain is better than short pain.

491
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Don't say it.

492
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's just right to drink.

493
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Don't say it's a burden.

494
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Dian Dian treats you like a stranger.

495
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
He won't be polite to you.

496
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
There's no process at all.

497
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That's good.

498
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
That's good.

499
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
His mother will be back in a few days.

500
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Where is aunt going?

501
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
His mother is in Guangzhou.

502
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Don't worry at all.

503
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Mother is very good.

504
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Go back quickly.

505
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Slow down.

506
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'll take you back to Guangzhou.

507
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm not going back tonight.

508
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Sleep here.

509
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Don't think too much.

510
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Sleep separately before you get married.

511
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Okay.

512
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I've brought all the luggage.

513
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The plane is at six o'clock tomorrow morning.

514
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You can pack your things later.

515
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'll wake you up at four o'clock.

516
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's worth the early flight.

517
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Where are we going?

518
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I don't know.

519
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Have you thrown it away?

520
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I've checked the two tickets in the country.

521
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I booked two flights back and forth.

522
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I'll go to Beijing tomorrow.

523
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It has nothing to do with parallel time.

524
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It has nothing to do with the person who looks like you.

525
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
If you want to go,

526
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
go there.

527
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Go to play psychological stability.

528
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Look at Xu Xian and Bai Su Zhen.

529
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I'll go with you.

530
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You're so nice.

531
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Where do I sleep?

532
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'll sleep in the car.

533
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'll sleep in the car.

534
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'll sleep in the car.

535
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'll sleep in the car.

536
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'll sleep in the car.

537
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'll sleep in the car.

538
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'll sleep in the car.

539
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'll sleep in the car.

540
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'll sleep in the car.

541
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'll sleep in the car.

542
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'll sleep in the car.

543
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'll sleep in the car.

544
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'll sleep in the car.

545
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'll sleep in the car.

546
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'll sleep in the car.

547
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'll sleep in the car.

548
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'll sleep in the car.

549
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'll sleep in the car.

550
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'll sleep in the car.

551
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'll sleep in the car.

552
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'll sleep in the car.

553
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'll sleep in the car.

554
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'll sleep in the car.

555
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'll sleep in the car.

556
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'll sleep in the car.

557
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'll sleep in the car.

558
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'll sleep in the car.

559
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'll sleep in the car.

560
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'll sleep in the car.

561
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'll sleep in the car.

562
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'll sleep in the car.

563
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll sleep in the car.

564
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I'll sleep in the car.

565
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'll sleep in the car.

566
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'll sleep in the car.

567
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'll sleep in the car.

568
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'll sleep in the car.

569
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'll sleep in the car.

570
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'll sleep in the car.

571
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'll sleep in the car.

572
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'll sleep in the car.

573
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'll sleep in the car.

574
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'll sleep in the car.

575
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'll sleep in the car.

576
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'll sleep in the car.

577
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'll sleep in the car.

578
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'll sleep in the car.

579
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'll sleep in the car.

580
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Xu Tian?

581
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
No matter what,

582
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'll be with you.

583
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'll be with you.

584
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Don't turn off the headlight.

585
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You can turn it off yourself.

586
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Okay.

587
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Go to sleep.

588
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm on the alarm at four o'clock.

589
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Okay.

590
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Send me your physical examination report on your phone if you have an electronic board.

591
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Do you have it?

592
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yes.

593
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Okay.

594
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Did you have a chat with him?

595
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
No.

596
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Don't think about it.

597
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You know it's not true.

598
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
What did you say a week ago?

599
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Just practice with him.

600
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
After six days, you will fly to Malaysia.

601
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It's not bad.

602
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Right?

603
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Hey, don't touch my computer.

604
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm talking about you.

605
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Let me have a rest.

606
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Take a rest.

607
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'll punish you.

608
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm going to sleep.

609
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Wanchong.

610
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I want to rest.

611
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't want to rest.

612
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I want to practice.

613
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I want to be a light bulb.

614
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Who?

615
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Zhou Cong.

616
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm going to go to the big festival with Zhou Cong today.

617
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You can't go.

618
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I want to be polite.

619
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I want to be polite.

620
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm not polite today.

621
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You are so annoying.

622
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Is it a rest to be in love?

623
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It's a lesson.

624
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
When you write the word love on the ground,

625
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
you say you want to work hard.

626
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You are a white-sleeved coin.

627
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't want to be a light bulb.

628
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm not polite today.

629
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I want to go to the big festival.

630
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I don't want to lose a piece of meat.

631
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You are not polite.

632
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
We used to do everything together.

633
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You want to accept Zhou Cong.

634
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It's too hard.

635
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You have to accept it.

636
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Okay.

637
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Hello.

638
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm downstairs.

639
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Why are you here?

640
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
When did you come?

641
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Six minutes ago.

642
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I sent you a message.

643
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I said I was downstairs.

644
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I saw that you didn't reply to the message.

645
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So I called you.

646
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
How did you know I live here?

647
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Mr. Song.

648
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I called your friend's father.

649
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I asked him.

650
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
He said he was here.

651
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I saw that kid's father called him.

652
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He is embarrassed to call my father.

653
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Sorry.

654
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm a little anxious.

655
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm down.

656
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
What are you anxious about?

657
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I didn't sleep for a night.

658
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm a little nervous.

659
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Last night,

660
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Mr. Song

661
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
officially informed me.

662
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
He will end it with you.

663
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
He went to your group yesterday.

664
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
He went to your director.

665
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But you're in love with me.

666
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Not only do you think so,

667
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
it's also a task that your group sent you.

668
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I don't believe it.

669
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You don't believe it.

670
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So I came to ask you this morning.

671
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's useless.

672
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
No, I still have to ask.

673
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's...

674
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
What?

675
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's still fake.

676
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You're so funny.

677
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Xiaoyao.

678
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We are really fake.

679
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
We can't do it.

680
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Today is a sunny day.

681
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Just give me a picture.

682
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
OK?

683
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Don't be embarrassed.

684
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I can do anything.

685
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Really, I can do anything.

686
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You can do anything?

687
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm so angry.

688
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Last time.

689
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Why are you like this?

690
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You're fragile, aren't you?

691
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
OK.

692
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Do you understand?

693
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yes, I understand.

694
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Come on.

695
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:07,200
Come to the

696
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
I went to the bathroom to see the rice.

697
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You didn't understand the bowl last time.

698
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Don't play with me.

699
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I won't play with you.

700
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Come on.

701
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Come on.

702
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Come on.

703
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Come on.

704
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
The E.T. is ready.

705
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Ready.

706
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh, that one.

707
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The hotel booked a three-mile group tour.

708
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Go out on the long red foot and walk five hundred meters.

709
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Go to the hotel to rest.

710
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I booked two seats at night.

711
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Tomorrow morning, the e-ticket for the cast is ready.

712
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Watch the play at night.

713
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Six o'clock in the morning the day after tomorrow.

714
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'll go back to Hangzhou for the third line in the morning.

715
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Two rooms in the hotel.

716
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It's just a neighbor.

717
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Why hasn't the car come yet?

718
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
No hurry.

719
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It's good to take a look.

720
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's all the same, right?

721
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Almost.

722
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Airport road.

723
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
People, cars.

724
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Sky tree.

725
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
All the same.

726
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Hello.

727
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Hello, is it the car you called?

728
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Sorry.

729
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
My car is broken.

730
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I can't get through.

731
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Sorry.

732
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Sorry. Sorry.

733
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's okay.

734
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
No hurry.

735
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The car is broken.

736
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Take the airport express.

737
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Go to the three-way bridge to turn line ten.

738
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You are so familiar with Beijing.

739
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Plan.

740
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
There is a plan.

741
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Just wait for me.

742
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'll be there.

743
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'll be there.

744
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Add a WeChat.

745
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'll scan you.

746
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
What name should I give you?

747
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You look happy.

748
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Come what may.

749
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Why did you add a WeChat?

750
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You want to worship the dock?

751
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's like a dock.

752
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Really?

753
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Then just worship twice.

754
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Just right.

755
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
No need to go to the embassy.

756
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Can you stand it if I worship you?

757
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Who can't stand it, who is called?

758
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Who doesn't worship, who is called?

759
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Let me tell you.

760
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I have been against you for a long time.

761
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Don't talk nonsense, okay?

762
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I don't care.

763
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
If you have any opinion, you are the one who is guilty.

764
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
What am I guilty of?

765
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Xiao Yang grew up with me.

766
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
We are besties since we were young.

767
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
If I let him ignore you, he can ignore you.

768
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Little friend, talk.

769
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Don't always stick to it, okay?

770
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You are the one who stuck to it first.

771
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Let me tell you.

772
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Everyone has his own thoughts and ideas.

773
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Only people like you will think that everyone should listen to you.

774
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
How many days have you known him?

775
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Not many days.

776
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Do you know what he is thinking in his heart?

777
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I don't know.

778
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Then ask him now.

779
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
No need.

780
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Just go.

781
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Who is going to go is a little prince.

782
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Zhou Butong, don't tell me that I don't have a connection with you.

783
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I don't know.

784
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Xiao Yang.

785
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Come.

786
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Where are you going?

787
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You asked him to come to worship the horse head.

788
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I didn't invite him.

789
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Why are you like this?

790
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You ignore me.

791
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Where are you going?

792
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Thank you.

793
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Wait for me.

794
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'll go back and talk to him.

795
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
How about this?

796
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You are in the bottom of the hole.

797
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I go up.

798
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I apologize to him.

799
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Anyway, this case will be over sooner or later, right?

800
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Don't say it.

801
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's okay, don't worry.

802
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I have a plan.

803
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I promise to coax him to be happy and happy.

804
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I'll take this horse head for him today.

805
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Three minutes.

806
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I'll go to the horse head.

807
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'll go to the horse head.

808
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I promise to coax him to be happy and happy.

809
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I promise to coax him to be happy and happy.

810
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I go to the horse head.

811
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Give me some strength.

812
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Enough.

813
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Wait for me to see the blood.

814
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Come in.

815
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm here.

816
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Come in.

817
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I go to the horse head.

818
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Thank you.

819
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Why didn't your son come up?

820
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I mainly come up

821
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,280
I'm sorry.

822
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:47,960
Okay.

823
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,760
Let's continue.

824
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:50,880
Okay.

825
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,600
Let's continue.

826
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,840
Don't be angry.

827
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,040
I was wrong.

828
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,840
I'm sorry.

829
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,280
Let's talk.

830
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,160
I asked you if you knew

831
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,520
what Xiao Yao was thinking.

832
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,040
Should I say I know

833
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,360
or not?

834
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,760
Three words,

835
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,680
love and love on the ground.

836
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,360
Do you know when it's written?

837
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,880
No.

838
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,440
On the 8th,

839
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,720
Xiao Yao didn't know you at that time.

840
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,440
The three words

841
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,160
are to determine the determination

842
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:40,680
to experience life and jump into the white

843
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,080
I saw it too.

844
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Did she answer?

845
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,800
No.

846
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,680
Three words,

847
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,000
write it again.

848
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,880
It means the 8th.

849
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,920
If you don't understand,

850
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,080
you have to come up to me.

851
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,360
Do you understand now?

852
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,080
Tomorrow is the first day.

853
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,520
You're done.

854
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,560
You fool.

855
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,080
Take it seriously.

856
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,600
Don't play with me, Jiaming.

857
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,800
I can't stand you playing like this.

858
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,960
It's so simple.

859
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,880
We agreed at the beginning.

860
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,560
I have to say it again.

861
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,000
Look at the phone.

862
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,960
Zhou Tong, you're a fool.

863
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,520
I'm practicing with you.

864
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,640
I've told you several times.

865
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,560
You still take it seriously.

866
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,800
Goodbye.

867
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,080
I'm calling Bai Suzhen.

868
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,120
Thank you for your cooperation.

869
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,640
You don't answer me.

870
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,560
You have to come down.

871
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,800
I'm sorry.

872
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,680
I'm sorry.

873
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,600
I'm sorry.

874
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,400
I'm sorry.

875
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,200
I'm sorry.

876
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
I'm sorry.

877
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,200
I'm sorry.

878
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,200
I'm sorry.

879
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,200
I'm sorry.

880
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
I'm sorry.

881
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,200
I'm sorry.

882
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,200
I'm sorry.

883
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,200
I'm sorry.

884
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm sorry.

885
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
I'm sorry.

886
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
I'm sorry.

887
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
I'm sorry.

888
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,200
I'm sorry.

889
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
I'm sorry.

890
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
I'm sorry.

891
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
I'm sorry.

892
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
I'm sorry.

893
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
I'm sorry.

894
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
I'm sorry.

895
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,200
I'm sorry.

896
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
I'm sorry.

897
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,200
I'm sorry.

898
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
I'm sorry.

899
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
I'm sorry.

900
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
I'm sorry.

901
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
I'm sorry.

902
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
I'm sorry.

903
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
I'm sorry.

904
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
I'm sorry.

905
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
I'm sorry.

906
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
I'm sorry.

907
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
I'm sorry.

908
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,440
I'm sorry.

909
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,440
I'm sorry.

910
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
I'm sorry.

911
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
I'm sorry.

912
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
I'm sorry.

913
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
I'm sorry.

914
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
I'm sorry.

915
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,440

916
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
I'm sorry.

917
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,440
I'm sorry.

918
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,440
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

930
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,440
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,440

I'm sorry.

938
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,440
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,440
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,440
I'm sorry.

942
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,440
I'm sorry.

943
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,440
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,440
