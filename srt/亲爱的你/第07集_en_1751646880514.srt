1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,800
OUP CHRISTMAS

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the hall

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When the sun is full of grass

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Loneliness is like a long journey

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Accompanying you is like returning to the old days

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Like a dream, we grow old together

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And leave behind the beautiful scenery

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The wind and rain are like a road

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We walk through the ups and downs

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The path of time

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
From childhood to the next life

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
May you and me be together

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 16

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't say

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The light is off, the night is on, the little light is on

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There is still a little feeling here

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Then let's take a picture

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Come on

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Come on

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Come

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Come on

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Come on, come on, come on

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Or this little posture

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's okay to take it

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Very happy

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
OK

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Get up

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is a small job

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why do you have to do it yourself

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They can't do it

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Not clean

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You know, I'm on the glass

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The children are so quiet

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Make that finger print

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let me see

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Take a look

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Isn't it black?

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't understand

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The girl is the light and shadow

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That effect, that temperament

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's like a model

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Look how good

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This this

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is not good

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is not good

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is not good

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This this

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This model

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why are you taking so carefully?

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is a camera shot

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Inverted

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's not my fault now

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I urged you to fall in love

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I didn't feel happy at all

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Really funny

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Xiaoyou

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Pretty good

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Pretty good

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll give you

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Talk about psychological activity

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Especially dangerous

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What dare

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I can't get it

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You can't get it or he can't get it

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All have

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What do people think

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I really can't get it

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You said at first

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
People have expressed their attitude

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Say experience life

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Find the feeling of love

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What if it's true?

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That girl

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So it's about face

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Isn't that her good friend Xiaomi?

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Have you said that?

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Do you really like her?

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How much is that?

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How to say this

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
One to ten

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Where is it now

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No matter what

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Be honest

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Seven or eight

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
得

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You will be filial to me in the future

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't forget your mother after marrying your wife

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Five or six levels

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Just want to fall in love with someone

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Seven or eight levels

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Just want to marry someone home

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Live a good life

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's six or seven levels

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No matter what he thinks

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You just go ahead

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm actually afraid I can't get it

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The more you like it, the more dangerous it is

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Su

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In case something happens to me in the future

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No matter how much you like it, it's not for nothing

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I am

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You are you

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Your dad is your dad

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What did your dad say to you in the car when he left?

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Life is short

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Who knows who is short

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Short also short a whole family

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Nothing in your dad's life

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Played and loved

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I gave him a big son

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why do you say you are in danger

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You just say hello

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Then I will listen to you

122
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
From tomorrow

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I won't be polite to Wen Xiaoyou

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Xiaoyou's side

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll ask that prince tomorrow

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Prince

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Your old prince

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Xiaoyou's unit leader

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Aren't you afraid that he is experiencing life?

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This matter

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Qiao Guanghui doesn't know

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
When is it an old prince?

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Drink and come in

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Should you be discharged?

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You are fine

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm really a little sad

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yang Yi, he told me clearly

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Said I passed the exam

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He made it himself

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Push forward for thirty years

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
When did I go to this kind of wild chicken dance training

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Interview video

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What wild chicken dance

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Who is a wild chicken

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Didn't I force you to go?

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Not necessarily

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The key is to be wise

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I really jumped

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
When I jumped

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I still have the heart of Zheng Jiang Aosheng

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Or I won't give up this foot

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Or you

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
One more time

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Bro

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Legs are broken

156
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I didn't ask you to jump

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You and me set up a dinner table

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let Song Guangwang

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Bring your foot ointment

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't want to

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I need

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You are hurt

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I am sad

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Song Guangwang told Xiaomin

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He is not suitable for me

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What does it matter to me

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Is it a buddy?

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This kind of thing

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can't just go straight to the name

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I ask him

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You help me touch his mind

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
See how to save it

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There is nothing in the world

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What's wrong, sister

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Brother Qiao, Mr. Qiao

176
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The room is empty

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Come in

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We two can charge the power

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Always so

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Take this and send me home

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, contact me next time

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Bye bye

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What about that dinner

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
How to say

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
OK, OK, OK

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What's wrong, sister

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What's wrong, sister

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What's wrong, sister

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What's wrong, sister

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What's wrong, sister

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What's wrong, sister

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What's wrong, sister

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What's wrong, sister

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What's wrong, sister

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What's wrong, sister

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What's wrong, sister

What's wrong, sister

302
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,280
Go to Baoshan?

303
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
Alone?

304
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,240
Wash my hair and pat me.

305
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,280
It smells so good.

306
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,600
Right?

307
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,320
It can keep the fragrance for several days.

308
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,000
It's cheaper than perfume.

309
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,080
The good eyes are full of the sword.

310
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,840
The bad eyes are full of the chat.

311
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,800
Being together...

312
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,360
What song is so bad?

313
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,560
I just learned it.

314
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,000
I can't see you.

315
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,920
Go to Baoshan later.

316
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,200
Uncle Wei will pick you up.

317
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,840
The bad eyes are full of the sword.

318
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,000
The bad eyes are full of the chat.

319
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,240
Hello, Mr. Bai.

320
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,880
Welcome to Baoshan.

321
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
Welcome to Baoshan.

322
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,840
Brother Xiao, you're here.

323
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,080
What's this?

324
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,040
It's for the publicity.

325
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,960
Baishan will find Lei Feng to do it.

326
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,000
They want to send the tickets.

327
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,000
You don't need to do this.

328
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,360
I've been working here for years.

329
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,400
I come here every week.

330
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,960
Where is this?

331
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,080
Beijing.

332
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,560
Forget it.

333
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,600
Thank you.

334
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,760
Here.

335
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,840
Here.

336
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,160
Dian Dian.

337
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Why did you buy so many vegetarian food?

338
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,760
The battery is dead.

339
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,880
Are you going out?

340
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,640
I'm having a dinner with him tonight.

341
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,480
Xu Tian.

342
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,920
Are you ready?

343
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,840
I'll call him later.

344
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
Dian Dian, let me tell you something.

345
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,320
If you're not so strong,

346
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,440
you'll get hurt.

347
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,320
What if...

348
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,200
No ifs.

349
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
I know what to do.

350
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,440
Go.

351
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Did you have a good time with your family?

352
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,880
He's not happy.

353
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,320
I'm fine with it.

354
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,200
Why did you buy so much water?

355
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,400
What kind of tea is this?

356
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,440
If we kiss,

357
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,160
we'll feel refreshed after eating so much.

358
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,280
Dian Dian.

359
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Can you develop slowly?

360
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,880
Slowly, wait for your mother to come back, okay?

361
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,280
She has no bad things, okay?

362
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,680
She has no...

363
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,880
A total of 332 yuan.

364
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,680
Is Xu Tian's physical examination on time?

365
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,080
You ask him yourself.

366
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,080
I'm sorry.

367
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,080
Hello?

368
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,680
Where are you?

369
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,880
I didn't see him.

370
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,880
I asked a friend to check the records of the Siamese Airport.

371
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,680
No. 4 had him come out of the airport.

372
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,280
He's exactly like you.

373
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,480
Hello?

374
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,880
Sister Ting, what's up?

375
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Are you investigating yourself or someone else?

376
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
I've never been on a plane.

377
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,280
I've never been to other places.

378
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,480
You've never left Hangzhou?

379
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,880
I have nothing special to do.

380
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,080
No. 7 went into the airport again.

381
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,880
He wants to know where he came from and where he went.

382
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,680
He needs you to go to the Siamese Airport and register the list.

383
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,880
The process may be a little more complicated than last time.

384
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,280
When do I go?

385
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,680
Anyway, the ID card is with me.

386
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,480
You can use it anytime.

387
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880
Or do you want to investigate yourself?

388
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,280
You don't believe what others say.

389
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,480
Don't you remember what happened the other day?

390
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,280
You still want to say that?

391
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,480
I told them,

392
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,680
but they will clear the video for a long time.

393
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,080
I don't know how long it will be saved.

394
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,280
What about today?

395
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,280
Hello?

396
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Today is the day.

397
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,480
The town is quite far away.

398
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,280
In the past...

399
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,280
15 minutes later, I'll go to the thunder tower.

400
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,680
There are 600 now.

401
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,280
Only a few have been sold.

402
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,880
Young people these days

403
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,480
are one by one dying.

404
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,480
Tian.

405
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,080
Tian, wait a minute.

406
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,680
What's up?

407
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,680
Well, I just told the leader.

408
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,880
After statistics,

409
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,080
you come to the thunder tower every week for 11 years.

410
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,880
The final destination is the tourist.

411
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,080
Well,

412
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,480
two tickets are from Beijing.

413
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,880
The police station will send you two tickets back.

414
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
No. 18 is the first show in Beijing.

415
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,280
No. 19 is the anti-corruption week.

416
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,080
The envelope contains the police station confirmation.

417
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,880
The envelope contains the police station confirmation.

418
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,480
Take it and your ID card

419
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
to the Wulin Gate National Tourism Agency.

420
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,080
Just get the ticket and the ticket.

421
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,680
Here, take it.

422
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,880
You go that way.

423
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,080
Well, Tian.

424
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,880
Well, it's up to you.

425
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,080
The police station is a good idea.

426
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,680
You need to be careful the day after you arrive in Beijing.

427
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,480
Okay, thank you.

428
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,080
The tour guide.

429
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,480
I'll tell you when the tour guide comes back.

430
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Well, over there.

431
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,080
Tian Jingxiang

432
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,680
Thank you.

433
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,880
Have a piece.

434
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,680
No, thanks.

435
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,600
I didn't eat lunch either.

436
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,480
It's low blood sugar.

437
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,040
Let me help you.

438
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,400
You don't have to.

439
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,560
I'm well rejuvenated.

440
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,680
Let me give you a hand.

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm٠ accents covered up.

442
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
Yes.

443
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Much better.

444
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,360
If you want to drink again, tell me.

445
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,600
I'll be at your service.

446
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,640
That's embarrassing.

447
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,960
What's in the bag?

448
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Oranges. I bought them on my way to the Tower of Thunder.

449
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,720
Can I eat them?

450
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,280
I head to the Little Store by the way of the Paper

451
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,040
You ran away after me,

452
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,600
so I have to take that risk.

453
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
am I wrong?

454
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,560
You are.

455
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,200
bluffing.

456
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
wah

457
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
Hall

458
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,520
Road

459
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,880
Walking and chatting

460
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,300
The song and the play

461
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,100
Playing

462
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,900
Stop drowsy

463
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,780
It's good

464
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,760
You also say

465
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Who on earth wears this scarf?

466
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,260
Block meeting, you !

467
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,760
You have all the ID cards?

468
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Sign and go to the public's office

469
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
If they don't, just do so

470
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Sign

471
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,160
Nice.

472
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,140
backsid

473
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,180
Xiaoming, cabinet leaderhält

474
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,500
Are you alone?

475
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,380
I'm sorry.

476
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,780
Wen Xiaoyao also signed it.

477
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,580
It's like this, Mr. Qiao.

478
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,500
Your daughter had modified the agreement.

479
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,420
Now the house is going to be in Wen Xiaoyao's name.

480
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,660
You are Wen Xiaoyao, right?

481
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,340
Yes.

482
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,740
Did you bring your ID card?

483
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,580
Yes.

484
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,540
Yes.

485
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,340
Hangzhou, Zhejiang.

486
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,180
Let's sign it first.

487
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,940
Mr. Qiao, don't worry.

488
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,460
How about this?

489
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,020
Sign the agreement between you three first.

490
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,260
We'll sign it after we get the notice.

491
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,180
Uncle Gui, I'll wait for you outside.

492
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,780
Xiaoyao, where are you in a hurry?

493
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,620
I'll go outside.

494
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,620
You sign it.

495
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,380
Sign the paper first.

496
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,260
How can this be?

497
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,900
What's the situation?

498
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,220
You agreed to give me the house.

499
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,980
But it's mine if you agree.

500
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,340
Is there anything wrong with me giving Xiaoyao the house?

501
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,460
What's wrong with you?

502
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,000
Give me the house.

503
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,340
A house?

504
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,340
Mr. Qiao.

505
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,580
It's이라는 Here is your drinks.

506
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,220
Have some oacong.

507
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,420
This is my way of serving you.

508
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
How pitiful.

509
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
You think too much.

510
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
I have a father. Does he?

511
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Yes.

512
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
After so many years, I'm his father.

513
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Isn't that right? Go try it.

514
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Come back and sign it in three minutes.

515
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Once you sign it, you're Wen Xiao's father.

516
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Qiao Min,

517
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
how about I go do something else?

518
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Don't go, Sister Liu. Sign it now.

519
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
I don't need an ID card.

520
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
I forgot you're from Hangzhou.

521
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
I've never been to Hangzhou.

522
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
That's crazy.

523
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
You guys from the troupe,

524
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
you've been performing in all kinds of places,

525
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
but you've never been to Hangzhou.

526
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
This time, Bai She Chuan might go.

527
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
The director said if the premiere is successful,

528
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Hangzhou might invite us to go.

529
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
It's for sure if it's successful.

530
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500
It would be even better if you can jump on the white lady.

531
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
You can go back to your hometown.

532
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
I don't dare to think about it.

533
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,500
I went to Hangzhou a few years ago.

534
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Have you been to the Thunder Tower?

535
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
No, I haven't.

536
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Back then,

537
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
we drank a lot and talked about projects.

538
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,500
We went to hotels and restaurants everywhere.

539
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
We went to the most famous places.

540
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,500
We went to hotels and restaurants everywhere.

541
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Right.

542
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
There's still a whole show to go.

543
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Uncle Gui.

544
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,500
How can you give me this house?

545
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Xiao Mi treats you like her own sister.

546
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Why can't she?

547
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
You've taken care of me for so many years.

548
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
You've been so kind to me.

549
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,500
To be honest, I'm quite stressed.

550
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
I don't know how to repay you.

551
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
You're thinking the wrong way.

552
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
You're looking for trouble.

553
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Uncle Gui.

554
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
If I were your daughter,

555
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
and I were Xiao Mi,

556
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
would she want me to give her a house?

557
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Uncle Gui,

558
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,500
I think it's already a blessing to have you and Xiao Mi.

559
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
I understand.

560
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,500
You know Xiao Mi's temper.

561
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
They're playing cards together.

562
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
In her heart,

563
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
she's the first,

564
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
and I'm the second.

565
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Xiao Mi, I'm having a meeting over there.

566
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Can we sign?

567
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Yes, three minutes.

568
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Three seconds.

569
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Coming.

570
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Xiao Yang, sign.

571
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

572
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
From now on, you don't have to pay the rent.

573
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
I won't pay you either.

574
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Xiao Mi!

575
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Don't be angry.

576
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,500
I'm me, you're you.

577
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
It's no fun if you say it like this.

578
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Listen to me.

579
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
I'm not listening to you.

580
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
You're mine.

581
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Mine is yours.

582
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
It's better that way.

583
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
I have nothing.

584
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
No, you have me.

585
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,940
Here?

586
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,140
Sign here in here for you

587
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,620
Ms Liu

588
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,820
How long will it take for this plan to fail?

589
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,100
It's good 50 days

590
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,260
Then we must wait again

591
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,500
2 times is so exhausting

592
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,460
bearing the birth of a son.

593
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,680
You should hide

594
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,420
and find a real dad who is willing

595
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,360
to take care of your son directly,

596
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,080
so most important is

597
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,980
getting a good job as a son.

598
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,880
If we lose her again,

599
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,060
we won't get time to spend with you,

600
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,220
don't worry about it.

601
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,880
I know you won't receive

602
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,520
this kind of words of advice,

603
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,020
don't worry about it.

604
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,560
chassis!

605
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,020
Send Liu

606
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,100
Wang

607
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,460
I'll sendение in a few days

608
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,820
Sorry

609
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,940
This

610
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,020
Wait a while

611
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,940
I'll go home

612
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,180
Wait a bit

613
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,340
Wait a moment

614
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,620
Hear me

615
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,780
fotografing

616
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Don't cry.

617
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Your relationship with Xiaoyao

618
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
is not something that a house can represent.

619
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,660
I'm not crying.

620
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,500
I can't cry.

621
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,900
Xiaoyao said

622
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,660
she has pressure.

623
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
Understand.

624
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,500
I don't understand.

625
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,260
You don't understand because you lack nothing.

626
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,100
You can think about the problem from another angle.

627
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,660
Why is it pressure?

628
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,660
She obviously treats me like an outsider.

629
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,660
Don't talk.

630
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,260
If she doesn't treat me like an outsider,

631
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,260
what if I give her a house?

632
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,260
She's a good girl.

633
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,820
She's fine.

634
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,500
You have to give her a house.

635
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,100
Who doesn't want to?

636
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,100
Have you discussed it with me?

637
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,100
Everyone

638
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,580
has to have their own thoughts.

639
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,580
No matter how close you are,

640
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,980
if you fall in love,

641
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,380
and you get married early,

642
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,580
and you look back,

643
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,180
and you give the house to someone else,

644
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,180
what's going on?

645
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,180
Are you talking about Xiaoyao?

646
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,580
You two are the same.

647
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,980
A girl

648
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,180
will get married sooner or later.

649
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,180
You're a jerk!

650
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,180
You're so reluctant!

651
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,180
You're so bad.

652
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,180
Just do as you want.

653
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,180
You can't even say a word.

654
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
You have to do as you want.

655
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,180
The whole world has to be around you.

656
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,180
That's not what I meant.

657
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,180
What do you mean?

658
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,580
Aunt also said I was spoiled.

659
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,180
Aunt Song.

660
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,180
You two are the same.

661
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,660
What do you mean?

662
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,980
What's wrong?

663
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,380
What do you mean?

664
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,380
Don't you know that

665
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,380
I have a sister?

666
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,280
But even so,

667
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,580
I still have to treat her like your sister.

668
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,980
Do you want to choose teach Bella off?

669
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,580
Okay.

670
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,780
See you later.

671
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,380
Don't handle this.

672
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,940
Cause funnel

673
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:15,740
It is to pick these five

674
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,240
Bullet

675
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,920
It's just your imagination.

676
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,960
Let's go.

677
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,400
Let's go.

678
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,080
Xiao Mi,

679
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,880
you're so quick.

680
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,160
Your singing

681
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,600
is so better than the fact

682
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,320
they talk on stage.

683
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,540
from those you love and love and love.

684
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,100
Yunаствors tried to take me away from you.

685
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:02,940
We made腰圎和腰 kidding into a helicopters

686
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:08,020
We had a lot of surprises on our minds.

687
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,960
Before that time,

688
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,240
you and me were like friends.

689
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,460
Then I like it very much.

690
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,780
Had our grown up together actually,

691
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,780
I'm sorry.

692
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,860
Sister, do you want to listen to Beijing's little song?

693
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
It's free.

694
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
Yes.

695
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
You don't know how to do this?

696
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
I'll teach you.

697
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,060
Wang Li Yi.

698
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,980
Chu.

699
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,980
You know how to do this?

700
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,980
Yes.

701
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,980
Okay, do it again.

702
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,980
Okay.

703
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,780
It's so nice.

704
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,780
Slow down.

705
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,780
Slow down.

706
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,780
Even if I'm in your way

707
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,780
It's so beautiful.

708
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,780
It's beautiful, right?

709
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,780
I'll take you as my home

710
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,780
You've never been here, right?

711
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,780
Let me fix it.

712
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,780
Name, Shi Dian Dian.

713
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,780
How old are you?

714
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,780
This is Jiang Shao Xing.

715
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,780
You don't bring your ID card when you come out.

716
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,780
But your boyfriend has an ID card?

717
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,780
I'm looking for a friend to check the video.

718
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,780
I need his ID card.

719
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,780
You can check people with an ID card?

720
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,780
I told my friend that

721
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,780
I'm checking myself.

722
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
Did you see that?

723
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
No.

724
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,780
You know it.

725
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,780
Fortunately, your friend knows how to do it.

726
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,780
Use public resources to harm the private sector.

727
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
Right?

728
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
No.

729
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,780
Look, is he the one who checked?

730
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
Look, is he the one who checked?

731
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
Yes.

732
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,780
It's not the same as you.

733
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,080
How come?

734
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
Uncle.

735
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,780
How come?

736
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,780
Look.

737
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,780
Why are you tutored?

738
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
I would like to know.

739
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,780
Come here.

740
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,780
What's wrong with you?

741
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,780
Come here!

742
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
What was the matter with you, easily craziest?

743
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,780
Who is stupid for laurel flowers?

744
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,780
Who is stupid for laurel flowers?

745
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
Who is stupid for laurel flowers?

746
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,780
Stop!

747
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,780
What are you doing?

748
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
Brother Qiang.

749
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,780
Brother Qiang.

750
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,780
Is it Yu Tian?

751
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,780
Yes.

752
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,780
We are looking for you.

753
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,780
I told you it had nothing to do with me.

754
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,780
It's okay now.

755
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,780
Why are you running?

756
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,780
Go to the police station.

757
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,780
Go.

758
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,780
I ran.

759
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
I'm going home now.

760
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,780
It's windy at night.

761
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,780
I don't know if I can go back.

762
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,780
It has already been explained.

763
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,780
Nothing big.

764
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,780
I will criticize education most.

765
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,780
Will you?

766
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,780
I didn't see the video either.

767
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,780
I gave my ID card to my friend.

768
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,780
He checked the video.

769
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
I didn't see it.

770
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
I didn't see it.

771
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,780
I didn't see it.

772
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,780
I have a friend.

773
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,780
He checked the information of that person.

774
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,780
He called the police station.

775
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,780
What is his friend?

776
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,780
A classmate.

777
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,780
Li Kenan.

778
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,780
A dormitory.

779
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,780
Say my name again.

780
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
It's you.

781
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,780
It's you.

782
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
My name is Xu Tian.

783
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,780
The two of us are like the sky and the earth.

784
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,780
I am 29 years old today.

785
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,780
I live in Hangzhou.

786
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
It's still No. 17, Xiacheng District.

787
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,780
I am a custom-made cheongsam.

788
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,780
The store's door number is the same as the owner of the store.

789
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,780
What is the relationship between you two?

790
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,780
Friend.

791
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,780
Shi Dingding said it was a boyfriend and girlfriend.

792
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,780
Correct.

793
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,780
He said you have an indirect memory.

794
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,780
He wants to find out where he has been.

795
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,780
But your ID card has never been registered in the plane ticket.

796
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,780
I have never been on a plane.

797
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,780
And I have never left Hangzhou.

798
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,780
Is it you?

799
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,780
No.

800
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,780
What tea do you want?

801
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,780
It was windy and raining on June 6th.

802
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,780
There was a person who looked like me.

803
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,780
It should be the person just now.

804
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,780
He went to my store to change clothes.

805
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,780
It should be.

806
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,780
I saw him and then he disappeared.

807
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,780
So I'm a little curious.

808
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,780
Is that the reason?

809
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,780
That's the reason.

810
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,780
Your girlfriend is responsible.

811
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,780
You must be punished for returning to the unit.

812
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,780
It's wrong to use public information resources to harm others.

813
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,780
I'm sorry.

814
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,780
I'm sorry.

815
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,780
Let's see if there are any problems.

816
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,780
Don't do it again.

817
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,780
Okay.

818
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,780
Don't you want to see it?

819
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,780
You must give me a copy.

820
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,780
You can see it when you go back.

821
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,780
Chao Lan.

822
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,780
There's something wrong with the box.

823
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,780
Does Xu Tian suggest that Yongwei?

824
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,780
You should work hard to find out the problem.

825
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
Okay.

826
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,780
Are you hungry?

827
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,780
I'm hungry.

828
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,780
You're going to the unit to be punished.

829
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,780
It's okay.

830
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,780
I was a pioneer.

831
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,780
Actually, I can go to your unit and help you explain.

832
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,780
No need to say.

833
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,780
They must think you're my boyfriend.

834
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,780
Otherwise, why am I so active?

835
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,780
I can't make it clear.

836
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,780
Safety belt.

837
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,780
What are you thinking about?

838
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,780
I'm thinking about what his name is.

839
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,780
Where he's going.

840
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,780
Gao Si must be in a block now.

841
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,780
I know a small road.

842
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,780
It's straight from the Qian Dang River Bridge.

843
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,780
I'm going to the unit.

844
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,780
I'll go with you.

845
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,780
Okay.

846
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,780
I'll go with you.

847
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,780
Okay.

848
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,780
I'll go with you.

849
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,780
Okay.

850
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,780
I'll go with you.

851
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,780
Okay.

852
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,780
I'll go with you.

853
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,780
Okay.

854
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,780
I'll go with you.

855
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,780
Okay.

856
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,780
I'll go with you.

857
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,780
I'll go with you.

858
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,780
Okay.

859
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,780
I'll go with you.

860
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,780
Okay.

861
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,780
I'll go with you.

862
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,780
Okay.

863
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,780
I'll go with you.

864
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,780
Okay.

865
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,780
I'll go with you.

866
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,780
Okay.

867
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,780
I'll go with you.

868
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,780
Okay.

869
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,780
I'll go with you.

870
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,780
Okay.

871
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,780
I'll go with you.

872
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,780
Okay.

873
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,780
I'll go with you.

874
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,780
Okay.

875
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,780
I'll go with you.

876
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Okay.

877
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,780
I'll go with you.

878
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,780
Okay.

879
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,780
I'll go with you.

880
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,780
Okay.

881
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,780
I'll go with you.

882
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,780
Okay.

883
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,780
