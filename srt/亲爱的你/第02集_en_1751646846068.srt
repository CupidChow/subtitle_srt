1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
sales

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the love letter you wrote.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I watch the butterflies dance with the wind.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I wait for the sunset to fill the grass.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am lonely and lonely.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I have to go through so many hardships to accompany you.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I am thinking of the beautiful girl who is like a flower in the morning and night.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I am walking through the wind and rain.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I have been through so many hardships.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I have known since I was a child that I can be with you.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I hope we can be as happy as before.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 2

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Brother Tong, why are you wearing a mask?

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Take it off.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
My mom said I had a fever.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why do you have a fever? Are you dizzy?

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I look pretty dizzy.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Brother Tong, is this girl looking for you?

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Good.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Where is your mask?

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is it so difficult?

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I have been covering it for a long time.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I am fine.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hello.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hello.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you a little nervous?

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I...

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why do I feel that you are quite nervous?

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I am very nervous.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then you are more nervous than me.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I am also a little nervous.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But I am fine.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I am fine.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You keep looking at me.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You didn't look at me. How do you know I am looking at you?

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Besides, you are sitting here.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You are just being watched, right?

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You look different from others.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes, I am different from others.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I am a photographer.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So, I look at good things.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am used to looking for angles.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What do you do?

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I dance ballet.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then on your condition, you can still go on a blind date?

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have to go on a blind date.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I won.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's sleeping.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
InnerEcerity

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,380
It is so

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,760
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,040
Or I'll call the police.

56
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,440
I'll call the police as soon as I see you.

57
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,000
You're just watching.

58
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,600
You're just watching.

59
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
All right.

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,320
I'm not old enough.

61
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
I don't know why you've sacrificed so much.

62
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,160
I can't forget him.

63
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,360
I'm thinking about him again.

64
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,760
I think he's holding back.

65
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,360
Don't send me WeChat messages.

66
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,720
I'll just say a few words.

67
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,520
I'll leave after I'm done.

68
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,680
I won't waste your time.

69
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,240
All right?

70
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,920
All right.

71
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
Can you?

72
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,920
Let me introduce myself first.

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,080
My name is Zhou Tong.

74
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,920
I have to apologize to you first.

75
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,440
It's not that you're not good.

76
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm the one who's wrong.

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,480
I didn't want to go at all.

78
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,520
The one who's in love and getting married and having children.

79
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,040
Because when I was very young,

80
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,680
my dad died.

81
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,480
Then my mom

82
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,760
pulled me into this age.

83
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,520
My mom thought

84
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,840
I should be at this age now.

85
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
It's time to date and have a girlfriend.

86
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,520
So

87
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,160
she always

88
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
talked to me every day.

89
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,320
I really can't help her talk to me.

90
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
So

91
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,400
I'm here to see you today.

92
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm a filial son.

93
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,040
But don't worry.

94
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,720
I...

95
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,760
Don't worry.

96
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,880
I'll tell her when I get back.

97
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,640
I've seen her.

98
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,400
But it's not suitable.

99
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,480
It's not good.

100
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,200
I think she'll give up.

101
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,000
She can take a good rest for a while.

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,320
Don't be like this.

103
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,920
I...

104
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,560
I'm a straightforward person.

105
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,320
So I never talk nonsense.

106
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,360
I don't have anything to say.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,680
And

108
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,480
you see,

109
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,800
you're so good.

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,520
You don't have to

111
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,040
waste your time with me.

112
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
And I

113
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,360
can't say I saw you for the first time.

114
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,800
I think you're pretty.

115
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,080
Right?

116
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll be a bad guy.

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,720
I'll...

118
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,080
I'll change my principles.

119
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,520
It's not suitable.

120
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,560
I'm a straightforward person.

121
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,080
Right?

122
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,920
Don't be like this.

123
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,960
If you're really upset,

124
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,640
you can

125
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,360
scold me.

126
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,560
And you can be relieved.

127
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,120
Because

128
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,720
I'm angry with anyone.

129
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm not happy with me.

130
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,360
I'm straightforward.

131
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,480
I'm relieved.

132
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,280
Wait a minute.

133
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,520
No.

134
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm Wen Xiaoyao.

135
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,760
We meet to experience life.

136
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,040
What?

137
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,800
What...

138
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,480
What's the topic?

139
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,000
What's the topic?

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,120
I've never been in love.

141
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,280
I can't dance well.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,400
White Snake.

143
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,080
I fell in love with Xu Xian.

144
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,520
You're so ridiculous.

145
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,480
You're filial.

146
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm happy to experience life.

147
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,440
I'm leaving.

148
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,360
We haven't talked yet.

149
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,360
No.

150
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,960
I think

151
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,440
we have nothing to talk about.

152
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,720
Right?

153
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,400
You're fake.

154
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm fake.

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,920
We're both fake.

156
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,560
If you have something to say,

157
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
I'll go to the airport.

158
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,960
That's all.

159
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,400
Bye.

160
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,200
What's wrong with him?

161
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,840
Why is he hit?

162
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,000
Tong.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,400
What's wrong?

164
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Why are you lying there?

165
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,920
What's wrong with you?

166
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,800
What's wrong?

167
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,040
Get up.

168
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,840
Brother.

169
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,080
Where did you hit?

170
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,840
Sit down.

171
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,160
What's wrong?

172
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,040
Are you okay?

173
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,080
Why are you here?

174
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,960
When will you

175
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,240
let me find you?

176
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,120
I'm at the end of the road

177
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,080
waiting for you to come back

178
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,520
to try to get rid of myself

179
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,320
and have this expectation

180
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,560
Shi Dian Dian.

181
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,520
I'm Xu Tian.

182
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,120
I know.

183
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,120
I saw you selling fruits on the way.

184
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,080
It feels fresh.

185
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
I brought you some.

186
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,840
What about that?

187
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,960
Cheap clothes.

188
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,400
I didn't get anything

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,800
for the meeting.

190
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,640
I happen to be a cheapskate.

191
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,880
Give it to me.

192
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,320
Yes.

193
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,120
I didn't have time to make it.

194
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
So I got one in the store.

195
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,320
I don't know if it's the right size.

196
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,720
If it's not,

197
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,960
I'll change it next time.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,880
Do you want to introduce yourself again?

199
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,080
Introduce yourself.

200
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,560
No need.

201
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,080
I have a good impression of you.

202
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,360
What about you?

203
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,360
I'm fine, too.

204
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,520
My grandpa said you were mature.

205
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm happy.

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,640
Shi is your grandpa.

207
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,680
I ordered Longjing.

208
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,600
I'll take the cheongsam.

209
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,480
Have some tea.

210
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,600
Thank you.

211
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,600
Thank you.

212
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,480
Thank you.

213
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,680
Sir, do you want to cut the fruit?

214
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,880
It's convenient.

215
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,800
It's convenient.

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:53,120
1st technically does not happen.

217
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,400
It's convenient.

218
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,080
Perfect for me.

219
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,800
It's comfortable and close to me.

220
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,040
Why are you wearing it?

221
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,880
It's polite to open the door

222
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,080
when you receive a gift.

223
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Let's get down to business.

224
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,440
Okay.

225
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,480
You're 29 years old and I'm 28 years old.

226
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,760
We've wasted too much time.

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,480
Since you've thought it through,

228
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,080
I'll tell you my thoughts.

229
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
I've been thinking about

230
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,880
a plan since I was a junior high school student.

231
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,640
So far,

232
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,960
I've been following the plan.

233
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,040
I'll go to high school and go to university.

234
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,640
I'll graduate from the research center at 25.

235
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,680
I'll get married at 28 in three years.

236
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,120
I'll have a child at 29.

237
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,680
I'll have a family at 30.

238
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,280
I'll be the software backer

239
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,080
and the supervisor.

240
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,240
You went to the bathroom just now, right?

241
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,760
I can only change my clothes.

242
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,360
I'd like to go, too.

243
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,880
Okay.

244
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,440
Hello, Xu Tian.

245
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,120
Hello, Mr. Xu.

246
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,760
Please tell him to come at 10 o'clock.

248
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,120
I won't go to him.

249
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,120
Didn't you meet him?

250
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,600
I saw him.

251
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,920
But he was too serious.

252
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,480
Forget it.

253
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,800
I'll think of another way to monitor him.

254
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,400
Thank you.

255
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,640
What did you do to help your daughter?

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,120
She's going to get married.

257
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,320
Mr. Xu,

258
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,360
what did you say to her?

259
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,640
When did I say

260
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,920
I'd consider it mature?

261
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,280
I won't meet you

262
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,800
if I don't tell her.

263
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,480
Mr. Xu.

264
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,440
Listen to me.

265
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I'm not an ordinary person.

266
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,720
Li Ke'nu.

267
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,680
Li Ke'nu is a man of reason.

268
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,760
She won't turn back unless she meets Nanqiang.

269
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,280
Even if she meets Nanqiang,

270
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,880
she'll study hard and get a good result.

271
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,040
If she gets Nanqiang,

272
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,280
she'll continue to study.

273
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,320
Mr. Xu,

274
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,400
are you trying to kill me?

275
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,640
Xu Tian,

276
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,920
don't hurt Dian Dian.

277
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,080
Do you like it?

278
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
Zhou Butong.

279
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,600
Do you like it?

280
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,440
My dad bought it for you.

281
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,880
Do you want to eat crab?

282
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
No.

283
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,480
Let's go see him.

284
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,400
We have crab.

285
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,160
We'll faint if we meet him.

286
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,880
We can't ignore him.

287
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,480
Let's go to the crab.

288
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,800
What do you mean?

289
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,280
Let's see if he has a fever.

290
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,480
I'm not afraid of him.

291
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,680
I'm not afraid of him.

292
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,880
I'm not afraid of him.

293
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,640
Let's see if he has a fever or something.

294
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,960
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

295
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,360
Welcome to Zaoan.

296
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,600
Here's your money.

297
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,800
Please have a look.

298
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,080
This is the most expensive one, right?

299
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,840
Yes, this is the most expensive one in our store.

300
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Hello, Xiaobing.

301
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,960
Hello, dad.

302
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,560
What are you doing?

303
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,720
Nothing.

304
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,880
You're acting weird.

305
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,680
Are you doing something bad?

306
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,920
No.

307
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,400
You're so suspicious.

308
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,720
I'm sorry, Mr. Qiao.

309
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,480
You can't go out on the street.

310
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,880
Why did dad buy a ticket?

311
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
For you?

312
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,280
How could it be?

313
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,440
I guess it's a waste of money again.

314
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,680
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm sorry.

316
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
I'm sorry.

317
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,160
Are you in a bad mood?

318
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,520
I'm not in a bad mood.

319
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,720
I'm thinking about the money.

320
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,240
Hello, Xiaobing.

321
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,640
Well,

322
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,640
can you give me the address of Zhou Butong's house?

323
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,720
Zhou Tong.

324
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,440
The one who went on a blind date this morning.

325
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,680
What are you doing?

326
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,240
Xiaoyao is going to see her.

327
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,400
We should talk about it later.

328
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,440
Send me the address and location.

329
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
I'll pay for it.

330
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Okay.

331
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
Wait a minute.

332
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Don't stand at the door this time.

333
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,880
You have to have a sense of shame.

334
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,280
Aren't we apologizing to you?

335
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,960
It's fake.

336
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,880
It's all fake.

337
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,280
You're so silly.

338
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,080
Here's a cheongsam.

339
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,280
I said I'd give it to you.

340
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,480
I was too impatient.

341
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
Actually,

343
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,280
I should be the one to apologize.

344
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,080
After you left,

345
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
I sat there for an hour.

346
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Miss me?

347
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
I miss you.

348
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
I miss you.

349
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
I miss you.

350
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,080
I miss you.

351
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
I miss you.

352
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
I miss you.

353
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
I miss you.

354
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,080
I miss you.

355
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
I miss you.

356
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
I miss you.

357
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
I miss you.

358
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Why did you think of me?

359
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,680
The Longjinggui there

360
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
always drinks after he's done.

361
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,280
You asked me out for a reason.

362
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,680
There's another reason.

363
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,080
What is it?

364
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,680
I want to know.

365
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,280
Actually,

366
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
I want to ask you for a favor.

367
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,880
I told the teacher before.

368
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,680
Maybe he didn't tell you the truth.

369
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,080
What can I do for you?

370
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,280
I want you to find someone for me.

371
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,080
From the camera.

372
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,480
Because I think your job

373
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
should be more convenient.

374
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,880
You should have told me earlier.

375
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,480
It would make everyone uncomfortable.

376
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,880
But it's okay.

377
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,080
I won't bother you.

378
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,480
I'll think of another way.

379
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Thank you.

380
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
I'm leaving.

381
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
Don't take it to heart.

382
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,680
You don't have to be sorry.

383
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,280
I was thinking too much.

384
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Sister.

385
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,080
Dian.

386
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,480
You're looking for her?

387
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,080
I was wrong.

388
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,280
Don't think too much.

389
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,480
She wanted to help you with the surveillance.

390
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,080
I'm kind.

391
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,280
I'm afraid you won't be able to

392
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,480
get along with each other.

393
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,680
But it seems

394
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,480
she doesn't have feelings for you.

395
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
Don't be nervous.

396
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,080
Fate is destined.

397
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,680
Take your time.

398
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,880
I'm 28 years old. I'm already very old.

399
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Fate is up to me.

400
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,280
It's destiny.

401
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
She doesn't like you.

402
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,080
She asked me out for dinner.

403
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,480
She said I agreed to help.

404
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,280
You helped her.

405
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,080
She still doesn't get along with you.

406
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,280
Good or bad, it depends on the process.

407
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Helping also depends on the process.

408
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,880
You can't help her once or twice.

409
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,080
As long as you do it seriously,

410
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,280
you can't do it.

411
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,080
She will definitely like me.

412
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,680
Dian Dian, don't be angry, okay?

413
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,880
I'm not angry.

414
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,080
According to the plan,

415
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,280
I'll be 25 and work for 3 years.

416
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,480
I'll be 28 and start dating.

417
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,480
Mr. Shi.

418
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,080
Xu Tian.

419
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,880
Please tell Shi Dian Dian

420
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
that I'm treating her to a dinner.

421
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,280
I didn't even pay the bill for the morning tea house.

422
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,080
I'm so embarrassed.

423
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Okay.

424
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,280
Tell him to ask for help again, okay?

425
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,680
This...

426
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,480
It depends on whether he's willing or not.

427
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,680
Then please make an appointment for me.

428
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,080
Okay. I'll tell you when I'm done.

429
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,280
Okay. Then you...

430
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning at Leshui Pavilion.

431
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
I'll send you the address.

432
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,080
Leshui Pavilion?

433
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,480
Where is there a restaurant?

434
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,280
I'm on a late night shift. I don't have time to eat.

435
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Hey, Fang Fang.

436
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,880
Let me tell you something.

437
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,280
I was kind

438
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,080
and introduced Dian Dian to a girl.

439
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,680
But if anything happens, don't blame me, okay?

440
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,680
The problem is that she doesn't like him.

441
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,880
But Dian Dian seems to like him a lot.

442
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,480
You know?

443
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,480
If you don't stop, you'll never know.

444
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,280
If you don't start, you'll lose control.

445
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
Fang Fang.

446
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,280
You can't let Dian Dian not be in touch with men for the rest of your life, right?

447
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,480
I introduced him to a young man named Xu Tian.

448
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,880
He's a nice guy.

449
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
I didn't say anything.

450
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,880
How can I say anything?

451
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,280
You forgot about yourself.

452
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,880
I can't say anything.

453
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,680
Again.

454
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,480
I just saw it.

455
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,080
Dian Dian, you didn't leave?

456
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,880
Your mom left the phone.

457
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
One bottle of mineral water.

458
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,880
You have to pay for it yourself.

459
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
Take it and drink it.

460
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,880
I have to pay for it.

461
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,880
One Russian under 15ей

462
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
Your kid didn't come in, okay?

463
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,680
Good night.

464
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,480
nell,

465
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,880
be violent.

466
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,180
I know she's her own child.

467
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,280
Stop making yourself sound like that.

468
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,080
Great.

469
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,480
As long as there's no trouble, think of it as your own self-destruction.

470
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,280
I'll listen to you.

471
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,880
This girl is really good-looking.

472
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,160
She's suitable for taking photos.

473
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,960
And then you fell in love?

474
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,880
And then you fell and fell into a big hole?

475
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,680
You didn't even make any movements?

476
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,920
I really didn't.

477
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,640
What did you tell everyone?

478
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
Just... just... just introduce me.

479
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,360
I didn't even say a few words.

480
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,640
You've already done that?

481
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,080
I was watching from above.

482
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,120
You didn't just say one word.

483
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
I said it.

484
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,720
My mom forced me to come to the blind date.

485
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,200
No, of course.

486
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,600
I'm really at the age of dating.

487
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,320
Everything is good. Don't worry.

488
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,560
I think this girl is pretty good.

489
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,160
She's quite fresh and clean.

490
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,560
You've caught her this time.

491
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,760
How can I catch her?

492
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,680
Don't pretend. Look at my eyes.

493
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,440
What kind of person is your mom?

494
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,000
No, she... she took me...

495
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
She took me to practice.

496
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,040
What practice?

497
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,320
This girl is really good at dancing.

498
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,680
You know, she's acting like Bai Cu Zhen, but she hasn't been in a relationship.

499
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,240
She's looking for someone to date and experience life.

500
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,600
She's making me feel bad.

501
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,320
What?

502
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,280
What did Qiao Guang Hui do?

503
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,440
And then you fell in love, right?

504
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,640
Yes, I was.

505
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,520
I felt so bad.

506
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,480
My heart was so numb.

507
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,000
Enough. Stop making me look bad.

508
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,920
I'll change the plane ticket later.

509
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,280
I'll fly the big horse tomorrow.

510
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,400
You can't take it anymore?

511
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,560
What's wrong with that?

512
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,240
She didn't do anything, right?

513
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,400
I'll tell you the truth.

514
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,640
She told me the truth.

515
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,040
Isn't that good?

516
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,760
Son, you like that girl.

517
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,960
Don't lie to yourself.

518
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
That's not a good thing.

519
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,120
You can't let your son be a partner, right?

520
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,080
I know.

521
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,880
Mr. Sun.

522
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,000
That's not a good thing.

523
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,240
Mr. Sun.

524
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,760
You're here to pay the rent?

525
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,920
Well, there are two girls looking for Brother Tong.

526
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,800
Who?

527
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,760
They look like they're dancing.

528
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh, you can go down first.

529
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,360
Okay.

530
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,160
I'll go check.

531
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,680
Wait.

532
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
You said you liked her.

533
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,840
I've told her.

534
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,440
You said you didn't like her.

535
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,920
Why are you here?

536
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,840
Let her go.

537
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,160
Aunt.

538
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,320
You're here to collect the money.

539
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,080
I was in a hurry to rehearse in the factory this afternoon.

540
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,000
I didn't have time to go to the hospital.

541
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,440
I'm sorry.

542
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
I'm sorry.

543
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,600
I'm sorry.

544
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,040
I was in a hurry to rehearse in the factory this afternoon.

545
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,840
I didn't have time to go to the hospital.

546
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,800
I'm here to check.

547
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Who is this?

548
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,040
I'm Xiaomi.

549
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,240
I'm her best friend.

550
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,840
This is the letter we sent you.

551
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Okay.

552
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,000
Come up.

553
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's a mess here.

554
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Come up and talk.

555
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm Zhou Tong's mother, Song Guan Wang.

556
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,200
Hello, Aunt Sun.

557
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
I'm Wen Xiao Yang.

558
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,400
How old are you?

559
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Twenty-one.

560
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
What's your birthday?

561
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
What month is it?

562
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
The rabbit.

563
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
January 29th.

564
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
The rabbit is a good match.

565
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
I'm sorry.

566
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
I'm sorry.

567
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
I'm sorry.

568
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I'm sorry.

569
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
I'm sorry.

570
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I'm sorry.

571
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
The rabbit is a good match.

572
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
It's a good match with Zhou Tong.

573
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
It's a good match with me.

574
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
How is Zhou Tong's head?

575
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
He's having a concussion.

576
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
He's nervous to see you.

577
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
He likes you.

578
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Xiao Yang, have you ever talked to your friend?

579
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
No.

580
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,400
I'm going to call Zhou Tong down.

581
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
He likes to eat fried crabs.

582
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Sit down.

583
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Drink some water.

584
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Are you going down or not?

585
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
What are you looking at?

586
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Stop pretending.

587
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Where are you looking at now?

588
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
What's going on?

589
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Why are you still here?

590
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
He's worried about your head.

591
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Is there a needle in your head?

592
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
He brought a box of fried crabs for you.

593
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
I'm going down.

594
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
What are you talking about?

595
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
What a nice girl.

596
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Enough.

597
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Don't argue with me.

598
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Hurry up.

599
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Mom.

600
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
He's not in a relationship with your son.

601
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,400
If he's not serious, why did he come to the door?

602
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm also curious.

603
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
You're curious.

604
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
You go down and ask.

605
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Look at you.

606
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Okay.

607
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
I'll call him up.

608
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Mom, if you're like this, then I'll...

609
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Qiao Mei.

610
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
What are you doing?

611
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
I'm not doing anything.

612
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Then you're not going up with me.

613
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Okay.

614
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
I'm nervous alone.

615
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Then I can't be the light bulb.

616
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
Go upstairs.

617
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Let you talk.

618
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,400
His head is dizzy and he can't go downstairs.

619
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Go.

620
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
There's a living room upstairs.

621
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
The tea is ready.

622
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Me?

623
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Let me accompany you to be the light bulb.

624
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Yes.

625
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Okay.

626
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
This is nice.

627
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
There's also a rehearsal room.

628
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Okay.

629
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,400
I used to wash my photos.

630
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
This is a special tea for Su Mu.

631
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
If you can't get used to it,

632
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
there's coke here.

633
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Two options.

634
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
I changed the flight ticket to tomorrow.

635
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Then I'll fly.

636
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Can you fly?

637
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Of course.

638
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
I had a fever.

639
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
But after I got a cough,

640
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
I'm not thin anymore.

641
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Actually, today,

642
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,400
I was a little dizzy because of the fever.

643
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
My feet didn't stand still,

644
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
so I fell.

645
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
I just came to see you.

646
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Thank you.

647
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Well,

648
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
how did you feel

649
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
when we met this morning?

650
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Me?

651
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
To be honest,

652
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,400
I was a little panicked.

653
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Me too.

654
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
You didn't

655
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
have a boyfriend?

656
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
No.

657
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
No.

658
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Actually, I'm a little panicked now.

659
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Me too.

660
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Don't panic.

661
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Don't cause any misunderstandings.

662
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
I'll tell you why I don't want

663
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
to date and get married.

664
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
You'll understand in a few words.

665
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,400
My dad is a travel friend.

666
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
He used to go anywhere he was free.

667
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
He didn't care

668
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
about my mom's

669
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,400
voice every day.

670
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
When I was 15,

671
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
my dad and I

672
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
got stuck in a ditch

673
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
and watched my dad

674
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,400
leave in front of me.

675
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
After a few years,

676
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
I realized

677
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
how long he could live

678
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
and when he would leave.

679
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
I couldn't decide.

680
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Maybe he would leave

681
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
so I decided to

682
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
date and get married

683
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
to Wang Tian'nuo.

684
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Look at my mom.

685
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
She doesn't even mention

686
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
my dad.

687
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
She doesn't even have my dad's photo.

688
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Are you and Xiao Yao

689
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
good friends?

690
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
No.

691
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
We're not friends.

692
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
We're best friends.

693
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,400
We're family.

694
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Let me ask you something.

695
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
This morning,

696
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Xiao Yao said she wanted to

697
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
experience life training.

698
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Is it true?

699
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
It's true.

700
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Then why did she say that?

701
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
We were dating.

702
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,400
We even prepared it last night.

703
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
When we got here,

704
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Zhou Botong said

705
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
he didn't plan to date

706
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
just to make you happy.

707
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
I don't know if he's telling the truth.

708
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
But Xiao Yao is sitting there

709
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
and not saying anything.

710
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
It's embarrassing.

711
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Right, auntie?

712
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
This is too much

713
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
to bully Xiao Yao.

714
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
No.

715
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
I have to go up.

716
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
I'll tell you if I go up.

717
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
My mouth is not sharp.

718
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
I can tell.

719
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Is it true?

720
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Look at my actions.

721
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
I know. I'll talk to you later.

722
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Don't worry.

723
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Don't follow me.

724
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Don't send it.

725
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
It's okay.

726
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
I'll send it.

727
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Thank you for the fried crab.

728
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Can you cook it?

729
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
I can't eat it anyway.

730
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
I have to walk more than a week.

731
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
You can eat it.

732
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
You're leaving so soon?

733
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
I'm going to the bathroom.

734
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
I'll be back in a minute.

735
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
You're leaving so soon?

736
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
I have rehearsal tomorrow.

737
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
What did you say?

738
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
I'm telling the truth.

739
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Wait.

740
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
I'll send you off.

741
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Uncle Hui.

742
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Why are you here?

743
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
I have something to do.

744
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Did Xiao Mei stay with you?

745
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Where is she?

746
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Maybe she went down.

747
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Do you come here often, Xiao Yao?

748
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
No.

749
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
I just came to see her head.

750
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Her head must be in the water.

751
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
I'll talk to her later.

752
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
I'm so embarrassed.

753
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Who do you like?

754
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Who do I like?

755
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
I don't know you.

756
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
I know you again.

757
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
This is for you.

758
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
It's too expensive.

759
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
I only have one daughter.

760
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Xiao Xiao Ni.

761
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Xiao Yao is calling you to go down.

762
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
I'm going to the bathroom.

763
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
I'll be back in a minute.

764
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
I'll be back in a minute.

765
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
I'm calling you to go down.

766
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Take it back.

767
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Save the money and spend it slowly.

768
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Aunt.

769
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
What's wrong?

770
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
This kid.

771
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
She changed her name to Aunt.

772
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Why are you here at night?

773
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
I came to see your son.

774
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Let's talk about this.

775
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
What's going on?

776
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Tell me.

777
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
I네

778
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,400
ça encore c'est tout.

779
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
That's it.

780
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
I won't talk about this.

781
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
You don't talk about this?

782
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
You're really wording.

783
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
You don't talk about it.

784
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,640
My dad started talking about it.

785
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,680
Uncle Wei?

786
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
Did you see that?

787
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,400
This is his car.

788
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,320
And this is the ring.

789
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,880
The only girl in the world

790
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,880
who never goes to school except me.

791
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,640
This time, it's real.

792
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,880
Have you forgotten Zhou Budong?

793
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,640
Just pretend that it never happened.

794
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,200
What?

795
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Dad.

796
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,200
Dad.

797
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,520
Dad didn't go to school.

798
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,880
His friend couple hasn't said that yet.

799
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,720
One day,

800
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,480
he told my dad to hide in the school first.

801
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Then, again.

802
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,680
Why did you do that?

803
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,880
He was so troubles.

804
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,560
Why can't you hide it there?

805
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,880
Why do you want to do?

806
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,160
No.

807
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,000
I can't help you.

808
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
I don't want it.

809
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Every tile in the house is yours anyway.

810
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Three things.

811
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
You understand?

812
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
First,

813
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Xiao Yao told you to experience life

814
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,400
because you told her to go to school first.

815
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
She's a girl.

816
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
She has to find me.

817
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,400
I'll have a good relationship with you.

818
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
You bullied her.

819
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Did she really say that?

820
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Second,

821
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
the ticket is back.

822
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
If you dare to leave,

823
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
we'll break off our relationship.

824
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
It doesn't matter if you're in love or not.

825
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
You should make her happy first.

826
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
When will you make her happy?

827
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
When will you stop?

828
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
How can I make her happy?

829
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Third,

830
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,400
she has no father since childhood.

831
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
She has no mother at three.

832
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
She's an orphan.

833
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,400
I know what you think.

834
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Everyone has a limit.

835
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Look,

836
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
a girl in her twenties

837
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
is so active.

838
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
How can she be different from you?

839
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Third,

840
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
we should be happy together.

841
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
We should be happy together.

842
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
How can I make you happy?

843
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
I don't know what to do.

844
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
You're a man.

845
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
You're a woman.

846
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
You're a woman.

847
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
You're a woman.

848
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
I need to find someone.

849
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
I need to find someone.

850
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
I need to find someone.

851
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
I've found someone.

852
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
I've found someone.

853
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
I want to chase after

854
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
We have changed

855
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
a little bit

856
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Lost direction

857
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Love is on the road

858
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
but it's going to be a long way

859
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,400
It turns out that there is no need to write down the wind and waves

860
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,400
Remember you have the look of my love

861
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Run forward together

862
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,400
The journey is a pain and a smile

863
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Don't be afraid of the time

864
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
I am fine

865
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
The real us

866
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,400
From the time we met

867
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Accept everything about you

868
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,400
No matter how many times you hold hands

869
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,400
We can reach the faraway

870
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,400
Don't be forced

871
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Two hearts are like eyes that see the scenery

872
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Understand that love is a free and unhurried journey

873
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
No matter
