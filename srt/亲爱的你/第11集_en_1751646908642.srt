1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,920
tactical

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the hall

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wait for the sunset to spread the grass

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Loneliness is like a long journey

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Accompanying is the return

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like a fantasy, the beautiful girl is left behind

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Wind and rain, we walk through the ups and downs

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The path of time, from small to large

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
May you and me be as one

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Are you happy?

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Actually, people are very nice.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
They are very kind.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Really?

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you feel wronged?

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I will accompany you to find your happiness today.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Open your head.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't do these things.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Can I?

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you angry?

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We are separated.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You are sitting in my car.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You are the one who came to pick me up.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I am training my feelings.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I will perform tomorrow.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't be angry.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't blame me.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You have always been my goddess.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now you are.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Double reason.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
First, you don't accept the director's songwriter Bai Su Zhen.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Second, you don't love me at all.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You don't love me at all.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Maybe a little.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Director is right.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You love yourself.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Two reasons are together.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How can you make it so awkward?

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Later, when you come to the university temple,

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
what do you want to say?

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Forget it.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can't count.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't count.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's go.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Stand up.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Take the subway to the university temple.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's the same everywhere.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So many people.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's the same everywhere.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Much more than Hangzhou.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Is our relationship a little fast?

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Is it good?

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I don't have a boyfriend.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I choose.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You are a piece of wood.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You are a fairy.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But I like wood.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can't take a good picture.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Look.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I will read the book tomorrow.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I have read it.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I will read it first.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Take another one.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What?

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I am satisfied to meet you these days.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Thank you.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Everything is impermanent.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
In fact, it's all the mentality.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What you want is gone.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's impermanent.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What you don't want is gone.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's ordinary.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It wasn't mine.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I just want it.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's impermanent every day.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Which German said that?

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
How do I know?

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Not two identical leaves in the world.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There are no two identical people.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
In fact, impermanence means no ordinary.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So familiar.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's go.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Wait a minute.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's go.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What is it?

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What is it?

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What is it?

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What is it?

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can touch your nose.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Wait a minute.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I am afraid all the people in your wish list

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
within the american carpet

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and above you

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,080
will be making decisions.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It depends upon the center.

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,240
You're not used to sleeping on a full bed?

106
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,720
No.

107
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,600
Judging from your report,

108
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,000
your blood pressure is low

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,200
and your gallbladder is a little high.

110
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,360
I'll supervise your diet

111
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,600
and eat some oatmeal cookies every day.

112
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,160
Okay.

113
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,160
Matchsun

114
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,880
Chief, where's the power?

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This way, please.

116
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,160
This way.

117
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,120
Move here, please.

118
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,160
This way, please.

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,760
Let me have a look.

120
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
Excuse me for a moment.

121
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,360
Excuse me for a moment.

122
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,720
Excuse me for a moment.

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,880
Excuse me for a moment.

124
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,880
What are you going to wear at the college?

126
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
I wish you a long life.

127
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
And you?

128
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,760
That's all.

129
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,560
What about you?

130
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,360
Just not enough space.

131
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,800
OK.

132
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,620
Men...

133
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Doors will open on the left

134
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Please mind the gap

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Doors will open on the right

136
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Please mind the gap

137
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Doors will open on the left

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Please mind the gap

139
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,940
Doors will open on the left

140
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,940
Please mind the gap

141
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,940
Doors will open on the right

142
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Please mind the gap

143
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,680
Doors will open on the left

144
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Please mind the gap

145
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,940
Doors will open on the right

146
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,940
Please mind the gap

147
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,100
Right.

148
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,000
Go trick him.

149
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,240
There he is.

150
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,820
The phone you have dialed is busy now,

151
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,320
it'll be hard to hold things.

152
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,660
Did you call from your doctor?

153
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,540
Go.

154
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,060
It's time to connect,

155
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,540
did you call from your doctor's helps

156
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,460
to contact Mr. Bai?

157
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,540
Which train recommendation shall Iwelt appropriate?

158
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,440
Must be somewhere around 181 HORSE Fogo algum.

159
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,060
It's so important for people to just leave early for this one train.

160
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,600
Today, we border takeoff and then takeoff.

161
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,500
Here, there's a plan for the others.

162
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,300
First, you PDF your post-it comments and describe it.

163
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,680
Next, read the boss question,

164
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,220
write all the lover 독 greeting guys on the line Both pets at the same time.

165
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,340
And if your friends don't manage to get the title they're singing,

166
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,120
you'll be fry-ёed.

167
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Don't move.

168
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,960
Interesting.

169
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:56,060
I am all terrible

170
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,120
Where did you go?

171
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,620
You are all on me

172
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,620
Guo Tianqiang.

173
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,420
Let's go.

174
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,980
What's wrong?

175
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,180
What if you can't find it?

176
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,780
Call me if you have a phone.

177
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,940
Don't run around.

178
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,940
I don't know anyone in Beijing.

179
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,940
Don't run around.

180
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,300
From now on,

181
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
you can't go over 3 meters from me.

182
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,780
2 meters.

183
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Forever.

184
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,300
Did you do it on purpose?

185
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,420
No.

186
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
I did it on purpose.

187
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,540
The train is about to depart.

188
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,540
Please do not leave the platform.

189
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,540
Do not leave the platform.

190
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,540
Do not leave the platform.

191
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,540
Do not leave the platform.

192
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,540
Please be careful.

193
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,540
Please be careful.

194
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Please be careful.

195
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
Please be careful.

196
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,540
Please be careful.

197
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,720
Sit in thelarınL

198
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,880
located at the

199
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,620
Hello?

200
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,120
Where are you?

201
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,580
I'm going to see Tian Qiao.

202
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,220
Which Tian Qiao?

203
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,460
Xiao Xiao, that's enough.

204
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,580
Let's stop playing, okay?

205
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,580
What are you talking about?

206
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,700
Fine, let me tell you.

207
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,780
We all have a full day.

208
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,580
You should do well on the show tomorrow.

209
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,460
Okay?

210
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,300
You're saying this again?

211
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,460
Goodbye.

212
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,900
Goodbye!

213
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,060
Okay.

214
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,660
If you don't say goodbye, then I'll just go.

215
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,100
Please follow the direction of the road.

216
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,900
Please follow the direction of the road.

217
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,900
What are you doing?

218
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Are you sick?

219
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,500
I'm not going to tell you.

220
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
I'm not going to tell you.

221
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
That's enough.

222
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
What do you mean?

223
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,500
You're like a roller coaster.

224
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
It's too exciting.

225
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,900
I can't stand it.

226
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,700
Are you crazy?

227
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,500
I was just crazy.

228
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,900
I kept pulling it and it didn't let go.

229
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Stop playing.

230
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,500
Who's playing?

231
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,700
Xiaomi told me.

232
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,700
You said you were going to perform tomorrow.

233
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,100
What?

234
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,300
Do you want me to practice with you for another day?

235
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,700
What did Xiaomi tell you?

236
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
That video.

237
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,900
When are you going to show it to me?

238
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,500
I think I'm a fool now.

239
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,900
Really.

240
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,100
You said the first time you met me,

241
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,300
you told me to practice with me.

242
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,700
Then you told me several times.

243
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,100
I just don't believe that shoe.

244
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,500
I really took it seriously.

245
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,300
But I think it's pretty good.

246
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,700
You see, you'll perform the white suit tomorrow.

247
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,100
I'm still a stupid.

248
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,300
Don't bother me.

249
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
It's all good.

250
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
Keep it all.

251
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm going to call Xiaoming now.

252
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
You listen.

253
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Xiaomi, what did you say to Zhou Tong?

254
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
Still with him?

255
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Don't be a fool.

256
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Come back to the team.

257
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Stupid.

258
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,500
Your brother hurt Sister Yun.

259
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,700
Come back.

260
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,300
Zhou Tong, 120 is here.

261
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,900
The leaders are all here.

262
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,100
Gao Shan asked you to come back to the team immediately.

263
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,100
I'm sorry.

264
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100

I'm sorry.

268
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,100
I'm sorry.

269
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,100
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

273
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,100
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,100
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
I'm sorry.

280
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
I'm sorry.

281
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100
I'm sorry.

282
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
I'm sorry.

283
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,100
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
I'm sorry.

286
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,100
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,100
I'm sorry.

290
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
I'm sorry.

291
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,100
I'm sorry.

292

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
I'm sorry.

305
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm sorry.

306
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
I'm sorry.

307
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
I'm sorry.

312
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
I'm sorry.

313
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
I'm sorry.

314
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
I'm sorry.

315
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
I'm sorry.

317
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,100
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,100
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
I'm sorry.

323
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,100
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
I'm sorry.

328
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
Shout it.

330
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
Where is it?

331
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
I don't know.

332
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Don't be afraid.

333
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
I'm sorry.

334
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
Tong, look.

335
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,220
Slow down.

336
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
Go down.

337
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,460
Tong.

338
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,780
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,060
It's not your fault.

340
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,740
Come on, Xiao Bai.

341
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
Everyone, move aside.

342
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
Go with them.

343
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,740
Do the procedures.

344
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,740
Come on, follow them.

345
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,420
Mr. Ma.

346
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,420
Leaders,

347
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,420
let's go back to the training center first.

348
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,420
Jin Yi,

349
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
go and take the leaders to the training center.

350
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Let's go to the training center first.

351
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,420
We'll discuss it there later.

352
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,420
Okay.

353
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,420
Everyone.

354
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,420
Let's go.

355
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,420
Yan Yan, take everyone to the hall.

356
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
Okay.

357
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,420
Where's Xiao Bai?

358
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,420
I called her.

359
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,420
Look.

360
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
Look.

361
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,420
She's still so impulsive.

362
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,420
Come on.

363
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,420
Bai Su Zhen is yours.

364
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
Let's go.

365
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,420
Let's go.

366
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,420
Okay.

367
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Let's go.

368
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
Let's go.

369
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,420
Make her faster.

370
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
Okay.

371
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
Faster.

372
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
Okay.

373
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,420
Let's go.

374
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,420
It's none of your business.

375
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,420
Everyone's training is for tomorrow's performance.

376
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
Yang Yun is not a big problem.

377
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,420
But he might not be able to perform this round.

378
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,420
We have to make a decision.

379
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,420
It's too late to perform the group dance.

380
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,420
Let's perform the three-person dance and the double dance.

381
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,740
Let's start with the double dance.

382
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
Come on.

383
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
Xiao Yang.

384
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,740
I can't jump.

385
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,740
Say it louder.

386
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,740
I can't jump now.

387
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,740
Didn't you always want to jump Bai Su Zhen?

388
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,740
Didn't you practice together?

389
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,740
You experienced life together.

390
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,740
You're at this critical point.

391
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,740
Are you an actor?

392
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,740
I'm sorry.

393
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,740
I can't jump either.

394
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,740
What did you say?

395
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,740
I'm afraid that I'll fall again.

396
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,740
Crying is useless.

397
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,740
Wei Xiao Yang, can you do it?

398
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
Can you?

399
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
I can.

400
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,420
Come on.

401
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,420
It's broken.

402
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,420
What?

403
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Wei Xiao Yang.

404
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,880
It's not called breaking up.

405
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,880
It's a single love.

406
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,280
It's not good for the teeth.

407
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,680
I'll fly the horse tomorrow.

408
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,920
The End

409
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,680
Now I'm relieved.

410
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,960
The poster is about to change.

411
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,840
What's the name of the kid?

412
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,640
It's a coincidence.

413
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,720
Wen Xiaoyou.

414
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,080
OK.

415
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,800
The two interviews in the city

416
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,000
are on the way.

417
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,360
The poster will be sent tomorrow morning.

418
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,080
Don't worry.

419
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,400
The official website of my group

420
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,160
has been selected.

421
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,920
OK.

422
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,240
Get ready to pick up the reporter.

423
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,400
OK.

424
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,880
Please get in the car.

425
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,320
Thank you.

426
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,400
Come on.

427
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,480
Thank you for not being in the studio.

428
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,520
It's getting dark.

429
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,200
theories

430
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,640
I want to earlier.

431
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:43,920
Give me a more appropriate one.

432
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,680
Is there any further information

433
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,480
regarding citizens here?

434
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,240
About what I've learned from you.

435
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,800
What's more important,

436
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,160
That you don't get married.

437
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,400
What kind of scarf are you preparing?

438
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,980
Writing moetenis

439
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,120
I am wearing this today.

440
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,680
My seasons out.

441
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:02,900
Writing

442
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,660
He might go home.

443
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,340
You're not happy?

444
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,100
You're so miserable today.

445
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,860
No.

446
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,340
I'm the lead.

447
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,260
I got the first prize after three dances.

448
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,260
How happy is that?

449
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,220
Does Zhou Butong ignore you?

450
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,900
Yes.

451
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,940
He doesn't care.

452
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,300
Anyway, we've achieved our goal.

453
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,740
I'm telling you, you danced so well.

454
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,500
I'm touched by your performance today.

455
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,980
When?

456
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,900
It's okay.

457
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,100
I'll just apply it on my face.

458
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,060
It'll be fine.

459
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,900
Xiaomi.

460
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,140
You won't break up with Zhou Butong.

461
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,100
Let's talk after three dances.

462
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,380
I love Zhou Butong.

463
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,900
Yao Yao.

464
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,740
Yao Yao.

465
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,820
Don't leave.

466
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,820
There's an interview on the stage.

467
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,020
Okay.

468
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,300
Wow.

469
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,260
Interview.

470
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,220
I'll wait for you.

471
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,980
No need.

472
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,660
I'll go to see Zhou Butong.

473
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,780
What about Miss Tan?

474
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,180
I'll go to the hospital after I find Zhou Butong.

475
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,500
Nothing is more important than Zhou Butong now.

476
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,540
You're the most important.

477
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,820
But I love Zhou Butong.

478
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,780
You have to help me.

479
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,980
Is Yang Yin in the hospital?

480
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,900
Is Yan Ye here?

481
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,460
Wen Xiao Yao will definitely not be able to make it today.

482
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,860
There are a lot of things to change the host.

483
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,460
The reporter will be here soon.

484
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,260
I'll let her wait on the stage.

485
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,740
She'll be here soon.

486
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,540
And don't let Yang Yun think too much.

487
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,060
I'll wait for her.

488
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,140
Xiaöng Creating Oh Jun

Okay.

Do you have water?

502
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,300
There's water in the fridge.

503
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,300
Thank you.

504
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,100
You're welcome.

Dad.

506
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,100
What's wrong?

507
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,740
The hair team told me that you changed the lead.

508
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,820
I made a mistake.

509
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,060
What mistake?

510
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,020
Xiao Yao jumped on Bai Su Zhen.

511
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,180
Good thing.

512
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,540
Sister Yun fell down.

513
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,420
You did it?

514
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,140
Of course not.

515
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,340
Then what mistake did you make?

516
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
I'll go find you.

517
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,980
Go to see Yang Yun.

518
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,460
Is it serious?

519
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,180
Which hospital?

520
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,540
I don't know.

521
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,380
Hello.

522
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,220

The light is too bright.

529
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,460
Are you done with the interview?

530
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
