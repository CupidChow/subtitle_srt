2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the love of your book in the hall

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When the sun sheds its grass

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Loneliness is like a lonely man

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to accompany you to go back to the old days

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to paint the beautiful scenery with flowers

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We have been through ups and downs together

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We have been through ups and downs together

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We have been through ups and downs together

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I want to be with you forever

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Stop taking pictures. Stop taking pictures of me. Take pictures of the scenery.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll send it to you later.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Come here.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I think we should keep our distance first.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's be honest first.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
How honest?

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll say it first.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's your turn later.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Is that okay?

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
OK.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Look at this shadow.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It will be more and more later.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The sky will be dark.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
When I was a kid, I saw my dad die in the car.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
For me, it's a shadow.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So I studied psychology in college.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I want to control myself.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I didn't expect that in seven years,

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
not only is there no less shadow,

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
but more and more.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So I can only run around.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Run to a beautiful place.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Take pictures of beautiful things.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And then?

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And then it's a little bit numb.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It doesn't matter.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
To be honest,

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I was really confused when I first saw you.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You are a beautiful place.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Beautiful things.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Last night,

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
my mom taught me.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She told me,

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
no matter how short life is,

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
it should be short-lived.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's positive energy.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So,

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
dating, getting married and having children,

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
nothing can be delayed.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What do you say?

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I say,

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can't be a little hot-headed.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The button is not sweet.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I can drive a car.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I won't give up the donkey open-eyed, right?

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are so kind.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You heard too much.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a mess.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you say too much, it will have side effects.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's your turn.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How long will the sun set?

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
An hour.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
If there's only one hour left in life,

68
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,080
what would you do?

69
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,360
Let's not talk about ifs and buts, okay?

70
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,400
Say it.

71
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,800
I've never thought about your question.

72
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,680
What if what I said is different from what you think?

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,240
Wouldn't it be a big deal?

74
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Right?

75
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,280
We can talk on WeChat.

76
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,160
We'll leave evidence.

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,280
Then we have to tell the truth.

78
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,560
Don't be so cold.

79
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,640
I know what you're going to say.

80
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,000
Impossible.

81
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,520
How about this?

82
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,400
I'll use your phone to send it to me.

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,080
You can use my phone to send it to yourself.

84
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,600
Then...

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll be the one to decide what you really mean.

86
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Okay.

87
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,160
Start.

88
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Okay.

89
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,320
I want to be with you every minute.

90
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Okay.

91
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,240
From now on, I don't want to waste every second.

92
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
You're really a gentleman.

93
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,280
I'mAH?

94
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,520
I'm your brother.

95
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,680
It's going to be dark soon in my place.

96
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,200
There's a sun shining in my place.

97
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,020
Alliance of China

98
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,800
Are you telling the truth?

99
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,800
All that I said was for you to express.

100
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,760
Are you real?

101
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,880
More real than a pearl.

102
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,800
Yesterday, in the subway,

103
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,520
I was in love with you.

104
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
You know that, right?

105
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,800
I know.

106
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,520
I was thinking about you.

107
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,840
I held it in.

108
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,320
Now, it's fine.

109
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,360
My feelings.

110
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
What about you?

111
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I was thinking...

112
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
In this world,

113
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,800
there must be someone else who likes you as much as I do.

114
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
It's just that I'm lucky.

115
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
I'm the one who's lucky.

116
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Go down.

117
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
It's getting dark.

118
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Stay a little longer.

119
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Then, let's take a picture.

120
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
End.

121
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
What's wrong?

122
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
The car broke down. Will it be repaired?

123
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Where did it break down?

124
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
I'll call the ambulance.

125
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Come down and rest.

126
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
The car broke down.

127
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
What did you mean?

128
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Hello, Dad. Where are you?

129
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I want to comfort you.

130
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
I don't need to comfort you.

131
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
You've been angry with me since I was a kid.

132
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
I don't. I'm going.

133
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Where's Xiaoyao?

134
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
We're fine.

135
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Zongzong and Gangsheng are all here.

136
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
That's not a good time.

137
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Come on. Don't make trouble.

138
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
I know.

139
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
We're all elders.

140
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Then, I'll go back to the teahouse.

141
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
What did you get?

142
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Oh, Lida's death medicine.

143
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
He's not here yet.

144
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
You're all sitting here.

145
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Don't call him Gangsheng.

146
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Call him Brother Gang.

147
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Brother Gang? Okay.

148
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
I have to talk to him about age.

149
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I've been prepared.

150
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
I've been prepared.

151
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
I've been prepared. I'm used to it.

152
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
This is a garbage bag.

153
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,800
It's really good to be with you.

154
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Isn't that good?

155
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
It's pretty good.

156
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I'm going.

157
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Are you still thinking about that person?

158
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
I've been thinking all the way.

159
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Where did he go?

160
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
What are you doing now?

161
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I'm also outside the house.

162
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
With a person who likes him.

163
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
I like you.

164
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
You always know that.

165
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,700
Sit here.

166
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,060
Sit down.

167
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,100
This...

168
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,860
Si Jin, get in.

169
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,460
Sit, sit, sit.

170
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,220
Wait.

171
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,220
How can you run?

172
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,420
Be careful.

173
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,260
Okay.

174
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,100
Wait.

175
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,660
So this is how it feels.

176
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,300
Bro.

177
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,460
Slip down.

178
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,820
Slip here.

179
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,620
Super good.

180
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,100
The kick.

181
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,020
What does it feel like?

182
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,140
I...

183
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,140
I only wanted to dance.

184
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,900
I don't know why I did it.

185
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,220
I kept dancing.

186
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,220
Now,

187
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,100
I just want to sit here

188
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,420
and do nothing for my whole life.

189
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,140
I don't want to do anything.

190
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,100
I don't know.

191
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,380
You still have to dance.

192
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,300
Just sit for a while.

193
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,900
One big commercial contract?

194
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,540
You don't know?

195
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,540
I got one.

196
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,980
In health insurance?

197
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,260
I got a huge commercial contract.

198
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,740
Piors and highlights in day time.

199
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:05,060
You make me look for you

200
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,940
That's it

201
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,180
On the day of the sixth

202
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,660
I met him

203
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,780
He's actually another person

204
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,860
But that day the wind was blowing

205
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,140
The magnetic field was in chaos

206
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,580
Don't help me anymore

207
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,980
To be honest

208
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,860
Have you never liked me at all?

209
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,340
Let's just pretend it's the first time today

210
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,580
From the beginning

211
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,180
I don't talk much about the past

212
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,740
Can you live with it?

213
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,340
I think so

214
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,820
The light in the room on the second floor

215
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,700
Not yet

216
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,500
Maybe find him

217
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,420
See him and talk

218
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,540
Maybe it's really put down

219
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,020
I think so

220
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,780
See them

221
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,060
The purpose of going to the airport today

222
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,180
Still achieved some

223
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,980
The surveillance camera for us

224
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,340
He carried a bag

225
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,660
Behind is B 46 boarding gate

226
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,100
At that time, the boarding gate of No. 46 was crowded

227
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,380
3.30, Shenyang

228
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,340
4.10, Beijing

229
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,420
I saw B 46

230
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,940
It seems that someone has started boarding

231
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,940
He looked up at the surveillance camera

232
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,580
The camera is usually installed on the upper part of the mall

233
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,180
He's not going to the bathroom

234
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,060
Just want to buy something

235
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,860
No line

236
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,380
and so

237
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
The possibility of taking the plane to Beijing is relatively high

238
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,500
You didn't call the ambulance today, right?

239
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,300
The car is not broken

240
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,140
You can leave at any time

241
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,180
Sit again

242
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,300
It's hard

243
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,380
I'm afraid I'm sleepy

244
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,820
I didn't sleep much last night

245
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,900
Nothing

246
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,180
Check the surveillance

247
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,220
Then you can sleep

248
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,500
Sleep as long as you want

249
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,420
I never met

250
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,820
People who treat me like you

251
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,660
If because of the past

252
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,020
Throw away the present you

253
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,420
Then I must be a fool

254
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,220
It's really smelly

255
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,980
I'll apply it for you

256
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,700
This way

257
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,380
Effective

258
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,180
Don't move

259
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,380
I tell you

260
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,500
Just hold on like this

261
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,500
Just keep it like this

262
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
If you move, the medicine will dissipate

263
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,260
Keep for five minutes

264
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,900
My daughter, Xiaomin, found you, right?

265
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,660
Don't go to heart what she said

266
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,500
I didn't hear what you said

267
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,900
Since there are no outsiders

268
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,100
It doesn't count as an outsider

269
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,580
How old is the prince?

270
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,780
I

271
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,860
I'm three years old

272
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,940
I'm not a man

273
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,860
I'm not a man

274
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,180
I'm not a man

275
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,900
I am forty-seven years old on the weekday

276
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,100
Forty-eight years old on the weekday

277
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,380
Didn't you say fifty days ago?

278
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,260
Bigger than me

279
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,180
Didn't you ask me to ask him about my brother?

280
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,580
I have to ask my age clearly

281
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,740
Prince, how old are you?

282
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,460
53 on the weekday

283
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,900
54 on the weekday

284
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,260
Fifty-four years old

285
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,700
Row

286
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,900
Call your brother

287
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,740
Let's be in front of each other

288
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,100
To be honest

289
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,980
I hate you

290
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,420
Let me talk

291
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,220
I'm an adult, what's the atmosphere?

292
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,860
You're an adult and it's late enough

293
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,780
Hello, how many?

294
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,060
Mr. Qiao's room

295
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,180
Mr. Qiao

296
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,540
Brother Hui

297
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,020
Big bag

298
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,700
No need

299
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,700
Prince

300
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,900
I've never bought a brick for you

301
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,180
I bought it for my daughter

302
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,020
Just one time in a lifetime

303
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,860
I wanted to propose to you officially

304
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,020
Don't let my daughter be proud

305
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,860
It's okay

306
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,540
Just one sentence

307
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,860
Especially like you

308
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,460
I hope you think seriously

309
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,700
This is awkward, isn't it?

310
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,300
Is not

311
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,500
What do you mean?

312
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,900
Or it's too strong

313
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,340
You mean

314
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,100
Let me give you an answer today

315
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,740
dad

316
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,500
Director

317
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,220
Second aunt

318
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,300
Who is the aunt?

319
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,580
Who is the aunt?

320
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,420
I'm wrong

321
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,580
This kid is here too

322
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,260
Let's not talk about this today

323
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,140
stop

324
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,740
Right now

325
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,540
Right now

326
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,380
Think how great you are

327
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,100
I've been there twice

328
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,540
I promised He Yang

329
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,220
Promise to work part-time in your place

330
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,060
When did Qiao Ganghui ask for someone?

331
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,340
Third and fourth

332
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,100
I feel sad

333
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,860
I still refuse you immediately

334
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,380
Big

335
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,500
Refuse

336
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,180
Long pain is not short pain

337
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,900
No, you can't see it

338
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,780
He totally disrespects you

339
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,660
Don't worry

340
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,660
I won't mention my daughter

341
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,100
My heart

342
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,500
Row

343
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,180
Still brother Gang is loyal

344
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,460
Then I will give you an answer today

345
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,220
Qiao Ganghui

346
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,740
I think we two

347
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,900
Not suitable

348
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,780
No, I don't think you are bad

349
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,700
I don't like others either

350
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,900
I think

351
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,980
Let's be friends

352
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,780
Ok?

353
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,820
No

354
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,580
What's your business

355
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,860
Can be friends

356
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,420
Row

357
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,180
Be friends

358
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,740
You are so stubborn

359
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,980
Brother Gang's gift

360
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,940
I'll take it

361
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,460
After your legs are recovered

362
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,740
Just go to work at my place

363
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,100
impossible

364
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,620
You said it doesn't count

365
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,780
Brother Gang

366
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,060
you see

367
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,940
Okay, okay, don't talk

368
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,900
If you know this

369
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,100
I won't come today

370
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,540
Let's go

371
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,940
Row

372
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:32,980
Row

373
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,620
Row

374
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,340
Row

375
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,140
Don't be here

376
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,660
I'm kidding you

377
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,220
Why did I see you

378
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,740
A lot of people

379
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,980
I'm the same

380
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,220
Look at you looking for a beating

381
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,900
Sit down

382
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,940
Boss

383
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,040
Watch your five

384
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,340
T Rag

385
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,860
Vibrate

386
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
You're all right.

387
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,780
Get on the floor.

388
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,180
Teacher.

389
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,180
Old Jia, let me ask you.

390
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,980
When will Wen Xiaoyao come out?

391
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,380
Not him.

392
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,900
Not him?

393
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,060
No.

394
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,060
He's Bai Su Zhen's son.

395
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,460
Do you understand?

396
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,260
I don't.

397
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,260
Don't take pictures.

398
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
I didn't take pictures of anyone.

399
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,340
You're Song Guan Wang's son, right?

400
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Yes, Song Guan Wang's mother.

401
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,540
You're all...

402
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,180
not serious.

403
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,180
Pay attention to the green hole.

404
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,300
Press it.

405
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,500
Not serious.

406
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,580
I heard it.

407
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,900
Yes, you're right.

408
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,100
This is a serious dance.

409
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,500
The second floor is just a show.

410
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,100
But it's dangerous to be professional.

411
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Your legs are easy to break.

412
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
You're so naughty.

413
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,180
It's nice.

414
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,860
Xiaoyao, remember.

415
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,860
60 yuan.

416
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,860
You can find it in there.

417
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,860
I'll come.

418
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,860
Xiao Lu, take it.

419
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,860
I won't say a word.

420
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,860
Okay.

421
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Your underwear.

422
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,860
Did you see Xiaoyao?

423
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,860
Here.

424
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,860
Give me this.

425
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,860
I saw Xiaoyao.

426
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,860
Here.

427
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,860
Here.

428
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,540
Thank you.

429
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,540
Thank you.

430
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,540
I'll remember it.

431
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,540
This is a good thing.

432
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,540
Take it away.

433
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
I...

434
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,860
I'm only kidding.

435
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,460
Why did you don't show your love to me?

436
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,060
When are you making money?

437
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,520
Up to me Which origin

438
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:22,620
How could you guys block me like this?

439
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,620
How can you live without Xu Xian?

440
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,620
I'm Bai Su Zhen.

441
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,820
Xu Xian is like this.

442
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,220
How can I love him?

443
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,020
Can we separate our life and acting?

444
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,620
I can't.

445
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,820
You can't. How can I separate?

446
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,420
You said it.

447
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,220
Then let's separate.

448
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
We're separated.

449
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,420
Don't blame me for the disappointment of the director.

450
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,220
You can't jump in.

451
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,820
You don't have Xu Xian.

452
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,020
Master, did you see Xiao Yao?

453
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,220
Thank you.

454
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,620
How is it?

455
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,220
This one.

456
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,220
This one.

457
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,220
One more.

458
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,220
Adjust the speed.

459
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,620
Then, faster or slower?

460
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,020
No, you're normal.

461
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,620
I'll adjust the speed.

462
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,620
Okay.

463
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,220
Turn off the light.

464
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,220
That's enough.

465
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,620
Thank you, master.

466
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,220
I'll go to the bathroom.

467
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,220
Okay.

468
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,220
I'll go to the bathroom.

469
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,420
You go first.

470
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,620
I'll wait for Xiao Mi.

471
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,620
Then I'll wait for you at the door.

472
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,020
No.

473
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,820
I'll go to the bookstore.

474
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,620
Slow down.

475
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,620
I'll go to the bookstore.

476
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,620
Okay.

477
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,020
I'll go to the bookstore.

478
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Okay.

479
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
Xiao Yao.

480
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,220
Why are you sitting here?

481
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,420
To fall in love.

482
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,220
Zhou Cong just left.

483
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,020
Master, is anyone here?

484
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,620
Come here.

485
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,620
Come here.

486
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620
You're not angry anymore?

487
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,620
Why should I be angry?

488
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,820
What did you do that you're sorry about me?

489
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,220
The house.

490
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
Xiao Qing.

491
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,020
You worked hard today.

492
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,620
I'll massage your feet.

493
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,620
And massage your legs.

494
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,620
You didn't write it?

495
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,020
Yes.

496
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,020
It was supposed to be a good thing.

497
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,620
But I'm alone.

498
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,220
But I've forgiven you.

499
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,020
I want to tell you something important.

500
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
How important?

501
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,420
I went to the mountain with Zhou Cong yesterday.

502
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,620
It was my personal ganz.

503
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,220
I was late to the meeting today.

504
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,620
I made the name,

505
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,820
Bai Suzhen,

506
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:46,960
a very

507
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,460
If you don't love each other,

508
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,580
you can't have me.

509
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,980
That's true.

510
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,580
Zhou Tong said

511
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,020
you have to be together every minute and every second.

512
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,540
You'll be with me every day.

513
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,300
You're so mean.

514
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:00,980
Let's go.

515
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,340
Let's have a diagnosis.

516
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,420
What's the diagnosis?

517
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,660
You're seriously ill.

518
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,340
Your heart is poisonous.

519
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,820
You're looking for Bai Su Zhen and Xu Xian

520
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,180
for your life.

521
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,620
Is it Xu Xian?

522
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,540
I'm not Bai Su Zhen.

523
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,500
You have to be.

524
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,380
You want to be Bai Su Zhen.

525
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,380
You watched the musical, White Snake, when you were a kid.

526
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,340
It doesn't matter.

527
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,020
Sister Ling is so good at dancing.

528
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,420
Why does it suddenly become irrelevant?

529
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,060
Have you changed, Xiao Yao?

530
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,180
The director told me that

531
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,020
if you love someone and be loved,

532
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,900
you can feel the sweetness and bitterness of love.

533
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,100
Then you can feel yourself

534
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,740
and others.

535
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,260
And then?

536
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,140
I think he's wrong.

537
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,340
There's no bitterness.

538
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,980
There's no separation.

539
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,580
Only sweetness.

540
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,420
He's not in love with anyone.

541
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,060
You're serious?

542
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,340
You're serious.

543
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:37,580
He's

544
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,420
jealous.

545
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,420
I'm having so many troubles

546
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,940
because of him.

547
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,320
Let me tell you the truth.

548
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,500
I asked him to come to you

549
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Completely.

550
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,540
You can't get over this.

551
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,540
Guess what?

552
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,940
Can't get over it?

553
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,060
If you can't get over it,

554
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,620
you'll have to go to the end of the world with her.

555
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,660
You won't go home.

556
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,900
Impossible.

557
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,020
Impossible.

558
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,100
Go to her house.

559
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,820
I said,

560
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,500
I don't even want the house.

561
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,980
You're so annoying, little girl.

562
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:07,820
How about this?

563
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,700
She's going to the bookstore now.

564
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,700
You go with me now.

565
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,020
Forget it.

566
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,620
You give her the money first.

567
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,660
She has to pay for it.

568
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,180
I'll go to the bookstore.

569
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,820
I'll go now.

570
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,980
Go ahead.

571
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,860
I'm leaving.

572
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,700
Master Dong Guang.

573
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,140
Turn off the light.

574
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,660
Okay.

575
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,460
Turn it off.

576
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,460
I'm leaving.

577
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,260
I'm leaving.

578
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,260
I'm leaving.

579
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
I'm leaving.

580
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,260
I'm leaving.

581
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,020
Miss Jiang.

582
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,060
I think there are many girls in your unit.

583
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,020
If you need to make a cheongsam,

584
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,860
you can find me.

585
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,900
You're opening a cheongsam company?

586
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,940
A small tailor shop

587
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,300
is in the lower level of the sea.

588
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:16,900
Then...

589
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,420
The result...

590
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,220
Excuse me.

591
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,220
You...

592
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,740
The leader talked to Ding Ding

593
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,260
that is the error词 he made about his date.

594
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,820
It's because of me.

595
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,200
You're really his date?

596
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,000
Have you decided?

597
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,500
I've decided.

598
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,180
A stone in the pot...

599
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,260
I'm sorry.

600
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,260
I've made your bubble this morning.

601
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,980
Can I try it?

602
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,140
Go ahead.

603
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,860
You won't run away after trying it?

604
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:06,940
No.

605
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,740
Here you go.

606
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,380
Look here.

607
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,380
It's sharp.

608
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,180
It's good.

609
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,060
Then check up on it.

610
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,100
Then don't touch him.

611
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,980
Don't let him有олет again.

612
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:29,900
OK.

613
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:30,940
What about my pasta?

614
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,460
OK.

615
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,700
Then what about your old man?

616
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,460
Miss Jiang.

617
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,500
Sorry to bother you.

618
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,920
Why do you always

619
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,760
look at both

620
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,160
The Shu Bo brothers have several hundred million.

621
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,080
It's a gold coin.

622
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,400
Does it have anything to do with me?

623
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,600
Do you have any other questions?

624
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,520
I just know that Dian Dian treats me well.

625
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
I have to be nice to her.

626
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,120
Yes.

627
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,000
Don't make Dian Dian sad.

628
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,760
It's pretty.

629
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,720
It's pretty.

630
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,000
How much is it?

631
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,600
You're my friend. Why do you ask for money?

632
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,800
They said it's your boyfriend.

633
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,240
Really?

634
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,520
Are you free at noon?

635
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,400
I'll wait for you at the water park.

636
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,000
Okay.

637
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,000
Miss Jiang.

638
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,520
I'm leaving.

639
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,280
Goodbye.

640
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,120
Goodbye.

641
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,380
Good night.

642
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,920
What did you say to Xu Tian?

643
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,800
You're stargazing.

644
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,140
Is there something else?

645
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,680
Don't beans Estoy.

646
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Something different

647
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,760
Lost direction

648
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,560
Love is on the road, but it's going to be a long way

649
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,160
It turns out that there is no need to write down the wind

650
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,560
Remember you have the look I love

651
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,560
We run toward the destination together

652
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,520
On the journey we go

653
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,520
Don't think about the old years

654
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,520
The Long Ballad
