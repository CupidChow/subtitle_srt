Timing and Translation carefully crafted by the Divine Destiny Team at Viki.com

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the hall

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wait for the sunset to spread the grass

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my heart into a song and sing it gently

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Loneliness is like a lonely man

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Accompanying is the custom

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like a fantasy, the beautiful girl is left behind

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Wind and rain, we walk through the ups and downs

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The path of time, from small to large

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
May you and me be together

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sorry, I'm late.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's okay.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's 11.30.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not close to the office.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Your work environment is so good.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There are two houses over there.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Our unit is divided into several places.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The software backstage is here.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Share the host station with others.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Actually, I want to treat you to a meal.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Next time.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Next time.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Say it. I don't have much time.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Say what?

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Who are you looking for?

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How to find?

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There are some obstacles to the transfer of public information.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But as long as the reason is right,

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
it is okay not to interfere with public safety.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The police also hold procedures to find people through the database.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you have your ID card?

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Remember to bring it next time.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll help you with the procedures.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Who are you looking for?

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Find myself.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are here.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are here.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Here is the thing.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
On the afternoon of the sixth day,

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
around one or two o'clock,

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the wind was blowing and the ice was thin.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Then the sun came out.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There was a period of one or two hours.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That day I carried a big bag.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
My brain is a little confused.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't know where I went at that time.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And how I came back.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So I think,

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it's not right to be confused.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But if I did something bad,

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
it would be troublesome.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What you can't remember is a bad thing.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You understand.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I heard from my grandpa that you were the only one in your family.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When did it start?

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The year when the thunder tower was rebuilt.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
In 2002.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
People should be more lively.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
One person will always be in trouble.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If the family can't see it,

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
it doesn't mean they are not here.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It may also be that they are in another time.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm kidding.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll help you with the procedures.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Next time, remember to bring your ID card.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You can also apply for a card.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Thank you.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm leaving for work.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry to have you here.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I owe you a meal.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I ran away when I was in the teahouse last time.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I didn't even pay the bill.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What are you afraid of?

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't know how to eat people.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
My brain was suddenly short-circuited at that time.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't know what to say to you when I sit down.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Next time, no, right?

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
No.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I know you don't like me.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's okay.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We are friends.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
More friends, more ways.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay?

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll cook you dinner.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But I've eaten with him.

95
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,920
Dust that stillшая

96
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,180
All these dead people

97
00:05:50,380 --> 00:06:11,200
I

98
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,820
You

99
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,260
What should I do?

100
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
Go to write your homework.

101
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,060
Add me on WeChat.

102
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,380
Don't call me.

103
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,300
Okay.

104
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,340
Okay.

105
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,020
Why do you always call me

106
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,020
Grandpa?

107
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,620
We have a large family.

108
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,100
We have six brothers.

109
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,340
We have five brothers

110
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,340
in the family.

111
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,420
We have six sisters

112
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,260
in the family.

113
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,740
We have more siblings.

114
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,100
We can't eat

115
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,020
when we go home.

116
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,620
That's good.

117
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,980
In the past,

118
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,340
Bai Su Zhen and Xiao Qing

119
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,580
were here

120
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,220
and met Xu Xin.

121
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,860
Let's go to reasoning world.

122
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,020
And I'm sure

123
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:38,540
you will comment my problems

124
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,340
and I'll pick you up.

125
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,660
Mom,

126
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,620
you still have a long way to go.

127
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,820
You have to move forward.

128
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,620
Don't worry.

129
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,780
I'll just sleep

130
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,980
like I usually do.

131
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,900
secret

132
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,580
Do you really treat me well?

133
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,100
After five months back from the army?

134
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,900
Every step I made

135
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,220
is due to your love.

136
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,820
You just need to be more serious.

137
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,300
But personally,

138
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,020
I have clue

139
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,740
that your passion for sports

140
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,140
Is that all right?

141
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,300
Yes, yes.

142
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,260
Xu Tian!

143
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,060
Here.

144
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,140
love words

145
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,060
Cry out

146
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,820
Don't be nervous

147
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,540
I'm good to drive

148
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,380
Where are we going now

149
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,860
You brought your ID, ID card and ID

150
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,980
all

151
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,740
I'll take them all.

152
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,740
I think you

153
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
have very red eyes.

154
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,940
I'm late.

155
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,940
I got off work at 10 a.m.

156
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,340
From noon to now,

157
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,140
I've looked around the tailor shop

158
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,740
for more than a hundred cameras.

159
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,140
I'm really sorry.

160
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,140
It's okay.

161
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,340
You can take a rest tomorrow.

162
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,540
You can take a nap.

163
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,540
Actually,

164
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,940
I don't need to take a nap.

165
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,140
I can take my time.

166
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,140
I promise you.

167
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,140
Do I have to fill these?

168
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,540
You have to write them all down.

169
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,140
You go to the left.

170
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,340
Can I not fill the following ones?

171
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,940
Family members have to write them down.

172
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
They're not here.

173
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,540
Sister Jiang.

174
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,940
I've filled out the information about the phone.

175
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,340
Let me see.

176
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,540
Then I'll just draw one.

177
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,740
Thank you.

178
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,540
I'll go.

179
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,740
Dian Dian.

180
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,340
Be nice to her.

181
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,140
Living a hard life

182
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,940
and taking care of your family

183
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:12,940
after the wedding.

184
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,740
It's not easy.

185
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,740
We're ordinary people.

186
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,540
Let's go.

187
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,540
Let's go.

188
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,540
Who is this man?

189
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,940
I've never seen him.

190
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,540
How long have you been working here?

191
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,740
Three years.

192
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,140
He'll be expensive later.

193
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,740
Help me prepare the shoes.

194
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,940
Okay, come in.

195
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,740
Success.

196
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,340
加强

197
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,340
Hello?

198
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,540
Are you Wen Xiao Yao?

199
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,460
I'm Zhou Tong.

200
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,900
I...

201
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,660
Your number is what my mom and Uncle Qiao asked for.

202
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,260
Hello?

203
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,340
Yes.

204
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,940
What's going on?

205
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,020
We're rehearsing.

206
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,460
I'll call you later.

207
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,940
I'll rehearse it myself.

208
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,700
Well, I...

209
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,100
I'm not going to Malaysia.

210
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,260
I'm going to eat your food.

211
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,220
It's delicious.

212
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,220
You cook it yourself.

213
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,620
My mom.

214
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,100
What do you like to eat?

215
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,420
A lot.

216
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,900
What's your favorite?

217
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,260
Hot pot.

218
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,660
How about I treat you to hot pot tonight?

219
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,580
I'll treat you.

220
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,420
Okay.

221
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,780
I don't usually go out to eat.

222
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,140
I don't know where to go.

223
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,460
I know.

224
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,100
How about this?

225
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,060
My WeChat account is your phone number.

226
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,340
Add me.

227
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,900
And send me the address later.

228
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,020
But...

229
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,460
Why?

230
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,020
Are you really

231
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,020
in love with Tian Shenghua?

232
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,140
Yes.

233
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,740
Then?

234
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,660
What's the result?

235
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,100
A blank shot.

236
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,980
I want to know how it's like to be in love.

237
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,140
Let's not talk nonsense.

238
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:46,980
It's true.

239
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,100
The point is, we're both not pure.

240
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,980
How can you know when you're in love?

241
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,460
Then why did you call me?

242
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,140
My mom wants to break up with me.

243
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,100
I won't.

244
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,940
Anyway, I don't know.

245
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,060
It's okay to be more sincere, right?

246
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,740
We're both pure.

247
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,580
Isn't that right?

248
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,620
You said it?

249
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,140
Yes.

250
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,220
Okay.

251
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,580
Send me the address later.

252
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,660
See you tonight.

253
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,700
Here.

254
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,460
Xiao Mi.

255
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,300
You can go home after you practice.

256
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,300
Just now,

257
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,860
Chu Chu called me.

258
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,980
What does she want?

259
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,740
She wants to buy you a hotpot.

260
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,180
Don't just eat.

261
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,820
We have to talk.

262
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,860
Then go with me.

263
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,740
I'll call you when I'm done.

264
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,580
Where's Xiao Yao?

265
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,580
On a date.

266
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,060
You're dating again?

267
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,340
You gave her your phone number.

268
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,180
Why are you asking?

269
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,740
Let's not talk about Xiao Yao.

270
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm alone now.

271
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,260
Be honest.

272
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,260
I'll buy you a car.

273
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,780
It's not convenient to go out every day.

274
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,580
Xiao Yao and I are good at it.

275
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,820
It's worth it.

276
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,020
I'm not a bad person.

277
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,180
I'm just a good person.

278
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,300
I'm just a good person.

279
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,300
I'm just a good person.

280
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,300
You're a good person.

281
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,940
Only Xiao Yao.

282
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,980
What do you think?

283
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,620
Only you.

284
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,460
Then don't buy a car.

285
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,620
Just buy me a house.

286
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,940
Okay?

287
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,940
Why?

288
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,340
Look.

289
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,420
I won't bother you.

290
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,020
It's your business sooner or later.

291
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,340
Why are you in a hurry?

292
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,580
I want to be earlier.

293
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,740
Anyway,

294
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,740
it's just a few hours of money.

295
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,260
What?

296
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,780
Can I still be free?

297
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,940
I'll get the household register.

298
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,420
I'll take a day off.

299
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:30,940
You go to the

300
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,140
shrine.

301
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,300
Frankly,

302
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,200
I need to work.

303
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,300
What do you need later?

304
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,520
Finally,

305
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,020
I'm soon allocated to bye-bye.

306
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,860
See you.

307
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,020
At 12.20 a.m.,

308
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,540
take a bus on Fengqi Road.

309
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,500
When the이야龍翔橋公交車等紅綠燈的時候,

310
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,100
ketchup was filmed on your car.

311
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,060
But it's unclear.

312
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,140
It took more than an hour to get out of the tunnel.

313
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,780
At 2.17,

314
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,940
the security at the gate of the scenic area

315
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
took you away.

316
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,820
You should be taking a bus when you come back.

317
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,940
The security at Longxiang Bridge

318
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,060
didn't take you away.

319
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,820
It was windy and dark.

320
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,340
At 2.41,

321
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,020
the security at the entrance of Fengling Community

322
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,940
took you to the north

323
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,540
and walked into the convenience store of your grandpa.

324
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,940
At 3.51, the rain stopped.

325
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,420
You came out of the alley.

326
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,700
At the entrance,

327
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,300
if you didn't look up,

328
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,740
the raincoat and the hat were covered.

329
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,100
I couldn't tell it was you.

330
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,740
Do you remember now?

331
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,900
Yes.

332
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,580
You didn't remember anything before?

333
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,460
I came out of the old store.

334
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,900
It was 3.51 here.

335
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,740
I didn't get a shot in the middle.

336
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,460
It was very dark.

337
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,500
The street lights didn't turn on.

338
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,580
I didn't get a shot.

339
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,940
The street lights at my door were on.

340
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,220
The camera

341
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,860
was broken when the wind blew in the afternoon on June 6.

342
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,340
It hasn't been restored yet.

343
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,660
What about the entrance?

344
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,860
This is the entrance. You're there.

345
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,340
I mean,

346
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,180
have I passed by here before?

347
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,580
This is you.

348
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,700
Yes.

349
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Yes.

350
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
I...

351
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,620
I even carried a big bag.

352
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,820
A big backpack.

353
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,580
You never carried a backpack.

354
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,580
I checked the surveillance videos

355
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,300
for more than six hours since I got off work this morning.

356
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,580
I didn't even have lunch.

357
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,460
I'm sorry.

358
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,460
I'm sorry.

359
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
I'm sorry.

360
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,460
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
I'm sorry.

363
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,100
I'm really sorry to trouble you.

364
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,580
Just buy me lunch.

365
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,580
Let's go.

366
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
Now?

367
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,140
Can I take a look again?

368
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,140
Is he your boyfriend?

369
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,820
He said he was.

370
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
But he said he wasn't.

371
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,300
Whatever he said.

372
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,100
He looks so energetic.

373
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
Where did you find him?

374
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,260
Fate.

375
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,860
Fate?

376
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,860
He didn't even admit it.

377
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,260
He's not my boyfriend.

378
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,260
He's my boyfriend.

379
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,260
He's my boyfriend.

380
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,260
He's my boyfriend.

381
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,260
He's my boyfriend.

382
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,260
He's my boyfriend.

383
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,260
He's my boyfriend.

384
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,260
He's my boyfriend.

385
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,260
Married at the end of the year.

386
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,260
Next year, he's on leave.

387
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
Really?

388
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,940
Yes.

389
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,260
You won't come to work

390
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,740
if you find your boyfriend?

391
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,740
Who said that?

392
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,740
You've been working here for over a year.

393
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,260
Everyone is guessing

394
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,740
if you'll find a boyfriend.

395
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
If you find a boyfriend,

396
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,740
you'll definitely change your place.

397
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,740
Dachuan,

398
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,660
you're right.

399
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,540
But before looking at each other,

400
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,940
do you want to because

401
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
you're in love?

402
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,340
I'm a man who loves men more than men.

403
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,100
Do I need more sexail?

404
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,060
Art history is a real art.

405
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,180
It may be hard to understand.

406
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,640
Nothing much.

407
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,220
Not much.

408
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,140
Aren't you gonna front bite it or offer me some representative food?

409
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,440
I've been considering whether to buy nós微辣

410
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,540
since you found this place quitestylish.

411
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,260
Green onion and ginger, a few pieces are enough.

412
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,860
The main thing to eat is the freshness of the lamb.

413
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,620
But the small ingredients are stronger.

414
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,500
Sesame oil, sesame, chopped green onion,

415
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,340
chives, soy bean curd, and shrimp oil.

416
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,620
Nothing can be missing.

417
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,260
You know so much.

418
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,900
How about we leave? There are too many people.

419
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,020
Let's eat something else.

420
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,380
You don't like hot pot?

421
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,900
Basically, I don't eat it.

422
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,820
Then how do you know so much?

423
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,940
I also know that the plane can fly.

424
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,220
I haven't eaten it myself, right?

425
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,980
What do you usually eat?

426
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,300
I'm at home with Beijing.

427
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,940
If I have a business trip, I'll have a big meal.

428
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,020
Where is the big meal?

429
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,620
I ordered wine.

430
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,860
You don't have to go to work tomorrow.

431
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,420
Drink something and sleep.

432
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,100
You and your colleagues

433
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,660
said I was your boyfriend.

434
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,260
They guessed it.

435
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,260
I've never taken a man to work.

436
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,980
Thank you very much today.

437
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,780
If possible,

438
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,460
can you give me another...

439
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,940
Hello, the red wine you ordered.

440
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,900
I don't need to thank you.

441
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,780
One cup.

442
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,700
What did you just say?

443
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,860
It's okay.

444
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,820
We'll talk later.

445
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,940
Thank you.

446
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,340
Don't think too much.

447
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,140
We're just friends.

448
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,060
I just want to find someone to marry this year.

449
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,500
I don't mind.

450
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,180
After eating hot pot,

451
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,420
you don't have to contact me.

452
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,660
Why are you so anxious this year?

453
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,220
Know what is the most real thing in a person's life.

454
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,740
What?

455
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,660
Being afraid of suffering and loneliness.

456
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,500
Afraid of tiredness, failure and no one understands.

457
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,700
Afraid of being angry and no one tolerates.

458
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,140
Afraid of saying strange things that no one understands.

459
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,540
Finding a lover is the most real thing.

460
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,340
After getting married, you don't have to be afraid of anything.

461
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,740
The whole world ignores you.

462
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,980
Two people pretend that the whole world doesn't exist.

463
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,940
Tired together tired.

464
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,580
Happy together happy.

465
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,700
The family is less risky than outside.

466
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,780
Say random things.

467
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,860
Not strong.

468
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,460
You can say that you don't care about anything.

469
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,300
Is it true?

470
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,980
So I'm anxious.

471
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,540
But there are also risks.

472
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,860
On the way, I found that the lover is not myself.

473
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,820
The sky collapsed.

474
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,420
Sometimes it's not at the beginning.

475
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,420
It's not mine at the beginning.

476
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,220
I just found it on the way.

477
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,260
Be more real.

478
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,420
Do you want to drink a little?

479
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,500
I don't drink it.

480
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,740
We two have one to keep sober.

481
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,340
Thank you.

482
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,380
You have been drinking.

483
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,420
I

484
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,140
I don't have time to talk.

485
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,940
I don't want to talk.

486
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,620
Stay longer.

487
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,620
My mom is happy.

488
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,380
Are you a drunkard?

489
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,580
I'm not.

490
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,140
I don't take a drop of work on business trips.

491
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,980
I usually drink a little.

492
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,980
I don't drink.

493
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,980
I don't drink.

494
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,980
I don't drink.

495
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
I don't drink.

496
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,980
I don't drink.

497
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,980
I don't drink.

498
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,980
I don't drink.

499
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,980
I don't drink.

500
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,980
I don't drink.

501
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,620
I don't drink.

502
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,820
Let's take a group photo.

503
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,100
My mom wants to be right.

504
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,900
Let me take a picture.

505
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,900
I'll post it on the Instagram.

506
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,300
You can't do this.

507
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,620
Your face has changed shape.

508
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,660
I'll take a picture with my phone.

509
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,340
Okay?

510
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,180
This is a professional photo.

511
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,180
I'll post it to you.

512
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,180
Let me tell you.

513
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,460
You're holding it like that.

514
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,220
Your arms are short.

515
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,140
It's not easy to find angles.

516
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,140
We can't wrap it.

517
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,740
Look.

518
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,740
Time.

519
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,340
After the time,

520
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,540
find a fixed position.

521
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,660
Like this.

522
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,860
Let's look at the camera.

523
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,580
Five seconds.

524
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,740
Look.

525
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,900
Look.

526
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,620
You take a good picture.

527
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,620
Let me send it to you.

528
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,860
I haven't seen my dad since I was a kid.

529
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,380
No.

530
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,860
Uncle,

531
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,140
how are you doing right now?

532
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,460
I'm fine.

533
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,460
I'm off now.

534
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
We've here for a long time.

535
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
I need to rest early.

536
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
Okay.

537
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,700
Dad,

538
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,620
I'll cut lagi reading immediately.

539
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,620
Okay.

540
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,660
Let meThere are other people here.

541
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,660
Okay.

542
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,460
All right.

543
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,060
We won't have to take risks.

544
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,180
Yeah there won't be any consequences.

545
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,060
I'm not done talking anymore.

546
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,700
Then I'm gonna go home.

547
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,260
Okay.

548
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,620
It is raining.

549
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,460
V宿, how is it going on here?

550
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:26,820
Sit down.

551
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,180
We should be there soon.

552
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,020
I'm sorry.

553
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,820
Actually, I don't remember

554
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,340
what I did.

555
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,580
It's just that on the day of the 6th,

556
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,780
I saw a person

557
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,180
who looked exactly like me

558
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,220
enter my shop.

559
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,860
So I want to know

560
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,300
where he came from,

561
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,300
where he's going,

562
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,060
and where he lives.

563
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,780
So I want to go and have a look.

564
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,300
Find the time tunnel for you?

565
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,140
I'm just checking the surveillance footage.

566
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,460
That day, I...

567
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,900
He...

568
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,300
He carried a big bag.

569
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,820
You carried a big bag,

570
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,940
right?

571
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,420
Yes.

572
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,580
I'll definitely find you a time tunnel.

573
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,020
Are you a science student?

574
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,540
But

575
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,740
my teacher often said that I...

576
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,060
He said I was delusional.

577
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,420
It's okay if I don't get married today.

578
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,180
It's okay if I'm late.

579
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,580
I'll give you a little more time.

580
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,180
I'm sure

581
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,380
I like you.

582
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,580
But anytime

583
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,020
you run away like you did

584
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,020
at the teahouse that day,

585
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,900
it's okay.

586
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,980
It's okay.

587
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,340
When you were three years old,

588
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,500
your mother...

589
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,780
She's gone.

590
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,340
Do you remember how she looked like?

591
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,020
No.

592
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,780
But I know.

593
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,980
Just two.

594
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,980
I found them online.

595
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,780
She left.

596
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,660
She didn't leave

597
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,020
any photos?

598
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,460
No.

599
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,540
Just two photos.

600
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,860
They're still there.

601
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,380
A drama photo?

602
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,860
My mother took it when she played Bai Suzhen.

603
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,500
If I were to dance to Bai Suzhen,

604
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
I'd be like my mother.

605
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,820
Then dance.

606
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,020
Why do you have to date first?

607
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,620
Have you ever been in a relationship?

608
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:37,820
Yes.

609
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,500
Just once.

610
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,980
Then we broke up.

611
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,700
She thought I was abnormal.

612
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,500
That's difficult.

613
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,540
Then she asked.

614
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,620
Why would she ask?

615
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,780
You are working on it with me?

616
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,460
Like what?

617
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,020
Pretending to be him.

618
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,620
What do you mean?

619
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,700
I'm ready

620
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,860
for a love talk online.

621
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,980
And I can answer you

622
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,980
I'm going to have a blind date.

623
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,780
Okay.

624
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,380
Okay.

625
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,220
But you have to promise me one thing.

626
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,740
You're a ballet dancer.

627
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,820
I've never seen a real ballet dancer.

628
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,180
You have to show me one of the most difficult moves

629
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,540
in ballet.

630
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,420
Let me see.

631
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,820
Here.

632
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,100
Okay.

633
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,300
Isn't your family a children's training center?

634
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,820
Our training center...

635
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,020
Our training center...

636
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,420
I'm telling you.

637
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,460
It's unbelievable.

638
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,980
There are kids in every school.

639
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,820
How can they dance?

640
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,100
Besides,

641
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,340
I'm not in a relationship with them, am I?

642
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,740
What are you doing?

643
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,100
It's difficult, right?

644
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,060
Okay.

645
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,780
Okay.

646
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,740
You've done enough practice.

647
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,380
One by one.

648
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,340
On the count of three.

649
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,780
Oh.

650
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,380
Excellent.

651
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,020
Saved.

652
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,700
Get off.

653
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,740
Let me press some tendons.

654
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
I'll send you a message.

655
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,820
Start.

656
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,460
What message?

657
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,460
Your phone.

658
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,300
You go first or me?

659
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,580
I'll wait and see.

660
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,580
I'll wait and see, okay?

661
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,220
Wait and see?

662
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,700
I'm so sick of it.

663
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,300
To be honest,

664
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
I really liked you the first time I saw you.

665
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,300
I'm so happy.

666
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,300
I like you too.

667
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,300
It's...

668
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,300
a love at first sight.

669
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,300
I don't believe it myself.

670
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,300
But that's how it is.

671
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,300
Yesterday...

672
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,300
Yesterday or the day before yesterday...

673
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,300
Yesterday?

674
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,300
Yes, yesterday.

675
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,300
In Guangming Pavilion.

676
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,300
I was a little...

677
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,300
hungry.

678
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,300
You...

679
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,300
Which part are you talking about?

680
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,300
Why is your face red?

681
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,700
Your face...

682
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,100
Your face is red.

683
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,900
I've been drinking.

684
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,900
Start?

685
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,900
Will we...

686
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,300
Will we be together forever?

687
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,300
If you don't like someone else...

688
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,300
I won't.

689
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,300
But I'm not sure.

690
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,300
It's hard to tell.

691
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,300
That means...

692
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,900
you don't like me that much.

693
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,300
I like you very much now.

694
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,300
If I disappear one day,

695
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,300
will you look for me?

696
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Where are you going?

697
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,300
I mean, if...

698
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,300
Will you look for me?

699
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
Why would I?

700
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,300
Come.

701
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,300
It's my turn to ask, right?

702
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,300
Do you...

703
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
love me?

704
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,300
Will you keep looking for me?

705
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,900
Are you serious?

706
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,300
No, I'm not.

707
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,300
Look at you.

708
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,700
You must be serious.

709
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,300
No, no, no.

710
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,700
This is too much.

711
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,700
You can't do this.

712
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,700
I'm just kidding.

713
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,300
Let's play together.

714
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,300
You're quite reliable.

715
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,300
I...

716
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
Go away.

717
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,300
Get out.

718
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,300
Stop fighting.

719
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Stop fighting.

720
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Are you done?

721
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,300
Are you done?

722
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,300
Are you done?

723
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,300
Are you done?

724
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,300
Are you done?

725
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,300
I'm not done.

726
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,700
I'm not done.

727
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,700
funding

728
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,700
ChannelUnknown

729
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,700
You've arrived.

730
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
You,

731
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,280
Wang Jiao is the machine gun.

732
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,060
I should be able to introduce donw to him more easily.

733
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,340
Yes, you are right.

734
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:30,160
But there are several

735
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,020
women된 Northen China in Southible easier nots.

736
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,140
It's okay.

737
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,780
Did you see that photo?

738
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,380
Yes.

739
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,180
We take one photo every New Year.

740
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,500
And my mom changes the photo for me.

741
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,540
You're better than me.

742
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,380
Thank you for your help.

743
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,740
I'm leaving.

744
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,300
Bye.

745
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:39,020
We've become a little different

746
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:45,020
Lost direction

747
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:51,020
Love is on the road, but it's going to be a long way

748
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:58,020
It turns out that there is no need to write down the wind and waves

749
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:05,020
Remember you have the look of my love

750
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:11,020
Run forward together

751
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:18,020
The journey is a pain, the return is a laugh

752
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:26,020
Don't be afraid of the years, it's okay

753
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:37,020
The real us

754
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:43,020
From the time we met

755
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:49,020
Accept everything you have

756
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:55,020
No matter how hard you write

757
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,020
We can reach the faraway

758
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,020
Don't be forced

759
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:15,020
Two hearts are like eyes that see the light

760
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:21,020
Love is a free scene

761
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,020
No matter
