1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
doctoral

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the hall

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wait for the sunset to spread the grass

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my feelings into songs and sing them gently

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Loneliness is like a lonely man

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Accompanying is the custom

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like a fantasy, the beautiful girl is left behind

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Wind and rain, we walk through the ups and downs

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The path of time, from small to large

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
May you and me be together

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Master, do you still remember the way?

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't worry, Mr. Fang has already ordered it.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Master.

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Dad, don't wipe it. I've wiped it once.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's dirty.

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's all dirty.

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Come here and dance.

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What kind of dance is this?

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Uncle Dan, it's mainly from the mirror.

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Look at yourself dancing.

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm tired of doing this every day.

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What's wrong with you? Are you leaving?

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm leaving.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So early?

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You should leave after lunch.

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm not leaving.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's the same as staying at home and waiting at the airport.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You still can't stay?

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Send a WeChat message to Xiao Yao.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I sent it.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How did you reply?

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No reply.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Then call her and tell her that you're on a business trip.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You can't make friends. You'll be a familiar person in the future.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No need.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I've sent her the message I should have.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
She didn't reply. It's like she replied.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And we've discussed it before.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I've spent time with her.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The day of practice and performance has arrived.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If I don't do it, it'll be embarrassing.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll be annoyed.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Besides, she must be busy with her performance today.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You're thoughtful.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm leaving.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Here.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll send you off.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm leaving.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're leaving?

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You've sent me off so many times.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Today...

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll send you off.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Go back.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You can go.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Go back.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Do you have your ID card?

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Your credit card?

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's not the first time I've left.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've never seen you so detailed before.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're so detailed.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're like a stranger to Sheng Li.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're not coming back.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How many days have you left?

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
About ten days.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Send me a message when you arrive.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't worry. I'll take pictures for you.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You didn't take pictures of the square dance yesterday.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll take it when I get back.

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If you really dance the square dance,

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
it'll be very annoying.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'd rather die.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't say that.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Take it.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Take it.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Take it.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I didn't see the play.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Tell her I'm leaving.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm leaving.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We're talking about this.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's not easy for her.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't keep urging her to rent a house.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What do you mean?

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's been a long time.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
She'll give us money.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
She's not that kind of person.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Your life is so hard.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Are you still alive if you're urging her to rent a house?

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Alright.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's go.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's go.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Are we going to the airport?

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll call a cab.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Wait for me at the intersection.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm leaving.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's go in.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll see her later.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't know what to say.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let her say

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
she's nervous when she sees you.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's do it.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You have to let go of your thoughts

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and let your brain reach a state of emptiness.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Your spirit and body

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
will be fully rejuvenated.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Your spirit and body

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
will be fully rejuvenated.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Xiao Mi.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yao Yao and Yin Ye

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
have the most selfish thoughts.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Qiao Mi

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
is the most simple.

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm stupid.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Selfish thoughts

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
are not good.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's not wrong to be greedy.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Being emotional is the root of art.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't be trapped by your own feelings.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is really a good move.

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you want a cab?

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
No.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll call a cab this afternoon.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll call a cab this afternoon.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll call a cab this afternoon.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll call a cab this afternoon.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're so busy this afternoon.

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm so worried that I can't see her.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I was going to find her.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She's not in a good mood.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Xiao Mi.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What are you doing?

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't walk around, Yao Yao.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There's a level.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
There's no one to help you.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You don't accept interviews.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Go to sleep.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Go to sleep.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yao Yao, Yao Yao, hurry up.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Come on.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you, everyone.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Thank you.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Then,

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
15 minutes later,

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
she has to eat.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
15 minutes later,

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
come one by one.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Four days, that's it.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Come on, Brother Xiao.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The meal is on the table.

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Go in yourself.

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Calm down.

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Calm down.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hurry.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's coming out.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Miss Wen is here.

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Miss Wen, hurry.

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Miss Wen, please open the door.

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Miss Wen, please open the door.

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Open the door.

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Miss Wen, please open the door.

221
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,940
We are doing it today,

222
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,580
okay?

223
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,940
What happened?

224
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,380
At the airport?

225
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,280
Soon.

226
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,900
Why so flower?

227
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,540
Is something wrong?

228
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,060
Where did you go before?

229
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,700
Why did I bother?

230
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,100
You're not going to find Xiao Yao, are you?

231
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,900
If I go to her, do I need to buy a ticket?

232
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,700
I'm so upset.

233
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
There must be a demon.

234
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,700
Yes, I just went to Xiao Yao.

235
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,100
Are you with her now?

236
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,100
The security guard didn't answer.

237
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,100
If that's the case, come back.

238
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,100
If you can't let go, how can you leave?

239
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,700
I really can't let go.

240
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,900
What do you think?

241
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,700
I feel bad.

242
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,500
Little girl is pretty good.

243
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,700
You two have a foundation.

244
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,100
Come back and talk to me.

245
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,900
Go back.

246
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,300
I'm already at the airport.

247
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,100
Who are you fooling?

248
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
You can't leave in this mood.

249
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Then I'll really come back.

250
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Come back.

251
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,500
I'll be relieved when I come back.

252
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,900
I'm hanging up. I'm getting off the car.

253
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,500
Okay.

254
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,900
Your Brother Tong loves you.

255
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,100
He wants me to give you a rent.

256
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Give him two months.

257
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,900
Half a year won't do.

258
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,500
Really?

259
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,300
Give him three days.

260
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Brother Tong is so nice.

261
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,100
Brother Tong, do you want me to accompany you?

262
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,500
You're already asking me?

263
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,500
Why are you getting off the car here?

264
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,700
Are you trying to fool me?

265
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Enough.

266
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,100
Come in.

267
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,900
Get on the car.

268
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Where are your luggage?

269
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,100
What do you mean?

270
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,500
You don't want to go to Xiao Yao, right?

271
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,700
Hello, Auntie.

272
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,100
You are...

273
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Hello, Auntie.

274
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,900
My name is Xu Tian. I'm from Hangzhou.

275
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,700
We came to visit Zhou Tong.

276
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,100
This is my girlfriend.

277
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,900
Shi Dian Dian.

278
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,500
Zhou Tong.

279
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,900
Zhou Tong.

280
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,700
Zhou Tong.

281
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,900
That auntie was Zhou Tong's mother?

282
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,100
Zhou Tong isn't here.

283
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,100
She went to Malaysia.

284
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,900
What did you say?

285
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,700
About you.

286
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Let's go.

287
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,300
We're leaving now?

288
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,500
She's not here.

289
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,900
Let's go.

290
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,500
Wait a minute. Open the door.

291
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,500
Open it.

292
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
What is it?

293
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,300
Let's not bother her anymore.

294
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,900
I don't have time.

295
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,500
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,780
I'm Zhou Teng's mother.

297
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,380
You're here, too.

298
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,660
Come in and have a seat.

299
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,500
I'll wait for you in the car.

300
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,460
I'm at the airport now.

301
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,140
I'm going to Malaysia.

302
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,620
Thank you for the six days.

303
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,500
I really mean it.

304
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,660
Even if I'm a fool,

305
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,740
I really like you.

306
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,260
I wish Bai Suzhen a successful performance.

307
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,780
Wen Xiaolang, can we start?

308
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,900
You can sit here and look at the camera.

309
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,620
Sorry, this is my stuff.

310
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,700
Your stuff.

311
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,620
No one's here?

312
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,420
Xiaoxiao, you really own the stuff.

313
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,740
You idiot.

314
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,840
I was the one who made Xiao Mi watch the video.

315
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,440
Without you, Bai Su Zhen wouldn't exist.

316
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,240
Forget what we said in Changcheng.

317
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,440
I love you, Zhou Tong.

318
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,640
Can we start now?

319
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,240
I'll make a video call first.

320
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,040
If you don't want to talk, just leave it there.

321
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,640
Okay.

322
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,740
Bai Su Zhen

323
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,240
How do you understand this dance, Bai Su Zhen?

324
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,240
I've never been in a relationship.

325
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,940
Because of Bai Su Zhen, I met someone called Zhou Tong.

326
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,240
From the first time we met until today,

327
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,140
I've loved him for six days.

328
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,940
I hope that I can be with him every day in the future.

329
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,640
I hope that he can come to watch this performance.

330
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,440
Without him, there wouldn't be Bai Su Zhen in my heart.

331
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,140
Bai Su Zhen gave up on cultivating to become a mortal for Xu Xian.

332
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,940
If it wasn't for Zhou Tong, I'd rather not be here today.

333
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,940
Will he come to watch your performance?

334
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,940
Can we start now?

335
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,540
Eat.

336
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,840
in this àsんです

337
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,440
Let's go.

338
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,180
You are really a person, a life

339
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,060
Look

340
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,740
Your mother died when you were seven

341
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,260
I served Shengsheng for three years

342
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,900
Actually I didn't do anything

343
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,060
Just go to the pharmacy every day to get medicine

344
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,020
Go home and fry

345
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,620
Pour for her

346
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,700
I want to take care of her all the time

347
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
what

348
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,900
What job do you do now

349
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,540
I do distance sales

350
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,220
My family was originally a shop

351
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,540
Mom was后

352
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,260
Look how good this is

353
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,020
Isn't it like my son

354
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,920
Walking with the wind

355
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,500
wandering

356
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,620
By then you will know when you see him

357
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,980
Aunt Sun

358
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,420
in fact

359
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,340
I came to see

360
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,300
Not necessarily

361
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,780
I want to see him

362
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,900
just

363
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,820
I've been thinking about it for many years

364
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,300
in fact

365
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,340
After I got here

366
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,820
Just put it all down

367
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,940
What are you thinking about

368
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,580
Those things

369
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,740
Not good to tell you

370
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,220
I'm already very rude

371
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,740
Come and disturb if you don't know

372
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,340
Thank you for your tea

373
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,820
Nothing

374
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,260
You drink more tea

375
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,300
Actually your girlfriend

376
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,180
I've told me something about you

377
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,140
If you don't say it

378
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,940
I won't let you sit on the table

379
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,860
I almost took you as my son

380
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,260
I said Zhou Tong went out today

381
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,540
Why is it a bit strange

382
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,020
It turns out to be like this

383
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,500
Zhou Tong Zhou Tong

384
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,540
Here, here, look at him, look at him

385
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,020
The next wave of reporters will be interviewed soon

386
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,340
Where are you

387
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,140
High speed at the airport

388
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,660
What are you crazy about

389
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,700
Go to the airport

390
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,860
I'm sick

391
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,620
Do you miss me

392
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,260
Do you miss me

393
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,540
What do you want to say

394
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,020
You wait for him for me

395
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,140
Look

396
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,420
This is Sister Ning's

397
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,180
Lend me my dressing room for the time being

398
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
Just me

399
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
Come quickly

400
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Come in

401
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,860
Wen Jian Yang, can we start

402
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,260
I said big star, big star

403
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,300
You hang up first

404
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,540
Otherwise you are busy

405
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,900
You are here, I will be at the door

406
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,100
I'll send you a WeChat, okay?

407
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,180
I won't hang up

408
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,420
You hurry up

409
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,980
I want to

410
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,860
I hope I can get in the city without a traffic jam

411
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,860
Eat a orange

412
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,300
Thank you auntie

413
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,420
When mom left

414
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,820
Tell me

415
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,700
There is no money in the world

416
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,580
But I was young at that time

417
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,180
There must be a reason to continue living

418
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,780
So I always fantasize about another myself

419
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,940
I knew it was impossible after I grew up

420
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,460
But time has passed

421
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,820
Thoughts are also stubborn

422
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,780
Yes

423
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,100
Always alone

424
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,340
Psychological boredom, right?

425
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,780
From June 6th to today

426
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,820
Just like a roller coaster

427
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,580
All the old ideas were broken

428
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,180
Sit here today

429
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Chat with you

430
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,780
My girlfriend is waiting for me in the car downstairs

431
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,060
Think about it

432
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,380
All the old days

433
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,580
All the things I experienced

434
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,660
All the things

435
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,020
All for

436
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,740
Let me meet her

437
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,860
She always thinks

438
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,540
How good it is to meet me

439
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,340
Actually I understand

440
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,980
Because I met her

441
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,500
This life

442
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,260
I just started living again

443
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,620
What is your girlfriend called Dian Dian

444
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,860
Shi Dian Dian

445
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,940
You have to be nice to others

446
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,900
Aunt Song

447
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,660
It feels so good to talk to you

448
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,740
This is fate

449
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,900
There are so many strange things in the world

450
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,540
I didn't say you two look alike

451
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,900
Aunt Song, I'll go first

452
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,020
Just go

453
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,700
It's already rude

454
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,540
I'm sorry

455
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,020
That's what I said

456
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,820
Come, let me send you

457
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,060
Aunt Song

458
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,700
I can go up and have a look

459
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,380
Don't go up

460
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,420
People are not here

461
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,300
Three rooms upstairs

462
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,780
One living room, two bedrooms

463
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,940
Which room is his

464
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,900
It's a study room and a bedroom

465
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,100
It's a mess

466
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,620
Actually, when No. 6 was in Hangzhou

467
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,860
I met him

468
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,660
It was raining that day

469
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,460
He happened to be in my store

470
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,300
Change clothes

471
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,980
Yes, no wonder

472
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,900
He came back from Hangzhou

473
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,420
That dress is all wet

474
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,740
He is in Hangzhou on June 6

475
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,300
Correct

476
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,260
Later in the monitoring, I also saw him

477
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,900
Come to monitor

478
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,060
Otherwise, how did you meet my girlfriend

479
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,820
To your shop

480
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,740
Why didn't Zhou Tong tell me when he came back

481
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,620
It was dark that day

482
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,500
The shop was also shut down

483
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,300
He may not have seen my face

484
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
Yes yes yes

485
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,860
Zhou Tong came back and took your photo

486
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,340
Just on that bus

487
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,380
I said

488
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,700
Then I'm leaving, aunt

489
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,500
Still in Beijing

490
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,140
Not coming

491
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,020
After going back

492
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,940
Live a peaceful life with Dian Dian

493
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,340
Your girlfriend is so good

494
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,060
thank you

495
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,940
You are too polite

496
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,780
Let's go

497
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,500
I am the first actor in Beijing's three shows

498
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,980
I can play Bai Suzhen

499
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,220
I just want to thank Yun Jie for guiding me

500
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,540
And director

501
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,220
Mother

502
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,340
I'm making a video

503
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,500
You broke me

504
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,500
What's the matter? So unbearable

505
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,620
The most important thing in the world

506
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,820
Director Song, I officially announce to you

507
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,820
Comrade Wen Xiaoyang has come to terms with it

508
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,060
Is your daughter-in-law

509
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,620
What big horse moon ball

510
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,740
I won't go anywhere

511
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,940
In the future, I will be at home every day to serve you

512
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,220
Take your daughter-in-law Wen Xiaoyang

513
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,540
Serve you together

514
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,580
Where are you

515
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,420
I won't say it, I'll be fast

516
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,780
you

517
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,780
This kid is so strong

518
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,620
Hungry

519
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,420
Do you still watch the play?

520
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,940
Time is fast

521
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,980
No

522
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,500
What about Zhou Tong

523
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,780
I don't watch it either

524
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,140
What do you want to eat

525
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,380
Listen to you

526
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,540
Listen to me

527
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,380
After eating, we will go back to Hangzhou

528
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,580
In the future, everything will be according to your arrangement

529
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,900
I like arrangements the most

530
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,820
I should have gone to Sihuan just now

531
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,620
You said this point is going to the city

532
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,500
Can't you understand

533
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,420
Sihuan can't come up

534
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,100
More ungraceful

535
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,900
Director Song

536
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
I finished the interview

537
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,460
I can't do this anymore

538
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,100
Heart-struck

539
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,980
Why is the heart-struck

540
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,100
Afraid of time and death, you are gone again

541
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,020
Then why did you go to the airport

542
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,220
Life is fate, right

543
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,500
I am so happy

544
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,540
Then you promise me

545
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,460
You are mine

546
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,380
Do you still have to promise

547
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,780
I told my mother

548
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,140
You are mine

549
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,060
I am mine

550
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,300
All mine

551
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,180
Your attitude can be good

552
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,020
Can you come and see me

553
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,900
What happened

554
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,860
Hurry up and wait for you

555
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,540
Hand in hand

556
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,900
One hour left

557
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,500
Make-up warm-up activity

558
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,780
And before you prepare for the role

559
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,580
Don't call again

560
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,700
I'm really anxious with you

561
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,620
You ask Yang Yun

562
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,180
How does a good actor prepare for the role

563
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,820
Enter the role three days in advance

564
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,100
I'm wrong, director

565
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,020
How about xiao yang

566
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,940
Do you feel like a big star

567
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,180
Why do you have you everywhere

568
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,380
Go back to your own makeup room

569
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,380
Xiao Yang didn't put on makeup either

570
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,260
Uncle Hui

571
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
All here

572
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,580
Come come come

573
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,500
Just right

574
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,580
Here

575
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,820
Come come come

576
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,740
Come come come

577
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,100
Look at this look at this look at this look at this look at this

578
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,620
I don't shoot

579
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,180
Yao Yao

580
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,100
I told you everything I should say

581
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,060
In five minutes

582
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,060
Closed class

583
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,220
Am I a guest

584
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,620
I am a guest

585
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,940
Sorry director

586
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,820
Too much pressure

587
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
Let's make way

588
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,780
Uncle Hui

589
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,380
Can you help me to the door later

590
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,180
Wait for Zhou Tong to give him a ticket

591
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,140
Did he give him a ticket again

592
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,340
I haven't given him yet

593
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,580
I have

594
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,100
Take pictures first

595
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,780
it is good

596
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,740
Good

597
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,060
All right

598
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,260
Don't be nervous

599
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,340
I'll go to the door

600
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,380
Come on

601
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,180
Yeah

602
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,740
Really

603
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,140
Zhou Butong really came

604
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,980
I was going to Malaysia

605
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,540
I came back to the airport

606
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,980
You two said it

607
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,260
What did you say

608
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,900
I called him back

609
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,180
Zhou Butong didn't say anything bad about me, right

610
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,380
Say your good words

611
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,500
That's fine

612
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,180
What about in the future

613
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,540
I'm his person

614
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,060
How are you his person

615
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,780
What should I do

616
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,500
I am still yours

617
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,340
He is our person

618
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,660
It's our person

619
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,180
I'm going to call my brother-in-law

620
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,980
almost

621
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,980
Then I will treat him as Xu Xian

622
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,020
Wait for him to make a mistake

623
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,300
Help me supervise him

624
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,700
Go

625
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,140
Draw a dog

626
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,060
Close the door

627
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,220
Ah

628
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,140
Oh my god

629
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,180
Is this the old heaven going to kill me

630
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,020
This

631
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,660
We have to be at the lake

632
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,220
It's faster than driving

633
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,820
No

634
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,500
I got off the car

635
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,540
Drive away

636
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,580
Who can afford it

637
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,380
I take the subway

638
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,460
Take a train, run a train

639
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,220
Much stronger than this

640
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,620
What's the hurry

641
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,100
Re-marriage

642
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,020
Thank you

643
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,060
Give a good review

644
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,740
Great

645
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,660
Can you eat it like this

646
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,660
A little bit

647
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,700
Then let's see something else

648
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,940
Jiang Zhe Cai

649
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,900
Just come to Beijing once

650
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,380
I have to eat Jiang Zhe Cai

651
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,940
Don't come anymore

652
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,740
I won't go anywhere in the future

653
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,460
Back to Hangzhou

654
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,820
You go to the lake

655
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,900
I'll go to the lake

656
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
I'll go to the lake

657
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,940
I'll go to the lake

658
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
I'll go to the lake

659
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
I'll go to the lake

660
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,940
I'll go to the lake

661
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,940
I'll go to the lake

662
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,860
You go to work

663
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,860
I make cheongsam

664
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,220
What if I don't go to work

665
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,220
I can support you

666
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,060
Roasted duck

667
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,820
There is a four-star

668
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,420
Won't you call your mother

669
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,820
We eat it ourselves

670
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:52,860
it is good

671
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,780
I'm warm

672
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,580
Uncle Gui is at the gate of the bar

673
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,260
Call Auntie Song to watch the show

674
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,900
I'm in the subway, right away

675
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,840
Sit down

676
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,540
Sit down

677
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,260
Sir, the entrance has already been set up

678
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,100
Come really

679
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,340
Second, little crazy

680
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,780
G flagship

681
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,260
Not yet

682
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:47,700
It won't get off

683
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,540
No problem

684
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,420
I'm so tired

685
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,180
it's for you

686
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,140
Hello sir

687
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,980
hello

688
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,500
Excuse me

689
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,020
that's me

690
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,620
A feet

691
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,620
太远了

692
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,060
Not far

693
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
I'm fine with you.

694
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,220
You don't want your ears?

695
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
I can even give you my eyes.

696
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,580
You're not afraid of losing me?

697
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,740
You can't lose me like this?

698
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
Then close your eyes.

699
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,660
Don't walk too fast.

700
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,820
You peeked?

701
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,580
No.

702
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
I'll tie you up.

703
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,060
It's urgent.

704
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,780
Excuse me.

705
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,020
Thank you.

706
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,820
Thank you.

707
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,780
Right away, Xiao Yao.

708
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,980
I'm leaving the subway.

709
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,780
Mom, what's up?

710
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,780
I didn't hear the phone.

711
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,780
The kids are here for class.

712
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,780
What are you doing?

713
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,780
It's okay.

714
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,780
Well,

715
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,780
we'll go to Xiao Yao's performance later.

716
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,780
President Qiao is waiting for us at the gate of the bar.

717
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,780
President Qiao again?

718
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
I'm going.

719
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,780
You're just saying that?

720
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
Son.

721
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,780
What's wrong?

722
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,780
Let me tell you.

723
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,780
Today, you left not long ago.

724
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,780
A person named Xu Tian came from Hangzhou.

725
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,780
I found him exactly like you.

726
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,980
I recognized him as you.

727
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
A man from the south.

728
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,980
He's a man of his own.

729
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,980
When it was raining in Hangzhou,

730
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,980
you changed clothes in his shop.

731
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,980
Do you remember?

732
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,980
He came to Beijing to look for you.

733
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,980
He talked to me for a while.

734
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,980
He said he'd come home and live a peaceful life.

735
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,980
Why don't you talk to me?

736
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,980
I'm telling you, I don't have time to go.

737
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,980
Hello?

738
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,980
Hello?

739
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
Here.

740
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,980
What's wrong with you?

741
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
What's wrong?

742
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
What's wrong?

743
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,980
He just got hit by a car.

744
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,980
He's been hit.

745
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,980
You saw it?

746
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,980
You saw it?

747
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,980
Do you have a mouth and teeth here?

748
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
No.

749
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
Don't be afraid.

750
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,980
It doesn't matter.

751
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,980
Is he having a bad hit?

752
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
I don't know.

753
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,980
I don't know.

754
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,700
Wait for me here.

755
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
Where are you going?

756
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,300
To the bathroom.

757
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
I'll order first.

758
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,020
Wait for me here.

759
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,980
Wait for me here.

760
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,980
Bye.

761
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,820
What are you doing?

762
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,980
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

763
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,980
Are you his girlfriend?

764
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,980
Your phone.

765
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Hurry up.

766
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
Hello, son.

767
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,980
Are you at the theater?

768
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,980
I'm so nervous since you went out today.

769
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,980
What day is it today?

770
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,980
Have you seen Xiaoyang?

771
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,980
Hello.

772
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,980
Who?

773
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
Why are you crying?

774
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,980
Why?

775
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,980
I'm Dian Dian.

776
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,980
Dian Dian?

777
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,980
You're with Zhou Tong?

778
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
I went to the hospital.

779
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,980
Zhou Tong was hit by a car.

780
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,980
Zhou Tong.

781
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,980
Zhou Tong.

782
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,980
Zhou Tong.

783
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,980
Zhou Tong.

784
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,980
Zhou Tong.

785
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,980
Zhou Tong.

786
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,980

788
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,980
Zhou Tong.

789
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,980
Zhou Tong.

790
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,980
Zhou Tong.

791
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,980
Zhou Tong.

792
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,980
Zhou Tong.

793
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,980
Zhou Tong.

794
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Zhou Tong.

795
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,980
Zhou Tong.

796
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,980
Zhou Tong.

797
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,980
Zhou Tong.

798
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,980
Zhou Tong.

799
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,980
Zhou Tong.

800
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,980
Zhou Tong.

801
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,980
Zhou Tong.

802
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,980
Zhou Tong.

803
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,980
Zhou Tong.

804
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,980
Zhou Tong.

805
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,980
Zhou Tong.

806
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,980
Zhou Tong.

807
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,980
Zhou Tong.

808
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,980
Zhou Tong.

809
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,980
Zhou Tong.

810
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,980
Zhou Tong.

811
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,980
Zhou Tong.

812
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,980
Zhou Tong.

813
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,980
Zhou Tong.

814
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,980
Zhou Tong.

815
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,980
Are you nervous?

816
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,980
Not at all.

817
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,980
I feel a little bit.

818
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,980
Zhou Tong should be under houseby.

819
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,980
For sure.

820
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,080
Later it all disappears?

821
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,980
You can succeed.

822
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,340
If there's still aande he has been looking up

823
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,740
to the mountain on Swingsan Mountain,

824
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,100
is it possible that Gu ranked up just now?

825
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,140
He's only got one opponent left.

826
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,580
He's going to win.

827
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,100
The next day,

828
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,820
Gu had a journey for an hour.

829
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,980
I will be your friend forever

830
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,980
I will be your friend forever

831
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,980
I will be your friend forever

832
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,980
I will be your friend forever

833
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,980
I will be your friend forever

834
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,980
I will be your friend forever

835
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,980
I will be your friend forever

836
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,980
I will be your friend forever

837
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,980
The real us

838
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:01,980
From the moment we met

839
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,980
Accept everything about you

840
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:14,980
No matter how hard we try

841
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,980
We can reach the far distance

842
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,980
No need to be aggrieved

843
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:34,980
Two hearts are like the eyes that see the scenery

844
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,980
We understand that love is a free and unwavering thing

845
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,980
It's okay
