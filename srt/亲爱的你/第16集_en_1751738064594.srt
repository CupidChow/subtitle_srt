1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Your dress 空心 blessed by the humans

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I read the book you love in the hall

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Watch the butterflies dance with the wind

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wait for the sunset to spread the grass

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I write my heart into a song and sing it gently

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Loneliness is like a lonely man

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Accompanying is the return

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like a fantasy, the beautiful girl is left behind

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Wind and rain, walking through the ups and downs

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Time goes by, from small to large

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
May you and me be together

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 1

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Long Ballad

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm leaving. Take care of the shop.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Xiao Yue

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mr. Fang

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Uncle, is this the suit?

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's a bit too much today.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mr. Fang, this is my best suit.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's not.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mr. Fang, which car do I take?

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The one behind. He doesn't want to talk.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, okay, okay. See you later.

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
See you later.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hurry up, brother.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wait for me.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's go.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's go.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's go.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Mr. Fang, this is mine.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't put the sofa in the bedroom.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How about the living room?

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This way.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Be careful.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Be careful.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Be careful.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mr. Fang

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm thinking about the meal again.

42
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What's that?

43
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't know.

44
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't know.

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know.

46
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't know.

47
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know.

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The wind is a star.

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Only one flower a year.

50
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Only a dozen days.

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It usually looks like this.

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Long green leaves like water grass.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
When will it bloom?

54
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's all done.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Please sign it.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay.

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll sign it.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Where's the cheongsam?

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
My mother and Mr. Song Nan

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
made cheongsam for two days.

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's in the room downstairs.

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Mother's body was bruised.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The year when the thunder tower was rebuilt,

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
she left.

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mother told me

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
if she wasn't by my side one day,

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
it was just that she went to another time and waited for me.

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
There's the same mother and me.

69
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Are you done with your homework?

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mr. Xiao's life is the same as his mother.

71
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Is he sick too?

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
After that show,

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
he never showed up again.

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He's back.

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Please sign it.

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think there's enough for me to sign through.

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's time.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Is it cold?

79
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Never mind.

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm here.

81
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,200
Xu Tian, mom is here.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Sister.

83
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,480
Dian Dian.

84
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,040
Mom.

85
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,000
Grandpa.

86
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Don't stand here.

87
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,040
Come in.

88
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,360
Come in.

89
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:26,520
Come in.

90
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:26,720
Come in.

91
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,360
Come in.

92
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,800
Come in.

93
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,360
Come in.

94
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,960
Come in.

95
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,520
Come in.

96
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:29,640
Come in.

97
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,120
Come in.

98
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,760
Dian Dian's dad is here, too.

99
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,720
He's waiting for us in the hotel.

100
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,920
You don't need to introduce Mr. Fang, do you?

101
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,000
Mr. Fang.

102
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,120
You still don't change your words?

103
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,800
After a few days,

104
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,160
Dian Dian and Mr. Fang will come back from Guangzhou.

105
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
They will get married.

106
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,160
They will have a wedding banquet.

107
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,240
I'll pay for the wedding banquet.

108
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,840
I have the money to pay for the wedding banquet.

109
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,880
Mr. Fang.

110
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,960
I'll pay for the banquet.

111
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,400
How much is it in total?

112
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,040
Don't stay here and wait.

113
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,640
Go up and check the new room.

114
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,840
We'll have dinner in the hotel.

115
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,400
Dian Dian.

116
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,960
Take everyone up there.

117
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,520
Grandpa, you go up first.

118
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,080
I'll go last.

119
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,880
Aunt. Aunt.

120
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,560
Aunt.

121
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,520
Be gentle.

122
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,160
Wait.

123
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,840
Don't stay there.

124
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,520
Go up and check the new room.

125
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,560
Be careful.

126
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,480
Don't break it.

127
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,120
Is it annoying?

128
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,600
So many people.

129
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,840
They are all family members.

130
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,880
I'll take you to get something later.

131
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,760
What?

132
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
You'll know when you get there.

133
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,520
Tomorrow, my mother and I will go to Guangzhou.

134
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,680
I'll be back in three days.

135
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,640
She'll be back in a month.

136
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,160
My mother wants to talk to me at the hotel.

137
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
I want to talk to my mother, too.

138
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,160
It's not a talk.

139
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,360
It's a heart-to-heart talk.

140
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,160
Then,

141
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
should I be nervous?

142
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,560
You can be.

143
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,960
Go up and stay with them.

144
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,760
Okay.

145
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,800
'

146
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,080
Don't move.

147
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,960
It's a serious business.

148
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,200
Since Yang Yun has been in the office and spoken,

149
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,560
anything else must have been said to this problem.

150
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,120
Have you well-안� 갖 staring Yang Yun?

151
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,760
No.

152
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,840
You're the director.

153
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,840
You're an art senior.

154
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,080
Do you want to listen to your opinion

155
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,400
about the direction of the play?

156
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,880
Senior?

157
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,280
That sounds like a person.

158
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,720
They're all your juniors.

159
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,920
Yang Yingying has recovered.

160
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
She's done enough.

161
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,320
Is the troupe

162
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,360
going to recover the White Snake Tour

163
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,400
or the scenic spot?

164
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,400
Let's decide today.

165
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,960
Scenic spot?

166
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,120
Is she new here?

167
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,840
You have to register your name

168
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
and phone number.

169
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,040
My name is Qiao Guanghui.

170
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,720
No one can do that.

171
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,520
This register book was messed up before.

172
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,560
I've sorted it out.

173
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,760
Who are you looking for?

174
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,400
It's in the room...

175
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,360
No rules.

176
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,240
Let me register.

177
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,120
The poem written by Li Shangyin is called

178
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,960
The Precious Color.

179
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
I gave the name to the new play.

180
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,640
As long as the White Snake Tour

181
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,480
is cut off and the lake is in two,

182
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,000
the relationship between Bai Suzhen and Xiao Qing

183
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,920
was mentioned to you before the accident in October.

184
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,000
You're the director and you're the rehearsal.

185
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,800
Is that so, Mr. Yang?

186
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,360
The team encourages the artistic team.

187
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,360
Is Xiao Qing still Qiao Min?

188
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,120
Is it the film or the show?

189
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,080
Do we need the show?

190
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,760
I'm sure we do.

191
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,760
What about Bai Suzhen?

192
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,920
Me?

193
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,120
You're the director, you're the rehearsal,

194
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,280
you're the dance.

195
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
You've made the decision.

196
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,960
What are we still deciding here?

197
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,040
Raise your hand.

198
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,800
If you agree,

199
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
you'll be more active.

200
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,320
You're old and you're new.

201
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,400
The new play needs the director's guidance.

202
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,560
Raise your hand if you agree to the new play.

203
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,360
Where's Wen Xiaoyao?

204
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,320
I haven't contacted her for the past few days.

205
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,720
She's doing fine.

206
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,520
Isn't it because of her?

207
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,160
Xiaoyao's three first shows are over.

208
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,280
She doesn't value her artistic life at all.

209
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,240
Don't talk about life.

210
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,280
I won't agree.

211
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm against it.

212
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,960
It's useless to object.

213
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,320
You guys do your best.

214
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,760
I can't do it.

215
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,880
Where's Wen Xiaoyao?

216
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,440
Dad.

217
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,240
I need to register.

218
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,720
Get out of the way.

219
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,480
Guys, don't be anxious.

220
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,120
Dad.

221
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,240
I'm a fool.

222
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,360
You want me to register?

223
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,720
Do you know who I am?

224
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,720
I need to register.

225
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,200
Mr. Yang.

226
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,200
Mr. Qiao is here.

227
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,080
You're here to pick up your daughter.

228
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,240
Where are you going?

229
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,440
Register.

230
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,080
I...

231
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,240
Register?

232
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,040
I'm waiting for you.

233
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,720
Sign.

234
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,680
I don't lack information.

235
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,320
specified

236
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,280
Lu Wanqing

237
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,000
Xiaoyao.

238
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,220
Father will

239
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,300
pick me up for her mock exam today.

240
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,160
Thank you, Uncle He Hui.

241
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,200
I live near the友 Hotel.

242
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,720
When I'm in友 Hotel tomorrow,

243
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,960
I'll take you home.

244
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:27,200
What's wrong with you?

245
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,200
I'm telling you a joke.

246
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,200
When I was studying, my dream was to become a scientist.

247
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Later, I found that some people wanted to be painters,

248
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
some people wanted to be writers.

249
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
What is my dream now?

250
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
What?

251
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,200
To be a family with you.

252
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Is that funny?

253
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Hello, my name is Xu.

254
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
I booked a ring here before.

255
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Then come with me.

256
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
When did you book it?

257
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Last month, the 10th.

258
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Here.

262
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Let me see. Have you paid?

263
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
I've paid the deposit, Mrs. Xu.

264
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Why don't you try it?

265
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
How is it, Mrs. Xu? Is it suitable?

266
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
It's not Mrs. Xu yet.

267
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Is it a little big?

268
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
It's just right.

269
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
I think it's a little big.

270
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Wait a minute, I'll adjust it for you.

271
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Is it too expensive?

272
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
It's not expensive. It's only once in a lifetime.

273
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
I should pay for it.

274
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Of course it should be me.

275
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Give it back.

276
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Do you like it?

277
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
I like it.

278
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Come, Mrs. Xu, try it again.

279
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm sorry, let me ask.

280
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Can you give it back?

281
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,200
This is a customized one. I'm afraid.

282
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Then I'll change to another one.

283
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Okay, let me see which one you need.

284
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
How about these?

285
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
This one.

286
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,200
This one, this one, and this one.

287
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Please have a look at these.

288
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
This one is simple and not elegant.

289
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,200
This one can also be customized for you.

290
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Look, this ring can be engraved with your name,

291
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
anniversary, fingerprint, etc.

292
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
But this one is cheaper than the deposit.

293
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
How about this?

294
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Wait a minute.

295
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
This is the only one.

296
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
There can be no discount.

297
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Sister Dian.

298
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Dad.

299
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Okay.

300
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Dian Dian is here.

301
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Mr. Shi.

302
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Xitian, have a seat.

303
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Sit down.

304
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
You gave me so much stuff.

305
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Let's talk and wait for the wine.

306
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Sit down.

307
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Sit down.

308
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Today is December 10th.

309
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
You two met on October 9th.

310
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Just two people.

311
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
We met in June.

312
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,200
My grandpa introduced us to each other in the first summer.

313
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
You want me to tell you or me to tell you?

314
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Mr. Fang, you tell me.

315
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Xitian, do you love Dian Dian?

316
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Yes.

317
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Love where?

318
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,200
It's easy to be with Dian Dian.

319
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,200
And it's safe.

320
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Dian Dian is very good to me.

321
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,200
So I have to be good to Dian Dian.

322
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,200
No matter what he becomes in the future, I won't change.

323
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,200
But this has nothing to do with love.

324
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
He is good to you.

325
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
So you are good to him.

326
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,200
But you two have never been in a relationship.

327
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Don't blame me.

328
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
According to the old rules,

329
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
after drinking the engagement wine,

330
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,200
your daughter is yours.

331
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Take her to Guangzhou tomorrow to do the procedures.

332
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Come back.

333
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
You two choose a date.

334
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Go to the civil service office to register.

335
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
When will you go to Guangzhou?

336
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Dian Dian was born in Guangzhou.

337
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Do you want to go together?

338
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
The little grandpa is rushing.

339
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Other relatives are waiting.

340
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
The foundation of love is trust.

341
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
No preservation.

342
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
I know.

343
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
The things hidden in the stomach,

344
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,200
in fact, we guessed it together.

345
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,200
I think it's better to tell it from the beginning.

346
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Solve it.

347
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Xu Tian knows about my things.

348
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,200
No, he doesn't.

349
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,200
What do you mean?

350
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
I don't need to know.

351
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Let Xu Tian know.

352
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Actually, I always want to tell you.

353
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
What?

354
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
I won't let you say.

355
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
I don't have.

356
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I came back from Beijing in October.

357
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
I was at the airport at night.

358
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
You said Zhou Tong was sent to the hospital.

359
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
It's okay.

360
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,200
It's all one thing.

361
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
It's one thing after another.

362
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,200
At that time, you couldn't tell who was who.

363
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Now you have to live with Xu Tian.

364
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Zhou Tong, why go to the hospital?

365
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
On October 18th,

366
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
I was holding you on the road.

367
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200
He was right across the road.

368
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
He passed by with his body.

369
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
We're fine.

370
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,200
He was hit by a car.

371
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,200
I was very scared at that time.

372
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Then I sent him to the hospital.

373
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I saw him.

374
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I seem to have seen you.

375
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
My brain is messed up.

376
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
He's fine.

377
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm afraid you're in trouble.

378
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Then he...

379
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Did he see me?

380
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Look at it.

381
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Then Auntie Song came.

382
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
There is a man.

383
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,200
I came out to call my mother.

384
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

385
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
It's better to say this.

386
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,200
You two are together because you are looking for Zhou Tong.

387
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,200
You can't rely on God to bless you.

388
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
The past is over.

389
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,200
In the future, you should tolerate each other and live well.

390
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Then help me.

391
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Then help me.

392
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:08,940
What floor is the

393
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,940
I'm here.

394
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,940
I'll go down and stand for a while.

395
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,940
Do you want me to accompany you?

396
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Go.

397
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Go.

398
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
Go.

399
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,940
Go.

400
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,940
Go.

401
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,940
Go.

402
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,940
Go.

403
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Go.

404
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,940
Go.

405
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,940
Go.

406
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,940
Go.

407
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,940
Go.

408
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,940
Go.

409
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,940
Go.

410
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,940
Go.

411
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,940
Go.

412
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,940
Go.

413
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,940
Go.

414
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,940
Go.

415
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,940
Go.

416
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,940
Go.

417
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,940
You're not going to Beijing, are you?

418
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,940
I have nothing to do with him.

419
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,940
I just want to stand alone.

420
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,940
Father and mother have been admitted.

421
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:39,940
That day, you left me alone in the restaurant.

422
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,940
You just took him to the hospital, right?

423
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Then why didn't you ask me to go with you?

424
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,940
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble too.

425
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,940
It's too coincidental.

426
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,940
You two just met and hit a car.

427
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,940
He should be fine, right?

428
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,940
He woke up when I left.

429
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,940
Did his girlfriend go?

430
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,940
I didn't see Wen Xiaoyao's performance that day.

431
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,940
What a coincidence.

432
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,940
What happened before

433
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,940
and what you've been thinking about

434
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,940
all happened together.

435
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,940
What happened before?

436
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,940
Mr. Jia Zulan's daughter

437
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,940
is now in the White-Sword Battle.

438
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,940
We went to Beijing to see her.

439
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,940
But coincidentally,

440
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,940
I met another dog.

441
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,940
Zhou Tong is Zhou Tong.

442
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,940
You are you.

443
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,940
I know.

444
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,940
It's just that it makes people think.

445
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,940
So you dare not tell me.

446
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,940
I'm sorry.

447
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,940
Today, call your family with the change of accent.

448
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,940
I'll change my accent when I go back to my hometown.

449
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,940
Okay.

450
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,940
You're home.

451
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,940
Not home.

452
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,940
No Xiaoyao either.

453
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,940
On October 16th,

454
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,940
a person named Shi Dian Dian came to the troupe to look for Xiaoyao.

455
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,940
She never told me.

456
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
Shi Dian Dian?

457
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,940
What did she look like?

458
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
I saw her on the register.

459
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,940
How would I know what she looked like?

460
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,940
On the day that Zhou Tong had an accident on the 18th,

461
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,940
a woman sent her to the hospital.

462
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,940
I saw her when I arrived at the hospital.

463
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,940
She was bleeding.

464
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,940
I was quite curious.

465
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,940
I asked the official website twice, but she didn't tell me.

466
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
Official website?

467
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
Song Da Gu.

468
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,940
Director Song, these two months,

469
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,940
she didn't say anything.

470
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,940
She was a person who was very secretive.

471
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,940
When Xiaoyao left,

472
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,940
she went to Zhou Tong's house.

473
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,940
She was driven out by Da Gu.

474
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,940
She used to be very aggressive.

475
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,940
She was good at being aggressive.

476
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Now she's very gentle.

477
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,940
She has a woman's taste.

478
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,940
I'm not a man of my word.

479
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,940
Old Qiao,

480
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,940
can you talk to a normal person about this?

481
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,940
You're too harsh. You're my dad.

482
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
Normal person?

483
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,940
How could I forget about your steel business?

484
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,940
I saw her this afternoon.

485
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,940
She ran away.

486
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
Director Yang asked her to leave.

487
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,940
They were filming a new drama.

488
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,940
It was a big deal.

489
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,940
That's a big deal.

490
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,940
Her art career ended.

491
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,940
Xiaoyao's also over.

492
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940
Where are you going later?

493
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,940
I'm going to Jing Song's small square.

494
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,940
The official website is there every day.

495
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,940
I'm afraid I'll go home alone like you.

496
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,940
I'm going to Jing Song's small square.

497
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,940
The official website is there every day.

498
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,940
I'm going to Jing Song's small square.

499
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,940
The official website is there every day.

500
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,940
I'm going to Jing Song's small square.

501
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,940
The official website is there every day.

502
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,940
I'm going to Jing Song's small square.

503
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,940
The official website is there every day.

504
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,940
I'm going to Jing Song's small square.

505
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,940
The official website is there every day.

506
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,940
I'm going to Jing Song's small square.

507
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,940
The official website is there every day.

508
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,940
I'm going to Jing Song's small square.

509
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,940
The official website is there every day.

510
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,940
Ou Yu SeShi.

511
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,820
You are finally here.

512
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,340
I don't move even if I come here every day.

513
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,940
I'm cold.

514
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,140
This sound effect is too strong.

515
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,740
I'll sponsor it later.

516
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,340
I came late today.

517
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,340
Xiao Ni and I went to Da Bu Zhen.

518
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,740
Xiao Yao went to see her mom every week.

519
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,940
Now that she's not here,

520
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,340
Xiao Ni and I sent her to the police.

521
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,140
You're not bad.

522
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,140
You're right.

523
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,340
It's useless. I lost it.

524
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,140
I'll say it in a polite way.

525
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,940
Actually,

526
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,740
even if Zhou Tong leaves,

527
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,340
you can't completely forget about him.

528
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,540
Everyone has a life.

529
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,940
You should miss him.

530
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,140
But you have to continue your life.

531
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,740
Right?

532
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,140
I blame Yao Yao.

533
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,340
I blame you.

534
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,340
You're not born, you're not born,

535
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,540
you're not dancing,

536
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,940
why are you leaving?

537
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,940
Wang Wang, get in the car.

538
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,940
Wang Wang, you're wrong.

539
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,140
People will think we're angry.

540
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,540
Get in the car.

541
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,740
I'll see you once a day.

542
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,140
I can't see you at home.

543
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,540
Wang Wang.

544
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,940
Get in the car.

545
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,540
I'll drive slowly.

546
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
It's warm.

547
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,940
I don't want to drive.

548
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,340
Why?

549
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,740
I want to walk alone.

550
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,740
Are you annoying me or the car?

551
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,740
I'm not annoying you.

552
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,540
If you're not annoying me, then it's fine.

553
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,740
I'll accompany you from now on.

554
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
How many keys?

555
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,740
Throw away a few.

556
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,940
I don't want the car.

557
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,740
There's nothing there anyway.

558
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,540
It's expensive and it's around you.

559
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,340
I'm sorry.

560
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,740
I'm sorry.

561
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,740
I'm sorry.

562
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,140
I'm sorry.

563
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,940
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,940
I'm sorry.

565
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,540
Hello?

566
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,340
What are you doing?

567
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
Taking advantage of the situation.

568
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,540
Come pick me up.

569
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,340
I can't pick you up, I don't have a car.

570
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,740
Then I'm looking for you.

571
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,340
I need to do something.

572
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,340
I'll talk to you later.

573
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,100
Okay, I threw it into the river.

574
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,540
It's not in the grass.

575
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,900
You want to make fun of me?

576
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,540
If you say something annoying me,

577
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,700
I'll disappear immediately.

578
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,700
Clean and smooth.

579
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,100
Making fun of this kind of thing is not my life.

580
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,020
I'm fine.

581
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,820
What's good about it?

582
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,020
Look at your little face.

583
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,380
Like a moon.

584
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,780
Who can rest assured?

585
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,580
I'm bored of you.

586
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,500
Actually, your current appearance

587
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,740
makes me enjoy it.

588
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
Enjoy?

589
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,100
You used to nag me.

590
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,100
Now it's good.

591
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,180
Like a jade.

592
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,300
Gentle.

593
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,260
Did I nag you before?

594
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,900
You can't feel it.

595
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,940
I'll tell you a few words.

596
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,100
You have to change your mind.

597
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,300
Otherwise, you can't catch it.

598
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,300
Now it's good.

599
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,500
The sun is setting.

600
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,140
Bend your body and look for the car keys in the grass.

601
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,300
How beautiful.

602
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,500
I have to enjoy this kind of illusion.

603
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,300
If you come back one day,

604
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,620
I guess I'll be blind again.

605
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,300
I can't.

606
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,020
This river used to be very muddy.

607
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,460
How about I take you to eat something delicious?

608
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,300
I'm talking about the river.

609
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,060
The river doesn't open fire.

610
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,220
It's getting cold.

611
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
Put on some balsams.

612
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,220
I'll treat you to a piece of lamb.

613
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,140
How about it?

614
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,500
How about I call Brother Gang?

615
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,620
He'll be more generous.

616
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,900
What if he does?

617
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,900
He might forget about it.

618
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,660
Actually, he wants me to quit the second line.

619
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,380
He's running away with Yao Yao.

620
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,140
Sometimes,

621
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,740
I'm so confused.

622
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,100
quartries be planed in Nanfang area

623
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,940
Pass it all.

624
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,320
After we crush it,

625
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,740
they'll leave us alone.

626
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,160
Make

627
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,500
Zhou Leng know how to pubitize hot pot

628
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:13,500
сред007

629
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,320
Little Qin Hao

630
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,540
If you stop the sponsorship

631
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,460
I may check it in other places

632
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,000
I can say silver

633
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,180
OK

634
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,700
The0

635
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,700
It's still Bai Shizhou.

636
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,860
Do you know what her name is?

637
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,860
Jin Se.

638
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,740
How do you think of her?

639
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,740
Brother.

640
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,180
Tomorrow,

641
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,660
you go to that Jingsong Factory.

642
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,660
Where?

643
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,660
The place where they dance.

644
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,860
Go there and have a look. What's wrong?

645
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,860
Give the sisters some milk.

646
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,020
Come on.

647
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,020
Show me your sinker to create some strange atmosphere.

648
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,020
It will be better with personajes to show off my money.

649
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:09,020
I'm so copying you.

650
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,020
My professional income is low enough.

651
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,020
I'm not low enough.

652
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,020
How low?

653
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,020
I'm not low.

654
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
It's too heavy for you to fall for that!

655
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,020
You're so whiny

656
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,660
I respect you

657
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,180
You can't always bully people, can you?

658
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,580
You

659
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,620
Just put it in the pot and wash it

660
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,020
Did you see it

661
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,060
He is like this

662
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,100
That's right

663
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,220
I asked you to come

664
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,100
Just to let him scold you

665
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,260
Why

666
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,100
I am also the leader of the country

667
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,300
People are not like you

668
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,260
Leader

669
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,180
People's artist

670
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,900
I don't play because my son died

671
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,980
See sad

672
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,180
Your life is low

673
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,540
Because of age

674
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,340
Still dreaming of eggplant

675
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,060
Blame what yaoyao

676
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,140
What

677
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,580
Who is it

678
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,660
Yang Yun

679
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,580
Yang Yun

680
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,220
Don't listen

681
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,300
Why do you blame two women

682
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,740
I asked you to go to the official entertainment class

683
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,060
It's been a day

684
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,460
Let you give your sisters a present

685
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,540
It's for your good

686
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,260
back down

687
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,020
Let you find the right place in life

688
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,580
Enough, don't go to class

689
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,220
Don't care about the first and second floors

690
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,140
It's better to be yellow

691
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,540
Baby

692
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,420
Don't really sit up

693
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,100
It doesn't matter if you don't make money

694
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,580
But if it's really yellow

695
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,900
I feel worse

696
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,260
It will be yellow sooner or later

697
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,900
Life is the same

698
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,820
Don't don't don't

699
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,540
Don't be so pessimistic

700
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,340
Just put it anyway

701
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,900
There is still some residual energy

702
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,780
Now still top

703
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,620
The glory of the boss of the court

704
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,820
After a while

705
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,220
The news of retirement

706
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,740
It's not worth it to spread

707
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,140
Qiu Fanghui

708
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,980
Where did you get it

709
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,580
Anyway, it's not yours

710
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,900
My dear friend

711
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,380
Thank you

712
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,100
Thank you for telling me the point

713
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,340
I can choose my own

714
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,220
Did you listen to Fang Fang?

715
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,700
I am such a person

716
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,620
Eat more

717
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,740
A little more

718
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,300
understand

719
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,620
Really stubborn

720
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,220
Don't care about me

721
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,620
I know Mr. Yang

722
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,460
I'll listen to you

723
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,540
Really

724
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,860
Don't care about me

725
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,140
This is not good

726
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,340
Can't act

727
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,500
Then you go to the official website to have a class

728
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,340
He doesn't need me

729
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,180
The more this kind of thing, the more it needs

730
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,780
My husband died early

731
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,340
Now that my son is gone

732
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,020
How lonely is this heart

733
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,300
He has you

734
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,300
He needs you now

735
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,580
What do you mean

736
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,380
Help him or help me

737
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,620
Or we two

738
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,420
Be a man, have a sympathy

739
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,020
Who sympathizes with me

740
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,740
Men don't need sympathy

741
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,300
All worth it

742
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,500
understand

743
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,660
I'll go to Hangzhou tomorrow to find Yao Zhao

744
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,860
Let's talk

745
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,940
You find Mr. Yang

746
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,220
Then Mr. Yang is also waiting

747
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,980
You first make the king's heart happy

748
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,860
Row

749
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,780
When to go

750
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,060
Go tomorrow

751
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,580
Then I will go

752
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,260
Do you know what my son is doing in Hangzhou?

753
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,020
Сегодня

754
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,760
Good news

755
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,780
Huh!

756
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,580
Okay!

757
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,640
Someone help me!

758
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,780
I want my charge back!

759
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,100
Okay!

760
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:26,940
But she said that she said she purchased that

761
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,420
ten o'clock.

762
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,020
He sent Tong Ge to the hospital.

763
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,540
Is it him?

764
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,660
Does the registration office have his contact information?

765
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,380
I'll go see him tomorrow.

766
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,260
Can you go and see him for me now?

767
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,620
Thank you.
