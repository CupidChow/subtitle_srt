1
00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:02,031
(Apricot blossoms signal the arrival of spring.)

2
00:00:02,032 --> 00:00:03,901
(Spring in Yangsan)

3
00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:05,071
(Team Se Yoon and Joon)

4
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:06,201
(Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho)

5
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:07,372
(Team Jong Min and DinDin)

6
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:08,671
(The more seed money they gain...)

7
00:00:08,672 --> 00:00:10,432
(in the missions, the bigger the advantage.)

8
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:12,511
(Round 1 is Pull Toilet Paper.)

9
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,541
(They all struggle.)

10
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:16,382
(With some daring play, )

11
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:18,211
(Team Jong Min and DinDin win 19,100 seeds.)

12
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:19,752
(Do they gain seed money...)

13
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:21,682
(or decided to eat?)

14
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:25,962
(While the other teams decide to eat, )

15
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:27,921
(Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho...)

16
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:29,892
(focuses on harvesting water parsley.)

17
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:31,962
(As a result, they gain 28,600 seeds.)

18
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:33,661
(Seed Money Status)

19
00:00:33,662 --> 00:00:36,901
(There's still a chance to win.)

20
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:39,901
There are 3 empty cups and 3 cups of water.

21
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:41,072
We'll wager 2,500 seeds.

22
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:42,401
- Two thousand five hundred? - Yes.

23
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:43,672
- Number 5. - Sae Ho chose 5.

24
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:45,772
- I'll go with 4. - Okay, 4 and 5.

25
00:00:46,142 --> 00:00:47,611
- We're doing good right now. - Yes.

26
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:48,612
It's not bad.

27
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:50,482
(Se Yoon's smiling.)

28
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:53,722
(What fate will befall them?)

29
00:00:54,382 --> 00:00:55,681
You don't get to switch.

30
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:57,242
- Let's just go. - Okay. Are you ready?

31
00:00:57,452 --> 00:00:58,991
Here goes. Count to three.

32
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,091
- You two. - Okay.

33
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,898
(There's a 20-percent chance both cups are empty.)

34
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:03,208
- One, two, three! - One, two, three!

35
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,731
(Can they keep their seed money...)

36
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,001
(or will they lose it?)

37
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:08,032
- Three! - Three!

38
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:12,431
- Sae Ho. - See?

39
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:14,472
- That was crazy. - We should've wagered more.

40
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:16,242
- Here's double what you bet. - Okay.

41
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:18,552
- We should've bet more. - That was crazy.

42
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:19,642
Do you want to go?

43
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:20,642
- You go ahead. - You go first.

44
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:21,642
- We'll... - Okay.

45
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:23,511
Let's all face the front so they can move the cups.

46
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:24,512
- I can't see. - Me neither.

47
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:26,652
- Jong Min, stand over here. - Come here, Joon.

48
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:28,781
How much do you want to bet?

49
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:30,951
Well, the bigger the amount,

50
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,692
the more cathartic it is.

51
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:34,561
You only have one shot.

52
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:37,062
Yes. We played, and we regret betting what we did.

53
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:38,632
(Giggling)

54
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,331
We only live once!

55
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:41,431
(They bet 15,000 seeds.)

56
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:43,192
- Let's go. - Betting 15,000 seeds is a lot.

57
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:45,031
- Number 5? - It was 4 and 5 earlier.

58
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:46,071
- Right? - Yes.

59
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,271
I think the crew...

60
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:49,101
could've left the empty cups in 4 and 5 again.

61
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:50,211
You heard me, right?

62
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:51,511
I said five. It's up to you now.

63
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:52,912
- I'll go with five, then. - Okay.

64
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:54,681
- Do it! - Let's go!

65
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:55,782
Let's go!

66
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,552
- Come on! - Se Yoon.

67
00:01:58,012 --> 00:01:59,351
- Number 3! - Number 3!

68
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,352
No.

69
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,828
- Number 3? - I chose 3 instead of 1.

70
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:03,591
Joon, it's your last chance...

71
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:04,592
- to swap! - What?

72
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:05,751
- Let's go! - Let's do this!

73
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:07,522
- I won't swap! - I won't swap!

74
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:08,792
One!

75
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,262
Two.

76
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:11,262
- Three! - Three!

77
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:12,292
Here goes!

78
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:14,102
- Three! - Three!

79
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:15,102
Here goes!

80
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:24,611
(Drenched)

81
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,241
I gave you a chance to swap, didn't I?

82
00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:27,242
Even so...

83
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:29,452
Sir. When will you leave?

84
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,011
Going home late...

85
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:32,312
disappeared like this?

86
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:34,581
- I feel lost. - It feels horrible.

87
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:36,151
- It's so harsh. - For real? For 15,000 seeds?

88
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:38,391
- I got home after six. - What do you say, Joon?

89
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,722
Shall we play once more?

90
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:40,821
- Let's go. - One more time?

91
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:41,921
- Let's go. - We'll play once more.

92
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:43,532
- For how much? - We'll play once more.

93
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:45,262
Let's bet all we have.

94
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:48,631
- What got into you? - We can always win more.

95
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:49,632
- What... - You never know.

96
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,071
I'll work really hard.

97
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:52,171
Okay. Look.

98
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,201
Even if we bet 10,000 seeds, it's fine if we win.

99
00:02:54,202 --> 00:02:56,212
- It's pointless if we lose. - Right.

100
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:58,072
- We're all in. - That's it!

101
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,612
(One day, we will meet again.)

102
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:06,022
(A celebratory performance for them going all in)

103
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:08,421
(14,600 seeds, going all in!)

104
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,552
Look carefully, Joon.

105
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:11,291
When we chose number three earlier,

106
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,451
Sae Ho said number one...

107
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:13,661
- was empty too. - Yes.

108
00:03:13,662 --> 00:03:15,261
And in the first game,

109
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,631
- we did the spraying. - Yes.

110
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:17,861
- I checked the cups then. - Yes.

111
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,801
Number one was empty.

112
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:21,531
It makes no sense to switch so suddenly.

113
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,632
- That means number one is empty. - Okay.

114
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:25,302
Joon, what's our program called?

115
00:03:25,502 --> 00:03:26,601
- 2 Days 1 Night. - Yes.

116
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:27,772
Numbers 1 and 2, then?

117
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,542
No, wait.

118
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:32,071
- He's too excited. - What?

119
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:33,392
I think number one has something.

120
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:35,481
- Number three! - For real?

121
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,152
I'll show you. I'll pick number one.

122
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:38,581
- You go with number one. - And you?

123
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:39,822
I'll go with number three.

124
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:41,321
- One and three? - Yes.

125
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,751
- What is it? Be quick. - It's done.

126
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:43,922
- They chose. - Hurry up.

127
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:45,522
(Screaming)

128
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:47,321
(He starts pathetic acting.)

129
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:48,862
I can't stand his antics.

130
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,162
(It's confusing, isn't it?)

131
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:53,332
Whenever he does something...

132
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:55,461
You always make that face.

133
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:57,171
It's so heavy! Don't touch it!

134
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:58,292
(Pretending the cup's heavy)

135
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,171
(Confused)

136
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:02,401
Hold hands!

137
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:03,842
- It's so heavy! - There's water.

138
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:05,742
Please! We need a turnaround!

139
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:07,612
- My life begins now. - One!

140
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:09,952
- Two, three! - Two, three!

141
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:12,482
My gosh.

142
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:14,652
- Three! - Three!

143
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:18,521
(Going all in failed.)

144
00:04:18,522 --> 00:04:19,562
That's incredible.

145
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:21,521
You both chose water?

146
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,162
(We're ruined.)

147
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:27,902
- What happened? - What now?

148
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:29,571
What do we do? We...

149
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:30,771
The probability...

150
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,031
- It's nonsense. - It's low.

151
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:33,741
- We'll play now. - We'll play.

152
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:35,141
We have the most seed money.

153
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,312
We'll bet a lot.

154
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,212
Bet everything!

155
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,241
How much?

156
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:41,511
(The large amount they bet is...)

157
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:42,611
A thousand seeds.

158
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:44,381
- That's fine. - Our sweat...

159
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:46,652
- to earn this... - This is a lot to us.

160
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,221
- Let's go. - That's it.

161
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:49,591
- Choose your cups. - Let's see.

162
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:51,491
- I'll help Jong Min. - Do it!

163
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,691
Choose a number.

164
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,191
Okay. You can only speak.

165
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:55,322
- This is... - Hey.

166
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:56,691
What's this trick?

167
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:57,692
(Searching for water veins?)

168
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:59,802
Wait. Is it water if it shakes?

169
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:03,602
They do this to search for water veins.

170
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:04,971
- Number 4! - Number 1.

171
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,001
Come on!

172
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:07,671
The others moved to the left,

173
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:09,418
- Number one. - but this moved to the right.

174
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,471
- Okay. - Four and one.

175
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:12,512
I got it. I felt it. Let's go with it.

176
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:14,042
(Shouting)

177
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:15,841
Come over here.

178
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:16,981
Is that number four?

179
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:18,712
(Is this deja vu?)

180
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:20,382
Number four is heavy!

181
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:22,152
Oh, no.

182
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:25,151
Can we increase our bet...

183
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:26,462
based on their acting?

184
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:28,662
Oh, no!

185
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,432
- Se Yoon's cup is empty. - It's fine.

186
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:31,838
- I want a look. - Joon's is too.

187
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:33,662
- Really? Should we bet more? - It's empty.

188
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:35,531
- Should we bet more? - Yes.

189
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:36,901
We'll give you five seconds.

190
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:38,972
They're busy people.

191
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:40,141
- One... - How's 15,000?

192
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:41,201
- We'll bet more! - Okay!

193
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:42,242
For real?

194
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:44,371
- Four thousand seeds. - Give them to me.

195
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:45,941
- The total is 5,000. - That's 5,000 seeds.

196
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:47,012
That's a lot!

197
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:49,081
- Wait. - Are you sure?

198
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,082
(Grinning)

199
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,051
(The answer)

200
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,181
(Number 1, Joon's cup)

201
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:59,022
(No water)

202
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:00,891
(Number 4, Se Yoon's cup)

203
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:02,091
Do you want to switch?

204
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:03,931
(There's water.)

205
00:06:03,932 --> 00:06:05,592
Hey, don't bet too much.

206
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:07,531
- No, we'll... - It's full to the brim.

207
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:09,432
- You're brave. - Let me talk.

208
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:10,831
What Se Yoon did was...

209
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:12,608
(He mistakenly thinks Se Yoon's cup is empty.)

210
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:14,392
The face he made when he picked it up was...

211
00:06:14,672 --> 00:06:15,771
- His jaw. - Let's go!

212
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:17,242
I saw his jawline lift up.

213
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:18,412
Let's go!

214
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:20,411
Hurry up! It's heavy!

215
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:21,482
My gosh.

216
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,681
No, not this time.

217
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:24,981
- Then... - Let's go.

218
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:26,221
Should we bet more?

219
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:27,281
Oh, dear.

220
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:28,351
- Oh, dear. - Come on.

221
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,521
- Hurry up. - There's no time.

222
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,591
- Don't bet anymore. - Here goes!

223
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:31,722
Wait!

224
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,392
It's so heavy!

225
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:34,621
- Five thousand more! - Five thousand more!

226
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:35,692
Are you serious?

227
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:38,831
(Overjoyed)

228
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,002
Look at that acting.

229
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,432
- They're terrible actors. - Look at them.

230
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:45,931
- A thousand's in coins. - One thousand.

231
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:47,401
- Here's 5,000 more. - We still have 40,000 left.

232
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:48,402
- It's fine. - Okay.

233
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:50,212
Okay. Count to three.

234
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:51,412
Here goes!

235
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,942
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

236
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:57,311
Oh, dear.

237
00:06:57,312 --> 00:06:59,482
(What?)

238
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:03,022
(Happily dreaming of becoming rich)

239
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:06,992
(An unexpected shower)

240
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:09,262
I didn't know there was water in here.

241
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,491
- Jong Min. - Right?

242
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:11,561
- For real? - Yes.

243
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:12,662
There was water.

244
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,331
(Jong Min and DinDin: 40,000 seeds)

245
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:15,701
I told you to switch.

246
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:16,931
We just lost 11,000 seeds.

247
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:18,171
- Shall we bet 10,000 more? - Let's do that.

248
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:20,472
Jong Min's impressive. He survived.

249
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:21,771
- We'll bet 10,000 seeds more. - Okay.

250
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:22,911
- Should we switch? - Hey.

251
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:23,912
- We can. - It's up to you.

252
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:24,912
- We just bet 10,000 seeds. - You guys should do it.

253
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:25,912
- I gave him 10,000 seeds. - Okay.

254
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,811
- I'll pick number 3. - Number 3.

255
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:29,041
- Okay. - I'll take the third one.

256
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:30,252
Okay, I got it.

257
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:33,021
The thing is...

258
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,051
(Exaggerating his facial expression)

259
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:35,082
(Screaming)

260
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,592
I'm 100 percent sure that doesn't have water in it.

261
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:40,922
(They're unshakably at ease.)

262
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,331
(Straightening up)

263
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:45,961
- Number 4. - Number 4.

264
00:07:45,962 --> 00:07:47,202
(DinDin picks the 4th tumbler.)

265
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:48,802
(Shaking)

266
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,802
- There's no water inside. - There's nothing inside.

267
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,731
Seon Ho can't fake that. Here's a thing. When he grabbed it,

268
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,771
he accidentally pushed it. The tumbler shook then.

269
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:55,371
(The tumbler tilted very easily.)

270
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:56,571
- We'll give you a chance to change. - All right.

271
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:57,988
- Five... - We'll give you a chance to change.

272
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,041
- We'll give you a chance. - I won't change it.

273
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:00,281
- I won't change mine. - Will you really let me change?

274
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:01,282
We will.

275
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:04,612
(Method acting)

276
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,392
- We'll give you five seconds. - No. We will let them change.

277
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:08,721
- Five... - Will you let us?

278
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:09,851
- The one Sae Ho is holding? - Will you let them?

279
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:11,252
We'll let you do whatever you want.

280
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,032
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

281
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:15,121
- My goodness. - Should we bet another 10,000?

282
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:16,122
This is crazy.

283
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:17,363
- Let's just go for it. - Okay.

284
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:18,792
(Laughing)

285
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,378
My gosh, this guy is playing big bets.

286
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:21,861
(Whatever! Let's just go for it.)

287
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:23,371
What's the point of leaving behind money? Bet the rest.

288
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,078
- No. Keep 10,000 seeds. - No, we need 10,000 seeds.

289
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:26,741
- We must take a taxi home. - Hurry up.

290
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:27,742
My gosh. Darn it.

291
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:28,742
- Here it goes. On three. - Let's go.

292
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:29,971
On three. Shout it out.

293
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:31,011
- Are you ready? - I'm ready.

294
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,442
- Let's go. - Two.

295
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,081
- One. - Okay.

296
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:35,941
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

297
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:38,711
(The two of them will have a huge lead if they succeed.)

298
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:40,281
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

299
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:41,282
Let's go!

300
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:42,963
(The tumbler Seon Ho is holding is empty.)

301
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:45,632
(What about the tumbler Sae Ho, the passionate actor, is holding?)

302
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:47,362
Come on!

303
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:48,362
(Shocked)

304
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,362
- Three. - Let's go!

305
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:51,032
Come on!

306
00:08:53,062 --> 00:08:56,372
(Their 20,000 seeds disappear into thin air.)

307
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:57,772
(Laughing)

308
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:01,572
What's this?

309
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,771
- Hey. - We lost 30,000 seeds.

310
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:05,441
(Why did they bet more seeds?)

311
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:07,081
Oh, no!

312
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:08,581
We worked so hard to earn those seeds.

313
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,581
So I told you to stop gambling!

314
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:11,582
I...

315
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,051
You earned those seeds by performing as KOYOTE.

316
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,381
- Why did you blow it up on this? - My gosh.

317
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:16,692
- I worked so hard to earn them. - Oh, no. You...

318
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:18,451
- Well done. - Yes.

319
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:19,521
(Sae Ho showed perfect acting.)

320
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:21,121
- Does your wife know about this? - No.

321
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:23,068
Well, you don't have a choice now. You'll have to do part-time jobs.

322
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:24,162
- Come on. - Come here.

323
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:26,191
What a pity.

324
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:27,261
Do you want to play another round?

325
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:28,262
I won't.

326
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:29,361
How about with the new batch?

327
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:30,571
- What did you say? - How much money do we have left?

328
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:32,748
Are you out of your mind? He asked me how much money we had.

329
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:33,841
We lost all of our money.

330
00:09:33,842 --> 00:09:34,871
(The aftermath of going all in)

331
00:09:34,872 --> 00:09:37,012
- You told me to go all in. - You lost it too, right?

332
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:38,541
- Can we bet our cell phone? - Can we bet our cell phone?

333
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:39,612
- Yes? - Can we?

334
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,781
- I bought the latest model. - No.

335
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:42,842
- Okay. - I bought it.

336
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:44,211
Come on, give me the seeds!

337
00:09:44,212 --> 00:09:45,212
(We won't accept that.)

338
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:46,582
He was going to throw it out.

339
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:48,281
- How much money do we have left? - Don't call me.

340
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:49,728
- We have about 35,000 seeds. - How much money do we have?

341
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:51,591
- We can't do that. - We have some seeds left.

342
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,921
- No? - Should we bet 6,200 seeds?

343
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:54,061
Let's go with 6,200 seeds.

344
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,398
- That will be neat. - We'll bet 6,200 seeds.

345
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:56,761
- Gosh, that's no fun. - Put that away.

346
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,432
- We're the true winners. - My gosh.

347
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:00,638
I guess they'll win first place and compete in a poker game.

348
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:01,662
You know...

349
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:03,701
Here's what I think. They're going to train on our show.

350
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,271
They will beat Hong Jin Ho and Jong Min first.

351
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,771
- Then they'll enter competitions. - Yes.

352
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,842
- Right. - Yes.

353
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,071
- Come on. Really? Only 6,200 seeds? - Next.

354
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:11,742
- That's no fun. My gosh. - It's fine.

355
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:13,342
DinDin, grab number one.

356
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:14,681
- That's it. You can't change it. - The one on the end.

357
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,122
- Jong Min, grab number six. - Okay.

358
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:17,952
You can't change it or anything.

359
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:19,751
- You won't change, right? - We won't.

360
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,921
Let's keep it clean and go for it.

361
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:22,722
- Bet the rest of your seeds. - No.

362
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:25,152
- Bet the rest. - I think he's tired.

363
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,992
We don't have any seeds left either.

364
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:28,661
- Bet a bit more. This is no fun. - That's empty, right?

365
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,108
- This is no fun to watch. - We're good.

366
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:31,631
- Come on. - Sae Ho.

367
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,161
Seriously. This is no fun.

368
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:34,162
My gosh, fine.

369
00:10:34,163 --> 00:10:35,431
- Let's not do it. - Let's not.

370
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:37,471
- Let's just do it. - Go ahead.

371
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:38,801
- It's so frustrating. - Check out the wind.

372
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:40,682
- The viewers are angry now. - Let's go for it.

373
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:42,271
- I'm sorry. - They're angry.

374
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:45,112
- We're sorry. - Oh, no. We're sorry.

375
00:10:45,742 --> 00:10:48,182
Don't be angry at us. Please stop the storm.

376
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,051
- We'll work hard. - The viewers...

377
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:51,111
We'll work hard.

378
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:53,221
- We'll bring Dex next week. - Please forgive us.

379
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:55,181
- We'll bring Dex. - Please don't switch channels.

380
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:56,721
- The musical doesn't pay a lot. - No, wait.

381
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:57,821
- He's tenacious. - Wait!

382
00:10:57,822 --> 00:10:59,192
My goodness.

383
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:00,291
Come here.

384
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,532
- We'll be back after 60 seconds! - Tell us. What is it?

385
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:03,961
- Okay, we'll bet 5,000 seeds more. - We'll bet 5,000 seeds more.

386
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:05,561
- There you go. - Gosh, we're so cool.

387
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:07,102
Viewers, come back!

388
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:10,272
- They're coming back. - They're coming back.

389
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:12,632
- Come on. A little more. - They're coming back.

390
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:14,541
- Seon Ho. - You can't look down...

391
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,742
on the viewers of KBS from all over the world.

392
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:18,812
- Let's do it. - Let's go for it now.

393
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,918
Gosh, I think we'll end up losing 5,000 seeds.

394
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:22,311
- One, two, three. - My gosh.

395
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:24,593
(Will they be able to earn the viewers' heart and seeds?)

396
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:26,882
(Sae Ho is safe.)

397
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,592
(If Seon Ho passes too, 2 of their bets would be successful.)

398
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:31,291
(They fail.)

399
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:32,692
- My gosh. - There was water in it.

400
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:35,492
- There was water in it. - Really?

401
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:37,191
- Really? - I didn't know.

402
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:38,232
This is so much fun!

403
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,201
- There was water in it. - We thought there wasn't.

404
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:41,262
There was water in it.

405
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,002
Sorry.

406
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:45,631
Sorry about that. Okay. We thought there wasn't.

407
00:11:45,632 --> 00:11:47,142
- You can go now. - Okay.

408
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:49,471
- These are bad guys. - I mean...

409
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:51,141
DinDin showed me such kind eyes.

410
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:53,071
- No, I told you they were awful. - We're good now.

411
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:54,211
- He had such kind eyes. - I...

412
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,381
- What about me? - We lost extra 5,000 seeds.

413
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,682
We have about 30,000 seeds.

414
00:11:56,852 --> 00:11:58,252
- Next. - You have that many seeds?

415
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:00,321
Jong Min and DinDin have 20,000 seeds.

416
00:12:00,322 --> 00:12:01,322
- Great job. - And...

417
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:02,482
We've got nothing.

418
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:04,021
Darn those seeds.

419
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:05,022
(Remaining seeds, 0)

420
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:06,022
Zero seeds.

421
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:09,121
Guys, let's head over to the base camp.

422
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:10,932
- But... - Pull your pants down. Be proper.

423
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:12,732
So the seeds we have...

424
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,231
- We'll have to use them, right? - Yes.

425
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:17,071
I bet we can buy dinner and pick our sleeping spot with the seeds.

426
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:18,871
Should I buy dinner with the seeds?

427
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,341
You know what? Choosing the right ones was harder than I thought.

428
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:22,902
- That's a difficult game. - Right.

429
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:25,271
(Gloomy Fatty)

430
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:26,942
Wake up. You can't fall asleep yet.

431
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:28,782
How can I sleep right now?

432
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,982
I'm broke right now. How can I sleep?

433
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:33,481
- Yes. He just had his eyes closed. - I kept thinking,

434
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:35,681
"Had I picked number 2, not number 1..."

435
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:37,802
(He can't seem to laugh as they're in the same boat.)

436
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:39,752
(Eye contact)

437
00:12:39,753 --> 00:12:41,092
(Sighing)

438
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:45,292
(How am I going to take care of him?)

439
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:47,961
I'm dirt poor. Where can I earn money?

440
00:12:47,962 --> 00:12:49,522
Can we harvest the water parsley again?

441
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,131
You'll keep harvesting the water parsley?

442
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:54,501
(They arrive at the base camp.)

443
00:12:54,502 --> 00:12:55,502
My gosh.

444
00:12:55,503 --> 00:12:57,672
(Sprawling)

445
00:12:58,442 --> 00:12:59,471
- Gosh. - My goodness.

446
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:00,672
(Groans echo around the room.)

447
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:06,952
(They had to hunch over to harvest the water parsley all afternoon.)

448
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:09,221
(Out of energy)

449
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,292
There are clothes here.

450
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:15,721
(Massaging)

451
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:16,992
You worked out a lot.

452
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:19,831
(Sae Ho massages his legs as a present.)

453
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:20,961
Does it feel nice when I press here?

454
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:21,962
(Amazed)

455
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:25,331
(Feeling refreshed)

456
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:26,871
- Gosh, your hands are strong. - Yes.

457
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,472
- Your grip strength is strong. - Right.

458
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,472
- Lie down on your belly. - What?

459
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:32,511
(Pressing)

460
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,912
I'm loosening the knots. I got you.

461
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:38,652
(Sae Ho's massage washes away the fatigue completely.)

462
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:40,121
(He's chasing away the fatigue with a massage.)

463
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:41,598
Are you a licensed massage therapist?

464
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:43,081
Are all six of you in here?

465
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:44,552
Are the other two upstairs?

466
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:45,792
- Yes. - My gosh.

467
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,221
So the four of you can rest up.

468
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:50,231
Okay.

469
00:13:50,232 --> 00:13:52,732
- But Se Yoon and Joon... - Gosh, why?

470
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:54,961
You guys don't have any seed money.

471
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:56,331
- What? We must go and make money? - Let's go out,

472
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:57,672
so you can earn more seed money.

473
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:00,401
(Laughing)

474
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:02,082
We're fine. We'll practice non-possession.

475
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:03,771
- Quickly change your clothes. - I...

476
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:05,371
- I'm not joking right now, sir. - Okay.

477
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:07,092
I practice non-possession in real life too.

478
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:10,011
I heard emptying things out was better for me.

479
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:11,912
You need money to have dinner.

480
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,551
- My gosh, this is crazy. - Oh, my.

481
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,851
(If that's the case, I should go out and work.)

482
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:16,381
- How did this happen to us? - Gosh.

483
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:18,262
(What additional task awaits Joon and Se Yoon?)

484
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,062
It's the food truck!

485
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:23,091
(It's impossible to walk past it without stopping by.)

486
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:24,191
- Gosh, hello. - My goodness.

487
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:25,831
- Gosh, it's salmon. - Yes.

488
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,032
There's salmon?

489
00:14:28,262 --> 00:14:29,562
- My gosh. - Yes.

490
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,431
But...

491
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:33,441
- Please sit on the bench. - Okay.

492
00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:36,201
If you clean a box of water parsley,

493
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:37,942
- Yes. - we'll give you 10,000 seeds.

494
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:39,981
Come on, give us a bit more.

495
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:42,081
The water parsley will be incorporated...

496
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,582
into the staff's meal shortly.

497
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:44,982
So do a thorough job.

498
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:46,652
Let's do this.

499
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:48,881
(Chuckling)

500
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,121
Did we harvest all of this?

501
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,222
- We did. - Well...

502
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,761
(They have to remove dry...)

503
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,261
(or decomposed water parsley from the box.)

504
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,561
So we just have to remove wilted water parsley.

505
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:00,102
Yes, that's about it.

506
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:03,802
Had we gotten the first round correct...

507
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:06,002
That's a bitter feeling.

508
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:07,802
I want to be the director again.

509
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:11,011
(I was so happy back then.)

510
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:12,741
- Those were the good times. - In your next life...

511
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:14,311
No. You should study and become a director.

512
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:16,181
- You can become a director. - It's too late for me.

513
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,862
I can't memorize the multiplication table.

514
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:20,781
- Directors... - Isn't it important for directors?

515
00:15:20,782 --> 00:15:22,352
No. I doubt that.

516
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,862
Do you know the multiplication table by heart?

517
00:15:26,352 --> 00:15:27,991
(Does he not know them by heart?)

518
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:28,992
Let's play a round.

519
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:30,631
If we win, let us remove a bunch.

520
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:31,632
For fun.

521
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:33,852
- If we lose, we'll do more. - I'll play a round.

522
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:34,932
- Really? - Yes.

523
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,802
- Then... - My gosh, we have to win this game.

524
00:15:38,332 --> 00:15:39,632
- I'll do it right away. - Okay.

525
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,642
- What's 8 times 5? - It's 45.

526
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:44,412
- Let's try again. - Why?

527
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:47,211
Eight times two is sixteen. Eight times three is twenty-four.

528
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,512
- It's 40. - So 8 times 5 is 40.

529
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:49,941
Eight times five is forty.

530
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:51,281
(8 times 5 is 40.)

531
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:52,381
He wants to try again. He must not have known it either.

532
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:53,598
He said he wanted to try again.

533
00:15:53,622 --> 00:15:54,881
- You didn't know either, right? - My gosh.

534
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:55,882
- You didn't know, right? - My gosh.

535
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:57,723
Hold on. Can someone tell us the right answer?

536
00:15:57,922 --> 00:15:59,891
Wait. It's a bit iffy for me to check the answers.

537
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,691
- Who majored in math here? - Yes, you tell us the answers.

538
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,091
- Gosh. Yes. - Mr. SNU, you check the answers.

539
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,861
- Okay. Mr. SNU. - You must check them fast.

540
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:05,931
Let's scrap the last round.

541
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,572
- That never happened. - Let's try again.

542
00:16:07,702 --> 00:16:09,202
- What's 7 times 2? - It's 14.

543
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,101
- What's 8 times 8? - It's 64.

544
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:12,202
Gosh, that was a hard one.

545
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:14,272
- What's 4 times 9? - It's 36.

546
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:15,842
- What's 6 times 8? - It's 48.

547
00:16:16,302 --> 00:16:17,442
What's 7 times 6?

548
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:19,211
- It's 42. - Okay.

549
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,452
- Is it correct? Okay. - Wrong.

550
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:21,781
What?

551
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,081
- Why? - No, 7 times 6 is 42.

552
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,611
- No, 7 times 6 is 42. - I'm sorry.

553
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:25,982
He must've gone mad!

554
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,251
- Hey, come here. - You went to SNU! What is this?

555
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,922
- What are you talking about? - Listen.

556
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:30,691
What's going on, Mr. SNU?

557
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:32,422
- You're the weakest one. - Hey, he's out.

558
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,121
Se Yoon, let's scrap the last one.

559
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:35,491
Why do you keep doing that?

560
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,432
- Well, this... - Why does that keep happening?

561
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,702
(You'll all forget about it, right?)

562
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:42,262
I'll win this time.

563
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:43,772
All right. Let's do it.

564
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:45,672
- What's 9 times 8? - It's 72.

565
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,372
- What's 4 times 4? - It's 16.

566
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:49,402
- What's 8 times 7? - It's 56.

567
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:51,572
- What's 3 times 2? - It's 12.

568
00:16:52,172 --> 00:16:53,512
- What? - It's 12.

569
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:55,182
What?

570
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:58,652
(You fool!)

571
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,682
(Utterly embarrassed)

572
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:03,222
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

573
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:05,292
- Who came up with this game? - Gosh, this...

574
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:07,261
My gosh. Is someone adding more water parsley from the bottom?

575
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:08,538
The water parsley keeps rising up.

576
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:09,562
I mean...

577
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,091
There must be a hole in here.

578
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:13,762
We've been going through them, but the volume isn't going down.

579
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:15,561
It's just us here.

580
00:17:15,562 --> 00:17:16,802
(About 40 minutes have passed.)

581
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:18,731
(They're finally done going through the water parsley.)

582
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:20,101
- Good job. - Thank you.

583
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:21,142
- Sure. - Thank you.

584
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,102
(That was exhausting.)

585
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:25,462
Can you tell them to make a lot of spicy squid salads?

586
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,181
- Seriously. Just a bit more. - Okay.

587
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:28,981
- My gosh. - I just want an appetizing sample.

588
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:30,628
- I want to entertain my tastebuds. - Okay.

589
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:33,922
(The owner of the food truck used the water parsley...)

590
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:37,192
(to make the spicy squid salad.)

591
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:40,292
(The staff enjoyed the dish very much.)

592
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:42,322
What? So did you earn money?

593
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,162
What did you do?

594
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:45,962
- We cleaned the water parsley. - What?

595
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:48,402
- You cleaned it? - Yes.

596
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:49,702
Good job.

597
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:51,631
Attention, please.

598
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:52,772
Okay.

599
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,242
Right now,

600
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:57,041
your last chance to earn more seed money...

601
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,542
is set up outside.

602
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:00,312
Once these 30 minutes are over,

603
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:03,142
- you won't be able to earn money. - We'll have to play then.

604
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:05,728
You'll no longer have chances to earn more seed money after this.

605
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,122
No pressure. Just take a look.

606
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:09,751
If you want to earn more money, you can participate.

607
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:11,222
- My gosh, it's up to us. - Hey.

608
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:12,722
Joon, this is our last chance.

609
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:14,668
Hey, let's turn the table around. Okay?

610
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,521
Se Yoon, we just need to hit it big once.

611
00:18:16,522 --> 00:18:17,731
(Will Se Yoon and Joon be able to become rich?)

612
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:19,992
I'll give my all this time around.

613
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:22,561
(A spring evening in Yangsan is still chilly.)

614
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:24,402
- Gosh, it's cold at night. Right? - Yes.

615
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:27,371
I guess we'll do it afterward.

616
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,102
- I see. After this. - Right?

617
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,671
Oh, no.

618
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:32,211
(An outdoor space for the grand seed festival)

619
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,611
You can go to the stations you like...

620
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,312
and earn more seed money.

621
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:36,411
Wait.

622
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:37,881
- Why is there a jegi? - I like this.

623
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:38,982
Oh, no. My money.

624
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:41,752
(Game 1 of the grand seed festival, kick the jegi)

625
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:43,151
To enter, I need 10,000 seeds.

626
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:45,128
For each time I kick the jegi, I get 1,000 seeds. Hey.

627
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:47,721
(They must kick it more than ten times to break even.)

628
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:49,621
- Okay. - This game is made for Jong Min.

629
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:52,062
- This game is perfect for Jong Min. - I'll kick it 50 times.

630
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:53,802
Oh, no.

631
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:55,801
- Kick it more than ten times. - Can we practice?

632
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,201
(As he's not good at kicking the jegi, )

633
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,762
(he heads over to a different station.)

634
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,101
What's this?

635
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:01,748
(Game 2 of the grand seed festival, a random sword draw)

636
00:19:01,772 --> 00:19:03,611
My gosh, it's a similar system from the previous game.

637
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:04,612
- Right, Sae Ho? - Yes.

638
00:19:04,613 --> 00:19:06,072
But the probability went up.

639
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:08,011
(Only one of them is a real sword.)

640
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:09,942
(They can double up their seeds.)

641
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:12,082
This is just crazy.

642
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:13,881
At least... Hey, this one is great.

643
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:15,781
I can play this. Jong Min. I got this.

644
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:17,451
- You can't practice. - Okay.

645
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:19,051
(You'll win the number of seeds written on the balloons.)

646
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:21,062
I checked out the darts. Here's what's iffy.

647
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:23,072
- Many of them have the minus sign. - Yes.

648
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:25,161
- I really have good aim. - That's 3,000.

649
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:26,631
(The balloons with the minus sign are all over the board.)

650
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,401
- This balloon says 10,000 seeds. - I can do it. It's doable.

651
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:30,162
- I can try it too. Sae Ho. - Yes.

652
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:31,852
- I'm good at this too. - Let's do it.

653
00:19:32,332 --> 00:19:34,071
(Sae Ho and Seon Ho: 27,500 seeds, Jong Min and DinDin: 20,000 seeds, )

654
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,941
(Se Yoon and Joon: 10,000 seeds)

655
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,311
(Here you go. These are 10,000 seeds.)

656
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:38,671
- Which one? - The jegi game.

657
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:40,382
- Jong Min will kick the jegi. - Okay.

658
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:42,481
I can smell that.

659
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,581
- I already paid 10,000 seeds. - Team Jong Min paid 10,000 seeds.

660
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:46,011
For each time you kick the jegi,

661
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:47,481
- What? - you'll earn 1,000 seeds.

662
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:48,922
If he grabs the jegi, will it reset?

663
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:50,021
- You can only do it once. - No, it's over.

664
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,152
- Just once? - Just once?

665
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:52,322
- Just once. - If he grabs it.

666
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:53,322
- That's not fair. - What?

667
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:54,322
How?

668
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:56,363
(Everyone knows Jong Min is the king of jegichagi.)

669
00:19:57,092 --> 00:19:58,691
I won't go overboard. If I kick it ten times, I'll break even.

670
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:00,332
- Yes. Just ten. - I'll break even.

671
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:01,562
- Here it goes. - No?

672
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:03,362
- It's over. - Two,

673
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:04,671
- three, - It's over.

674
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:05,831
- four, - It's going up high.

675
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:06,971
- five, - The lights are getting in the way.

676
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,212
- six, seven... - Six, seven...

677
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:11,372
(He's in control of his feet like a pro.)

678
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:14,712
- Oh, no. - Eight, nine...

679
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:17,611
(If he kicks it one more time, he'll break even.)

680
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:19,051
- Ten. - That's ten.

681
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,181
- No. He missed it. - Ten.

682
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:21,721
- I kicked it ten times. - What is it?

683
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,221
- Nine. - No, it was ten.

684
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,222
- It was ten. - No.

685
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,151
- I kicked it. - You saw it.

686
00:20:26,152 --> 00:20:27,321
- That's 10,000 seeds. - Listen.

687
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:28,591
The lights were blinding my eyes.

688
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:29,661
- Turn around and do it then. - My eyes...

689
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:30,791
- The lights are so blinding. - Turn around and do it.

690
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:32,261
- My gosh. - So he didn't fail?

691
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:33,361
My gosh, the lights are too bright for my eyes.

692
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,332
Once I kick it, I can't see it well.

693
00:20:35,762 --> 00:20:37,032
But this...

694
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:38,871
The lights are too blinding indeed.

695
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:40,752
(The lights must be too bright for their eyes.)

696
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:42,171
- I already paid. - But...

697
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:43,242
- He did? - Yes.

698
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:44,872
Here I go.

699
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:46,412
Okay.

700
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,511
- One, two... My gosh. - One, two, three,

701
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:50,351
- four, five, six, - Four.

702
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:51,912
- seven... - Okay.

703
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:53,311
- They lost money! - What happened?

704
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:54,421
(He only kicked it 7 times?)

705
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:56,052
- They lost money! - My gosh.

706
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:58,121
(They lost money!)

707
00:20:58,122 --> 00:20:59,151
(Deducting 3,000 seeds)

708
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:00,421
- Hey, they lost money. - I'm sorry.

709
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:02,591
- Sae Ho. - My pants were sliding down.

710
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:03,991
(You said you were good at this.)

711
00:21:03,992 --> 00:21:05,391
- Let's not play it again. - We won't play it again.

712
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:07,638
- We'll lose more money. - I have a bad feeling about this.

713
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:09,031
Why did my pants have to slide down?

714
00:21:09,032 --> 00:21:10,331
(They lose 3,000 seeds because of Sae Ho.)

715
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:11,701
- It's okay. - Gosh, my pants slid down.

716
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:14,018
- But we only lost 3,000 seeds. - Should we play 1 more round?

717
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:15,301
We're going to play this one.

718
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:16,302
- Okay. How many seeds... - These are 5,000 seeds.

719
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:18,588
- How many? Okay, 5,000 seeds. - Hey, that's too expensive.

720
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:19,712
Let's take a look.

721
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:21,041
The moment you touch it,

722
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:22,412
- you can't change it. - Okay.

723
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:24,411
When you draw it, you must say, "Face my sword."

724
00:21:24,412 --> 00:21:26,482
After you say it out loud, you can draw the sword.

725
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:27,951
We have to draw a long sword, right?

726
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:30,492
No, you must draw a real sword to earn money.

727
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:32,322
But this one is really hard.

728
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:34,192
You know? This is...

729
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:37,931
(DinDin carefully scrutinizes the swords.)

730
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:38,962
Okay.

731
00:21:39,362 --> 00:21:40,401
- I'll do it. - Okay.

732
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:41,601
- Once you touch it... - Okay!

733
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:43,661
- You can't touch other swords. - He picked it.

734
00:21:43,662 --> 00:21:45,032
(Did DinDin pick the real sword?)

735
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:47,372
Face my sword!

736
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:48,601
(Surprised)

737
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:51,541
(He successfully draws the real sword.)

738
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:52,571
- Gosh. - That's amazing.

739
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:54,441
(DinDin is surely a lucky guy.)

740
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:56,541
- How many seeds did you spend? - We doubled it. We bet 5,000 seeds.

741
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,552
- Really? - My gosh.

742
00:21:57,912 --> 00:21:59,151
(They acquire 10,000 seeds, twice the amount they paid.)

743
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,828
- My gosh. - Team Jong Min, you succeeded.

744
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,551
- They earned a lot of seeds. - We doubled it.

745
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:03,768
- We doubled it. - This can be risky.

746
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,891
- Let's go. - That can be risky for us.

747
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:07,932
- Let's check that. - Should we play the other one?

748
00:22:08,922 --> 00:22:10,642
- Could you exchange this to money? - Sure.

749
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:12,432
- Do you think you can do it? - Yes.

750
00:22:13,162 --> 00:22:14,231
I can do it. I'll go for it.

751
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,831
Look at it carefully. Which one are you going for?

752
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:17,332
Me?

753
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,201
Where is it? Hold on.

754
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:20,202
- Hey. - Where's 5,000?

755
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:21,401
The 5,000-seed balloon is over there. It's the red one.

756
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:23,148
- I'll aim for the 5,000-seed one. - The purple one is 10,000.

757
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:25,811
(Joon is targeting the high-numbered balloons.)

758
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,111
Don't get too worked up.

759
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,142
Hey, don't get too worked up. Breathe.

760
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:30,581
- Calm down. - Here's why.

761
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,351
- I can feel my luck has turned now. - All right. Just get one.

762
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,658
Okay. At least get the 500-seed balloon.

763
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:37,305
(What's the result?)

764
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,619
All right. Just get one. Okay. At least get the 500-seed balloon.

765
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:42,043
(What's the result?)

766
00:22:45,283 --> 00:22:46,313
My gosh.

767
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:49,053
(The balloon didn't pop, so it's a dud.)

768
00:22:49,923 --> 00:22:51,222
(Sighing)

769
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:52,522
(The unlucky guy had another unlucky result.)

770
00:22:52,523 --> 00:22:54,152
You still have one more dart left.

771
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:55,522
- Hey. - Why didn't it pop?

772
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:56,992
Hey, you're not supposed to throw it like this.

773
00:22:56,993 --> 00:22:59,113
The trajectory is supposed to follow a parabolic arc.

774
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:01,409
He's going for it right away. He must've lost his mind.

775
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:03,503
(He tries out for the 2nd time right away.)

776
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:05,673
(Joon throws his last dart.)

777
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:07,202
Okay. Which one is it?

778
00:23:07,203 --> 00:23:08,702
(He popped a balloon this time!)

779
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:09,872
- Which one is it? - Which one?

780
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:10,903
Which one is it?

781
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:12,372
He won 500 seeds.

782
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:13,843
(He won 500 seeds.)

783
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:15,942
(A cold gaze)

784
00:23:15,943 --> 00:23:18,483
(Of all balloons, he pops the 500-seed one.)

785
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:21,252
- Step out. - Well done.

786
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:22,323
Let me try it too.

787
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:24,352
- I'll play 1 round. - Sure. I'll give you 500 seeds.

788
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:25,522
(Se Yoon pays 1,000 seeds for the dart game.)

789
00:23:25,523 --> 00:23:26,892
- He's frustrating. - One more...

790
00:23:26,893 --> 00:23:28,553
Nothing is going my way today.

791
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:29,823
Yes.

792
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:31,162
It's 10,000 seeds.

793
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:32,863
(Se Yoon is their only hope.)

794
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,732
- Watch. - Se Yoon, you got this.

795
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:36,133
- Here it goes. - Let's go.

796
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:37,763
Get the one with a minus sign!

797
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,372
Get the minus sign!

798
00:23:39,373 --> 00:23:40,809
(The rest of them are hoping he'd fail.)

799
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,942
(The dart has been thrown.)

800
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,002
Get the minus sign!

801
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:45,813
- Okay. I broke even. - That's 1,000 seeds.

802
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:47,742
- I broke even. - That's fine.

803
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:48,813
- Great. - Slowly.

804
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:51,442
- The next one is 3,000 seeds. - Get the 1,000-seed one.

805
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:53,412
- Get the minus sign. - That one has minus 5,000.

806
00:23:53,413 --> 00:23:55,183
- Get the minus sign. - That's minus 5,000!

807
00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:56,353
I just want to make a little bit more. Come on.

808
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,353
- Get the minus sign! - Get the minus sign!

809
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:58,992
(He carefully throws it!)

810
00:23:58,993 --> 00:24:00,092
- Get the minus sign! - Get the minus sign!

811
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:01,622
(What's the result?)

812
00:24:01,623 --> 00:24:02,993
- Okay! How many seeds? - Gosh.

813
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:04,163
What is it?

814
00:24:04,164 --> 00:24:05,739
(How many seeds did it say on the balloon?)

815
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:07,192
- You won 1,000 seeds. - It's 1,000 seeds.

816
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:08,609
- So a total of 2,000 seeds... - I made money.

817
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:10,703
- You made money. - Gosh, we broke even.

818
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,003
Let's draw the sword.

819
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,632
(They play the next game with the momentum.)

820
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:17,843
We can only play it once. So we must bet 500 seeds.

821
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:19,772
We'll bet only 500 seeds and play jegichagi next.

822
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:21,372
Just trust me on this.

823
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:23,242
- Here. Yes. What? - You'll only bet 500 seeds?

824
00:24:23,243 --> 00:24:24,282
Nothing.

825
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:25,283
Are you looking down on us because we're broke?

826
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:26,283
No.

827
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:27,682
- No. - Who knows? What if...

828
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:28,782
I kick the jegi 200 times?

829
00:24:28,783 --> 00:24:29,783
Right.

830
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:31,823
I was a former ninja.

831
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,723
The moment you touch it, you can't change it.

832
00:24:35,253 --> 00:24:36,933
He must've lost it. What's wrong with him?

833
00:24:37,063 --> 00:24:39,423
Hey, what are you doing? Just don't do anything. Which one?

834
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:41,793
The moment you touch it...

835
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:43,503
(Ninja Joon picks a sword.)

836
00:24:43,703 --> 00:24:47,302
(DinDin also picked the sword in the same spot and succeeded.)

837
00:24:47,303 --> 00:24:49,743
(Will he succeed just like DinDin?)

838
00:24:49,873 --> 00:24:52,272
(He's already feeling nervous.)

839
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:53,343
What's gotten into him?

840
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:54,643
Face...

841
00:24:55,013 --> 00:24:56,143
- my sword! - Face it.

842
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,383
- Okay. - Okay.

843
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:00,913
Okay.

844
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:02,752
- It looked easy, didn't it? - How many seeds did you bet?

845
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:04,153
(Their 500 seeds have disappeared.)

846
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,353
Team Se Yoon, you failed.

847
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:08,923
(Sighing)

848
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:11,623
(In the end, he ends up with the strand of water parsley.)

849
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:14,892
(We're doomed.)

850
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:16,903
What's that? Pull that out. We bought it.

851
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:19,802
We need to eat that later.

852
00:25:19,803 --> 00:25:21,279
(Pulling out their precious water parsley)

853
00:25:21,303 --> 00:25:22,472
Hey, just leave it to me.

854
00:25:22,473 --> 00:25:26,413
(He keeps it in his pocket to eat it later.)

855
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:28,242
- Could you speed it up? - All right.

856
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:29,683
- Okay. - We're waiting too.

857
00:25:29,983 --> 00:25:31,013
Seon Ho will go for it.

858
00:25:31,283 --> 00:25:32,612
- You won 10,000 seeds. - Gosh.

859
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:34,029
- That's 10,000 seeds. - He popped the 10,000-seed one.

860
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:36,852
(Seon Ho popped the balloon in the upper right corner.)

861
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:38,822
- That's 10,000 seeds. - He popped the 10,000-seed one.

862
00:25:38,823 --> 00:25:41,153
(With Seon Ho, the dart genius...)

863
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:43,243
- None of this requires power. - It's over.

864
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,292
Fifteen, sixteen...

865
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,332
(Printing seed money in real time)

866
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,763
Eighteen, nineteen...

867
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,233
(He even shows off a cool trick.)

868
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:50,963
Okay!

869
00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:52,672
- Gosh, he made a lot of seeds. - That's amazing.

870
00:25:52,673 --> 00:25:53,702
- Okay. - It's okay.

871
00:25:53,703 --> 00:25:55,183
- Hey, well done. - Did you see that?

872
00:25:55,573 --> 00:25:57,603
- It flew up. - You did better than expected.

873
00:25:58,273 --> 00:25:59,313
Okay.

874
00:25:59,713 --> 00:26:01,042
(Sae Ho and Seon Ho: 43,500 seeds, Jong Min and DinDin: 34,000 seeds, )

875
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:02,812
(Se Yoon and Joon: 10,000 seeds)

876
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:03,982
Seriously.

877
00:26:03,983 --> 00:26:06,213
I'll show you why I was the head of recreation studies.

878
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,493
This leaves me with no choice. I just have to do it.

879
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:13,569
They'll never want to present this game again after today.

880
00:26:13,593 --> 00:26:14,593
Great.

881
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:17,563
This is the plot twist.

882
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:20,593
After falling behind,

883
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:22,733
we will place first.

884
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,503
Se Yoon, how many seeds do we have?

885
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:26,703
These are all we have.

886
00:26:26,704 --> 00:26:28,233
- Is it 10,000? - We're going all in.

887
00:26:29,143 --> 00:26:30,503
All in again?

888
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:33,373
- Are you going all in? - Yes.

889
00:26:33,943 --> 00:26:35,643
Things haven't been going well for us.

890
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:38,183
(They bet all their money on jegi.)

891
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:41,983
(Se Yoon was the head of the recreation department.)

892
00:26:43,523 --> 00:26:45,353
(You can count on me.)

893
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:47,823
You can do it.

894
00:26:47,824 --> 00:26:49,093
(How many will Se Yoon kick?)

895
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:51,992
(By the way, was Se Yoon good at jegichagi?)

896
00:26:51,993 --> 00:26:53,233
One, two,

897
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:54,733
three, four.

898
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:57,302
(He's average when it comes to jegichagi.)

899
00:26:57,303 --> 00:26:58,303
Here I go.

900
00:26:58,304 --> 00:26:59,732
- I'll make it. - You can do it.

901
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:00,773
(What will be the result?)

902
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,373
One, two, three, four,

903
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:05,072
five, six...

904
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:06,943
(After 6, the jegi touches his body.)

905
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:08,613
- Seven. - Eight,

906
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:09,842
nine, ten.

907
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:10,882
You've got it.

908
00:27:10,883 --> 00:27:13,382
Two, three, four,

909
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,452
- five, - He's good.

910
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:16,653
- six, seven, eight... - What's going on?

911
00:27:16,923 --> 00:27:18,923
Twenty, twenty-one...

912
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:21,593
(Are you watching this?)

913
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:22,693
He's good.

914
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:24,492
(Spectators gather after hearing about Se Yoon.)

915
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:25,562
What's going on?

916
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:28,492
(And one person who's cheering for him the most)

917
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:33,032
(Se Yoon is doing an amazing job.)

918
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:35,503
Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two,

919
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:37,672
twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five...

920
00:27:37,673 --> 00:27:38,772
(That's a shame.)

921
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:39,773
Okay.

922
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:40,972
(He still did 25.)

923
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:42,372
He did 25.

924
00:27:42,373 --> 00:27:43,513
- I got it. - Yes.

925
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:48,053
(Se Yoon set the highest record.)

926
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,083
(We're rich now.)

927
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:53,223
Gosh.

928
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:57,423
That's right.

929
00:27:57,823 --> 00:27:59,432
- Look at this. - We did it.

930
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:01,933
(Touching a large sum of seeds for the first time)

931
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:03,162
You did a good job.

932
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:05,662
(He's recognized as the head of recreation.)

933
00:28:05,663 --> 00:28:07,032
You kicked jegi 25 times?

934
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,232
(Thanks to Se Yoon, they came back to life.)

935
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,303
That's incredible.

936
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:10,943
Take 1,000 seeds.

937
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:12,712
Let's go after 10,000 or 5,000.

938
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:14,473
Someone took 10,000 seeds already.

939
00:28:15,673 --> 00:28:16,842
Someone took 10,000.

940
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:18,642
(Only one 10,000-seed balloon remains.)

941
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:19,912
Go after the pink one that's worth 10,000 seeds.

942
00:28:19,913 --> 00:28:21,252
(They have only one target.)

943
00:28:21,253 --> 00:28:22,282
Do it.

944
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,283
(The last 10,000 seeds)

945
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,322
Now?

946
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:25,653
(Which team will obtain them?)

947
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:27,622
(Team Jong Min and DinDin)

948
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,022
(Failed)

949
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:30,023
(Throwing)

950
00:28:30,024 --> 00:28:31,193
What are you doing?

951
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:32,862
(Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho)

952
00:28:32,863 --> 00:28:33,863
Darn it.

953
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:36,362
- He missed it. - Gosh.

954
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:37,363
That was close.

955
00:28:37,563 --> 00:28:38,602
Goodness.

956
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:40,333
Stop making a fuss.

957
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:41,932
It's all or nothing!

958
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:43,142
- Throw it. - Here I go.

959
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:44,402
- Joon. - Here I go.

960
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:46,013
(It goes down to the ground.)

961
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:48,113
- Good job. - It wasn't bad.

962
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:49,882
Move out of my way.

963
00:28:49,883 --> 00:28:51,812
(Today's rescue pitcher appears.)

964
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,013
Look only at the pink balloon.

965
00:28:53,553 --> 00:28:54,873
- Get the minus sign. - Goodness.

966
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:00,793
(What happened?)

967
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:04,063
(Rewinding)

968
00:29:04,563 --> 00:29:07,663
(He got the last one of 10,000 seeds.)

969
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:11,603
(Screaming with joy)

970
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:15,973
(The dramatic twist becomes reality.)

971
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:22,372
(Thank you, Se Yoon.)

972
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:23,712
Give them to him.

973
00:29:23,713 --> 00:29:25,583
(Pressing them for the seeds)

974
00:29:28,753 --> 00:29:29,753
Aren't you happy?

975
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:31,753
(Aren't I good at playing darts?)

976
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,622
- Is it over now? - Give it to me.

977
00:29:33,623 --> 00:29:34,922
It's over once they play jegichagi.

978
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:36,162
(Team Se Yoon and Joon are waiting to play jegichagi.)

979
00:29:36,163 --> 00:29:37,593
Did they play jegichagi only once?

980
00:29:37,663 --> 00:29:39,163
We have one more turn.

981
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,092
All right, is it your last time?

982
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:43,162
Seriously, he might interfere...

983
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:44,562
I'll block him.

984
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:45,909
- What's the problem? - Excuse me.

985
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:46,933
(Blocking him completely)

986
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:48,332
- I understand. - We're desperate now.

987
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,002
(It's a precious chance. Don't interfere.)

988
00:29:51,003 --> 00:29:52,742
We came back to life from being poor.

989
00:29:52,743 --> 00:29:53,842
Please understand.

990
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:55,672
Can you go over there?

991
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:56,712
- Gosh. - Thank you.

992
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,273
- You seem very sensitive. - Thank you.

993
00:29:58,783 --> 00:30:00,013
Water parsley.

994
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:01,282
They started.

995
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:03,123
I exchanged with DinDin's earlier.

996
00:30:04,023 --> 00:30:05,483
Are you okay?

997
00:30:05,823 --> 00:30:07,653
Gosh, he practically flew.

998
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:09,762
He must be very desperate to eat.

999
00:30:09,763 --> 00:30:10,763
Goodness.

1000
00:30:11,193 --> 00:30:12,322
Here I go.

1001
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:13,993
(Se Yoon's last attempt at jegichagi)

1002
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:17,103
Two, three, four,

1003
00:30:17,603 --> 00:30:18,703
five, six...

1004
00:30:20,203 --> 00:30:22,743
(If he misses it, it will be over.)

1005
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:26,212
Are you okay?

1006
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:28,673
Hey, he's serious about this.

1007
00:30:29,173 --> 00:30:30,713
He's serious about this.

1008
00:30:30,983 --> 00:30:32,042
He practically flew.

1009
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:33,453
(Se Yoon, was this necessary?)

1010
00:30:36,453 --> 00:30:38,482
- I caught it, didn't I? - Yes, you did.

1011
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:39,963
(The reason why he's working so hard)

1012
00:30:40,593 --> 00:30:42,922
(He met a younger friend.)

1013
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:45,692
(He made a promise to him.)

1014
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:46,732
You just wait and see.

1015
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:49,033
(I'll make you the winner.)

1016
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:52,832
(I've never forgotten my promise.)

1017
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:53,903
He caught it.

1018
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:56,972
He threw his body to catch it.

1019
00:30:56,973 --> 00:30:58,173
He's serious about this.

1020
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,673
He flew from here to there.

1021
00:30:59,913 --> 00:31:01,673
He must be very desperate to eat.

1022
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,612
Everyone, let's cheer...

1023
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:04,742
- for Se Yoon. - Let's cheer.

1024
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:06,583
- You can do it. - Moon Se Yoon.

1025
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:08,252
- Moon Se Yoon. - Moon Se Yoon.

1026
00:31:08,253 --> 00:31:11,623
- Sing together. - Moon Se Yoon.

1027
00:31:12,223 --> 00:31:14,152
Take it easy, Se Yoon.

1028
00:31:14,153 --> 00:31:17,192
(For his immature friend)

1029
00:31:17,193 --> 00:31:19,833
(Se Yoon's last attempt)

1030
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:21,633
Here I go.

1031
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:23,133
(He gives it a try.)

1032
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:24,233
In case it bothers him.

1033
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:25,402
- One, two, - One.

1034
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:27,433
Three, four, five,

1035
00:31:27,703 --> 00:31:28,932
six, seven...

1036
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:30,073
He's got it. Eight.

1037
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:31,703
He's good at it.

1038
00:31:32,203 --> 00:31:33,212
Nine.

1039
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:34,843
- That's good. - One,

1040
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:36,243
- two, three, - two, three,

1041
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:37,783
- four, five... - four, five...

1042
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:40,252
- We're going to be rich. - Six, seven, eight...

1043
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:42,013
(He's becoming rich in real time.)

1044
00:31:42,713 --> 00:31:44,053
Nine, ten.

1045
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:46,892
Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three,

1046
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:48,023
- twenty-four, - You got it.

1047
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:49,693
Twenty-five, twenty-six...

1048
00:31:51,863 --> 00:31:53,262
- Thirty, thirty-one, - How is he so good?

1049
00:31:53,263 --> 00:31:54,763
Thirty-two, thirty-three,

1050
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:56,763
thirty-four, thirty-five,

1051
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,333
thirty-six, thirty-seven,

1052
00:31:58,663 --> 00:32:00,072
thirty-eight, thirty-nine...

1053
00:32:00,073 --> 00:32:02,313
(He even does a performance of kicking jegi in the air.)

1054
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:06,312
(An extraordinary moment)

1055
00:32:06,313 --> 00:32:07,843
Thirty-eight, thirty-nine...

1056
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:10,743
(Finishing with a leg split)

1057
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:13,982
(His ending pose)

1058
00:32:13,983 --> 00:32:15,613
He did 39.

1059
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:19,252
This is what he's been talking about.

1060
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:20,652
They're going to make a fortune.

1061
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:23,193
- We don't have much money. - Life is great.

1062
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:25,092
Don't work so hard.

1063
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:26,832
Go for it in one go.

1064
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:27,993
One time is all it takes.

1065
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:30,263
- That's a bummer. - This is amazing.

1066
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:32,362
Go and get the seeds.

1067
00:32:32,363 --> 00:32:35,172
(They won 29,000 seeds in an instant.)

1068
00:32:35,173 --> 00:32:36,372
(The final result of seed money)

1069
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:37,653
(Se Yoon and Joon: 61,000 seeds)

1070
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,712
Let me take a photo in front of the world champion award.

1071
00:32:39,713 --> 00:32:41,373
- Yes. - That's a good idea.

1072
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:42,942
You were amazing today.

1073
00:32:42,943 --> 00:32:44,243
One, two, three.

1074
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:46,352
We're rich.

1075
00:32:46,353 --> 00:32:47,812
(Joon, you can count on me.)

1076
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:48,983
Gosh, I'm hungry.

1077
00:32:49,253 --> 00:32:51,122
Can we eat now?

1078
00:32:51,123 --> 00:32:53,222
- We didn't eat much today. - I agree.

1079
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:54,622
We didn't get any carbs.

1080
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:56,922
Eating meagerly at the field isn't enough...

1081
00:32:56,923 --> 00:32:58,523
- to fill our stomach. - Right.

1082
00:32:59,323 --> 00:33:00,632
(His only meal for the day)

1083
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:02,863
(Devouring pork belly with water parsley in a rush)

1084
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:05,253
You'll be pleasantly surprised by your upcoming meal.

1085
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:07,932
Did you fully experience spring while traveling...

1086
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:09,672
around Yangsan today?

1087
00:33:09,673 --> 00:33:10,673
Yes.

1088
00:33:10,674 --> 00:33:12,772
Eating is probably the best way...

1089
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,572
to experience spring.

1090
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:15,772
- Yes, we must eat. - Of course.

1091
00:33:15,773 --> 00:33:17,912
These days, webfoot octopus in season is the best.

1092
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,512
Wild chive doenjang soup.

1093
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:20,612
- Wild chive doenjang soup? - What is it called?

1094
00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:21,613
- Se Yoon. - Flounder?

1095
00:33:21,614 --> 00:33:23,782
- Flounder stew with mugwort. - Flounder stew with mugwort.

1096
00:33:23,783 --> 00:33:24,783
Pork galbi.

1097
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:25,922
Galbitang.

1098
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:27,252
- LA galbi. - Pork belly.

1099
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:28,253
- All right. - Jjajangmyeon.

1100
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:29,253
- Bibimbap. - Sarcodon mushroom soup.

1101
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:30,723
Everyone, please listen.

1102
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:32,763
Tonight's Dinner Game is...

1103
00:33:32,993 --> 00:33:35,162
a mysterious auction.

1104
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:37,203
- Is it an auction again? - Goodness.

1105
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:38,802
You have to buy the food...

1106
00:33:38,803 --> 00:33:40,432
with your seed money.

1107
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:42,072
- We didn't know about this. - Since it's a mysterious auction,

1108
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:43,442
the dish won't be revealed...

1109
00:33:43,443 --> 00:33:45,473
until it's auctioned off.

1110
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:47,313
We won't know.

1111
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:50,142
You'll participate in the auction after listening...

1112
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:51,612
to the description of the dish.

1113
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,783
This will be hard.

1114
00:33:53,253 --> 00:33:54,482
(Today's auctioneer: Director Joo Jong Hyun)

1115
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:55,483
(Gavel)

1116
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,482
There's a total of eight dishes.

1117
00:33:57,483 --> 00:33:59,592
- Here's the first dish. - Is it coming?

1118
00:33:59,593 --> 00:34:01,593
Do we get to... It's covered.

1119
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:04,162
It looks very light.

1120
00:34:04,163 --> 00:34:05,222
Look how light it looks.

1121
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:06,792
That's definitely a type of appetizer.

1122
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:08,113
- It must be a salad. - Everyone.

1123
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:12,333
It's the first dish that announces the spring.

1124
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:15,273
After winter, it becomes so sweet...

1125
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:17,542
that it can stimulate anyone's appetite.

1126
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:19,912
- It's a typical spring dish. - Seasoned spring cabbage?

1127
00:34:19,913 --> 00:34:22,272
If it's good with rice, it'd be either spring cabbage...

1128
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:23,793
- or wild chive doenjang soup. - Okay.

1129
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:25,642
(In season from March to April)

1130
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:27,843
(Could it be spring cabbage that announces the spring?)

1131
00:34:27,953 --> 00:34:30,283
(Or wild chive doenjang soup full of spring fragrance?)

1132
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,152
The bid will start...

1133
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,393
from 1,000 seeds.

1134
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:35,822
- Shall we bluff? - Let's bluff...

1135
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,062
and take all of their money.

1136
00:34:37,063 --> 00:34:38,293
Let's keep raising the price.

1137
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:39,762
Okay?

1138
00:34:39,763 --> 00:34:40,792
We'll make a bid.

1139
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:42,092
- We'll start. - Jong Min?

1140
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:43,602
- We bid 10,000. - We bid 10,000.

1141
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:44,662
- Did you say 10,000 seeds? - Yes.

1142
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:45,832
- Ten thousand seeds? - Are you crazy?

1143
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,102
- Already? - Of course.

1144
00:34:47,103 --> 00:34:48,702
You have so much money. Why won't you spend it?

1145
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:50,543
- How much do you have? - I won't tell you.

1146
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:52,442
It announces the spring.

1147
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:53,572
It announces the spring.

1148
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:55,312
- Are you really bidding 10,000? - We give up.

1149
00:34:55,313 --> 00:34:56,783
- We give up too. - Right.

1150
00:34:57,243 --> 00:34:58,912
We worked very hard to come this far.

1151
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:01,883
Remember that we have eight dishes.

1152
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:03,622
- We worked very hard. - It's fine.

1153
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:05,122
I'm sorry, but can we start over?

1154
00:35:05,123 --> 00:35:06,752
No, you can't take back your bid...

1155
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:07,753
at an auction.

1156
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:08,952
What do the other teams say?

1157
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:10,922
A price of 10,000 is too high.

1158
00:35:10,923 --> 00:35:12,022
- Gosh. - We also give up.

1159
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:13,493
- It's too high. - They can eat it.

1160
00:35:13,663 --> 00:35:15,309
How can it cost 10,000 seeds? We don't know what it is.

1161
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,562
This isn't fun. Let's do it again.

1162
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:17,602
Listen, I'm sorry.

1163
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:18,603
- For 2,000... - I'm sorry.

1164
00:35:18,603 --> 00:35:19,603
You can't take it back.

1165
00:35:19,604 --> 00:35:20,973
- Se Yoon. - It's over.

1166
00:35:21,173 --> 00:35:22,173
All right.

1167
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:23,872
Jong Min and DinDin.

1168
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:25,373
Sold at 10,000 seeds.

1169
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:27,312
- My goodness. - Come on.

1170
00:35:27,313 --> 00:35:28,642
It could be something delicious.

1171
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:29,912
- It's definitely good. - I'm sorry.

1172
00:35:29,913 --> 00:35:31,112
We tried to make them lose their money.

1173
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:33,213
- It's sold at 10,000 seeds. - He's not fun.

1174
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,212
The price started at 1,000.

1175
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:36,682
- You can't bid 10,000. - Exactly.

1176
00:35:36,683 --> 00:35:37,822
Who would bid higher?

1177
00:35:37,823 --> 00:35:39,459
- Don't you know about bluffing? - Everyone.

1178
00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:41,522
We'll serve the dish right away.

1179
00:35:41,523 --> 00:35:43,362
I bet it's seasoned spring cabbage.

1180
00:35:43,363 --> 00:35:44,662
- Spring cabbage or wild chives. - It could be something good.

1181
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:47,963
The dish could be amazing from the start.

1182
00:35:48,593 --> 00:35:49,702
What is it? Let's see.

1183
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:51,432
- Shall we reveal it? - Open it.

1184
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:52,662
- Can we take a look? - Go ahead.

1185
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:54,233
- One. - Open it.

1186
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:56,703
- It looks nice. - I bet it's nice.

1187
00:35:57,343 --> 00:35:58,503
Is it mushrooms?

1188
00:35:58,673 --> 00:36:00,173
Is there no twist?

1189
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:01,542
- Pardon? - Without any twist,

1190
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:02,913
will the dishes be in order?

1191
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,612
- "Without any twist?" - What is it?

1192
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:05,943
It must be a type of appetizer.

1193
00:36:06,183 --> 00:36:07,312
It's spring cabbage.

1194
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:08,612
- It looks good. - It's spring cabbage.

1195
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:10,253
They bought it for 10,000.

1196
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:13,252
(When slightly sweet spring cabbage is mixed...)

1197
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:14,953
(with a delicious sound)

1198
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:18,622
It's incredible when mixed with rice.

1199
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:20,369
(A typical spring dish that's good with rice)

1200
00:36:20,393 --> 00:36:21,533
DinDin looks sulky.

1201
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:22,993
He's sulking.

1202
00:36:23,063 --> 00:36:25,133
- Have some. - He's sulking.

1203
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:26,833
The scent is very...

1204
00:36:26,903 --> 00:36:28,472
The scent is strong without the lid.

1205
00:36:28,473 --> 00:36:30,002
It has to be delicious. It cost 10,000 seeds.

1206
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:31,979
- It smells very sweet. - It's seasoned spring cabbage.

1207
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:33,472
Based on the description,

1208
00:36:33,473 --> 00:36:35,012
- it was obviously spring cabbage. - It was spring cabbage.

1209
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:36,412
- It was obviously spring cabbage. - It announces the spring.

1210
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:38,843
So there's no surprise in the order, right?

1211
00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:40,952
We don't know because it's a mystery.

1212
00:36:40,953 --> 00:36:42,282
We'll use all our money in the beginning.

1213
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,982
- Don't follow us. - Don't follow us.

1214
00:36:43,983 --> 00:36:44,983
Go ahead.

1215
00:36:44,984 --> 00:36:46,584
Here's what makes the next dish special.

1216
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:50,122
A typical spring vegetable with a splendid scent.

1217
00:36:50,123 --> 00:36:51,422
- Vegetable? - Vegetable?

1218
00:36:51,423 --> 00:36:52,792
It's so nutritious...

1219
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,793
that it's called ginseng of the spring.

1220
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:57,902
As it's rich in calcium,

1221
00:36:57,903 --> 00:37:01,072
it's good for growing children and against osteoporosis.

1222
00:37:01,073 --> 00:37:02,202
I'm grown up anyway.

1223
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:03,702
- This dish is... - Spinach?

1224
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:05,143
It must be spinach.

1225
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:07,572
- Let's forget it. - Again...

1226
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:08,853
We'll have two vegetable dishes.

1227
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:11,382
- We'll start from 1,000 seeds. - From 1,000 seeds?

1228
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:12,882
We bid 2,000 seeds.

1229
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:14,112
Two thousand seeds?

1230
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:15,113
We bid 1,500 seeds.

1231
00:37:16,453 --> 00:37:17,523
We bid 1,500 seeds.

1232
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:20,793
Wait, I said 2,000.

1233
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:22,853
Joon, listen to me.

1234
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:24,292
Come to your senses.

1235
00:37:24,293 --> 00:37:26,562
- At an auction, when I call 1,000, - Joon.

1236
00:37:26,563 --> 00:37:29,332
You can call either 2,100 or 2,500.

1237
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,333
The bid should increase.

1238
00:37:30,603 --> 00:37:32,432
- I bid 2,500. - You bid 2,500 seeds?

1239
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:34,702
Is the minimum increase 500?

1240
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:36,173
Let's go with 500 seeds.

1241
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:37,343
I bid 3,000 seeds.

1242
00:37:37,773 --> 00:37:40,243
- Three thousand. - Three thousand five hundred.

1243
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:41,412
We have 3,500 seeds.

1244
00:37:41,413 --> 00:37:43,313
- We bid 4,000. - They bid 4,000 seeds.

1245
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:45,882
- I bid 5,500 seeds. - We have 5,500 seeds.

1246
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:47,382
You should discuss now that it's over 5,000.

1247
00:37:47,383 --> 00:37:48,383
Okay.

1248
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:50,482
My pelvis on the right...

1249
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:51,983
got destroyed.

1250
00:37:52,183 --> 00:37:54,223
- Joon is being daring. - You should discuss.

1251
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:56,353
You need at least one dish. Right, Joon?

1252
00:37:56,493 --> 00:37:58,322
- You need one dish at least. - We bid 5,500 seeds.

1253
00:37:58,323 --> 00:37:59,403
Five thousand five hundred.

1254
00:37:59,523 --> 00:38:01,493
- Five thousand and five hundred? - Six thousand.

1255
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:02,663
What?

1256
00:38:03,463 --> 00:38:05,402
- Six thousand. - Joon, are you going to lose?

1257
00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:07,763
Are you going to lose? Don't forget that you're a red hare.

1258
00:38:07,803 --> 00:38:09,602
Be daring and bid 15,000 seeds.

1259
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:12,143
- They're overly excited. - There's a lot of gaslighting.

1260
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:14,372
You're a red hare, so be daring.

1261
00:38:14,373 --> 00:38:15,973
- Bid 15,000. - My pelvis is destroyed.

1262
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:17,142
Bid 15,000.

1263
00:38:17,143 --> 00:38:18,742
(Forget Se Yoon and bid 15,000.)

1264
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:19,783
Stay quiet.

1265
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:21,413
We bid 6,500.

1266
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,322
- It's at 6,500. - Okay,

1267
00:38:23,323 --> 00:38:24,323
that's enough.

1268
00:38:24,324 --> 00:38:25,452
- Six thousand five hundred? - That's enough.

1269
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:26,552
Hey, Seon Ho.

1270
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,092
- I bid 7,000. - What?

1271
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:29,922
- Seven thousand. - You must eat when you're growing.

1272
00:38:29,923 --> 00:38:31,363
- I bid 8,000. - Hey!

1273
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:33,233
Are you out of your mind?

1274
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:34,632
- What's wrong with you? - Seon Ho.

1275
00:38:34,633 --> 00:38:37,803
- They went all in for a vegetable. - What's wrong with you?

1276
00:38:38,063 --> 00:38:39,563
Okay, we give up.

1277
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:41,073
You give up?

1278
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,572
- I mean... - Was the last bid 8,000?

1279
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:44,702
- Eight thousand? Three, - Why would you bid that high?

1280
00:38:44,703 --> 00:38:47,012
- Joon, bid 8,500. - two, one.

1281
00:38:47,013 --> 00:38:48,313
(Calm down.)

1282
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:50,912
(Auctioned off by Se Yoon and Joon for 8,000 seeds)

1283
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:52,382
I feel somewhat regretful.

1284
00:38:52,383 --> 00:38:53,623
- We could have... - Thank you.

1285
00:38:53,753 --> 00:38:55,413
This is...

1286
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:58,253
- You have a lot of money anyway. - That's right.

1287
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:00,223
Give me back 2,000.

1288
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:02,223
We'll give you 2,000 instead.

1289
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:04,323
Why would you give it to me?

1290
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:06,522
(He didn't fall for it.)

1291
00:39:06,523 --> 00:39:08,233
- Over here? - Give it to us.

1292
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:09,432
Here you go.

1293
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:10,832
- It's expensive. - It is.

1294
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:11,833
(Remaining amount: 53,000 seeds)

1295
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:12,862
What could it be?

1296
00:39:12,863 --> 00:39:13,872
(A vegetable that costs 8,000 seeds?)

1297
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:14,902
Is it a type of vegetable?

1298
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:16,532
It's seasoned vegetables, but there's something more.

1299
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:18,642
- Like wild chives webfoot octopus. - Everyone.

1300
00:39:18,643 --> 00:39:20,443
- It's mixed with something. - Please listen.

1301
00:39:20,573 --> 00:39:23,583
Remember, I said what makes the next dish special is...

1302
00:39:23,943 --> 00:39:25,042
a spring vegetable...

1303
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:26,182
- It's what makes it special. - with a splendid scent.

1304
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:28,212
- It's what makes it special. - So it must be a dish.

1305
00:39:28,213 --> 00:39:30,173
- All right. - I don't think it's just vegetable.

1306
00:39:30,683 --> 00:39:32,222
(Pit-a-pat)

1307
00:39:32,223 --> 00:39:33,223
What makes it special?

1308
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:36,293
- It looks big. - There's something big inside.

1309
00:39:36,723 --> 00:39:39,493
(Incredible!)

1310
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:42,063
I was right.

1311
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,963
I told you...

1312
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:46,833
- that there would be a twist. - Everyone.

1313
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:48,672
It has shepherd's purse.

1314
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:50,872
It's beef shank suyuk with shepherd's purse.

1315
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:53,002
I told you that there would be a twist.

1316
00:39:53,003 --> 00:39:55,873
(Beef shank with the ultimate tenderness and chewiness...)

1317
00:39:56,743 --> 00:39:59,983
(with fragrant shepherd's purse)

1318
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:03,723
(All ingredients are cooked evenly.)

1319
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:06,382
(Relieved)

1320
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:07,522
As I said...

1321
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:08,843
Why wasn't there a twist in this?

1322
00:40:09,623 --> 00:40:11,223
Why didn't you put a twist in this?

1323
00:40:11,293 --> 00:40:13,123
He said what made it special.

1324
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:16,032
- Good job, punk. - I knew it all along.

1325
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:17,103
This is so annoying.

1326
00:40:18,263 --> 00:40:19,503
It looks delicious.

1327
00:40:19,903 --> 00:40:22,032
Gosh, look at that.

1328
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:23,033
I love that.

1329
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:25,773
- Auctions are all about the spirit. - It must be cartilage.

1330
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:27,833
- It's about your confidence. - What's this?

1331
00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:29,313
The next dish has...

1332
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:32,583
a tender texture of meat that melts in the mouth.

1333
00:40:33,043 --> 00:40:34,759
- It's also flavorful. - "Texture of meat?"

1334
00:40:34,783 --> 00:40:35,783
"Texture of meat?"

1335
00:40:35,784 --> 00:40:37,483
The price for the dish...

1336
00:40:37,683 --> 00:40:38,782
What will it be?

1337
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:40,122
It starts at 3,000 seeds.

1338
00:40:40,123 --> 00:40:41,593
I'll bid 10,000 right away.

1339
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:44,123
It's tender.

1340
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:45,644
(The sound of meat makes him lose it.)

1341
00:40:46,563 --> 00:40:48,833
(Is it an amazing dish that's worth losing one's mind?)

1342
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:51,102
- All right, we're bidding. - Us too.

1343
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:52,963
- We bid 13,000. - It's 13,000.

1344
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:55,132
(They increase the price in one go.)

1345
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,302
- In one go. - They're going all in.

1346
00:40:56,303 --> 00:40:57,872
- Bring it on. - Bring it on.

1347
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,772
- Bring it on. - Bring it on.

1348
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:01,113
Bring it on.

1349
00:41:01,813 --> 00:41:03,412
It's definitely braised beef ribs.

1350
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:05,442
- It's braised beef ribs. - Braised beef ribs...

1351
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:06,513
Trust me.

1352
00:41:07,413 --> 00:41:09,152
- Increase the bid by 1,000. - What?

1353
00:41:09,153 --> 00:41:10,423
I bid 14,000.

1354
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:12,282
I bid 15,000.

1355
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,523
I bid 16,000.

1356
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:15,752
- I bid 17,000. - Are you crazy?

1357
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:17,763
- I bid 18,000. - What are you doing?

1358
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:19,922
- It's at 18,000. - Sae Ho.

1359
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:21,443
Didn't he say meat to make it obvious?

1360
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,293
Any other bidder?

1361
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:26,362
Five, four,

1362
00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:28,002
three, two,

1363
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:29,683
- Our seeds could become worthless. - one.

1364
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:31,943
- Sold. - Okay.

1365
00:41:32,443 --> 00:41:34,272
Let there be a twist.

1366
00:41:34,273 --> 00:41:35,719
- Please. - I hope it's seasoned vegetables.

1367
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,542
- Please. - Tender seasoned vegetables.

1368
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:40,713
- Let it be jangjorim. - Jangjorim.

1369
00:41:40,813 --> 00:41:42,152
- Tender jangjorim. - Everyone,

1370
00:41:42,153 --> 00:41:44,423
your highest bid was 18,000.

1371
00:41:44,953 --> 00:41:46,583
It has to be braised ribs.

1372
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:48,922
- Come on, braised ribs. - Please bring it in.

1373
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,522
- Jangjorim. - Tender jangjorim.

1374
00:41:50,523 --> 00:41:52,062
(What's this dish with a tender texture of meat?)

1375
00:41:52,063 --> 00:41:53,633
- Let it be braised ribs. - Lift it up.

1376
00:41:53,863 --> 00:41:55,063
Braised ribs.

1377
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:56,963
- Lift it up. - Remove the lid.

1378
00:41:56,993 --> 00:41:57,834
- Remove the lid.

1379
00:41:57,835 --> 00:41:59,104
- One, two... - Darn it.

1380
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,143
(Se Yoon's short and thick groan)

1381
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,744
- You punk! - What?

1382
00:42:04,904 --> 00:42:06,974
One, two, three.

1383
00:42:08,374 --> 00:42:09,984
(The third dish is durian.)

1384
00:42:10,314 --> 00:42:12,194
(The dental veneers brothers are very excited.)

1385
00:42:13,014 --> 00:42:16,183
(They spent 18,000 on a durian.)

1386
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:17,483
- Durian... - What's this?

1387
00:42:17,484 --> 00:42:19,754
- It's durian. - It has nothing to do with meat.

1388
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:21,493
"Texture of meat" is used...

1389
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:22,694
- to describe durian. - Right.

1390
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:25,363
Its fruit texture is called the texture of meat?

1391
00:42:25,364 --> 00:42:27,163
By the way, Se Yoon is...

1392
00:42:27,164 --> 00:42:28,333
a huge fan of durian.

1393
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:29,964
- Right. - He loves durian.

1394
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:32,674
Whenever there's durian, it's for Se Yoon.

1395
00:42:33,034 --> 00:42:34,174
A durian lover.

1396
00:42:35,874 --> 00:42:39,143
(In Yecheon...)

1397
00:42:39,144 --> 00:42:42,514
(and Goryeong, he enjoyed some durian.)

1398
00:42:44,484 --> 00:42:46,353
(It's coming up to my nose.)

1399
00:42:46,354 --> 00:42:48,314
(I can smell it.)

1400
00:42:48,454 --> 00:42:49,814
Se Yoon, we have five dishes left.

1401
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:51,324
We have five left.

1402
00:42:51,454 --> 00:42:53,253
- Can you stay put? - What?

1403
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:54,653
Let's stay calm.

1404
00:42:54,654 --> 00:42:55,694
Don't lose your composure.

1405
00:42:56,094 --> 00:42:58,094
Here's the next dish.

1406
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:01,864
(Removing the cover for the dish)

1407
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:03,363
Why are you removing it?

1408
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:06,004
This time, we'll reveal the dish before bidding.

1409
00:43:06,434 --> 00:43:08,534
- In that case... - Why didn't you for the durian?

1410
00:43:08,574 --> 00:43:11,303
The next dish has excellent flavor and texture.

1411
00:43:11,304 --> 00:43:13,543
It protects the bronchial tubes during the change of seasons.

1412
00:43:13,544 --> 00:43:15,883
- Balloon flower roots? - As it's rich in fiber,

1413
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,043
it's good for digestion.

1414
00:43:17,044 --> 00:43:18,183
- Fiber? - Is it something common?

1415
00:43:18,184 --> 00:43:19,353
- Cheonggukjang. - Balloon flower roots.

1416
00:43:19,354 --> 00:43:21,053
- Cheonggukjang. - It must be meat.

1417
00:43:21,054 --> 00:43:23,023
It's three types of deep-fried spring vegetables.

1418
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:24,823
(The fourth dish)

1419
00:43:24,824 --> 00:43:26,024
It's deep-fried food.

1420
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:30,524
(Did you know that anything is good deep-fried including shoes?)

1421
00:43:31,294 --> 00:43:34,234
(Deep-fried seasonal vegetables must be incredibly good.)

1422
00:43:35,064 --> 00:43:37,634
(Water parsley, rape greens, fatsia shoots)

1423
00:43:37,704 --> 00:43:39,874
(There's even wild chive sauce.)

1424
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:41,904
Bidding will be done in private.

1425
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:45,073
- In private? - Write down your bid on paper...

1426
00:43:45,074 --> 00:43:46,074
and hand it to me.

1427
00:43:46,075 --> 00:43:48,443
The team to make the highest bid...

1428
00:43:48,444 --> 00:43:50,784
will be given three types of deep-fried spring vegetables.

1429
00:43:52,384 --> 00:43:54,513
Let's talk about it only with gesture.

1430
00:43:54,514 --> 00:43:55,683
Tell me what you think.

1431
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:57,384
(They start to discuss secretly.)

1432
00:43:58,284 --> 00:43:59,324
Yes!

1433
00:43:59,894 --> 00:44:01,424
It will definitely be ours.

1434
00:44:02,564 --> 00:44:03,764
I'm 100 percent sure.

1435
00:44:04,564 --> 00:44:05,693
I want to eat it.

1436
00:44:05,694 --> 00:44:06,763
- You do? - Yes.

1437
00:44:06,764 --> 00:44:08,193
I have an amount on my mind.

1438
00:44:08,194 --> 00:44:09,234
What is it?

1439
00:44:09,434 --> 00:44:10,533
- It's the same as mine. - That much?

1440
00:44:10,534 --> 00:44:11,814
- Let's write that down. - Okay.

1441
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:14,633
- Won't this work? - Yes.

1442
00:44:14,634 --> 00:44:15,744
What do you think?

1443
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:17,604
- What is it? - Before that...

1444
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:22,013
Here is...

1445
00:44:22,014 --> 00:44:23,943
- the amount. - We went all in.

1446
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:25,753
- Okay, enjoy the dish. - We went all in.

1447
00:44:25,754 --> 00:44:27,683
- I bet Jong Min bid 1,000 seeds. - He will be surprised.

1448
00:44:27,684 --> 00:44:28,814
(I don't believe him.)

1449
00:44:29,054 --> 00:44:30,083
(Gasping)

1450
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,184
Aren't you surprised?

1451
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:32,593
Aren't you surprised by ours?

1452
00:44:32,594 --> 00:44:33,594
The dish is ours.

1453
00:44:34,224 --> 00:44:36,124
- Se Yoon and Joon. - Are they eliminated?

1454
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:37,424
They bid 4,000 seeds.

1455
00:44:38,694 --> 00:44:40,063
It could have been bad.

1456
00:44:40,064 --> 00:44:42,133
- Sae Ho, Seon Ho bid 5,000 seeds. - We got it.

1457
00:44:42,134 --> 00:44:43,763
Okay.

1458
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,163
It's ours.

1459
00:44:45,164 --> 00:44:46,774
Our maximum was 5,000.

1460
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,104
DinDin looks upset.

1461
00:44:48,774 --> 00:44:52,104
(Their Dish and Seed Money Status)

1462
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,773
- Everyone. - We got a good one.

1463
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,143
There are four remaining dishes.

1464
00:44:55,144 --> 00:44:56,343
- Four dishes. - Good job.

1465
00:44:56,344 --> 00:44:59,483
- Smell it. - Stew and protein...

1466
00:44:59,484 --> 00:45:00,613
are coming up.

1467
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:03,324
As you seem so passionate about spring dishes,

1468
00:45:03,554 --> 00:45:06,693
we will reveal one more dish.

1469
00:45:06,694 --> 00:45:07,923
- Okay. - All right.

1470
00:45:07,924 --> 00:45:09,393
- It's fun. - It's getting fun now.

1471
00:45:09,394 --> 00:45:11,924
If you miss this dish, you'll regret it.

1472
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:15,494
Every spring, it becomes plump.

1473
00:45:15,764 --> 00:45:18,464
It's a healthy dish that epicures really love.

1474
00:45:19,274 --> 00:45:21,174
It is charcoal grilled webfoot octopus.

1475
00:45:21,474 --> 00:45:23,343
- We'll go all in. - Okay.

1476
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:25,043
- Won't we eat it? - We'll go all in.

1477
00:45:25,044 --> 00:45:26,044
Let's check the quantity first.

1478
00:45:26,045 --> 00:45:27,620
Let's go for it even if we don't get it.

1479
00:45:27,644 --> 00:45:29,043
- Let's get this and stop bidding. - Okay.

1480
00:45:29,044 --> 00:45:30,913
- We get both spicy and salty ones? - We'll spend the money anyway.

1481
00:45:30,914 --> 00:45:32,714
- This is more than good enough. - All right.

1482
00:45:34,054 --> 00:45:36,483
(It's not just a common webfoot octopus dish.)

1483
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:39,754
(It's grilled webfoot octopus full of smoky flavor.)

1484
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:45,994
(There's not only spicy kind, but also clean one with salt.)

1485
00:45:47,364 --> 00:45:51,334
(Have whatever suits your taste.)

1486
00:45:51,534 --> 00:45:52,880
- Let's give up on soup. - We just have to bid higher.

1487
00:45:52,904 --> 00:45:54,173
And let's get this one.

1488
00:45:54,174 --> 00:45:55,843
- We should be sure to get this one. - You see...

1489
00:45:55,844 --> 00:45:58,873
- Among spring dishes... - We'll spend it all if we have to.

1490
00:45:58,874 --> 00:45:59,973
- I'm on the same page. - Which one is...

1491
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:01,774
Look. Will we go with this?

1492
00:46:02,114 --> 00:46:03,384
Or with this?

1493
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:05,243
Oh, my. You even think of this amount?

1494
00:46:05,244 --> 00:46:07,164
If we can get that, we won't need anything else.

1495
00:46:07,414 --> 00:46:09,123
There will be no better dishes than that.

1496
00:46:09,124 --> 00:46:10,923
- Three thousand seeds. - Let's write the amount we have.

1497
00:46:10,924 --> 00:46:12,993
- Let's go all in. - Write it down and submit it.

1498
00:46:12,994 --> 00:46:15,424
If we fail, we can spend it next time.

1499
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:18,264
- Then the next one will be ours. - You can bid down to 100 seeds.

1500
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:20,064
(Peeking)

1501
00:46:22,094 --> 00:46:24,133
- Why would you see it? - I didn't see it.

1502
00:46:24,134 --> 00:46:25,504
- Did you not see it? - I saw it.

1503
00:46:26,604 --> 00:46:28,434
Thank you for your honesty.

1504
00:46:29,074 --> 00:46:30,704
I appreciate your honesty, really.

1505
00:46:31,274 --> 00:46:32,650
- They're trying to be smart, - Let's go with it.

1506
00:46:32,674 --> 00:46:34,820
Raising their bids by 100 seeds, and they'll lose all their money.

1507
00:46:34,844 --> 00:46:37,113
- Come on. Hurry up. - Gosh, seriously.

1508
00:46:37,114 --> 00:46:38,744
- Don't you have any guts? - Gosh.

1509
00:46:39,014 --> 00:46:41,153
- People like them... - Now, are you all ready?

1510
00:46:41,154 --> 00:46:42,313
- Let's go. - We already submitted it.

1511
00:46:42,314 --> 00:46:43,453
Okay. Here you go.

1512
00:46:43,454 --> 00:46:44,953
- Let's go. - This is frustrating.

1513
00:46:44,954 --> 00:46:46,054
It will definitely be us.

1514
00:46:46,724 --> 00:46:47,793
Okay. Please submit it.

1515
00:46:47,794 --> 00:46:48,794
- Sae Ho. - Yes?

1516
00:46:48,795 --> 00:46:49,923
We could bid higher than that.

1517
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:50,924
(Please, webfoot octopus. Come to me.)

1518
00:46:50,925 --> 00:46:52,493
- Let's see how it goes. - This is the main dish.

1519
00:46:52,494 --> 00:46:54,093
(Take this durian away.)

1520
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:55,193
That's the main dish for sure.

1521
00:46:55,194 --> 00:46:56,504
Let me tell you how this works.

1522
00:46:56,634 --> 00:46:58,503
- Hey, we should... - The highest bidder wins.

1523
00:46:58,504 --> 00:46:59,504
(Please)

1524
00:46:59,505 --> 00:47:01,374
- My gosh. - They must be surprised.

1525
00:47:01,534 --> 00:47:04,243
- They're definitely surprised. - He exclaimed. We won.

1526
00:47:04,244 --> 00:47:06,714
- The lowest bidder first. - Start with the lowest bidder.

1527
00:47:06,844 --> 00:47:08,143
- The lowest bidder first? - Yes.

1528
00:47:08,144 --> 00:47:09,344
Jong Min and DinDin.

1529
00:47:10,114 --> 00:47:11,214
Are we the lowest bidder?

1530
00:47:11,744 --> 00:47:13,114
You bid 23,000 seeds.

1531
00:47:13,884 --> 00:47:15,054
What?

1532
00:47:16,324 --> 00:47:17,953
- They bid 23,000 seeds? - Yes.

1533
00:47:17,954 --> 00:47:19,500
- And they're the lowest bidder? - My gosh.

1534
00:47:19,524 --> 00:47:21,853
- This is driving me nuts. - What's going on?

1535
00:47:21,854 --> 00:47:23,963
- How much did they bid? - My webfoot octopus.

1536
00:47:23,964 --> 00:47:26,324
- They bid all their money. - I can't lose webfoot octopus!

1537
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:27,933
- This is driving me crazy. - What's going on?

1538
00:47:27,934 --> 00:47:30,334
(The delicious webfoot octopus that makes everyone crazy)

1539
00:47:31,464 --> 00:47:33,174
I really want to eat that.

1540
00:47:33,374 --> 00:47:35,334
- Let's move on. - Please.

1541
00:47:38,144 --> 00:47:40,114
It's sold to Se Yoon and Joon.

1542
00:47:40,614 --> 00:47:41,644
How much did they bid?

1543
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:44,544
They bid 31,500 seeds.

1544
00:47:45,284 --> 00:47:46,454
- And... - What about them?

1545
00:47:47,284 --> 00:47:48,413
- It's lower than that. - Sae Ho and Seon Ho...

1546
00:47:48,414 --> 00:47:49,524
bid 28,000 seeds.

1547
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:52,324
Gosh. Darn it. We should've bid 29,000 seeds.

1548
00:47:52,994 --> 00:47:54,193
- Darn it. - Right.

1549
00:47:54,194 --> 00:47:55,253
- You're right. - Right?

1550
00:47:55,254 --> 00:47:56,593
Even if we bid 30,000 seeds, we would've lost.

1551
00:47:56,594 --> 00:47:58,424
We won in this game.

1552
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:00,263
We had nothing before.

1553
00:48:00,264 --> 00:48:01,664
Okay. We made it.

1554
00:48:02,394 --> 00:48:03,403
(The bountiful feast with both seafood and meat)

1555
00:48:03,404 --> 00:48:05,534
- Can I smell it? - You've got to eat this.

1556
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:07,673
- Let me smell it. - Hold on.

1557
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:08,973
- I'll just smell it. Come on. - Wait.

1558
00:48:08,974 --> 00:48:10,814
You might put some in your mouth accidentally.

1559
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:12,973
It smells so amazing.

1560
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,114
(Jealous)

1561
00:48:15,374 --> 00:48:17,260
- Okay. This is good. - We have everything we need now.

1562
00:48:17,284 --> 00:48:19,314
Good. They can eat webfoot octopus with durian.

1563
00:48:19,454 --> 00:48:20,553
It's theirs.

1564
00:48:20,554 --> 00:48:21,783
(That's childish.)

1565
00:48:21,784 --> 00:48:22,984
The next dish is...

1566
00:48:23,524 --> 00:48:25,683
even mentioned in "Donguibogam..."

1567
00:48:25,684 --> 00:48:27,223
as it's very good for your health.

1568
00:48:27,224 --> 00:48:29,423
- It's related to health, right? - I bet it's a medicinal herb.

1569
00:48:29,424 --> 00:48:31,093
As it's full of the vitality of spring,

1570
00:48:31,094 --> 00:48:33,463
it helps to fight spring fever.

1571
00:48:33,464 --> 00:48:34,563
Spring fever?

1572
00:48:34,564 --> 00:48:36,463
Being in season,

1573
00:48:36,464 --> 00:48:38,784
- it's boasting its subtle aroma. - I bet it's wild chive.

1574
00:48:38,864 --> 00:48:41,874
(We'll reveal the dish to the viewers first.)

1575
00:48:42,874 --> 00:48:45,774
(Flounder and mugwort soup with the vitality of spring)

1576
00:48:46,814 --> 00:48:47,873
(Fragrant mugwort...)

1577
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:51,214
(meets light and clean flounder caught in spring.)

1578
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:54,054
The bid will start with 1,000 seeds.

1579
00:48:54,254 --> 00:48:55,414
Jong Min and DinDin.

1580
00:48:55,814 --> 00:48:57,230
- Five thousand seeds. - Five thousand seeds.

1581
00:48:57,254 --> 00:48:58,454
We'll go for this one.

1582
00:48:59,054 --> 00:49:00,800
- Seven thousand seeds. - Seven thousand seeds.

1583
00:49:00,824 --> 00:49:02,724
- They bid 7,000 seeds. - We bid 10,000 seeds.

1584
00:49:02,864 --> 00:49:04,223
- What? - This is a hassle.

1585
00:49:04,224 --> 00:49:05,893
- They keep raising the bid. - Right. This is a hassle.

1586
00:49:05,894 --> 00:49:07,633
- We'll get this dish anyway. - Right. Bring it to us.

1587
00:49:07,634 --> 00:49:09,463
- We'll bid 30,000 seeds. - Right. We'll do that.

1588
00:49:09,464 --> 00:49:11,224
- Really? - I'm sure they don't have 30,000.

1589
00:49:11,434 --> 00:49:12,463
We bid 12,000 seeds.

1590
00:49:12,464 --> 00:49:13,473
- We bid 12,000 seeds. - Okay, 12,000 seeds.

1591
00:49:13,474 --> 00:49:14,933
- We bid 15,000 seeds. - We bid 15,000 seeds.

1592
00:49:14,934 --> 00:49:16,203
- What? - This is such a hassle, seriously.

1593
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,680
Are you insane? What has gotten into you?

1594
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,973
- You must get this dish, Sae Ho. - This is a hassle.

1595
00:49:19,974 --> 00:49:21,173
We'll figure it out on our own.

1596
00:49:21,174 --> 00:49:22,473
They bid 15,000 seeds.

1597
00:49:22,474 --> 00:49:24,090
- Let's let them have it. - They bid 15,000 seeds.

1598
00:49:24,114 --> 00:49:26,883
- Give it to them. - Five, four,

1599
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:28,683
- And 3, 2... - We bid 15,000 seeds.

1600
00:49:28,684 --> 00:49:30,623
- No, I mean, 16,000 seeds. - We bid 16,000 seeds.

1601
00:49:30,624 --> 00:49:33,093
- We bid 18,000 seeds. Bring it on. - We bid 18,000 seeds.

1602
00:49:33,094 --> 00:49:34,393
- Raise the bid if you can. - They got intimidated.

1603
00:49:34,394 --> 00:49:36,063
- They bid 18,000 seeds. - They got intimidated.

1604
00:49:36,064 --> 00:49:37,523
- They can have it. - Give it to them.

1605
00:49:37,524 --> 00:49:39,093
- Come on. Bring it on. - Seon Ho, what are you waiting for?

1606
00:49:39,094 --> 00:49:40,933
- Two. - Do you not have enough money?

1607
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:42,064
- One. - Please. I'm sorry.

1608
00:49:42,264 --> 00:49:43,704
- Bring it on. - He says he's sorry.

1609
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:45,510
- That's okay. It's good for us. - It's sold at 18,000 seeds.

1610
00:49:45,534 --> 00:49:47,050
- It's sold at 18,000 seeds... - It's good for us.

1611
00:49:47,074 --> 00:49:49,034
- to Jong Min and DinDin. - Why did they give up?

1612
00:49:49,174 --> 00:49:51,054
You bought it at the same price as this durian.

1613
00:49:51,244 --> 00:49:52,614
We bought this for 18,000 seeds.

1614
00:49:52,814 --> 00:49:54,173
- You bought it for 18,000 seeds? - Yes.

1615
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:56,343
You paid for it because you wanted to have it.

1616
00:49:56,344 --> 00:49:58,424
- We just tried to raise the stakes. - That's right.

1617
00:49:58,784 --> 00:50:00,153
Please let it be something to make us all laugh.

1618
00:50:00,154 --> 00:50:02,184
- It seems so light. - Please make us all laugh.

1619
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:03,583
Please, the deity of variety shows.

1620
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,994
- Why are you smiling? Why? - Make us all laugh.

1621
00:50:06,154 --> 00:50:08,430
Please make us all laugh. Let it be something like durian.

1622
00:50:08,454 --> 00:50:10,023
- "Hey, my friend." - I think it's a good one.

1623
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:11,323
I have a feeling that it's an invigorating dish.

1624
00:50:11,324 --> 00:50:12,833
- Did you see the inside? - Here we go.

1625
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:14,634
One, two, three!

1626
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:16,903
- It's flounder and mugwort soup. - It's flounder and mugwort soup.

1627
00:50:16,904 --> 00:50:18,134
- Okay. Good. - What is it?

1628
00:50:18,234 --> 00:50:20,434
- The flounder is so plump. - What is it?

1629
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:22,510
- It's a good one. - It's flounder and mugwort soup.

1630
00:50:22,534 --> 00:50:23,744
It's okay. We don't need it.

1631
00:50:23,974 --> 00:50:25,294
- Sae Ho. - The flounder is huge.

1632
00:50:25,504 --> 00:50:26,873
Sae Ho, we should stay alert.

1633
00:50:26,874 --> 00:50:28,213
- Don't say such a thing. - It's flounder and mugwort soup.

1634
00:50:28,214 --> 00:50:29,583
It's flounder and mugwort soup. Nice.

1635
00:50:29,584 --> 00:50:31,143
- It's such a tasty dish. - We can eat this. What's wrong?

1636
00:50:31,144 --> 00:50:32,583
- It's okay. - We'll be fine.

1637
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:34,553
- I didn't know it was a good one. - There aren't many left.

1638
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:36,354
- Really? Still, we got one dish. - Sae Ho.

1639
00:50:36,384 --> 00:50:38,024
But they have a lot of money.

1640
00:50:38,054 --> 00:50:40,653
- Sae Ho and Seon Ho? - There are only two dishes left.

1641
00:50:40,654 --> 00:50:43,363
- I feel drained of energy. - It doesn't need much explanation.

1642
00:50:43,364 --> 00:50:45,924
- Okay. - It's loved by many epicures.

1643
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:47,134
It's kimchi.

1644
00:50:47,694 --> 00:50:50,563
- It captivated people globally. - It's kimchi.

1645
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:52,444
- Just say it's kimchi. - The bid will start...

1646
00:50:52,774 --> 00:50:55,133
- Trust me. I saw his face. - It's kimchi for sure.

1647
00:50:55,134 --> 00:50:57,803
- It captivated people globally. - He looked...

1648
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:58,843
- You know what's so funny? - He got flustered.

1649
00:50:58,844 --> 00:50:59,913
- When Joon said, "It's kimchi," - The bid...

1650
00:50:59,914 --> 00:51:00,943
Jong Hyun pouted like this.

1651
00:51:00,944 --> 00:51:02,014
(Pouting)

1652
00:51:02,244 --> 00:51:03,613
(I shouldn't be swayed!)

1653
00:51:03,614 --> 00:51:05,383
- The bid will start... - He got better at hiding emotion.

1654
00:51:05,384 --> 00:51:06,713
- from 2,000... - Do you want to eat it?

1655
00:51:06,714 --> 00:51:08,313
The bid will start from 2,000 seeds.

1656
00:51:08,314 --> 00:51:10,754
I think he set the price to 2,000 seeds to fool us.

1657
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:13,074
- We bid 5,000 seeds. - We bid 5,000 seeds.

1658
00:51:13,324 --> 00:51:14,854
(There's a lot going on in his mind.)

1659
00:51:14,954 --> 00:51:16,193
- They bid 5,000 seeds. - It's kimchi.

1660
00:51:16,194 --> 00:51:17,364
We bid 6,000 seeds.

1661
00:51:17,464 --> 00:51:18,863
We need to eat something.

1662
00:51:18,864 --> 00:51:19,934
We bid 7,000 seeds.

1663
00:51:19,964 --> 00:51:21,164
We bid 7,100 seeds.

1664
00:51:21,964 --> 00:51:23,033
- They bid 7,100 seeds. - I'm sorry.

1665
00:51:23,034 --> 00:51:24,133
- He didn't mean it. - We bid 7,500 seeds.

1666
00:51:24,134 --> 00:51:25,203
- Just take a nap. - They bid 7,500 seeds.

1667
00:51:25,204 --> 00:51:26,274
Eight thousand.

1668
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:28,834
- We bid 8,500 seeds. - They bid 8,500 seeds.

1669
00:51:29,374 --> 00:51:31,474
What? You want to pay 8,500 seeds for kimchi?

1670
00:51:32,204 --> 00:51:34,573
(Could the dish this time really be kimchi?)

1671
00:51:34,574 --> 00:51:35,743
There aren't many dishes left.

1672
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:37,383
- Five, four... - How much was it?

1673
00:51:37,384 --> 00:51:38,384
- We bid 8,500 seeds. - And 3.

1674
00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:39,413
There will be one dish left after this.

1675
00:51:39,414 --> 00:51:41,254
- Nine thousand. - Nine thousand.

1676
00:51:41,554 --> 00:51:42,954
Sae Ho and Seon Ho bid 9,000 seeds.

1677
00:51:43,154 --> 00:51:44,424
- You got two dishes. - Five.

1678
00:51:44,654 --> 00:51:46,124
- Four. - We bid 20,000 seeds.

1679
00:51:46,294 --> 00:51:47,934
- Sorry? - Do you even have 20,000 seeds?

1680
00:51:48,754 --> 00:51:49,954
Do you even have 20,000 seeds?

1681
00:51:51,624 --> 00:51:53,964
- No, we don't have 20,000 seeds. - I just said it.

1682
00:51:54,894 --> 00:51:55,934
Sold!

1683
00:51:56,264 --> 00:51:59,234
- The last dish could be a good one. - It's sold to Sae Ho and Seon Ho.

1684
00:51:59,404 --> 00:52:00,474
How much? Nine thousand?

1685
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,773
- Yes. Sold at 9,000 seeds. - I think...

1686
00:52:01,774 --> 00:52:03,343
I think we just bought kimchi for 9,000 seeds.

1687
00:52:03,344 --> 00:52:05,074
- All right. Now... - What?

1688
00:52:05,544 --> 00:52:07,904
- We'll give it to you right away. - Why are they laughing?

1689
00:52:11,384 --> 00:52:13,560
- I don't think it's kimchi. - What? My gosh. This is...

1690
00:52:13,584 --> 00:52:14,713
- What's this? - What is it?

1691
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,034
Vegetables for wraps? What is it?

1692
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:19,324
(What's in the basket?)

1693
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:21,153
Vegetables for wraps? What is it?

1694
00:52:21,154 --> 00:52:22,254
Hey. Come on.

1695
00:52:22,624 --> 00:52:23,624
(It boosts your appetite, right?)

1696
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:24,663
- What is it? - Hey.

1697
00:52:24,664 --> 00:52:26,164
- What is it? - You can have this.

1698
00:52:26,634 --> 00:52:27,634
- Hey. - What is it?

1699
00:52:27,635 --> 00:52:28,934
- You can have this. - Gosh.

1700
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:32,403
- What is it? - They got cilantro!

1701
00:52:32,404 --> 00:52:33,474
(I am awfully jealous.)

1702
00:52:33,974 --> 00:52:36,744
(As they gained spring herbs, they hoped to get other nutrients too.)

1703
00:52:36,844 --> 00:52:39,144
(I can't believe we gained more vegetable.)

1704
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:43,144
(Green)

1705
00:52:45,344 --> 00:52:46,613
But look.

1706
00:52:46,614 --> 00:52:48,783
It matches your hoodies, the vegan color.

1707
00:52:48,784 --> 00:52:50,723
Sae Ho, what's going on with you?

1708
00:52:50,724 --> 00:52:52,964
- Why do you suddenly eat vegan? - I can't believe this.

1709
00:52:56,124 --> 00:52:57,124
(Shouting)

1710
00:52:58,624 --> 00:53:00,393
- Please bring in the next dish. - This is the last dish...

1711
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:01,893
- We'll go all in. - Okay.

1712
00:53:01,894 --> 00:53:03,463
- We should go all in. - It's not hard to predict.

1713
00:53:03,464 --> 00:53:04,833
The team with the most money will win.

1714
00:53:04,834 --> 00:53:06,603
- Right. We have a lot of money. - This is the last dish.

1715
00:53:06,604 --> 00:53:07,734
We'll spend all our money.

1716
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:09,543
The next dish is...

1717
00:53:09,544 --> 00:53:12,344
rich in protein, which helps to prevent hair loss.

1718
00:53:12,674 --> 00:53:15,344
More importantly, it contains lecithin as well,

1719
00:53:15,414 --> 00:53:18,484
which can help to prevent brain cells from aging.

1720
00:53:18,514 --> 00:53:21,053

Then why would you bid?

1733
00:53:39,704 --> 00:53:40,773
Can't we make a bid?

1734
00:53:40,774 --> 00:53:42,803
- You can't if you don't have money. - Of course, you can't.

1735
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:44,174
We bid 21,100 seeds.

1736
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,313
- We bid 21,500 seeds. - They bid 21,500 seeds.

1737
00:53:46,314 --> 00:53:47,343

00:53:55,154 --> 00:53:56,154
(What?)

1742
00:53:56,155 --> 00:53:58,254
Actually, we only have 3,500 seeds.

1743
00:53:59,054 --> 00:54:01,523
- We only have 3,500 seeds. - It's over anyway...

1744

1748
00:54:07,894 --> 00:54:09,633
- at 22,000 seeds. - You're worse than them.

1749
00:54:09,634 --> 00:54:11,203
Sold. This is mere paper.

1750
00:54:11,204 --> 00:54:12,233
I think...

1751
00:54:12,234 --> 00:54:14,433
I think it's black soybean.

1752
00:54:14,434 --> 00:54:16,974
- I'm 100 percent sure. - I think they made a heart shape.

1753
00:54:17,044 --> 00:54:18,774
What is it? Is it soybean soup?

1754
00:54:18,804 --> 00:54:21,643
Check what's inside. You'll be surprised.

1755
00:54:21,644 --> 00:54:22,913
- What is it? - Is it meat?

1756
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:23,983
- Oh, hold on. - What is it?

1757
00:54:23,984 --> 00:54:25,624
- Did you see it? - I think it's not bad.

1758
00:54:26,954 --> 00:54:29,114
(Is it sashimi, which is rich in lecithin?)

1759
00:54:29,254 --> 00:54:31,254

1760
00:54:31,424 --> 00:54:33,593

1762
00:54:36,424 --> 00:54:38,123
- Gosh. You've got to be kidding me. - Hey.

1763
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:39,464
Another vegan dish?

1764
00:54:39,794 --> 00:54:41,993
- Is it another vegan dish? - A vegan dish?

1765
00:54:41,994 --> 00:54:43,303
- Does it complete a vegan meal? - Seriously...

1766
00:54:43,304 --> 00:54:45,384
Didn't I tell you we should get the webfoot octopus?

1767
00:54:46,064 --> 00:54:47,233
Is it black soybean?

1768
00:54:47,234 --> 00:54:49,154
- Is it a vegan dish? - Here. You can have this.

1769
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:51,224
- What? Quail eggs? - Quail eggs.

1770
00:54:51,444 --> 00:54:52,873
They bought two quail eggs.

1771
00:54:52,874 --> 00:54:54,113
- But they look tasty. - My gosh.

1772
00:54:54,114 --> 00:54:56,613
I said we should bid 32,000 seeds for the webfoot octopus.

1773
00:54:56,614 --> 00:54:57,614
- We got the best one. - Oh, yes.

1775
00:54:59,814 --> 00:55:00,853
When did you...

1776
00:55:00,854 --> 00:55:02,213
When did you say 32,000 seeds?

1777
00:55:02,214 --> 00:55:03,523
- I said... - You said 30,000 seeds.

1778
00:55:03,524 --> 00:55:05,283
- Didn't I say we should bid higher? - You...

1779
00:55:05,284 --> 00:55:07,193
If only you hadn't played the dart game earlier.

1780
00:55:07,194 --> 00:55:08,723
- What game? - The dart game.

1781
00:55:08,724 --> 00:55:10,263
You kicked the jegi seven times...

1782
00:55:10,264 --> 00:55:11,923
You said we should bid 30,000 seeds.

1783
00:55:11,924 --> 00:55:13,884
- You didn't say 32,000 seeds. - Gosh, seriously.

Joon, can you eat durian?

00:55:29,644 --> 00:55:30,983
No, I have never had it before.

1793

- Try it. It's delicious. - You will get addicted if you try.

1794

Isn't that called like the king of fruits?

1796
00:55:35,884 --> 00:55:37,723
- King of fruits. - Right.

1797
00:55:37,724 --> 00:55:39,083

- Of course. - The meat is so thick.

00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:03,724
How about...

1891
00:59:03,994 --> 00:59:06,494
- This is it. - The spring cabbage is the best.

1892
00:59:07,134 --> 00:59:09,093
Ho Dong said this once.

1893
00:59:09,094 --> 00:59:10,633
"It tastes better than meat."

1894
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:13,574
- Right, he said that. - When you eat this in spring...

1895
00:59:13,934 --> 00:59:16,003
You can't help but say it.

1896
00:59:16,004 --> 00:59:17,980
(Having seasoned spring cabbage in spring is perfect.)

1897
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:22,144
(In love with spring cabbage)

1898
00:59:26,144 --> 00:59:28,583
(He cleared the whole bowl.)

1899
00:59:28,584 --> 00:59:30,323
I think seasoned spring cabbage is really good.

1900
00:59:30,324 --> 00:59:32,553
Seasoned spring cabbage is so delicious.

1901
00:59:32,554 --> 00:59:33,554
It's sweet and sour.

1902
00:59:33,555 --> 00:59:35,894
Do you want some mangoes?

1903
00:59:36,054 --> 00:59:38,423
- Give us the beef if we eat it. - All right.

1904
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:39,833
- We'll give you if you make it fun. - Okay.

1905
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:40,893
This is too cold.

1906
00:59:40,894 --> 00:59:42,163
You told us to make it fun.

1907
00:59:42,164 --> 00:59:43,664
- Let's try it. - I'll try it too.

1908
00:59:45,034 --> 00:59:46,673
(Sae Ho eating durian that gives off hot steam)

1909
00:59:46,674 --> 00:59:47,834
Try smelling it.

1910
00:59:47,874 --> 00:59:48,874
Nice.

1911
00:59:49,504 --> 00:59:50,604
(Action)

1912
00:59:56,584 --> 00:59:58,444
Goodness, it's hot.

1913
01:00:00,154 --> 01:00:01,753
Gosh, Sae Ho is 44 this year.

1914
01:00:01,754 --> 01:00:02,883
Isn't it too hot?

1915
01:00:02,884 --> 01:00:04,253
- Goodness. - Are you okay?

1916
01:00:04,254 --> 01:00:05,353
(My tongue almost got burned.)

1917
01:00:05,354 --> 01:00:06,423
That was amazing.

1918
01:00:06,424 --> 01:00:08,323
That action was amazing.

1919
01:00:08,324 --> 01:00:09,393
Try it.

1920
01:00:09,394 --> 01:00:11,594
(They got a piece of beef shank with shepherd's purse.)

1921
01:00:15,334 --> 01:00:16,964
This tastes amazing.

1922
01:00:17,234 --> 01:00:18,333
It's incredible.

1923
01:00:18,334 --> 01:00:20,504
(Happy)

1924
01:00:20,574 --> 01:00:22,503
I've never heard of a durian before.

1925
01:00:22,504 --> 01:00:24,573
- Try it. - Try a bite.

1926
01:00:24,574 --> 01:00:26,543
- It's delicious. - What's a durian?

1927
01:00:26,544 --> 01:00:27,890
You will get hooked on it once you start liking it.

1928
01:00:27,914 --> 01:00:29,214
Try smelling it.

1929
01:00:30,214 --> 01:00:31,854
It's something I've never smelled before.

1930
01:00:32,384 --> 01:00:34,354
(Taking a bite)

1931
01:00:35,884 --> 01:00:37,754
- What's wrong? - What kind of fruit is this?

1932
01:00:39,054 --> 01:00:42,254
- It's... - Is this some kind of fruit?

1933
01:00:43,054 --> 01:00:44,794
I can't tell what it tastes like.

1934
01:00:45,294 --> 01:00:46,393
(Joon, let me tell you what it tastes like.)

1935
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:48,364
- I love it. - I'm not saying it's not tasty.

1936
01:00:48,864 --> 01:00:50,004
It's just too new for me.

1937
01:00:56,004 --> 01:00:57,244
I've never had...

1938
01:00:57,344 --> 01:00:58,673
(This is how it tastes.)

1939
01:00:58,674 --> 01:00:59,744
Is that for real?

1940
01:01:01,714 --> 01:01:02,874
- What's wrong? - What is it?

1941
01:01:03,144 --> 01:01:04,384
My nose!

1942
01:01:05,344 --> 01:01:06,784
You had it when you couldn't eat it?

1943
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:08,784
Really?

1944
01:01:08,984 --> 01:01:11,223
- This tastes so odd. - I mean...

1945
01:01:11,224 --> 01:01:13,393
It tastes like it's gone bad on top.

1946
01:01:13,394 --> 01:01:15,223
But it's so sweet on the bottom. That drives me crazy.

1947
01:01:15,224 --> 01:01:17,023
Was that his true reaction?

1948
01:01:17,024 --> 01:01:18,063
(Trying to taste it)

1949
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:19,384
The cream is so sweet at the end.

1950
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:21,094
(Screaming)

1951
01:01:23,194 --> 01:01:24,803
(It's impossible for Se Yoon to have a durian.)

1952
01:01:24,804 --> 01:01:26,133
- The top and the bottom... - Really?

1953
01:01:26,134 --> 01:01:27,203
It's just so different.

1954
01:01:27,204 --> 01:01:28,704
- Did you all enjoy your meal? - Yes!

1955
01:01:29,104 --> 01:01:31,343
Let's move on to the next part.

1956
01:01:31,344 --> 01:01:32,820
(Let's get outside to decide who gets to sleep outdoors.)

1957
01:01:32,844 --> 01:01:35,713
We'll work on Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors now.

1958
01:01:35,714 --> 01:01:38,443
We'll wrap the day with the current teams.

1959
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:39,743
- That's 2 to 2 to 2. - Let's go.

1960
01:01:39,744 --> 01:01:41,214
I'll make you sleep inside.

1961
01:01:41,814 --> 01:01:42,953
I mean it.

1962
01:01:42,954 --> 01:01:44,184
I promised you, remember?

1963
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,284
Director.

1964
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,123
This is the finale of the spring trip.

1965
01:01:47,124 --> 01:01:49,270
- Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors... - It must be a game. Okay.

1966
01:01:49,294 --> 01:01:51,823
Do Whatever You Want.

1967
01:01:51,824 --> 01:01:53,294
What? What's that?

1968
01:01:53,364 --> 01:01:54,594
- What is it? - What's that?

1969
01:01:54,634 --> 01:01:55,793
Do Whatever You Want?

1970
01:01:55,794 --> 01:01:57,903
- Sleeping indoors. - The production crew...

1971
01:01:57,904 --> 01:02:00,673
compiled all the missions that they wanted to do.

1972
01:02:00,674 --> 01:02:01,934
- That's smart. - Goodness.

1973
01:02:02,104 --> 01:02:04,004
(That means...)

1974
01:02:04,144 --> 01:02:06,073
That means it's really hard.

1975
01:02:06,074 --> 01:02:07,543
Goodness, what's going on?

1976
01:02:07,544 --> 01:02:09,573
The production crew's long-waited missions are reflected...

1977
01:02:09,574 --> 01:02:12,083
on Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors. The first round is...

1978
01:02:12,084 --> 01:02:13,784
Watering Spring Flowers.

1979
01:02:13,984 --> 01:02:15,283
- Watering flowers? - Watering flowers?

1980
01:02:15,284 --> 01:02:16,514
Please bring it in.

1981
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:18,424
- What's this? - What is it?

1982
01:02:18,454 --> 01:02:20,223
It looks like we're the flowers.

1983
01:02:20,224 --> 01:02:21,594
We are the flowers, yes?

1984
01:02:21,824 --> 01:02:23,723
- What is it? - What's that?

1985
01:02:23,724 --> 01:02:25,024
- What's all this? - What is it?

1986
01:02:25,664 --> 01:02:28,164
- What's with all this water? - What's going on?

1987
01:02:28,994 --> 01:02:31,034
(Why did you bring water?)

1988
01:02:31,134 --> 01:02:32,403
Gosh, this is...

1989
01:02:32,404 --> 01:02:33,810
(They will have to go into the water.)

1990
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:35,903
(I don't want to get wet.)

1991
01:02:35,904 --> 01:02:37,003
- All right, everyone. - Yes.

1992
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:39,343
One from each team...

1993
01:02:39,344 --> 01:02:40,674
will wear the headband.

1994
01:02:41,044 --> 01:02:42,373
- And? - I think...

1995
01:02:42,374 --> 01:02:43,883
- You're the flower. - No, you are.

1996
01:02:43,884 --> 01:02:45,443
- You're the flower. I'm not. - You are!

1997
01:02:45,444 --> 01:02:47,313
You're getting married. So you're the flower.

1998
01:02:47,314 --> 01:02:49,253
No, my bride is the flower. So you are the flower here.

1999
01:02:49,254 --> 01:02:51,583
I'm not going to invite the singers for his wedding.

2000
01:02:51,584 --> 01:02:53,054
I'll call them all and cancel it.

2001
01:02:53,724 --> 01:02:56,223
(Taking the headband)

2002
01:02:56,224 --> 01:02:57,294
Is this mine?

2003
01:02:59,564 --> 01:03:02,094
Who did DinDin invite? You look so desperate.

2004
01:03:02,894 --> 01:03:04,804
Who did he invite? I can't wait to see.

2005
01:03:05,264 --> 01:03:07,673
(I need those singers at my wedding.)

2006
01:03:07,674 --> 01:03:09,333
So what do the flowers do?

2007
01:03:09,334 --> 01:03:11,403
- Let us know what the flowers do. - You should tell us.

2008
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:13,673
We'll tell you the roles once you decide.

2009
01:03:13,674 --> 01:03:15,514
Joon has to be the flower.

2010
01:03:15,644 --> 01:03:17,190
- Nobody ever called me a flower. - I don't mind it.

2011
01:03:17,214 --> 01:03:19,483
How about becoming a flower?

2012
01:03:19,484 --> 01:03:20,730
Do you want me to be the flower?

2013
01:03:20,754 --> 01:03:22,683
- No, I'll do it. - I'll do it.

2014
01:03:22,684 --> 01:03:23,853
- No, it's fine. - I'll do it.

2015
01:03:23,854 --> 01:03:24,854
- I'll do it. - No.

2016
01:03:24,855 --> 01:03:26,053
- I'll do it. - We never know.

2017
01:03:26,054 --> 01:03:27,123
Being a flower could mean something bad.

2018
01:03:27,124 --> 01:03:28,993
Can I ask you a question?

2019
01:03:28,994 --> 01:03:30,463
- No. - I'm serious.

2020
01:03:30,464 --> 01:03:31,963
- What? - Can I take the pink one?

2021
01:03:31,964 --> 01:03:32,994
No.

2022
01:03:33,194 --> 01:03:34,963
He was so serious.

2023
01:03:34,964 --> 01:03:36,294
- No. - I want the pink one.

2024
01:03:37,004 --> 01:03:38,663
This all belongs to me.

2025
01:03:38,664 --> 01:03:40,033
That's why I asked you.

2026
01:03:40,034 --> 01:03:41,633
- I know. - Fine. You take the pink one then.

2027
01:03:41,634 --> 01:03:42,934
Okay, thank you.

2028
01:03:42,974 --> 01:03:44,103
All right.

2029
01:03:44,104 --> 01:03:46,603
The ones wearing the headbands are the flowers.

2030
01:03:46,604 --> 01:03:49,374
- Okay. - Flowers get into the pots.

2031
01:03:49,474 --> 01:03:51,383
Those who are not wearing the headbands...

2032
01:03:51,384 --> 01:03:53,113
can go up to the pool...

2033
01:03:53,114 --> 01:03:54,884
and water your flowers.

2034
01:03:55,214 --> 01:03:56,983
Flowers can move the water...

2035
01:03:56,984 --> 01:03:59,623
from their own pots to the others'.

2036
01:03:59,624 --> 01:04:01,424
But you can't get out of the pot.

2037
01:04:01,924 --> 01:04:04,264
Whoever has less water in the pot wins.

2038
01:04:04,664 --> 01:04:05,923
There will be three rounds of games.

2039
01:04:05,924 --> 01:04:07,533
It applies to all the teams here.

2040
01:04:07,534 --> 01:04:09,133
You get one point if you win.

2041
01:04:09,134 --> 01:04:11,263
Just one team with the highest points...

2042
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,303
gets to sleep indoors.

2043
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:14,333
- We have to win twice. - We sleep indoors if we win twice.

2044
01:04:14,334 --> 01:04:16,603
You have to be quick and fit.

2045
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:17,903
All right, everyone.

2046
01:04:17,904 --> 01:04:20,313
Se Yoon and Joon. Sae Ho and Seon Ho.

2047
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,754
These two teams will start first. Move to your positions now.

2048
01:04:22,974 --> 01:04:24,084
I'll get inside.

2049
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:26,954
Goodness.

2050
01:04:28,054 --> 01:04:31,053
(The flower pot is too small.)

2051
01:04:31,054 --> 01:04:32,254
Are you all ready?

2052
01:04:32,424 --> 01:04:33,624
We'll give you one minute.

2053
01:04:33,824 --> 01:04:34,953
Ready.

2054
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,124
(Human flowers are ready.)

2055
01:04:36,324 --> 01:04:38,924
(Human sprays are ready too.)

2056
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:44,464
(Watering flowers seems a bit rough here.)

2057
01:04:45,064 --> 01:04:47,434
(Sunflower Sae Ho is getting a lot of water.)

2058
01:04:49,334 --> 01:04:51,444
(It was so powerful that his headband fell off.)

2059
01:04:51,874 --> 01:04:54,214
(It's no joke.)

2060
01:04:55,514 --> 01:04:57,984
(Getting splashed with water)

2061
01:04:58,544 --> 01:05:00,304
(The spraying on the back is complimentary.)

2062
01:05:01,754 --> 01:05:03,314
(Sae Ho, isn't it refreshing?)

2063
01:05:03,624 --> 01:05:04,954
(Mine is coming.)

2064
01:05:06,024 --> 01:05:07,354
Hold on a second.

2065
01:05:09,294 --> 01:05:10,764
(Gosh, it's cold.)

2066
01:05:10,894 --> 01:05:12,223
What's wrong with Seon Ho?

2067
01:05:12,224 --> 01:05:14,224
Hey, what's wrong with him? He fell into the pool.

2068
01:05:16,064 --> 01:05:17,364
It's cold!

2069
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:20,574
(He's in trouble.)

2070
01:05:21,404 --> 01:05:22,704
(He enters the water.)

2071
01:05:22,774 --> 01:05:23,974
(There is no time to waste.)

2072
01:05:24,304 --> 01:05:25,943
- Bring it on! - Twenty seconds!

2073
01:05:25,944 --> 01:05:26,973
(20 seconds have passed.)

2074
01:05:26,974 --> 01:05:28,513
(Se Yoon's pot)

2075
01:05:28,514 --> 01:05:30,514
(Sae Ho's pot)

2076
01:05:31,084 --> 01:05:32,084
Okay.

2077
01:05:32,085 --> 01:05:35,184
(The amount of water seems to be similar.)

2078
01:05:35,814 --> 01:05:36,814
Goodness.

2079
01:05:36,815 --> 01:05:38,483
- Rather than pouring it like that, - Yes.

2080
01:05:38,484 --> 01:05:40,524
Splashing it like Seon Ho seems better, doesn't it?

2081
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,224
(Lee Joon scoops the water up.)

2082
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:45,894
(Seon Ho splashes the water through the railing.)

2083
01:05:47,894 --> 01:05:48,933
Gosh.

2084
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:50,263
(Fat Flower is having a rough time because of that.)

2085
01:05:50,264 --> 01:05:51,663
You have ten seconds left!

2086
01:05:51,664 --> 01:05:52,784
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

2087
01:05:52,934 --> 01:05:54,774
(Exclaiming)

2088
01:05:55,234 --> 01:05:58,004
Five, four, three,

2089
01:05:58,304 --> 01:06:00,274
two, one.

2090
01:06:01,344 --> 01:06:03,314
(It was a buzzer beater.)

2091
01:06:04,584 --> 01:06:05,613
(Game over)

2092
01:06:05,614 --> 01:06:06,744
It's doable.

2093
01:06:07,054 --> 01:06:08,583
Everyone.

2094
01:06:08,584 --> 01:06:09,653
It's hard to tell.

2095
01:06:09,654 --> 01:06:11,553
- Please come out of the pot. - It's hard to tell.

2096
01:06:11,554 --> 01:06:13,530
It's really hard to tell. The amounts are too similar.

2097
01:06:13,554 --> 01:06:15,954
(Which team won?)

2098
01:06:16,324 --> 01:06:18,394
Se Yoon's pot, 5.5cm.

2099
01:06:18,564 --> 01:06:20,763
- Sae Ho's pot, 4cm. - Okay!

2100
01:06:20,764 --> 01:06:21,963
Sae Ho and Seon Ho won.

2101
01:06:21,964 --> 01:06:23,664
- Okay. - Amazing.

2102
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:25,563
- Okay. - But if you beat them,

2103
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,704
- Yes? - there will be a confusion.

2104
01:06:27,804 --> 01:06:29,873
- We wouldn't know until the end. - Okay.

2105
01:06:29,874 --> 01:06:32,504
But if Team Sae Ho wins, it's over, right?

2106
01:06:32,574 --> 01:06:34,373
- Right. - Okay.

2107
01:06:34,374 --> 01:06:36,173
Still, we won't let them sleep inside.

2108
01:06:36,174 --> 01:06:37,413
- Right. - Okay.

2109
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:38,644
We won't let them.

2110
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:41,354
We'll start the second match.

2111
01:06:41,614 --> 01:06:42,614
Ready?

2112
01:06:42,615 --> 01:06:43,653
(I will sleep indoors!)

2113
01:06:43,654 --> 01:06:44,654
Start!

2114
01:06:47,154 --> 01:06:48,254
Gosh.

2115
01:06:48,324 --> 01:06:50,124
(He's flustered the moment it begins.)

2116
01:06:51,794 --> 01:06:54,064
(Dandelion Jong Min can't stand up still.)

2117
01:06:56,464 --> 01:06:59,504
(He's getting moisturized.)

2118
01:07:00,534 --> 01:07:02,534
(Don't drink it. Let your skin have it, Jong Min.)

2119
01:07:05,404 --> 01:07:07,444
(Splashing)

2120
01:07:07,574 --> 01:07:09,334
(He goes for accuracy rather than quantity.)

2121
01:07:09,774 --> 01:07:12,944
(It's quantity over quality.)

2122
01:07:13,044 --> 01:07:14,254
Sae Ho is quick.

2123
01:07:15,054 --> 01:07:17,054
(It's hard to even see his face.)

2124
01:07:18,254 --> 01:07:20,424
(He's struggling without any sight.)

2125
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:21,554
Ten seconds!

2126
01:07:24,064 --> 01:07:26,024
(There seems to be more water in Jong Min's pot.)

2127
01:07:28,764 --> 01:07:30,304
(This won't work.)

2128
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:32,904
What is this?

2129
01:07:33,504 --> 01:07:35,834
(He attacks Seon Ho!)

2130
01:07:36,574 --> 01:07:38,704
(He's flustered.)

2131
01:07:38,944 --> 01:07:41,244
(That's a new method.)

2132
01:07:41,644 --> 01:07:44,844
(A new method of disturbing the attacker)

2133
01:07:45,244 --> 01:07:48,014
(It's very effective.)

2134
01:07:48,414 --> 01:07:51,353
(In a trance)

2135
01:07:51,354 --> 01:07:54,053
Five, four, three,

2136
01:07:54,054 --> 01:07:55,754
two, one.

2137
01:07:56,724 --> 01:07:57,794
Stop!

2138
01:07:58,494 --> 01:08:00,364
Come out. Hurry.

2139
01:08:02,064 --> 01:08:03,494
Hey.

2140
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:05,834
- Hey. - Hey.

2141
01:08:07,204 --> 01:08:08,804
(He slides and falls on purpose.)

2142
01:08:08,904 --> 01:08:10,644
What are you doing?

2143
01:08:10,944 --> 01:08:12,674
I got dizzy.

2144
01:08:13,244 --> 01:08:14,344
No.

2145
01:08:14,844 --> 01:08:16,544
(He lies down.)

2146
01:08:16,714 --> 01:08:17,714
(Laughing)

2147
01:08:17,715 --> 01:08:19,683
Come on. Then I'll go inside too.

2148
01:08:19,684 --> 01:08:21,214
No!

2149
01:08:21,584 --> 01:08:23,754
We'll announce the result first.

2150
01:08:24,224 --> 01:08:26,253
Jong Min, 5cm.

2151
01:08:26,254 --> 01:08:27,693
- The same as ours. - And...

2152
01:08:27,694 --> 01:08:30,224
Sae Ho, 2.5cm.

2153
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:32,963
So, Team Sae Ho and Seon Ho...

2154
01:08:32,964 --> 01:08:34,433
will be sleeping indoors.

2155
01:08:34,434 --> 01:08:35,434
Fried indoors?

2156
01:08:35,734 --> 01:08:37,203
- Sleeping.. - Fried indoors?

2157
01:08:37,204 --> 01:08:38,633
They will be fried indoors.

2158
01:08:38,634 --> 01:08:40,064
- That's so scary. - Why?

2159
01:08:40,404 --> 01:08:41,934
What's wrong, Director?

2160
01:08:42,574 --> 01:08:43,574
It's cold.

2161
01:08:45,804 --> 01:08:49,113
You will be sleeping indoors.

2162
01:08:49,114 --> 01:08:50,144
Fried indoors.

2163
01:08:50,174 --> 01:08:52,583
You must be feeling sleepy now.

2164
01:08:52,584 --> 01:08:54,513
I'm not sleepy. It's so cold.

2165
01:08:54,514 --> 01:08:58,254
The second round...

2166
01:08:58,824 --> 01:09:01,223
was prepared by Director Jun Kyung who washes his hair every day...

2167
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:02,494
on set.

2168
01:09:02,694 --> 01:09:05,093
He prepared You're Getting Sleepy.

2169
01:09:05,094 --> 01:09:07,214
- You're Getting Sleepy? - He washes his hair on set?

2170
01:09:07,494 --> 01:09:09,133
Director Jun Kyung, who washes his hair on the second day,

2171
01:09:09,134 --> 01:09:11,003
- prepared this. - In the morning?

2172
01:09:11,004 --> 01:09:12,564
- That's interesting. - In the morning?

2173
01:09:12,764 --> 01:09:15,003
- Why does he do that? - Everyone.

2174
01:09:15,004 --> 01:09:16,364
- Interesting. - You may come out.

2175
01:09:16,734 --> 01:09:18,104
What is that?

2176
01:09:18,774 --> 01:09:20,373
I guess we'll have to do something with our hair.

2177
01:09:20,374 --> 01:09:21,413
Isn't it ink?

2178
01:09:21,414 --> 01:09:22,820
(They don't know what it is, but it looks very suspicious.)

2179
01:09:22,844 --> 01:09:24,043
What is this?

2180
01:09:24,044 --> 01:09:26,314
When I count to three,

2181
01:09:26,544 --> 01:09:28,353
stamp your face...

2182
01:09:28,354 --> 01:09:30,154
- on the sponge of your choice. - And then?

2183
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,983
- They all look the same. - I know.

2184
01:09:32,984 --> 01:09:34,054
And then?

2185
01:09:34,954 --> 01:09:37,464
The production crew shouldn't do whatever they want.

2186
01:09:37,664 --> 01:09:39,223
We'll submit some ideas on what we want to do later.

2187
01:09:39,224 --> 01:09:40,964
We could play hospital and be patients.

2188
01:09:41,494 --> 01:09:42,893
We could lie down for eight hours.

2189
01:09:42,894 --> 01:09:44,563
- Hotel play. - We could do that every day.

2190
01:09:44,564 --> 01:09:45,564
You're a critically ill patient.

2191
01:09:45,565 --> 01:09:47,304
We could be YouTubers in a hotel.

2192
01:09:48,074 --> 01:09:51,774
(I guess they want to squeeze out their screen time again.)

2193
01:09:52,274 --> 01:09:53,813
- Are you ready? - Yes!

2194
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:54,843
How do we do this?

2195
01:09:54,844 --> 01:09:55,844
- Do we stamp our faces? - Do we stamp them now?

2196
01:09:55,845 --> 01:09:58,884
Let's start. One, two, three.

2197
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,143
(Their faces go down.)

2198
01:10:00,144 --> 01:10:02,183
Do we stamp the sides too?

2199
01:10:02,184 --> 01:10:03,330
(They're stamping their faces well.)

2200
01:10:03,354 --> 01:10:04,723
(This is fun to watch.)

2201
01:10:04,724 --> 01:10:06,754
Please raise your head.

2202
01:10:08,424 --> 01:10:10,294
- Everyone got it. - Everyone got it.

2203
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:12,564
- What? - What?

2204
01:10:12,794 --> 01:10:15,063
- What is this? Everyone has ink. - What are you doing?

2205
01:10:15,064 --> 01:10:17,304
- Why did you make us pick a spot? - What is this?

2206
01:10:18,204 --> 01:10:21,274
(They don't know what it is, but it's fun to watch.)

2207
01:10:21,874 --> 01:10:23,003
What is this?

2208
01:10:23,004 --> 01:10:24,004
- What are you doing? - What is this?

2209
01:10:24,005 --> 01:10:25,544
From now on,

2210
01:10:25,944 --> 01:10:27,773
- What is this? - you will get ready to sleep.

2211
01:10:27,774 --> 01:10:29,743
- What are you talking about? - There are waiting rooms...

2212
01:10:29,744 --> 01:10:31,514
behind you for each team.

2213
01:10:31,584 --> 01:10:33,113
You will go to the waiting room,

2214
01:10:33,114 --> 01:10:35,613
get ready to sleep,

2215
01:10:35,614 --> 01:10:37,423
- and ring the bell in front of you. - What about this face?

2216
01:10:37,424 --> 01:10:38,424
The first team to come out will be sleeping indoors.

2217
01:10:38,425 --> 01:10:39,453
- Hold on. - What about the face?

2218
01:10:39,454 --> 01:10:41,823
- Hold on. - We'll consider you ready...

2219
01:10:41,824 --> 01:10:43,493
when the ink is completely gone.

2220
01:10:43,494 --> 01:10:45,624
The ink should be completely gone.

2221
01:10:45,994 --> 01:10:48,563
Also, when you're done getting ready to sleep,

2222
01:10:48,564 --> 01:10:51,263
you have to sleep in that state.

2223
01:10:51,264 --> 01:10:53,633
If we find you doing further things to get ready to sleep,

2224
01:10:53,634 --> 01:10:55,974
you will be sent out to sleep outdoors.

2225
01:10:56,204 --> 01:10:58,104
(This is ridiculous.)

2226
01:10:58,204 --> 01:11:00,543
Are you telling us to take a shower? Do we just wash up?

2227
01:11:00,544 --> 01:11:01,873
You may choose not to take a shower.

2228
01:11:01,874 --> 01:11:04,813
But you will have to sleep like that.

2229
01:11:04,814 --> 01:11:06,583
But Se Yoon normally doesn't take a shower.

2230
01:11:06,584 --> 01:11:08,213
What are you talking about? I take showers.

2231
01:11:08,214 --> 01:11:10,054
We could just wash off the ink...

2232
01:11:10,314 --> 01:11:11,723
and stay like this.

2233
01:11:11,724 --> 01:11:13,324
He also doesn't shower.

2234
01:11:13,724 --> 01:11:15,493
- What? They both don't shower. - I can sleep like this.

2235
01:11:15,494 --> 01:11:17,263
- I can sleep like this too. - He's framing me.

2236
01:11:17,264 --> 01:11:18,494
He really doesn't shower.

2237
01:11:18,694 --> 01:11:19,963
We'll give you the shampoo...

2238
01:11:19,964 --> 01:11:22,894
so you can shower comfortably.

2239
01:11:23,264 --> 01:11:24,534
- Give us what? - What?

2240
01:11:25,904 --> 01:11:27,703
- What? - We'll give you the shampoo...

2241
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:29,933
- so you can shower... - what are you doing?

2242
01:11:29,934 --> 01:11:31,474
- What are you doing? - What is this?

2243
01:11:31,674 --> 01:11:33,504
What are you doing?

2244
01:11:33,574 --> 01:11:35,443
- What are you doing? - You've gone out of your mind.

2245
01:11:35,444 --> 01:11:36,844
- What are you doing? - You're mad.

2246
01:11:37,284 --> 01:11:39,114
(He grabs him by the collar.)

2247
01:11:39,414 --> 01:11:41,154
(This is ridiculous.)

2248
01:11:41,314 --> 01:11:42,984
(It's a relief they won in Round 1.)

2249
01:11:43,154 --> 01:11:44,523
(The director is doing whatever he wants.)

2250
01:11:44,524 --> 01:11:46,723
- What is this? - You can go now.

2251
01:11:46,724 --> 01:11:47,823
Ready.

2252
01:11:47,824 --> 01:11:49,823
- What is this? - Ready. Set...

2253
01:11:49,824 --> 01:11:51,864
(They head off to get ready to sleep!)

2254
01:11:51,964 --> 01:11:54,534
- Shall we go and shower? - Shall we?

2255
01:11:54,694 --> 01:11:56,994
This is a fun game.

2256
01:11:57,704 --> 01:12:01,210
(Which team will come out first?)

2257
01:12:01,301 --> 01:12:02,561
(They all start running.)

2258
01:12:02,562 --> 01:12:03,731
I'm going there.

2259
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:05,191
(Team Jong Min's room, Team Se Yoon's room)

2260
01:12:05,192 --> 01:12:06,232
Se Yoon.

2261
01:12:06,862 --> 01:12:08,001
(Se Yoon enters first.)

2262
01:12:08,002 --> 01:12:09,732
(He heads to the bathroom right away.)

2263
01:12:10,172 --> 01:12:11,902
Shall we wash together?

2264
01:12:12,072 --> 01:12:13,701
- We have no time. - Remove the mic.

2265
01:12:13,702 --> 01:12:15,271
Wash after removing the mic.

2266
01:12:15,272 --> 01:12:16,272
Remove it quickly.

2267
01:12:16,273 --> 01:12:17,711
- When you're in a rush, - We have to take our time.

2268
01:12:17,712 --> 01:12:19,311
You have to take your time. Slow down.

2269
01:12:19,312 --> 01:12:22,011
Bathing products. Foam cleanser!

2270
01:12:22,012 --> 01:12:23,411
(He's in the most rush.)

2271
01:12:23,412 --> 01:12:25,582
- They're in here. - They are?

2272
01:12:26,282 --> 01:12:27,482
How should I do this?

2273
01:12:28,282 --> 01:12:29,351
Take off your clothes.

2274
01:12:29,352 --> 01:12:30,391
(They take off their sweatshirts as soon as they enter the room.)

2275
01:12:30,392 --> 01:12:31,522
Run.

2276
01:12:31,652 --> 01:12:32,891
Gosh, it's cold.

2277
01:12:32,892 --> 01:12:34,492
(He quickly throws away his clothes.)

2278
01:12:34,722 --> 01:12:36,491
Wash your face, Jong Min.

2279
01:12:36,492 --> 01:12:37,892
(He shampoos aggressively.)

2280
01:12:38,192 --> 01:12:41,231
(Joon washes off the ink in earnest.)

2281
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:42,331
(They both seem to hate sleeping outdoors.)

2282
01:12:42,332 --> 01:12:44,602
(DinDin)

2283
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:46,601
(They're desperately getting ready to sleep.)

2284
01:12:46,602 --> 01:12:48,341
It's hot.

2285
01:12:48,342 --> 01:12:50,672
Wash your face. Hurry.

2286
01:12:52,812 --> 01:12:54,512
(Se Yoon takes it.)

2287
01:12:55,082 --> 01:12:57,052
(Se Yoon?)

2288
01:12:57,112 --> 01:12:58,512
I'm sorry, Joon.

2289
01:12:59,422 --> 01:13:00,582
I'm sorry.

2290
01:13:02,752 --> 01:13:03,951
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

2291
01:13:03,952 --> 01:13:05,191
- Should I keep using it? - Yes.

2292
01:13:05,192 --> 01:13:06,522
I think I'm done.

2293
01:13:07,722 --> 01:13:11,462
(I always lose in games.)

2294
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:15,231
(The result was always the same...)

2295
01:13:15,232 --> 01:13:18,502
(even if I tried to rely on luck.)

2296
01:13:18,932 --> 01:13:21,342
(If I don't want to sleep outdoors, )

2297
01:13:21,502 --> 01:13:22,811
I think I'm done.

2298
01:13:22,812 --> 01:13:24,771
(I should at least do this.)

2299
01:13:24,772 --> 01:13:26,112
Here. You can use it.

2300
01:13:27,912 --> 01:13:29,551
(After Se Yoon is done)

2301
01:13:29,552 --> 01:13:30,812
It's cold.

2302
01:13:31,652 --> 01:13:33,221
I'm done.

2303
01:13:33,222 --> 01:13:35,062
(Joon doesn't stop even if the water is cold.)

2304
01:13:35,692 --> 01:13:39,022
(He desperately continues to get ready to sleep.)

2305
01:13:39,722 --> 01:13:41,321
- Jong Min. - Yes?

2306
01:13:41,322 --> 01:13:42,562
You have to come out.

2307
01:13:43,062 --> 01:13:45,832
(They will be sleeping indoors if Jong Min comes out.)

2308
01:13:46,302 --> 01:13:47,501
Clothes.

2309
01:13:47,502 --> 01:13:48,502
(Joon also finished showering.)

2310
01:13:48,503 --> 01:13:49,548
(Se Yoon is getting changed.)

2311
01:13:49,572 --> 01:13:50,572
You have to wear clothes.

2312
01:13:50,573 --> 01:13:52,442
I don't know where my clothes are.

2313
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:53,702
Just wear anything.

2314
01:13:54,002 --> 01:13:55,772
Here it is.

2315
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:57,641
Hurry.

2316
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:59,542
(He goes to get changed.)

2317
01:13:59,742 --> 01:14:00,781
(Tumbling)

2318
01:14:00,782 --> 01:14:02,212
(He bursts into laughter.)

2319
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:05,181
You should turn around and take off your underwear.

2320
01:14:05,182 --> 01:14:06,222
Hey!

2321
01:14:06,282 --> 01:14:09,252
- I had no space. - How could you do that?

2322
01:14:09,422 --> 01:14:10,821
We're all men.

2323
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:12,522
We have to help each other.

2324
01:14:13,322 --> 01:14:14,621
I can't believe this guy.

2325
01:14:14,622 --> 01:14:16,462
(Who will come out of this confusion first...)

2326
01:14:16,492 --> 01:14:18,491
Jong Min, we have to go.

2327
01:14:18,492 --> 01:14:20,572
(Which team will ring the bell of sleeping indoors?)

2328
01:14:20,862 --> 01:14:23,831
Which team will come out first?

2329
01:14:23,832 --> 01:14:25,202
This is so exciting.

2330
01:14:25,772 --> 01:14:27,372
You did well to come up with the game.

2331
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,942
The shampoo squeezing at the end was excellent.

2332
01:14:30,242 --> 01:14:32,282
They might not have washed their hair without that.

2333
01:14:32,842 --> 01:14:35,282
What?

2334
01:14:35,982 --> 01:14:37,251
Hold on.

2335
01:14:37,252 --> 01:14:38,352
(Se Yoon?)

2336
01:14:38,912 --> 01:14:40,681
(Indoor sleeping, )

2337
01:14:40,682 --> 01:14:42,052
(wait for me!)

2338
01:14:42,282 --> 01:14:43,852
Gosh, he's missing his shoe!

2339
01:14:43,992 --> 01:14:46,322
(He came out barefooted on the gravel.)

2340
01:14:47,062 --> 01:14:49,532
(To our surprise, Se Yoon and Joon came out first.)

2341
01:14:49,992 --> 01:14:52,432
(What happened?)

2342
01:14:52,832 --> 01:14:53,961
(To get washed, )

2343
01:14:53,962 --> 01:14:55,631
(changed, )

2344
01:14:55,632 --> 01:14:57,401
(and come out, )

2345
01:14:57,402 --> 01:15:00,872
(it took them 4 minutes and 10 seconds.)

2346
01:15:01,142 --> 01:15:03,041
- Come out, Jong Min. - Why?

2347
01:15:03,042 --> 01:15:04,112
We have to go.

2348
01:15:04,372 --> 01:15:06,112
Hurry up and come out. We have to go.

2349
01:15:06,182 --> 01:15:07,242
Why?

2350
01:15:07,412 --> 01:15:09,111
We lose if we're late!

2351
01:15:09,112 --> 01:15:10,381
- Really? - Yes.

2352
01:15:10,382 --> 01:15:12,482
(Really? I see.)

2353
01:15:12,582 --> 01:15:14,522
They all came out.

2354
01:15:15,482 --> 01:15:17,192
(Peeking)

2355
01:15:17,792 --> 01:15:19,721
(After checking their loss...)

2356
01:15:19,722 --> 01:15:21,461
Let's just wash up, Jong Min.

2357
01:15:21,462 --> 01:15:22,532
Right.

2358
01:15:22,962 --> 01:15:24,192
Let's not leave.

2359
01:15:24,662 --> 01:15:25,931
- Gosh. - How long did we take?

2360
01:15:25,932 --> 01:15:27,361
We washed up really quickly.

2361
01:15:27,362 --> 01:15:29,431
Check the time. We were so desperate.

2362
01:15:29,432 --> 01:15:30,971
I didn't even wash up and just got changed,

2363
01:15:30,972 --> 01:15:32,292
but they came out faster than me.

2364
01:15:32,942 --> 01:15:34,702
- Did you wash up together? - Right.

2365
01:15:35,302 --> 01:15:37,741
I was washing up, and he used the water from behind me.

2366
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:39,022
The water dripping from my back.

2367
01:15:39,412 --> 01:15:40,812
I thought he was amazing.

2368
01:15:40,982 --> 01:15:42,481
I wash washing my hair,

2369
01:15:42,482 --> 01:15:44,381
and someone kept getting the water from behind me.

2370
01:15:44,382 --> 01:15:46,622
"Gosh!" He kept doing this.

2371
01:15:46,882 --> 01:15:48,452
There was a space where we got changed.

2372
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:50,921
I got changed while facing the wall.

2373
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:52,691
Joon came in right after,

2374
01:15:52,692 --> 01:15:54,891
and he suddenly turned around and pulled his underwear down.

2375
01:15:54,892 --> 01:15:55,931
(Pulling down his underwear after suddenly turning around)

2376
01:15:55,932 --> 01:15:57,532
"Why is the camera there?"

2377
01:15:58,292 --> 01:15:59,732
That's how intense it was.

2378
01:16:00,002 --> 01:16:02,361
- Gosh. - The cameraman was shocked.

2379
01:16:02,362 --> 01:16:03,571
(Thanks to Joon's eagerness...)

2380
01:16:03,572 --> 01:16:06,972
All right, Se Yoon and Joon. You two will sleep indoors.

2381
01:16:07,472 --> 01:16:08,502
Right.

2382
01:16:09,372 --> 01:16:11,388
It's the first time I've achieved something on my own...

2383
01:16:11,412 --> 01:16:12,941
after the Sin, Si, and Mo Islands.

2384
01:16:12,942 --> 01:16:14,941
But it was predicted...

2385
01:16:14,942 --> 01:16:16,481
that the two of you were going to sleep indoors.

2386
01:16:16,482 --> 01:16:17,712
- Right. - Right.

2387
01:16:17,812 --> 01:16:19,381
That ends our day.

2388
01:16:19,382 --> 01:16:21,082
- Okay. - Turn off the hot water for them.

2389
01:16:21,352 --> 01:16:22,791
They will come out right away when the hot water is turned off.

2390
01:16:22,792 --> 01:16:24,891
When the wake-up song plays in the morning,

2391
01:16:24,892 --> 01:16:26,161
you just need to come out.

2392
01:16:26,162 --> 01:16:27,262
- Okay. - Okay.

2393
01:16:27,622 --> 01:16:29,261
- We'll get going. - Thank you.

2394
01:16:29,262 --> 01:16:30,791
- Great work, everyone. - Bye!

2395
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:31,961
Should I hit the slate?

2396
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,801
Gosh, that was a great idea.

2397
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:34,961
- We'll get it later. - Right.

2398
01:16:34,962 --> 01:16:37,502
(The chaotic sleep preparation is over.)

2399
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:38,802
(After the crazy shower incident...)

2400
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:41,302
- We gave it our all. - It feels strange.

2401
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:43,412
We washed up so quickly.

2402
01:16:43,742 --> 01:16:46,242
Gosh, I should've brushed my teeth.

2403
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:48,012
I couldn't even put on my underwear.

2404
01:16:48,412 --> 01:16:49,972
You're not wearing anything underneath?

2405
01:16:50,652 --> 01:16:51,681
- Really? - I don't have any.

2406
01:16:51,682 --> 01:16:53,422
I don't have any underwear.

2407
01:16:53,952 --> 01:16:57,422
(It's a relief you have clothes on, at least.)

2408
01:16:57,492 --> 01:17:00,562
But this is such a great achievement.

2409
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:04,092
(The memories of the past flash by.)

2410
01:17:04,832 --> 01:17:07,331
(They realize how hard they've tried to achieve this.)

2411
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:08,701
- I'm fine. - Are you okay?

2412
01:17:08,702 --> 01:17:11,271
I didn't expect to have a champagne shower.

2413
01:17:11,272 --> 01:17:12,848
(Sweet indoor sleeping achieved with the champagne shower)

2414
01:17:12,872 --> 01:17:14,101
We're back.

2415
01:17:14,102 --> 01:17:15,841
(Sae Ho and Seon Ho return after a relaxing shower.)

2416
01:17:15,842 --> 01:17:16,912
Gosh.

2417
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:18,112
(Yawning)

2418
01:17:18,472 --> 01:17:20,742
Gosh, I don't even know if my hair got washed properly.

2419
01:17:20,782 --> 01:17:22,411
(A sudden check)

2420
01:17:22,412 --> 01:17:23,412
(Sniffing)

2421
01:17:23,413 --> 01:17:25,413
It has a certain smell. It must be from your perm.

2422
01:17:25,852 --> 01:17:28,381
I think it's the first time we're sleeping together like this.

2423
01:17:28,382 --> 01:17:29,422
Right.

2424
01:17:29,492 --> 01:17:31,851
I always sleep indoors with Se Yoon these days.

2425
01:17:31,852 --> 01:17:34,692
I always sleep outdoors with Sae Ho.

2426
01:17:35,062 --> 01:17:36,231
I was always outdoors.

2427
01:17:36,232 --> 01:17:37,752
It feels awkward to have Joon with us.

2428
01:17:38,092 --> 01:17:39,131
(Let's go to sleep now.)

2429
01:17:39,132 --> 01:17:40,532
We already won.

2430
01:17:41,062 --> 01:17:42,431
Gosh, I love it!

2431
01:17:42,432 --> 01:17:44,401
This is what it feels like to sleep indoors!

2432
01:17:44,402 --> 01:17:46,801
This is a historic day.

2433
01:17:46,802 --> 01:17:48,901
We sent the snake and the sneaky one out.

2434
01:17:48,902 --> 01:17:51,772
- Right. - We sent the strong ones out.

2435
01:17:52,112 --> 01:17:53,182
Gosh.

2436
01:17:53,512 --> 01:17:54,582
Gosh.

2437
01:17:55,282 --> 01:17:57,112
It's been so long to sleep outdoors.

2438
01:17:57,652 --> 01:18:00,121
I just decided to get a good shower toward the end.

2439
01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:02,651
Right. It was better to do that. I just took my time to wash up.

2440
01:18:02,652 --> 01:18:06,021
They came out without wearing their underwear.

2441
01:18:06,022 --> 01:18:07,092
- Really? - Yes.

2442
01:18:07,262 --> 01:18:10,432
(Is someone talking about me?)

2443
01:18:10,662 --> 01:18:12,802
- I didn't want to be uncultured. - Right.

2444
01:18:13,262 --> 01:18:15,432
- You need to wash up well. - Right.

2445
01:18:15,632 --> 01:18:16,972
A person must be nice and clean.

2446
01:18:17,172 --> 01:18:18,871
What's the point of winning...

2447
01:18:18,872 --> 01:18:20,072
and sleeping dirty?

2448
01:18:20,772 --> 01:18:22,301
This is good enough to sleep in.

2449
01:18:22,302 --> 01:18:23,411
Right. It's fine.

2450
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:24,812
Spring must be here.

2451
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,842
Spring in Yangsan.

2452
01:18:27,212 --> 01:18:28,912
- I had fun today. - Right.

2453
01:18:29,012 --> 01:18:30,982
- Spring has come, - Right.

2454
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:33,551
- so everyone got excited. - Right.

2455
01:18:33,552 --> 01:18:36,192
The cold winter went by, and the warm spring has come.

2456
01:18:36,252 --> 01:18:38,792
It warmed even our hearts, and we all got excited.

2457
01:18:39,292 --> 01:18:42,062
You're going to get married when this spring season comes.

2458
01:18:42,222 --> 01:18:43,262
Right.

2459
01:18:43,332 --> 01:18:45,191
Gosh, spring has finally come.

2460
01:18:45,192 --> 01:18:46,308
(The younger one feels a lot seeing Jong Min getting married.)

2461
01:18:46,332 --> 01:18:48,301
Right after Season Four started,

2462
01:18:48,302 --> 01:18:50,171
we were debating on...

2463
01:18:50,172 --> 01:18:51,771
- who would get married first. - Right.

2464
01:18:51,772 --> 01:18:52,872
We had that session.

2465
01:18:53,372 --> 01:18:55,941
(Back in May, 2021)

2466
01:18:55,942 --> 01:18:58,412
(The hardest debate topic)

2467
01:18:59,212 --> 01:19:02,642
(DinDin refused to be compared with Jong Min.)

2468
01:19:03,212 --> 01:19:07,022
(He even declared that he would get married first.)

2469
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:08,122
Right.

2470
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:10,151
Back then, I thought I was going to get married first.

2471
01:19:10,152 --> 01:19:11,868
I thought you were going to get married first too.

2472
01:19:11,892 --> 01:19:14,261
The spring you have waited for has finally come.

2473
01:19:14,262 --> 01:19:16,392
The third spring I have waited for.

2474
01:19:17,732 --> 01:19:22,162
(The quiet night sky starts to drizzle.)

2475
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:25,502
(As the leaves soak in the raindrops, )

2476
01:19:26,502 --> 01:19:29,302
(the wake-up song starts to play.)

2477
01:19:30,512 --> 01:19:33,412
(Getting up)

2478
01:19:34,142 --> 01:19:35,181
(Peeking)

2479
01:19:35,182 --> 01:19:38,212
(The ones that slept indoors get up in just 5 seconds.)

2480
01:19:38,682 --> 01:19:41,322
(DinDin the Kid gets up right away too.)

2481
01:19:41,522 --> 01:19:42,552
(Wake up, Jong Min.)

2482
01:19:43,622 --> 01:19:46,292
(Jong Min also wakes up looking half awake.)

2483
01:19:46,722 --> 01:19:52,432
(All members are awake.)

2484
01:19:52,732 --> 01:19:54,032
It's raining.

2485
01:19:55,602 --> 01:19:57,631
(Why is everyone surprised to see Sae Ho who came in last?)

2486
01:19:57,632 --> 01:19:59,331
That's an intense look.

2487
01:19:59,332 --> 01:20:00,371
(An intense look in the morning)

2488
01:20:00,372 --> 01:20:02,501
- Sae Ho looks intense. - Right.

2489
01:20:02,502 --> 01:20:04,942
(When Life Gives You Age)

2490
01:20:05,042 --> 01:20:06,781
All right, everyone. You've all slept well, right?

2491
01:20:06,782 --> 01:20:08,311
- Yes. - Yes.

2492
01:20:08,312 --> 01:20:09,912
Today's morning mission is called...

2493
01:20:10,112 --> 01:20:12,051
What's Next?

2494
01:20:12,052 --> 01:20:13,881
- What's Next? - "What is up next?"

2495
01:20:13,882 --> 01:20:15,821
It's about where we will have our next shoot.

2496
01:20:15,822 --> 01:20:17,568
(What is this all about early in the morning?)

2497
01:20:17,592 --> 01:20:21,192
(In celebration of spring)

2498
01:20:22,622 --> 01:20:26,232
(Given to you...)

2499
01:20:27,362 --> 01:20:30,702
(right now)

2500
01:20:30,732 --> 01:20:32,731
Gosh!

2501
01:20:32,732 --> 01:20:34,041
What's wrong?

2502
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:37,072
(A chance to make a choice)

2503
01:20:39,942 --> 01:20:42,781
(Coming soon)

2504
01:20:42,782 --> 01:20:43,782
From now on,

2505
01:20:44,082 --> 01:20:46,521
there will be four different rounds,

2506
01:20:46,522 --> 01:20:48,982
and the theme for the next trip will be decided.

2507
01:20:49,492 --> 01:20:50,892
- The theme? - Right.

2508
01:20:51,122 --> 01:20:53,122
There will be no negotiations or signs of support.

2509
01:20:53,492 --> 01:20:56,632
The trip will be solely based on the result of the game.

2510
01:20:56,662 --> 01:20:58,931
Gosh. All right.

2511
01:20:58,932 --> 01:21:00,101
- He's so strict. - Right.

2512
01:21:00,102 --> 01:21:01,801
All right. Please bring it inside.

2513
01:21:01,802 --> 01:21:03,501
- How will it get decided? - That would be the worst.

2514
01:21:03,502 --> 01:21:05,532
If it starts in Busan...

2515
01:21:05,572 --> 01:21:07,071
It could be at the KBS building again.

2516
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,802
What is that? It's being brought in.

2517
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:12,912
(Their fates will be decided...)

2518
01:21:13,842 --> 01:21:16,382
(by the spinning wheel.)

2519
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:20,481
The theme of the first round is "travel destination."

2520
01:21:20,482 --> 01:21:21,582
Right.

2521
01:21:22,052 --> 01:21:24,492
- I personally prefer the sea. - Same here.

2522
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:26,962
I prefer mountains now.

2523
01:21:27,062 --> 01:21:28,862
I enjoy seeing flowers...

2524
01:21:29,022 --> 01:21:31,491
and trees. I like those places.

2525
01:21:31,492 --> 01:21:34,262
I personally prefer mountains, but I have an allergy.

2526
01:21:34,662 --> 01:21:35,861
- You're allergic to mountains? - Really?

2527
01:21:35,862 --> 01:21:37,401
- Flowers. - I have a flower allergy.

2528
01:21:37,402 --> 01:21:39,071
- Right. - Right.

2529
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,701
- I think I should go to the sea. - I love the sea too.

2530
01:21:40,702 --> 01:21:42,501
Is your nose having an allergic reaction?

2531
01:21:42,502 --> 01:21:44,971
- Gosh. - Your allergy is bad too.

2532
01:21:44,972 --> 01:21:46,012
My allergy is bad.

2533
01:21:46,782 --> 01:21:48,181
His nose looks seriously swollen.

2534
01:21:48,182 --> 01:21:49,512
(They're all the same.)

2535
01:21:49,652 --> 01:21:52,652
All right. Choose someone who will spin the wheel.

2536
01:21:53,482 --> 01:21:55,652
- Gosh. - They're going to get blamed a lot.

2537
01:21:56,122 --> 01:21:57,791
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2538
01:21:57,792 --> 01:21:59,491
- The one with the most energy. - That's him.

2539
01:21:59,492 --> 01:22:01,421
- Right. Where do you want to go? - Okay.

2540
01:22:01,422 --> 01:22:02,791
- Gosh. - Where do you want to go?

2541
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:04,491
- Let's go to the sea. - I'll choose the sea for you.

2542
01:22:04,492 --> 01:22:05,761
Sae Ho has a lot of energy.

2543
01:22:05,762 --> 01:22:07,761
- Namhae. - But the area hasn't been decided.

2544
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:09,601
- Gosh! - You should leave.

2545
01:22:09,602 --> 01:22:10,602
(His morning breath came out without a warning.)

2546
01:22:10,603 --> 01:22:12,772
- What's wrong? - How rude of you!

2547
01:22:14,302 --> 01:22:15,471
I brushed my teeth with the foam cleanser...

2548
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:16,752
as I didn't have any toothpaste.

2549
01:22:16,912 --> 01:22:18,111
No wonder your teeth were so white.

2550
01:22:18,112 --> 01:22:19,312
Here I go.

2551
01:22:19,512 --> 01:22:20,982
(Laughing)

2552
01:22:21,042 --> 01:22:22,641
His teeth were so white.

2553
01:22:22,642 --> 01:22:23,752
Right. Yesterday...

2554
01:22:23,882 --> 01:22:24,951
What?

2555
01:22:24,952 --> 01:22:26,951
(He turns the spinning wheel all of a sudden.)

2556
01:22:26,952 --> 01:22:28,352
(Mountain, Sea)

2557
01:22:29,182 --> 01:22:31,652
(Where will Sae Ho take them?)

2558
01:22:31,922 --> 01:22:32,922
That must be it.

2559
01:22:32,922 --> 01:22:33,922
(The sea that everyone wishes for?)

2560
01:22:33,923 --> 01:22:35,261
- It's not it. - No.

2561
01:22:35,262 --> 01:22:37,232
- It's the mountain. - We can't know yet.

2562
01:22:37,832 --> 01:22:39,832
(Heart pounding)

2563
01:22:40,832 --> 01:22:43,202
(Will Sae Ho continue to be strong with his energy?)

2564
01:22:43,332 --> 01:22:44,332
It's not it.

2565
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:45,671
- No. - It's the mountain.

2566
01:22:45,672 --> 01:22:47,202
It is the sea.

2567
01:22:47,442 --> 01:22:48,801
- Okay! - Sea!

2568
01:22:48,802 --> 01:22:50,611
- You're on fire. - Nice one.

2569
01:22:50,612 --> 01:22:51,711
- You're on fire. - You're on fire.

2570
01:22:51,712 --> 01:22:53,981
- I've still got it. - You're on fire.

2571
01:22:53,982 --> 01:22:55,341
- Nice one. - Nice one.

2572
01:22:55,342 --> 01:22:57,011
- You're starting things well. - You saw that, right?

2573
01:22:57,012 --> 01:22:58,611
The staff members are looking brighter too.

2574
01:22:58,612 --> 01:23:00,322
- Sea! - Sea!

2575
01:23:00,482 --> 01:23:01,782
- That was it. - It's the sea.

2576
01:23:02,052 --> 01:23:04,691
Then we'll be heading to the sea.

2577
01:23:04,692 --> 01:23:06,862
- Right. To the sea. - To the sea.

2578
01:23:07,062 --> 01:23:09,632
This one will be important.

2579
01:23:09,862 --> 01:23:10,892
Is it the area?

2580
01:23:11,262 --> 01:23:13,632
It will be the distance from Seoul.

2581
01:23:14,132 --> 01:23:15,601
We have to do well with this one.

2582
01:23:15,602 --> 01:23:17,031
I'll be leaving early anyway.

2583
01:23:17,032 --> 01:23:18,072
All right.

2584
01:23:20,072 --> 01:23:21,141
What is it?

2585
01:23:21,142 --> 01:23:23,011
- Gosh. That's a big difference. - It's 300km away?

2586
01:23:23,012 --> 01:23:24,012
But...

2587
01:23:24,212 --> 01:23:26,142
why is this so unbalanced?

2588
01:23:27,282 --> 01:23:28,681
- Let's fight. - What on earth is this?

2589
01:23:28,682 --> 01:23:30,011
It's time to fight against them.

2590
01:23:30,012 --> 01:23:31,551
It's so unbalanced.

2591
01:23:31,552 --> 01:23:34,122
Please come out and explain. No?

2592
01:23:34,152 --> 01:23:37,351
You still get a 50-percent chance...

2593
01:23:37,352 --> 01:23:38,998
of going somewhere that is less than 300km away.

2594
01:23:39,022 --> 01:23:40,221
Why does it have to be at 50 percent...

2595
01:23:40,222 --> 01:23:41,421
for being over 300km away?

2596
01:23:41,422 --> 01:23:43,362
- We know that. - Can't it be equal to 100km...

2597
01:23:43,532 --> 01:23:44,861
or 100km to 200km?

2598
01:23:44,862 --> 01:23:48,162
We've never been balanced in our games anyway.

2599
01:23:48,602 --> 01:23:50,431
- Gosh. - Gosh. We have nothing to say...

2600
01:23:50,432 --> 01:23:52,301
- if he answers it like that. - Right.

2601
01:23:52,302 --> 01:23:53,302
Aren't I right?

2602
01:23:53,372 --> 01:23:54,601
- Rock-paper-scissors again? - What is that?

2603
01:23:54,602 --> 01:23:55,878
The one who gets this one will get a lot of blame.

2604
01:23:55,902 --> 01:23:57,571
The spinning wheel is turned, and the dart is thrown.

2605
01:23:57,572 --> 01:23:58,911
- Really? - Yes.

2606
01:23:58,912 --> 01:24:01,412
- Se Yoon is good at throwing darts. - Hey.

2607
01:24:02,112 --> 01:24:03,432
You saw me throw darts yesterday.

2608
01:24:03,952 --> 01:24:05,451
- You all saw me, right? - Right. We did.

2609
01:24:05,452 --> 01:24:06,452
You all saw me, right?

2610
01:24:07,622 --> 01:24:11,792
(During the balloon-popping game that was held yesterday, )

2611
01:24:13,062 --> 01:24:16,662
(Se Yoon managed to hit 10,000 and increase the amount of seeds.)

2612
01:24:17,692 --> 01:24:20,132
(A dart genius, Moon Se Yoon)

2613
01:24:21,162 --> 01:24:23,372
(Practicing)

2614
01:24:24,602 --> 01:24:26,502
(He's in good shape today.)

2615
01:24:26,642 --> 01:24:28,471
- You have to spin it hard. - Come on.

2616
01:24:28,472 --> 01:24:29,841
And you have to throw it in three seconds.

2617
01:24:29,842 --> 01:24:33,111
If you spin the wheel gently,

2618
01:24:33,112 --> 01:24:34,611
- you'll do it again. - Okay.

2619
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:36,952
(Number 1 on the blacklist)

2620
01:24:37,252 --> 01:24:39,082
- Let's begin. - You can do this!

2621
01:24:39,822 --> 01:24:40,981
What's that?

2622
01:24:40,982 --> 01:24:42,052
Spin it again.

2623
01:24:42,252 --> 01:24:43,522
Why?

2624
01:24:43,592 --> 01:24:45,592
(It even stopped spinning only after 1 second.)

2625
01:24:45,722 --> 01:24:46,792
Why?

2626
01:24:47,422 --> 01:24:49,161
What did you just do?

2627
01:24:49,162 --> 01:24:51,031
- I spun it with all my strength. - You did?

2628
01:24:51,032 --> 01:24:52,331
I almost broke my finger.

2629
01:24:52,332 --> 01:24:53,731
Are you a Thinker? You should ask if he's okay.

2630
01:24:53,732 --> 01:24:55,601
- You're unbelievable. - Are you okay?

2631
01:24:55,602 --> 01:24:56,901
- How is your finger? - Are you all right?

2632
01:24:56,902 --> 01:24:58,201
It's you who is being unbelievable.

2633
01:24:58,202 --> 01:25:00,302
(It's you who is being unbelievable.)

2634
01:25:00,572 --> 01:25:02,771
- Here I go. - It's all about fate.

2635
01:25:02,772 --> 01:25:04,311
- Let's go. It's all about fate. - I just...

2636
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:05,471
want to avoid 300km.

2637
01:25:05,472 --> 01:25:07,011
- Good. You can see it. - Three.

2638
01:25:07,012 --> 01:25:08,182
(The wheel is spinning well.)

2639
01:25:08,612 --> 01:25:11,051
- Three, two, one. - Let's go.

2640
01:25:11,052 --> 01:25:12,458
(All he needs to do now is to throw it well.)

2641
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:13,551
Let's go!

2642
01:25:13,552 --> 01:25:14,982
- What? - What?

2643
01:25:15,052 --> 01:25:16,321
- Hey! - Wait!

2644
01:25:16,322 --> 01:25:17,322
Let's go!

2645
01:25:18,752 --> 01:25:20,761
(Why did it fall off?)

2646
01:25:20,762 --> 01:25:21,792
Let's go!

2647
01:25:23,362 --> 01:25:27,662
(The dart bounced off the spinning wheel.)

2648
01:25:27,762 --> 01:25:28,802
Let's go!

2649
01:25:29,772 --> 01:25:32,702
(It still hit the 100km slot!)

2650
01:25:32,772 --> 01:25:34,341
- No. - It hit the slot first.

2651
01:25:34,342 --> 01:25:35,571
- Hey. - But it fell off.

2652
01:25:35,572 --> 01:25:36,741
It fell off.

2653
01:25:36,742 --> 01:25:39,071
- It was 100km. - I saw that.

2654
01:25:39,072 --> 01:25:41,081
- We should check the video. - Let's check it.

2655
01:25:41,082 --> 01:25:42,612
- It was 100km. - Come on.

2656
01:25:42,782 --> 01:25:44,288
(As Director Joo is being firm, they talk to the cameraman.)

2657
01:25:44,312 --> 01:25:46,011
- Why... - It was 100km, right?

2658
01:25:46,012 --> 01:25:47,581
- I'm sure it was 100km. - It really was.

2659
01:25:47,582 --> 01:25:49,081
It hit the 100km slot.

2660
01:25:49,082 --> 01:25:51,321
- I'm serious. - It went like this.

2661
01:25:51,322 --> 01:25:52,352
Let's go.

2662
01:25:52,852 --> 01:25:55,191
(Unfortunately, it doesn't count because it hit the line.)

2663
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:56,831
Here's my counterargument.

2664
01:25:56,832 --> 01:25:59,861
If it obviously hit 300km and fell off,

2665
01:25:59,862 --> 01:26:01,001
- Yes. - you would say it's 300km.

2666
01:26:01,002 --> 01:26:02,502
- I wouldn't do that. - Come on.

2667
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:05,372
- Then... - Fine. Let's do that.

2668
01:26:05,732 --> 01:26:07,571
- I think DinDin has a plan. - Let's do that.

2669
01:26:07,572 --> 01:26:10,871
He's going to take it off if it hits 300km.

2670
01:26:10,872 --> 01:26:12,111
- You should go there. - Why?

2671
01:26:12,112 --> 01:26:13,381
Why?

2672
01:26:13,382 --> 01:26:15,711
You say it doesn't count if it falls off. We can't help it.

2673
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:17,211
DinDin, stand in front of the TV.

2674
01:26:17,212 --> 01:26:19,151
- I should spin it. - Stand over there.

2675
01:26:19,152 --> 01:26:20,928
- I don't want to. - Do you want me to spin it?

2676
01:26:20,952 --> 01:26:22,151
Are you my dad?

2677
01:26:22,152 --> 01:26:23,152
(It's like he's disciplining DinDin.)

2678
01:26:23,153 --> 01:26:24,551
Why are you telling me to go?

2679
01:26:24,552 --> 01:26:25,721
Are you my dad?

2680
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,722
- Yes, Dad. - All right then.

2681
01:26:28,092 --> 01:26:29,361
- Should we start over? - All right.

2682
01:26:29,362 --> 01:26:31,391
- Let's do this. - Good.

2683
01:26:31,392 --> 01:26:32,591
- Lastly, - Okay.

2684
01:26:32,592 --> 01:26:33,961
I'll spin it and go over there.

2685
01:26:33,962 --> 01:26:35,961
- Okay. It's fair now. - Spin it.

2686
01:26:35,962 --> 01:26:38,001
This is like a penalty shoot-out. Let's do this.

2687
01:26:38,002 --> 01:26:39,562
- Ready? - This is a penalty shoot-out.

2688
01:26:39,602 --> 01:26:41,871
- It will be all right. - Spin it hard.

2689
01:26:41,872 --> 01:26:43,712
- All right. - I'll spin it once you're ready.

2690
01:26:43,842 --> 01:26:44,842
Spin it.

2691
01:26:45,072 --> 01:26:47,381
Five, four, three...

2692
01:26:47,382 --> 01:26:48,481
(Please)

2693
01:26:48,482 --> 01:26:49,512
Two.

2694
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,112
Se Yoon!

2695
01:26:51,113 --> 01:26:52,251
(What's the result?)

2696
01:26:52,252 --> 01:26:53,252
Two.

2697
01:26:53,382 --> 01:26:54,582
- Oh, no. - My gosh.

2698
01:26:55,952 --> 01:26:57,921
- Oh, no. - My gosh. This is so annoying.

2699
01:26:57,922 --> 01:26:58,952
Darn it!

2700
01:26:59,722 --> 01:27:01,561
(I want to cry.)

2701
01:27:01,562 --> 01:27:03,992
(Sorry...)

2702
01:27:04,032 --> 01:27:05,161
I don't know what to say.

2703
01:27:05,162 --> 01:27:06,882
I'll draw a mole on your face as a penalty.

2704
01:27:07,562 --> 01:27:09,532
- Se Yoon... - Stand in front of the TV.

2705
01:27:11,402 --> 01:27:13,972
(I don't want to.)

2706
01:27:14,802 --> 01:27:16,471
All right, everyone. Our next destination is...

2707
01:27:16,472 --> 01:27:20,741
the sea that is over 300km away...

2708
01:27:20,742 --> 01:27:22,142
from Seoul.

2709
01:27:22,582 --> 01:27:24,411
- The South Sea or the East Sea. - Where would it be?

2710
01:27:24,412 --> 01:27:26,151
Actually, it could be 400km...

2711
01:27:26,152 --> 01:27:28,421
or 500km away. It could be anywhere, even Jeju Island.

2712
01:27:28,422 --> 01:27:30,222
Stop talking. That makes me look bad.

2713
01:27:31,052 --> 01:27:32,591
We saw what happened. Why would you talk about it?

2714
01:27:32,592 --> 01:27:34,321
- It's not from 300km to 400km. - Right.

2715
01:27:34,322 --> 01:27:35,691
I think...

2716
01:27:35,692 --> 01:27:38,161
- it can be anywhere. - This is unfair.

2717
01:27:38,162 --> 01:27:39,162
- You did well at first. - All right.

2718
01:27:39,163 --> 01:27:40,202
(Embarrassed)

2719
01:27:40,362 --> 01:27:42,431
- This time... - I think there's more.

2720
01:27:42,432 --> 01:27:44,901
- Isn't it over? It's 300km. - There are 4 rounds.

2721
01:27:44,902 --> 01:27:46,531
Actually, it doesn't matter...

2722
01:27:46,532 --> 01:27:48,041
- wherever we go. - It doesn't matter.

2723
01:27:48,042 --> 01:27:49,601
- What is it? - It could be the sea.

2724
01:27:49,602 --> 01:27:52,341
This game is about abandonment.

2725
01:27:52,342 --> 01:27:53,511
- Abandonment? - Yes.

2726
01:27:53,512 --> 01:27:55,442
- Abandonment? - Are we going to be left behind?

2727
01:27:56,852 --> 01:27:58,881
(Abandonment on 2 Days 1 Night)

2728
01:27:58,882 --> 01:27:59,882
DinDin!

2729
01:28:00,252 --> 01:28:02,522
(It's a nightmare.)

2730
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:07,062
(You have to survive alone.)

2731
01:28:08,292 --> 01:28:11,532
(If you don't want to be left behind on your next trip...)

2732
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:13,632
If DinDin...

2733
01:28:13,832 --> 01:28:16,232
beats me in Cham, Cham, Cham,

2734
01:28:16,702 --> 01:28:18,332
there will be no abandonment.

2735
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,501
What?

2736
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:21,041
- If I win, - Will DinDin be left behind?

2737
01:28:21,042 --> 01:28:23,001
Some of you will be left behind.

2738
01:28:23,002 --> 01:28:24,341
- Okay. - But why...

2739
01:28:24,342 --> 01:28:25,442
We don't go together?

2740
01:28:25,512 --> 01:28:27,781
I think he's upset because you beat him the other day.

2741
01:28:27,782 --> 01:28:28,941
He said he practiced a lot.

2742
01:28:28,942 --> 01:28:31,182
Right. You read his mind.

2743
01:28:32,052 --> 01:28:34,051
(During the last trip to Uljin)

2744
01:28:34,052 --> 01:28:35,182
Cham, Cham, Cham.

2745
01:28:35,382 --> 01:28:39,152
(It was DinDin's complete victory.)

2746
01:28:41,322 --> 01:28:43,932
(Will he be able to recover his crumpled pride?)

2747
01:28:44,392 --> 01:28:45,591
All right. Let's do this.

2748
01:28:45,592 --> 01:28:46,938
(Will he be able to recover his crumpled pride?)

2749
01:28:46,962 --> 01:28:48,762
(Tensed up)

2750
01:28:48,932 --> 01:28:50,401
I'll go this way.

2751
01:28:50,402 --> 01:28:52,401
(He declares that he will go left.)

2752
01:28:52,402 --> 01:28:54,141
- Good. - There you go.

2753
01:28:54,142 --> 01:28:56,072
- Is it a single-round match? - A single round?

2754
01:28:56,142 --> 01:28:57,841
- Let's do that. - It's a single-round match.

2755
01:28:57,842 --> 01:28:59,611
You shouldn't move the finger late.

2756
01:28:59,612 --> 01:29:00,981
- Move it right away. - Let's do it...

2757
01:29:00,982 --> 01:29:02,612
with our eyes closed.

2758
01:29:02,742 --> 01:29:04,111
- Okay. - You might move late...

2759
01:29:04,112 --> 01:29:05,581
and read my movement.

2760
01:29:05,582 --> 01:29:07,351
- Move it on time. - I'll play fair and square...

2761
01:29:07,352 --> 01:29:08,922
- with my eyes open. - I don't want to.

2762
01:29:09,082 --> 01:29:10,251
- Let's do it with eyes closed. - Okay.

2763
01:29:10,252 --> 01:29:11,252
It's been a while...

2764
01:29:11,253 --> 01:29:12,422
(Closing his eyes)

2765
01:29:12,652 --> 01:29:13,822
(Laughing)

2766
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:15,861
- What was that? - That's funny.

2767
01:29:15,862 --> 01:29:18,362
I'll do it at ease.

2768
01:29:18,962 --> 01:29:20,131
(He crosses his short legs at ease.)

2769
01:29:20,132 --> 01:29:21,531
- As expected for him. - Look at his legs.

2770
01:29:21,532 --> 01:29:23,501
He's the king...

2771
01:29:23,502 --> 01:29:24,571
of Cham, Cham, Cham.

2772
01:29:24,572 --> 01:29:26,941
I told you I'd go this way.

2773
01:29:26,942 --> 01:29:27,942
(I'll win again.)

2774
01:29:28,002 --> 01:29:29,502
- I told you I'd go this way. - Okay.

2775
01:29:29,802 --> 01:29:31,312
- All right. - I'll win today.

2776
01:29:32,112 --> 01:29:33,982
"What do I do? Right or left?"

2777
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:36,142
"I have to win."

2778
01:29:36,412 --> 01:29:39,412
"But I don't know what to do."

2779
01:29:39,552 --> 01:29:42,252
"Please help me, Mom."

2780
01:29:42,722 --> 01:29:44,792
(Having a mental breakdown)

2781
01:29:45,092 --> 01:29:47,962
- I'll begin. - "Mom!"

2782
01:29:48,422 --> 01:29:50,092
- Let's begin. - Okay.

2783
01:29:50,292 --> 01:29:52,091
- Start. - It's over.

2784
01:29:52,092 --> 01:29:53,132
Here I go.

2785
01:29:53,962 --> 01:29:57,232
(DinDin, please win again.)

2786
01:29:57,302 --> 01:29:58,531
Cham, Cham, Cham.

2787
01:29:58,532 --> 01:30:00,572
(Unlike the promise, DinDin went left.)

2788
01:30:01,172 --> 01:30:03,572
(What about Director Joo?)

2789
01:30:03,772 --> 01:30:05,111
Cham, Cham, Cham.

2790
01:30:05,112 --> 01:30:07,512
(DinDin wins.)

2791
01:30:08,142 --> 01:30:09,581
(I can't believe this.)

2792
01:30:09,582 --> 01:30:10,752
He lost again.

2793
01:30:11,682 --> 01:30:14,181
- I enjoyed it a lot. - Unbelievable.

2794
01:30:14,182 --> 01:30:15,458
(I enjoyed the sweet taste of victory.)

2795
01:30:15,482 --> 01:30:17,291
- Yes! - It's over. I told you.

2796
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:18,321
(He's the strongest Cham, Cham, Cham player.)

2797
01:30:18,322 --> 01:30:19,721
- Hey! - Unbelievable.

2798
01:30:19,722 --> 01:30:21,821
He's not good at this.

2799
01:30:21,822 --> 01:30:23,368
(Thanks to DinDin, no one will be left behind on the next trip.)

2800
01:30:23,392 --> 01:30:25,232
I really want to win at least once.

2801
01:30:25,262 --> 01:30:26,761
- Good. - Is this the last round?

2802
01:30:26,762 --> 01:30:28,532
Yes. This is...

2803
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:31,331
the last round that will determine...

2804
01:30:31,332 --> 01:30:33,541
the amount of a meal on your next trip.

2805
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:34,942
- The amount of a meal? - Yes.

2806
01:30:35,302 --> 01:30:37,011
- Please bring it in. - We decide on that already?

2807
01:30:37,012 --> 01:30:39,172
- Will there be only one meal? - The amount of a meal?

2808
01:30:40,312 --> 01:30:41,312
What's that?

2809
01:30:42,112 --> 01:30:43,482
That darn pirate.

2810
01:30:44,682 --> 01:30:46,451
Now, you will stab the knives in...

2811
01:30:46,452 --> 01:30:48,482
- while alternating the colors. - Okay.

2812
01:30:49,322 --> 01:30:52,092
(Fasting, eating plenty)

2813
01:30:52,792 --> 01:30:54,021
(Fasting?)

2814
01:30:54,022 --> 01:30:55,561
- Are you shocked? - Yes, I'm shocked.

2815
01:30:55,562 --> 01:30:57,562
I've never skipped a meal in my entire life.

2816
01:30:57,962 --> 01:30:59,531
- I'm serious. - What about a medical check-up?

2817
01:30:59,532 --> 01:31:01,102
(Me neither.)

2818
01:31:01,132 --> 01:31:02,901
Even if we get fasting, we shouldn't blame each other.

2819
01:31:02,902 --> 01:31:04,671
- Because this is... - Come on.

2820
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:06,571
- We have to. - We have to blame him for sure.

2821
01:31:06,572 --> 01:31:08,541
If you don't want us to blame you, you should do it alone at home.

2822
01:31:08,542 --> 01:31:10,171
You will have to keep using the red ones...

2823
01:31:10,172 --> 01:31:11,471
because we're an even number.

2824
01:31:11,472 --> 01:31:12,841
Red, yellow, red, yellow,

2825
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:13,941
- red, yellow... - You're smart.

2826
01:31:13,942 --> 01:31:15,281
- That's why I'm saying this. - You're right.

2827
01:31:15,282 --> 01:31:16,441
We still should blame him.

2828
01:31:16,442 --> 01:31:17,711
- Well... - No, let's just do this.

2829
01:31:17,712 --> 01:31:18,951
- Let's not blame each other. - Okay.

2830
01:31:18,952 --> 01:31:20,981
- All right. Here I go. - Red.

2831
01:31:20,982 --> 01:31:21,982
We should eat a lot.

2832
01:31:21,983 --> 01:31:23,791
- Red first? - I'll put it in here.

2833
01:31:23,792 --> 01:31:24,992
- Let's go. - Okay.

2834
01:31:25,552 --> 01:31:27,621
- Can I do it right away? - Wait in the back.

2835
01:31:27,622 --> 01:31:29,391
- Yes. Push it hard. - I'll finish it right away.

2836
01:31:29,392 --> 01:31:30,808
It will be amazing if you finish it.

2837
01:31:30,832 --> 01:31:32,062
Too bad.

2838
01:31:34,002 --> 01:31:36,031
(Se Yoon passes.)

2839
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:37,871
- Do you want to go first? - Just do it right away.

2840
01:31:37,872 --> 01:31:38,872
Red...

2841
01:31:39,102 --> 01:31:41,702
- What? - What?

2842
01:31:41,942 --> 01:31:43,172
Just do it right away.

2843
01:31:43,272 --> 01:31:44,671
(As he put it in nonchalantly, )

2844
01:31:44,672 --> 01:31:49,181
(the pirate popped out right away.)

2845
01:31:49,182 --> 01:31:50,811
- Joon. - What?

2846
01:31:50,812 --> 01:31:52,781
(Hurray for Lee Joon!)

2847
01:31:52,782 --> 01:31:54,321
- Nice. - We will get to eat a lot.

2848
01:31:54,322 --> 01:31:57,191
- It's eating plenty. - My goodness.

2849
01:31:57,192 --> 01:31:58,291
(He's happy even when he falls since he gets to eat a lot.)

2850
01:31:58,292 --> 01:31:59,751
- What? - It's unbelievable.

2851
01:31:59,752 --> 01:32:01,262
- Well done, Joon. - This is great.

2852
01:32:01,662 --> 01:32:03,361
Joon saved my life.

2853
01:32:03,362 --> 01:32:05,262
- My gosh. - Joon, I can't skip a meal.

2854
01:32:05,462 --> 01:32:07,862
- He's amazing. - What just happened?

2855
01:32:08,162 --> 01:32:10,732
Come to think of it, all of us did a good job.

2856
01:32:11,102 --> 01:32:12,672
But only Se Yoon...

2857
01:32:13,132 --> 01:32:15,201
(Today's number 1 enemy)

2858
01:32:15,202 --> 01:32:17,511
- Can I try it again? - What did you do?

2859
01:32:17,512 --> 01:32:19,041
- Just once. - If we didn't pick 300km,

2860
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:20,042
it would've been perfect.

2861
01:32:20,043 --> 01:32:22,781
I mean, he hit 100km at first.

2862
01:32:22,782 --> 01:32:25,082
We will be really tired if we leave early in the morning.

2863
01:32:25,282 --> 01:32:26,381
Look at him.

2864
01:32:26,382 --> 01:32:27,781
What did you do?

2865
01:32:27,782 --> 01:32:28,881
(Yes, it's all my fault.)

2866
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:29,922
All right.

2867
01:32:30,222 --> 01:32:32,992
Everyone, I'll announce the results of What's Next.

2868
01:32:33,092 --> 01:32:34,121
(Going to the sea...)

2869
01:32:34,122 --> 01:32:35,891
(more than 300km away from Seoul)

2870
01:32:35,892 --> 01:32:38,462
(Eating a full meal without anyone left behind)

2871
01:32:38,562 --> 01:32:40,061
All six of us will get to eat a lot, right?

2872
01:32:40,062 --> 01:32:41,601
- Of course. - We will see.

2873
01:32:41,602 --> 01:32:42,901
- What? - Come on.

2874
01:32:42,902 --> 01:32:44,201
- What are you talking about? - That's ridiculous.

2875
01:32:44,202 --> 01:32:45,332
What's wrong with you?

2876
01:32:45,472 --> 01:32:47,772
You don't keep your promise at all.

2877
01:32:48,102 --> 01:32:49,402
Just let us eat.

2878
01:32:49,972 --> 01:32:51,572
(Flustered)

2879
01:32:52,142 --> 01:32:54,512
They do look like a dad and a kid.

2880
01:32:56,682 --> 01:32:58,411
- Then... - All six of you will get to eat.

2881
01:32:58,412 --> 01:33:00,421
- Okay. - Let's do that.

2882
01:33:00,422 --> 01:33:02,221
He hurt his leg, so he can't go far.

2883
01:33:02,222 --> 01:33:04,252
I think I hurt my leg again yesterday.

2884
01:33:04,752 --> 01:33:06,591
While I was asleep... I can't even get in my car.

2885
01:33:06,592 --> 01:33:07,791
I can't bend my leg.

2886
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:10,191
- Then I'll call Dex. - You just bent it.

2887
01:33:10,192 --> 01:33:12,031
See? I can bend my legs well now.

2888
01:33:12,032 --> 01:33:13,161
(He becomes fine as soon as Dex is mentioned.)

2889
01:33:13,162 --> 01:33:15,031
It's a miraculous treatment.

2890
01:33:15,032 --> 01:33:17,572
- Right. That was my idea. - As soon as you mentioned Dex...

2891
01:33:17,802 --> 01:33:19,672
He doesn't even go on his honeymoon.

2892
01:33:19,972 --> 01:33:21,672
Gosh, look at this.

2893
01:33:22,172 --> 01:33:23,571
- This is amazing. - Right.

2894
01:33:23,572 --> 01:33:25,271
- It's Dex medicine. - Dex medicine.

2895
01:33:25,272 --> 01:33:26,471
- My gosh. - Okay.

2896
01:33:26,472 --> 01:33:29,281
- I'll see you next week. - Okay. Thank you.

2897
01:33:29,282 --> 01:33:30,381
(The negotiation on the next trip is over.)

2898
01:33:30,382 --> 01:33:32,282
(Next episode)

2899
01:33:32,412 --> 01:33:33,682
The theme of today's trip is...

2900
01:33:33,882 --> 01:33:35,081
(When Life Gives You Age)

2901
01:33:35,082 --> 01:33:36,482
(With 6 Jong Mins)

2902
01:33:36,822 --> 01:33:38,322
(6 Jong Mins?)

2903
01:33:38,722 --> 01:33:40,362
(Are we supposed to become Jong Min?)

2904
01:33:41,592 --> 01:33:42,992
(Transformed right away)

2905
01:33:43,092 --> 01:33:44,131
No way.

2906
01:33:44,132 --> 01:33:45,162
Kim Jong Min.

2907
01:33:45,262 --> 01:33:48,102
(Guess who is Jong Min.)

2908
01:33:49,232 --> 01:33:52,102
(A cool showdown...)

2909
01:33:52,872 --> 01:33:56,772
(with their age at stake)

2910
01:33:57,442 --> 01:33:59,972
(Strange things that happened to 6 Jong Mins)

2911
01:34:00,212 --> 01:34:02,342
My gosh. Look at him.
