1
00:00:00,688 --> 00:00:05,288
(It's a rainy morning.)

2
00:00:05,898 --> 00:00:08,218
(Where will we go, accompanied by the music of raindrops?)

3
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:13,268
(Yeosu, South Jeolla Province)

4
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:14,898
(Today's opening location)

5
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:17,208
- Isn't this a castle?
- It's amazing.

6
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:18,728
- This place...
- The view...

7
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:20,738
It's picturesque.

8
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:22,907
- It's a piece of art.
- It's like art.

9
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:23,948
(Before us...)

10
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:29,488
(is Jangdo Island, the island of art.)

11
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:32,017
(It's known for Jinseom Bridge...)

12
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:34,517
(which gets submerged during the high tide.)

13
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:36,827
There's a sheet of mist.

14
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,228
- Yes.
- That's mist.

15
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:39,528
This is awesome.

16
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:41,228
- What is that?
- It's amazing.

17
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:42,727
It's like a noir movie.

18
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:44,368
- It's so beautiful.
- It's incredible.

19
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:46,238
Shall we run over?

20
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:47,767
- Let's run.
- Good luck!

21
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:49,108
- Let's run!
- Go for it!

22
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:51,267
(They're full of energy this morning.)

23
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:52,907
- Come on!
- Let's do this!

24
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:54,138
- Get over here.
- My gosh.

25
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:56,078
They're like this when the chief's around.

26
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:57,878
The chief's here?

27
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:59,018
- Come on.
- Where is he?

28
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:00,118
Since the chief's here,

29
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,247
- let's show our commitment.
- Gather round.

30
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:02,248
- Come on.
- Okay.

31
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:03,248
- One, two.
- One, two.

32
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:04,748
(They're fired up for once.)

33
00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:07,517
- Jump, Sae Ho!
- Jump.

34
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:09,227
- I apologize.
- Jump.

35
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:10,558
Something bad happens if I jump.

36
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:11,688
- Hang on.
- It'll be...

37
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:12,697
- really bad.
- Sae Ho is...

38
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:13,698
I apologize.

39
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,527
The Korean entertainment world is in trouble.

40
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:17,528
- Why?
- It's Code Red.

41
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:18,528
- It's an emergency.
- Why?

42
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:20,297
- The country's in uproar.
- It's an emergency.

43
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:21,397
- It's Sae Ho.
- Yes.

44
00:01:21,398 --> 00:01:22,767
- For real?
- He's greatly injured,

45
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:23,807
and yet, he came here.

46
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:25,308
No, I should be here.

47
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:26,537
- Good for you.
- Recently,

48
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:28,508
my immune system took a hit.

49
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:32,578
My lymph gland here got badly infected.

50
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:36,347
I got surgery on it last Wednesday.

51
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:38,017
- Really?
- That's two days ago.

52
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:39,387
Yes, two days ago.

53
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:40,388
You didn't have to come, then.

54
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:41,518
- No.
- A good rest...

55
00:01:41,658 --> 00:01:43,027
- If I missed a trip, - Today...

56
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:44,288
something worse might happen.

57
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:45,657
During today's opening,

58
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:47,658
Sae Ho was supposed to get dunked.

59
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:48,728
- Yes.
- Right!

60
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:49,728
- Hey!
- Then...

61
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,289
- He was to take a dive.
- That's true.

62
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:53,798
(During the previous shoot)

63
00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:57,738
(I'll dive in on my own that morning!)

64
00:01:58,238 --> 00:01:59,707
(They organized a mission...)

65
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,228
(to decide whether Sae Ho would dive.)

66
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:04,178
(But he failed the mission.)

67
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:07,218
(It was decided that Sae Ho would dive alone.)

68
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:09,817
- He was to dive if he got it wrong.
- Yes.

69
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:10,917
- What now?
- Then...

70
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:12,087
the sea's right there.

71
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:13,787
Won't the seawater sanitize his wound?

72
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:15,888
- I can't get the wound wet.
- Oh, really?

73
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:19,128
I promise to keep my end of the deal.

74
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:21,828
Then how about I hold your lower body...

75
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:23,427
and dunk you like this?

76
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,637
That can be done.

77
00:02:25,638 --> 00:02:26,667
- I can do that.
- Okay.

78
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:27,668
That's on.

79
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,767
- He's a true entertainer.
- As long as this part is dry,

80
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:30,937
I don't mind a dunk.

81
00:02:30,938 --> 00:02:33,407
If there are any penalties during today's games,

82
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:35,848
- we can take them for him.
- Of course.

83
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:37,047
(Very touched)

84
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:38,377
- Again?
- We'll keep...

85
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:40,077
Sae Ho's condition in mind today...

86
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,947
- as we manage the program.
- Thank you.

87
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:43,648
You won't say you'll let him forfeit.

88
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:46,287
Okay, everyone. Today's destination...

89
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:47,987
(Today's destination)

90
00:02:47,988 --> 00:02:50,288
is a city of romantic islands dotted in the sea.

91
00:02:51,058 --> 00:02:52,327
It's Yeosu in South Jeolla Province.

92
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:53,658
- Oh, Yeosu.
- Yeosu.

93
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:57,798
You can come by plane or train.

94
00:02:58,298 --> 00:03:00,738
(It's a hot destination for travelers who prefer to walk.)

95
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:02,838
It's famous for its good food.

96
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:05,308
Foreigners say it's their favorite place.

97
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:07,478
I'm getting excited about the food.

98
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:10,047
For today's trip, you'll be in teams of three.

99
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:11,108
Really? Two teams?

100
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:13,818
Se Yoon, DinDin, Seon Ho are Team Pink.

101
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,148
Team Pink.

102
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,647
Jong Min, Sae Ho, Joon are Team Blue.

103
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:18,687
- Team Blue.
- Yes.

104
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:19,817
- Good.
- Team Pink, Team Blue.

105
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:21,487
Real men like pink.

106
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:22,528
- Okay.
- Come in.

107
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,027
- What?
- Tug of war...

108
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:26,128
- in the morning?
- Gosh.

109
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:27,457
We'll play tug of war?

110
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,858
Tug of war in the morning?

111
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:31,567
- Aren't we at a disadvantage?
- Listen.

112
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:32,837
Sae Ho's injured,

113
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,037
so someone from Team Pink must step out as well.

114
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:36,538
- Se Yoon!
- Who do you want out?

115
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:37,668
- Se Yoon!
- Se Yoon!

116
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:38,837
I'll step out.

117
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:39,977
- What?
- Why you?

118
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:42,607
- Sae Ho and I are the same height.
- Can't we decide?

119
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:44,648
Se Yoon can play alone and beat us all.

120
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,277
Are you that unsure of your muscles?

121
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:47,318
- Yes.
- Yes.

122
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:49,248
I'm old.

123
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:50,947
- How old are you?
- I'm 47.

124
00:03:50,948 --> 00:03:52,188
Am I that much younger?

125
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:53,757
- I'm 44, you know.
- Listen.

126
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:54,758
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

127
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,257
- How?
- What are the rules?

128
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:57,587
- What are we playing for?
- If we win,

129
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:58,787
we decide who steps out.

130
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,598
We should play, honestly.

131
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:03,398
If you're that concerned, I'll just join in.

132
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:05,548
I don't care if my wound bursts open.

133
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:07,198
Can't we just play?

134
00:04:07,738 --> 00:04:08,897
- I'll try.
- Watch out.

135
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:10,638
It's like he's making me feel guilty.

136
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:14,038
I'll just play and end up bleeding profusely.

137
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:15,407
- What now?
- Okay, let's just play.

138
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:16,477
- You'll play?
- Okay.

139
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,548
- Okay.
- Okay.

140
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:18,877
(It's settled then.)

141
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:20,148
Are you ready now?

142
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:21,317
- Yes.
- Just lean back.

143
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:22,447
- Everyone.
- Lean back?

144
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:24,088
- Okay.
- The mission is...

145
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:26,118
the 3-on-3 tug of war.

146
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:28,387
(It's 3-on-3?)

147
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:29,888
But why are there only two of us?

148
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:31,457
- Why are we doing it then?
- Do I count for two people?

149
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,804
- Do I count for two people?
- What...

150
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:34,427
- All right. Come on in!
- What?

151
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:36,428
- What?
- Who's coming in?

152
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:39,438
- What's going on?
- What?

153
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:40,868
- Sang Yi.
- Everyone.

154
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:44,068
(We've been keeping the identity of today's guests confidential.)

155
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:47,638
(Curious)

156
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:55,478
- What's going on?
- What?

157
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:56,648
(Who are they?)

158
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:07,458
(Park Bo Gum)

159
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:11,728
(Lee Sang Yi)

160
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:15,038
(They've come to our show.)

161
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:17,068
Sang Yi.

162
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:20,178
(Amazed)

163
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:22,008
(A surge of attention)

164
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:24,178
(Tiptoeing to see them is a bonus.)

165
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:30,048
(Bo Gum and Sang Yi will join our trip today.)

166
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:31,588
(He can't believe his eyes.)

167
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:32,669
(What are they doing here?)

168
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:33,887
(They still haven't figured out what's happening.)

169
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:36,057
All right, everyone. The match will begin.

170
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:37,427
- Bo Gum, join Team Pink.
- What?

171
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:39,228
- Sang Yi, join Team Blue.
- What's going on?

172
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:42,157
(The two of them were taking their time to walk over.)

173
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:43,197
Bo Gum, join Team Pink.

174
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:44,998
- Sang Yi, join Team Blue.
- What's going on?

175
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,667
- Park Bo Gum.
- What?

176
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:47,868
- What's going on?
- What?

177
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:50,318
(The two of them were taking their time to walk over.)

178
00:05:50,673 --> 00:05:51,673
Join Team Pink.

179
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:53,474
- Sang Yi, join Team Blue.
- What's going on?

180
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:55,082
- Park Bo Gum.
- What?

181
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,283
- What's going on?
- What?

182
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,083
(Park Bo Gum?)

183
00:05:58,084 --> 00:05:59,523
- Gosh, Bo Gum.
- It's Park Bo Gum.

184
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:01,552
- Right here.
- What's going on?

185
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:03,523
- Pull.
- Wait. He needs to put on gloves.

186
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:06,893
(Bo Gum gets ready to pull although he's flustered.)

187
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:10,092
(Puzzled Sang Yi joins Team Blue.)

188
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:11,292
- What?
- Hello.

189
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:12,832
- What's going on?
- He needs to put on gloves.

190
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,032
- What's going on?
- Give him the gloves.

191
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,603
- Sang Yi.
- What's going on?

192
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:16,879
- Right here.
- What's going on?

193
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:20,243
(It's total chaos.)

194
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:21,373
My gosh.

195
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:23,312
- Park Bo Gum...
- What? What's going on?

196
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:24,313
(What's happening?)

197
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:26,283
- Bo Gum is my phone wallpaper.
- What?

198
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:27,682
Park Bo Gum is in Yeosu.

199
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:28,683
- Gosh.
- What are you doing here?

200
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:30,652
- Bo Gum, you're my wallpaper.
- Here. Put these on.

201
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:32,022
- My gosh.
- Hey, hurry up and pull.

202
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:33,353
- Pull.
- Wait.

203
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:34,683
- Hello.
- Hello.

204
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,752
- Get ready, - My gosh. Over there.

205
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:37,822
- set...
- Just pull.

206
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,163
- All right.
- Here.

207
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:40,563
- Set...
- Just pull.

208
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:41,722
- Pull.
- Let's go.

209
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:43,263
(Tugging)

210
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:44,663
(Whistling)

211
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:46,433
- Let's go.
- Pull.

212
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:48,103
- Pull.
- No.

213
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:50,833
- We have to lean back.
- My gosh.

214
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,072
- We have to lean back.
- Pull.

215
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:53,372
(Sang Yi suddenly lies down, and the other two are dragged.)

216
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:54,503
- Hold on.
- Pull.

217
00:06:54,903 --> 00:06:55,913
- My goodness.
- Pull.

218
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:57,242
(At the end of the rope, )

219
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:58,243
- Hold on.
- What is this?

220
00:06:58,244 --> 00:06:59,282
Pull.

221
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,283
(there's Moon Se Yoon.)

222
00:07:02,853 --> 00:07:05,623
(And Bo Gum is just having fun.)

223
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,382
(Clearly, Team Pink is winning.)

224
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:09,393
- Pull.
- What?

225
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:11,722
(Way to go, guys!)

226
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,693
- We have to lean back.
- My gosh.

227
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:15,162
- We have to lean back.
- We can't lose.

228
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:16,432
(Why does he keep lying down?)

229
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,563
- Hold on.
- What is this?

230
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:19,762
(Team Blue goes past the centerline.)

231
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:20,763
(Whistling)

232
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:23,402
- Hold on.
- What is this?

233
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:24,602
(Wrecked)

234
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:25,843
- Gosh, Se Yoon...
- Well...

235
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:26,943
- You know...
- Gosh.

236
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:27,943
(Hello)

237
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:31,143
- It's over.
- What is this?

238
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:32,742
- Bo Gum.
- What's going on?

239
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,482
- Hello.
- What's going on?

240
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:35,512
- Hello.
- What's going on?

241
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:36,553
- Hello.
- Hello.

242
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:38,252
- You came all the way to Yeosu?
- What?

243
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:40,023
- Yeosu...
- Oh, my.

244
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,453
- What? They suddenly showed up.
- Well...

245
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:43,952
- Everyone.
- What are they doing here?

246
00:07:43,953 --> 00:07:45,292
- This is...
- I bet you guys are surprised.

247
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:46,969
- What brings you all the way here?
- My gosh.

248
00:07:46,993 --> 00:07:47,993
- Everyone.
- Look.

249
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:50,333
They're our travel buddies who will join us on this trip.

250
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:51,632
- Really?
- I present you Park Bo Gum...

251
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:53,002
- and Lee Sang Yi.
- My gosh.

252
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:54,962
(Lee Sang Yi and Park Bo Gum)

253
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:56,102
- Hello.
- Hello.

254
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:57,303
- My gosh.
- Nice to meet you.

255
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:01,202
(They didn't see this coming at all.)

256
00:08:01,203 --> 00:08:03,243
Why? Why are they joining us?

257
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:04,572
- Why?
- They'll join us from the start?

258
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:05,613
- Right.
- Why?

259
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:08,282
You already met on "The Seasons: Cantabile of Park Bo Gum."

260
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:09,812
- We met him before.
- When I was on the show,

261
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:12,722
I actively sought after him on stage.

262
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:14,383
- I asked him...
- Okay.

263
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:17,022
To join our show if he had some free time.

264
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:18,052
- Really?
- Really?

265
00:08:18,053 --> 00:08:19,292
And you decided to come.

266
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:20,562
- Really?
- He joined us pretty fast.

267
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:21,892
- Really?
- That's why you're here?

268
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:22,962
Is he really here because you asked him?

269
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:24,563
I can't be the reason he's here, though.

270
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:26,132
I really enjoyed...

271
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,533
"Mix Rice with Moon Se Yoon."

272
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:29,073
- Really?
- Yes.

273
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:31,472
- "Mix Rice with Moon Se Yoon."
- My gosh.

274
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:32,642
"Mix Rice with Moon Se Yoon." See?

275
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:34,372
- That was good, right?
- It really was.

276
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:35,772
Right. Park Bo Gum and Moon Se Yoon.

277
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:37,673
- We could combine our shows.
- I like it.

278
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:41,142
(Here's how Bo Gum decided to star in 2 Days 1 Night.)

279
00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:44,312
(It was about two months ago.)

280
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:45,682
("The Seasons: Cantabile of Park Bo Gum")

281
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:47,252
(It was during Drifting Around KBS which aired on March 16.)

282
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:48,852
(Park Bo Gum?)

283
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:49,853
(It's the rival show of that.)

284
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:53,693
(There was a segment for "Mix Rice with Moon Se Yoon.")

285
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:55,292
(Two days after the episode aired)

286
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:56,462
(The filming day of "The Seasons: Cantabile of Park Bo Gum")

287
00:08:56,463 --> 00:08:57,562
Thank you.

288
00:08:57,563 --> 00:08:58,732
- Seriously.
- Congratulations.

289
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,102
I'll treat you guys.

290
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:01,232
(The staff went to show their support...)

291
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:02,873
(for ChoNam Zone's comeback performance.)

292
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,332
(Then the staff ran into...)

293
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,902
(Park Bo Gum in the hallway by chance.)

294
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:07,572
- I wanted to give this to you.
- This?

295
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:08,702
- Yes.
- I enjoyed...

296
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:09,863
"Mix Rice with Moon Se Yoon."

297
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:11,673
This is Bo Gum.

298
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:13,212
- Thank you.
- My gosh.

299
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:14,342
"Mix Rice with Moon Se Yoon."

300
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:15,882
(On top of that...)

301
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:16,982
(He'll be on 2 Days 1 Night to take down "Mix Rice.")

302
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:18,452
(The staff got shocking news while filming "The Seasons.")

303
00:09:18,453 --> 00:09:19,722
(My gosh, thank you. That's amazing news.)

304
00:09:19,723 --> 00:09:21,122
(Staff)

305
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:22,552
(He'll be on 2 Days 1 Night to take down "Mix Rice.")

306
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:27,122
(The staff got the news that Bo Gum wanted to star on the show.)

307
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:32,203
(Yang Gwan Sik wants to join our show?)

308
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:35,932
(The staff wouldn't miss a golden opportunity like this.)

309
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,272
(Taking a picture to leave as evidence)

310
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,642
(Making an offer)

311
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:41,163
(Please come and join 2 Days 1 Night.)

312
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:44,413
(As it so happens, his drama is about to premiere.)

313
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:48,143
(He gladly agreed to join our show.)

314
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:51,282
(His colleague from "Good Boy," Sang Yi, will join us too.)

315
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:52,323
- Hello.
- Hello.

316
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,682
I'm Park Bo Gum of "Good Boy."

317
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:54,723
I'm Lee Sang Yi.

318
00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:57,322
- For the drama.
- They're in the drama together.

319
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:59,022
There were news articles about their upcoming drama.

320
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:00,023
- My gosh.
- "Good Boy."

321
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:02,039
It's about detectives who used to be national athletes.

322
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:03,063
Right.

323
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:05,292
- And they'll be chasing criminals.
- Really?

324
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:06,732
- Isn't it an action drama?
- It is.

325
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:07,733
My gosh.

326
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:09,503
I wanted to hear the introduction from them.

327
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,509
You're unbelievable. We knew that too.

328
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:12,542
- Then...
- We were holding ourselves back.

329
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:14,379
- go ahead and introduce it.
- It's an action drama, right?

330
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:15,813
Could you tell us about the drama?

331
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:18,043
(Chuckling)

332
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:19,813
So in our drama, "Good Boy,"

333
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:22,983
former gold medalists from the national teams...

334
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:25,012
were recruited by the police as special hires.

335
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:26,822
And they take down criminals to uphold justice.

336
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:28,552
(Medalists who became police officers as special hires...)

337
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:30,192
(will fight the evils of the world...)

338
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:32,069
(in this young adult detective drama with full of comedy and action.)

339
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:34,622
(Please show your support for the drama.)

340
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,562
- Wasn't Bo Gum on our show before?
- I see.

341
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:37,632
- He was on our show before.
- Right.

342
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:39,202
- Right.
- I heard it's been nine years...

343
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,839
- That's right.
- I almost died because of him.

344
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:42,332
- Why?
- Why?

345
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,333
That's true.

346
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:45,872
Right? Didn't you fall into the water or something? What was it?

347
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:47,002
- No.
- Back then,

348
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:48,173
there was an amusement ride.

349
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:50,483
- Jong Min can't ride it.
- He rode it with me.

350
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:52,172
- Really?
- Which ride was it?

351
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:53,813
- He never gets on those rides.
- Really?

352
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:56,653
(It was 9 years ago on 2 Days 1 Night.)

353
00:10:57,153 --> 00:11:01,283
(The 24-year-old Bo Gum wanted to ride it with him.)

354
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:05,422
(Jong Min was persuaded by Bo Gum.)

355
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:08,893
(Falling)

356
00:11:09,263 --> 00:11:10,263
(Screaming)

357
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:12,333
(He experienced a thrilling ride thanks to Bo Gum.)

358
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:15,363
Bo Gum wanted it so badly.

359
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:17,132
I never ride it no matter who asks.

360
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,803
You never ride it no matter who asks you.

361
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:20,103
- My gosh.
- Back then...

362
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:22,203
- So you'll stay with us...
- Okay.

363
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:24,343
- until tomorrow?
- Yes.

364
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:25,759
- Really?
- Really? You'll sleep with us?

365
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:27,012
- Really?
- Really?

366
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:28,142
- Yes.
- I was told we would.

367
00:11:28,143 --> 00:11:29,282
- Really?
- Really?

368
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:30,883
- Really?
- You'll make them suffer?

369
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:33,523
- Why did you join us this early?
- Why?

370
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:35,282
- You've experienced how it is.
- Yes.

371
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:36,652
It might take a toll on you...

372
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:37,992
- physically.
- Yes.

373
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:40,822
You won't look this nice in a few hours.

374
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:41,862
Are you okay with that?

375
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:43,469
- I am curious about this, though.
- Okay.

376
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:44,762
Will Bo Gum still look handsome...

377
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:46,132
after filming an episode of our show?

378
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:47,532
Right. For example,

379
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,332
- we might be on a mudflat.
- My gosh.

380
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,693
I think he'll still look handsome.

381
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:54,003
(5 hours later, )

382
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:57,613
(10 hours later, )

383
00:11:58,443 --> 00:12:01,343
(or even 13 hours later, his handsome face will survive.)

384
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:05,923
(The handsome guy's 2 Days 1 Night is coming soon.)

385
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:09,853
Sang Yi. As soon as you came, you had to put on gloves.

386
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:12,492
- This...
- The gloves are all ripped.

387
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:13,493
(Tattered)

388
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:15,192
- I put them on. Just now...
- Really?

389
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,162
When you grabbed the rope, you reminded me of these two.

390
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:19,462
- Gosh, no.
- Sang Yi. Did you...

391
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:20,562
- not use your power on purpose?
- Seriously.

392
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:23,403
I was really good at this game from elementary to high school.

393
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:25,102
My gym teacher always told me this.

394
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:27,502
"Grab the rope and lean back. Then you'll win."

395
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:29,012
- The weight will shift to our head.
- Okay.

396
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:30,113
So I did.

397
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:31,943
You were dragged on your back.

398
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:34,683
(Sang Yi rolled around on the ground.)

399
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:36,983
It was because of Se Yoon. It was just impossible.

400
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:38,182
- Was there...
- We had no chance.

401
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:39,983
A present at stake on this game?

402
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:42,452
- A harsh penalty will await us.
- We tried our best because...

403
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:44,152
they might feed the winning team or something.

404
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:45,692
Sang Yi is super busy these days.

405
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:47,162
- He's filming "Bloodhounds 2."
- Right.

406
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,192
- Really?
- And...

407
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:49,592
- "Good Boy" is about to premiere.
- Well...

408
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:50,892
- He's so busy.
- Yes, we know.

409
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:53,502
Then you must be physically exhausted these days.

410
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:54,503
I'm really hungry.

411
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:55,503
- Really?
- My gosh.

412
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:59,072
I'm quite serious about the games and determined when it comes...

413
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:00,833
- You must be feeling determined.
- to food.

414
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,843
As you saw me play the tug of war,

415
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:04,412
I'm ready to do my best.

416
00:13:04,413 --> 00:13:05,783
(Sang Yi declared to do his best.)

417
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:08,542
(I got it!)

418
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:09,552
Okay.

419
00:13:09,553 --> 00:13:11,883
(Are you going to cheat?)

420
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:16,253
(Eager to win the games)

421
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:17,593
(IA!)

422
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:19,593
(I want an iced Americano.)

423
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:22,763
(Determined for food)

424
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:27,263
(And his desperation for food)

425
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:30,533
(Please...)

426
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,203
- Hey, he got it.
- He looks like him.

427
00:13:34,803 --> 00:13:37,843
(He's going to show us various sides of him.)

428
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:40,913
(Please look forward to his participation.)

429
00:13:41,243 --> 00:13:42,843
- Did you guys eat before this?
- Right.

430
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:44,053
I had an energy bar.

431
00:13:44,513 --> 00:13:45,799
- This might be tough on him then.
- Gosh, no.

432
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:47,699
- Gosh. What do we do? We...
- That's not good.

433
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:49,769
- We have to get food for him.
- You're my senior alumnus.

434
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,093
- Really?
- Yes!

435
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:53,192
- We went to the same college.
- That's right.

436
00:13:53,193 --> 00:13:54,193
- Really?
- Yes.

437
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:55,322
- You went to the same college.
- We went to the same college.

438
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:57,139
- Korea National University of Arts?
- We went to the same college. Yes.

439
00:13:57,163 --> 00:13:58,193
I was a freshman in 2007.

440
00:13:58,263 --> 00:13:59,562
- In 2007?
- I was a freshman in 2010.

441
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:01,232
- You were 3 years ahead of me.
- He was 3 years ahead of you.

442
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,033
- So...
- If he was a freshman in 2010,

443
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:04,232
- Yes?
- he and I...

444
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,702
You and I are the same age. Weren't you born in 1991?

445
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,303
- Right.
- The Year of the Sheep, right?

446
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:08,502
- The Year of the Sheep.
- You should talk casually.

447
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:10,472
Why don't you say hello to him and tell how cute he is?

448
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:11,912
- You can check out his head.
- Here's why.

449
00:14:11,913 --> 00:14:13,182
- DinDin likes that.
- He looks so short.

450
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:14,643
Hey, we need a nice shot of that.

451
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:16,489
Just one picture. What's so bad about it?

452
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:17,712
Pat him on the head later. He likes that.

453
00:14:17,713 --> 00:14:18,882
As I told you,

454
00:14:18,883 --> 00:14:20,782
Yeosu is known as the city of gastronomy.

455
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:21,783
- Right.
- We have to eat some food.

456
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:23,153
According to our sources,

457
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:25,892
- they love food.
- Really?

458
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:27,023
- So...
- Yes.

459
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:28,522
With the theme of today's trip,

460
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:30,793
you'll get to try different dishes from Yeosu.

461
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:32,803
It's called the Food Boy Special.

462
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:34,733
- Food Boy?
- Food Boy?

463
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:36,632
(Lightening up)

464
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:37,633
- Food Boy.
- Food Boy.

465
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:38,879
- Food Boy.
- I love the title. Food Boy.

466
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:40,772
(They will turn into Food Boys from Good Boys.)

467
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:42,613
- I love the title. Food Boy.
- Food Boy.

468
00:14:42,873 --> 00:14:45,943
All right. We will reveal the menu for today's lunch first.

469
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:48,813
The first dish you will try in Yeosu is...

470
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,153
an extravagant delicacy that's in season now.

471
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:53,823
It's pike conger shabu shabu.

472
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:55,552
- That sounds good.
- Pike conger shabu shabu?

473
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:56,992
- They are in season now.
- Pike congers?

474
00:14:56,993 --> 00:14:58,893
It's a seasonal delicacy. We must eat them now.

475
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:04,233
(We'll also give you pike conger sashimi.)

476
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,932
The team with the higher score...

477
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,693
will be able to eat pike conger shabu shabu.

478
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,773
You already formed your teams when you played the tug of war.

479
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:13,042
Bo Gum, Se Yoon, DinDin,

480
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,802
- and Seon Ho will form a team.
- I see. Like this?

481
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:15,872
- Okay.
- And...

482
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,612
Sang Yi, Jong Min, Sae Ho, and Joon...

483
00:15:17,613 --> 00:15:19,382
will travel together as a team.

484
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:20,582
- Okay.
- Great.

485
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,552
Team Bo Gum won the first mission.

486
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:23,852
- We won.
- Team Bo Gum...

487
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:24,983
will get 100 points.

488
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,752
Let's get on the bus and head out together.

489
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:28,753
- Okay. Let's go.
- Yes.

490
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:30,293
(They go to the next spot together.)

491
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:35,392
(And there's a short break.)

492
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,093
- My gosh.
- I'm a huge fan.

493
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,463
- This feels surreal, Seon Ho.
- Seriously.

494
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,003
I can't believe...

495
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:42,279
- my character is your wallpaper.
- Right.

496
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:43,772
- I really liked the drama.
- Thank you.

497
00:15:43,773 --> 00:15:44,803
Thank you.

498
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:47,602
- I can't wait to work with you.
- Same here.

499
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:49,372
(Getting along well)

500
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:50,613
It's going to be fun today.

501
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:52,489
- Right. My gosh.
- This will be fun.

502
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:53,513
- Gosh.
- It's good to see you.

503
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:54,912
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

504
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:55,982
What should we do?

505
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:57,283
- You know how it goes.
- Okay.

506
00:15:57,453 --> 00:15:58,653
Just be yourself.

507
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:05,653
(Bo Gum and Sang Yi...)

508
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:08,123
(Making a peace sign)

509
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:09,463
Can I get three mochi?

510
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:14,163
(They blended in little by little.)

511
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:16,773
(Plums)

512
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:22,042
(Not threatening at all)

513
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:23,043
(Screaming)

514
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:24,573
(Screaming)

515
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,043
(Bo Gum, why are you so excited?)

516
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:31,683
(The quickest integration into the group)

517
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:39,493
(The quickest integration into the group)

518
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:42,322
(If you're curious about their Yeosu trip, )

519
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:43,692
- 2 Days 1 Night.
- 2 Days 1 Night.

520
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:45,333
(make sure to watch the show.)

521
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,933
- Korea's best...
- Real wild...

522
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,603
Road variety show...

523
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,203
- With Bo Gum...
- And Sang Yi.

524
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:53,603
Who are we?

525
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:55,072
- 2 Days...
- 2 Days...

526
00:16:55,073 --> 00:16:57,072
- 1 Night.
- 1 Night.

527
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:59,983
(2 Days 1 Night)

528
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:01,742
Gosh, if the weather was good...

529
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:02,882
(Putting behind the heavy rain that doesn't seem to stop...)

530
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:04,203
- It's a bummer.
- It's a bummer.

531
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:06,522
- Today...
- Hello.

532
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:07,883
What's famous in Yeosu?

533
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:12,623
(Still looking handsome even on a day with bad weather)

534
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:14,222
- It's funny how they're already...
- There are a lot of people.

535
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:16,262
- on the bus before us.
- There are so many staff members.

536
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:17,392
Where do you want to sit?

537
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:19,333
I can sit anywhere. No, you can sit there.

538
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:22,533
My gosh.

539
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:25,373
- I can sit in the corner.
- Right. Same here.

540
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:26,973
Should we sit in the corner?

541
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:29,142
- We can take the corner seats.
- Right.

542
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:30,349
(Bo Gum and Sang Yi sit at the far ends for the members.)

543
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,543
- Right here.
- Sit next to the guy your age.

544
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,242
Okay? Go and become friends.

545
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:36,252
(But it's awkward.)

546
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:37,283
Sit next to me.

547
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:40,052
(Things are still awkward between them.)

548
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:41,153
Sit next to him.

549
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:43,729
- Jong Min is going to sit here.
- Seon Ho, sit with me.

550
00:17:43,753 --> 00:17:44,952
(Heart pounding)

551
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:46,122
Those two are the same age.

552
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:47,923
- Handsome ones will sit together.
- Friends?

553
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:49,592
The patient can sit there.

554
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:51,109
(A handsome guy next to a handsome guy)

555
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,663
Let me sit here today.

556
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,232
Gosh, sure.

557
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:55,832
I've never seen Jong Min sit on a two-person seat.

558
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,073
- Really?
- Right.

559
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:59,103
(It's Jong Min!)

560
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:01,103
- Have you been well?
- Yes, I have.

561
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:03,312
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

562
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:04,612
(Jong Min and Bo Gum met after 9 years.)

563
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:05,713
I'm just getting old.

564
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:07,343
- But you look exactly the same.
- No.

565
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,582
- That was already nine years ago.
- Seriously.

566
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,703
(They head to the next destination as they catch up.)

567
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:13,222
It's nice to have these lovely guests joining us.

568
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,452
- Right.
- We usually criticize...

569
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:15,652
and take shots at each other.

570
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:17,613
(The atmosphere is indeed different at a glance.)

571
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:18,953
- This is nice.
- Right?

572
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:22,792
So what have you heard about the show?

573
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:25,392
I mean, it must have been a difficult decision.

574
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:26,673
- I bet it wasn't easy.
- Right.

575
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:28,162
- I almost lost my mind...
- I'm...

576
00:18:28,163 --> 00:18:29,803
- after my trip.
- grateful to Sang Yi.

577
00:18:30,103 --> 00:18:32,773
I wanted to star in 2 Days 1 Night.

578
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,342
But if I came alone, we would be an odd-numbered group.

579
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:36,772
(Bo Gum was worried that they'd be an odd-numbered group.)

580
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:37,813
- Right.
- So...

581
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:40,112
I asked Sang Yi, my co-star from "Good Boy,"

582
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:41,313
if he was interested.

583
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:43,312
He gladly said, "I'd love to."

584
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:44,583
- Really?
- As for me,

585
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:46,383
I had...

586
00:18:47,823 --> 00:18:49,793
complete trust in Bo Gum.

587
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:52,122
I thought there had to be a good reason...

588
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:53,443
if Bo Gum wanted to do something.

589
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:54,962
- What?
- I thought it must mean something.

590
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:56,732
What made you trust him fully?

591
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,992
- You know what? Here's the thing.
- It's his dignity.

592
00:18:58,993 --> 00:19:00,002
- What?
- His dignity.

593
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:01,903
- I was on his show too.
- Yes.

594
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:04,332
I couldn't stop thinking about Bo Gum...

595
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,602
for three weeks.

596
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,102
- I...
- Really?

597
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:09,673
There are small gestures he makes.

598
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:12,783
On the day of the shoot, he came to me out of the blue.

599
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:16,452
"I listened to your entire album on my way home."

600
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:18,152
- "I love this particular song."
- He listened to everything?

601
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:19,382
"If I play the piano for this,"

602
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:20,923
"could you sing it?"

603
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:23,122
He played my song.

604
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:24,422
- What?
- So...

605
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:27,122
I gave him running socks because I heard he was an avid runner.

606
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,162
- I see.
- Seriously.

607
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:30,533
- When you're around good people, - Yes.

608
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:33,933
You begin to take some of their traits. I mean it.

609
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,449
There are some bad people here. Are you okay with that?

610
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:38,933
You know what? I want to act like a gangster today.

611
00:19:39,873 --> 00:19:42,033
It will only take 1 hour to influence you, not 1 year.

612
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:43,342
- You know what?
- You might turn evil.

613
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:45,172
I can make you want to grab one of us by the collar later.

614
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:46,342
(I'll bring out the villain in me.)

615
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:47,919
You'll be able to put your fencing skills to good use.

616
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:51,353
From earlier, it sounded like Sang Yi loved to eat.

617
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:53,482
Bo Gum too.

618
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,483
- Does he like to eat too?
- He likes to eat.

619
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,082
He always eats more than one serving.

620
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,092
- Right.
- Really?

621
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:58,222
- Really?
- He can eat...

622
00:19:58,223 --> 00:19:59,522
- three to four servings.
- What?

623
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:01,122
- He must eat well.
- But you don't gain weight?

624
00:20:01,123 --> 00:20:03,593
- Let me tell you why I'm worried.
- Yes.

625
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,862
- The losing team won't get to eat.
- We won't get any food.

626
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:07,433
- Seriously?
- We get so angry.

627
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,802
You won't give us any food?

628
00:20:09,803 --> 00:20:11,172
(No food at all?)

629
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:12,372
- I lost 3kg...
- Yes.

630
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:13,542
After filming my first episode.

631
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:14,602
(If you lose, there's no food.)

632
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:16,749
- That's too mean, isn't it?
- Don't have negative thoughts.

633
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:19,312
He might turn into Joon if he doesn't get any food.

634
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:21,743
- I felt that too.
- I can tell from his face.

635
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:24,183
Without food, he won't have any energy.

636
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:27,422
(Like this)

637
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:30,553
So we're in Yeosu. Is there anything you want to eat?

638
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,692
- What's famous in Yeosu?
- Have you been here?

639
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:33,762
- To film a drama or a movie?
- Right.

640
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:34,962
- It's your 1st time here?
- It's my 1st time.

641
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:36,393
- Really?
- Yes.

642
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:38,633
What comes to your mind when you think of Yeosu?

643
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:41,232
(Pondering)

644
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,632
- The song.
- The song.

645
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,273
- "Yeosu Night Sea."
- "Yeosu Night Sea."

646
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:46,243
COEX.

647
00:20:46,343 --> 00:20:47,502
- Wait. COEX?
- Yeosu Expo.

648
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:48,572
- Yeosu Expo.
- Yeosu Expo.

649
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:50,212
- COEX is in Gangnam.
- COEX.

650
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:51,342
- I see.
- It's in Samseong-dong.

651
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:53,119
- See? I told you he was one of us.
- My gosh.

652
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:54,842
- He sounds like one of us.
- I felt that...

653
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:56,683
during the tug of war when he lay on his back.

654
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:59,952
(He just ended up getting dragged.)

655
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:02,822
He only sounds trustworthy because of his voice.

656
00:21:02,823 --> 00:21:04,722
- He and I might be similar.
- I think you are.

657
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,892
- I can sense it strongly.
- He reminded me of you earlier.

658
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:08,322
- I dare say...
- That was...

659
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:10,833
Sang Yi can fill in for any of us here.

660
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:13,033
We must be on our toes.

661
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:16,063
(Should I not go on my honeymoon?)

662
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:18,803
(Bo Gum observes Jong Min intently.)

663
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,742
Are you okay? You have to keep looking back.

664
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:22,343
It feels like my neck is going to break.

665
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:23,812
Do you want to switch seats?

666
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:25,542
- My gosh.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

667
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:26,942
- Jong Min.
- Could you be this involved...

668
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:28,513
- when it's just us too?
- Right.

669
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,152
- Jong Min is something else.
- When it's just us too.

670
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:31,582
- He turned around for no one.
- Right.

671
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,682
- You're working hard today.
- My gosh.

672
00:21:32,683 --> 00:21:33,922
- This is...
- You're working so hard.

673
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:35,052
- Right.
- Really?

674
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:36,082
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

675
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,093
I have to be on TV. Stop blocking my camera.

676
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:39,452
- Hey.
- You keep doing that.

677
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:40,462
- My gosh.
- Hey.

678
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:41,922
- You keep...
- Your face isn't important now.

679
00:21:41,923 --> 00:21:44,109
You're on the show every week. So what if you lose some airtime?

680
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:45,262
- Seriously.
- I mean...

681
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,302
Bo Gum and Sang Yi are here today.

682
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:47,662
- His shoulder was touching it.
- Really?

683
00:21:47,663 --> 00:21:48,762
- Hey.
- Stop it.

684
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:50,309
- I feel bad for saying this.
- Right here.

685
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,502
When I looked at you after looking at Bo Gum,

686
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:52,903
I thought you were his bodyguard.

687
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,302
"No. You can't do that."

688
00:21:55,303 --> 00:21:56,549
- You look like his bodyguard.
- "Stop."

689
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:59,543
Are you done filming the drama? Or are you still filming it?

690
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:01,112
We finished filming it.

691
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,459
- It was filmed in advance.
- It was filmed in advance.

692
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:04,352
- It took 11 to 12 months.
- My gosh.

693
00:22:04,353 --> 00:22:05,873
How many episodes does the drama have?

694
00:22:06,183 --> 00:22:07,652
There are 16 episodes which is not common now.

695
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:08,752
(It has 16 episodes which means it's worth watching.)

696
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:10,899
- It has 16 episodes.
- Then they have faith in the drama.

697
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:12,253
There are many action scenes.

698
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:15,092
Each character will showcase their talent in the drama.

699
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:16,093
- Right.
- That sounds like a fun drama.

700
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:18,733
- Our drama will be entertaining.
- So a fencer became a cop.

701
00:22:18,893 --> 00:22:20,602
- I...
- Do you stab them with a baton?

702
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:21,962
My character also uses a baton.

703
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:23,972
- He just uses whatever he sees.
- I see.

704
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:25,679
(He can turn anything he grabs as a weapon.)

705
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:27,142
- With boxing, things are raw.
- You just go for it.

706
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:28,272
You use your bare fists.

707
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:29,913
- Did you learn boxing then?
- I did.

708
00:22:30,143 --> 00:22:31,143
- I see.
- Really?

709
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:33,583
- What are you doing?
- He has beautiful hands.

710
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:35,483
Don't tell me.

711
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,852
Were you Toy Hammer from Dongbuichon-dong?

712
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:39,583
What was your nickname?

713
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:40,882
- Toy Hammer?
- How beautiful.

714
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:43,023
- Was that it?
- His fists make squeaky sounds.

715
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:44,292
(Laughing)

716
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:45,592
When he punches people, it makes squeaky sounds?

717
00:22:45,593 --> 00:22:46,762
- Hey.
- The squeaky sounds?

718
00:22:46,763 --> 00:22:49,662
When I punched people, they heard loud thuds.

719
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:51,462
- So my nickname...
- Talk to Sang Yi too.

720
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:53,032
- Actually, Sang Yi...
- He's good at boxing.

721
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:54,802
- got intensive boxing training.
- for "Bloodhounds."

722
00:22:54,803 --> 00:22:56,833
- I see. Really?
- I didn't train that much yet.

723
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:58,603
- No.
- My gosh, look at his fists.

724
00:22:58,703 --> 00:22:59,842
- Gosh.
- I have ugly hands.

725
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:01,102
- I bet his punches are powerful.
- Gosh, no.

726
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:02,103
Seon Ho too.

727
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:03,112
(Me?)

728
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:05,143
We have a big age gap with Seon Ho.

729
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:07,082
But now that Bo Gum is here,

730
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,342
Seon Ho seems happy to see someone around his age.

731
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:09,442
- Right.
- He's around my age.

732
00:23:09,443 --> 00:23:10,512
- How old are you?
- He's the same age as you?

733
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:12,012
- Well, we're not the same age.
- They're not the same age.

734
00:23:12,013 --> 00:23:13,323
- He's older than me.
- Right.

735
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:14,482
- They're 9 years apart.
- He was born in 2002.

736
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:15,629
He's nine years older than me.

737
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:17,152
- Really?
- Yes.

738
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:18,792
That means Seon Ho...

739
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:20,162
(Seon Ho is very young.)

740
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:22,762
Do you usually speak in honorifics with your guests?

741
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:24,292
- No.
- We speak casually.

742
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:25,592
DinDin is so shy...

743
00:23:25,593 --> 00:23:27,833
that he prefers others to treat him with less respect.

744
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:30,873
(Is that so?)

745
00:23:32,003 --> 00:23:33,772
(Sang Yi's physical contact makes him beam.)

746
00:23:33,773 --> 00:23:34,902
What's wrong with you?

747
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:38,172
He keeps grabbing my thigh with his hand.

748
00:23:38,173 --> 00:23:39,742
- Who?
- Then you should touch him too.

749
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:41,589
- You can touch him too.
- Did he make you scared?

750
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:44,052
Can I be comfortable around you?

751
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:45,683
As a friend, his hand is too...

752
00:23:46,313 --> 00:23:47,652
His physical contact makes it hard to be his friend.

753
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:50,122
Let him punch you before becoming his friend.

754
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:52,523
(With friendship in the air on 2 Days 1 Night bus)

755
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:54,292
It's raining, but we're at an amusement park.

756
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:56,373
- What's this place?
- Gosh, there's a Ferris wheel.

757
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:57,493
A Ferris wheel?

758
00:23:58,463 --> 00:24:02,102
(Why are they at a Ferris wheel?)

759
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:05,872
(The rainstorm gets stronger.)

760
00:24:05,873 --> 00:24:07,002
Oh, my.

761
00:24:07,003 --> 00:24:08,472
(They will probably be in the rain during their trip in Yeosu.)

762
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:09,573
It's so windy.

763
00:24:10,673 --> 00:24:12,613
- This is no joke.
- It's really windy.

764
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:14,312
That's why your flight got canceled, right?

765
00:24:14,313 --> 00:24:16,412
Yes, I'm glad that I took the KTX.

766
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,512
Was your flight canceled?

767
00:24:17,513 --> 00:24:18,682
- My flight got canceled.
- His flight got canceled.

768
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:20,052
You two came on the show.

769
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:22,653
- I'm sorry about the bad weather.
- I know, of all days.

770
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,323
Are we going to a coffee shop?

771
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:26,422
- Where are we going?
- We must be going to a cafe.

772
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,463
Right?

773
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:30,263
- Let's get some Americano.
- Yes, Americano.

774
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:31,532
Sang Yi.

775
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,703
- You can't drink whatever you want.
- Why not?

776
00:24:34,203 --> 00:24:35,262
Do you have to play a game?

777
00:24:35,263 --> 00:24:37,672
As soon as the shoot starts, the staff...

778
00:24:37,673 --> 00:24:39,432
- What's going on?
- This is insane.

779
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:40,502
- Sparta.
- What's going on?

780
00:24:40,503 --> 00:24:41,642
(They can feel the rainstorm.)

781
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:43,842
- This is terrible.
- Hurry up.

782
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:45,173
What a bummer.

783
00:24:45,313 --> 00:24:46,559
Maybe the shoot will turn out well.

784
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:47,983
- Yes, that's why.
- Yes.

785
00:24:48,483 --> 00:24:50,459
- The shoot will turn out well.
- He wants some Americano.

786
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:53,882
The wind is blowing in all directions.

787
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:54,923
I know.

788
00:24:55,723 --> 00:24:56,753
It's strong.

789
00:24:57,723 --> 00:24:59,723
- Look at the desserts.
- We should get something.

790
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:01,192
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

791
00:25:01,193 --> 00:25:02,892
- The briquette shape looks cute.
- What's this?

792
00:25:02,893 --> 00:25:04,732
- Everyone.
- Yes?

793
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:06,939
- Why are they showing it to us?
- Please hurry over here.

794
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,003
Being on this show makes you cheap.

795
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:12,003
Can I be competitive?

796
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:14,472
You must be competitive at all times.

797
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:15,902
- You must win.
- I will be merciless.

798
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:17,213
- Sang Yi.
- You have to win.

799
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:18,413
No matter what...

800
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:19,713
The view is...

801
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:21,743
- The view is incredible.
- Goodness.

802
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:23,712
It feels like we're floating in the sea.

803
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:25,189
(Today's view seen from the cafe with a glass wall)

804
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:27,122
- It's amazing.
- Take a look at the sea behind you.

805
00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:30,252
This place has a magnificent view.

806
00:25:30,253 --> 00:25:31,952
- It's beautiful.
- It's pretty.

807
00:25:31,953 --> 00:25:33,522
It would be great if it were sunny.

808
00:25:33,523 --> 00:25:35,292
(A panoramic view of the sea in Yeosu)

809
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:36,762
It looks like a film noir today.

810
00:25:36,763 --> 00:25:39,132
It looks even better with the rain and the wind.

811
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:40,162
(The rain makes it look romantic.)

812
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,203
It looks amazing.

813
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:44,103
The sea looks even more beautiful with waves in the wind.

814
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:45,972
- Take a photo together.
- Okay.

815
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:47,042
With Bo Gum.

816
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:48,342
(He takes a selfie with Bo Gum furtively.)

817
00:25:48,343 --> 00:25:49,372
At a coffee shop in Yeosu.

818
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,112
(Hashtag: With Bo Gum After Nine Years)

819
00:25:51,113 --> 00:25:52,113
With Sang Yi.

820
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:53,342
(Hashtag: A Photo with Sang Yi)

821
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,119
Did you see the Ferris Wheel on your way here?

822
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:57,113
- It opened this year.
- Yes, I saw it.

823
00:25:57,313 --> 00:25:59,182
It's the biggest Ferris Wheel in Korea.

824
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,922
- I see.
- It's 150m in height.

825
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:01,923
Is it 150m?

826
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:04,329
You can see the panoramic view of Hallyeohaesang National Park.

827
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:06,592
It's an emerging landmark in Yeosu.

828
00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:07,792
- Emerging?
- Last week,

829
00:26:07,793 --> 00:26:08,862
go-karts opened too.

830
00:26:08,863 --> 00:26:11,362
It's a place full of amusement.

831
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:12,739
- We should go on the rides.
- Right.

832
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:14,262
- Unfortunately, it's raining today.
- What?

833
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:16,502
- We can still go on the rides.
- We should.

834
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:17,602
We came all the way to Yeosu.

835
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:21,473
For security reasons, the rides aren't operating today.

836
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:24,172
- That's such a bummer.
- It's raining everywhere in Korea.

837
00:26:24,173 --> 00:26:25,442
That's why...

838
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:27,843
we had to prepare a mind game at the last minute.

839
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:31,053
Everyone, how do you feel now?

840
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:32,152
Are you disappointed?

841
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:33,322
- Yes.
- I'm disappointed.

842
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:35,583
Right? So we prepared this mission for you.

843
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:37,522
(Resolute)

844
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:38,553
He looks so resolute.

845
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:40,423
At this moment

846
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:42,462
It's called Feeling Speed Quiz.

847
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:43,992
"Feeling Speed Quiz?"

848
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:46,333
In case you are bummed out...

849
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:48,933
What would have happened if we weren't bummed out?

850
00:26:49,763 --> 00:26:51,402
We would have handled it accordingly.

851
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:52,602
Can you explain again?

852
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:54,243
At this moment

853
00:26:54,373 --> 00:26:55,502
How does it sound?

854
00:26:55,503 --> 00:26:57,219
You have perfect pitch, so how does it sound?

855
00:26:57,243 --> 00:26:58,572
- Oh, yes.
- Can you accompany him?

856
00:26:58,573 --> 00:26:59,943
- Yes, he sounds good.
- He does?

857
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:02,783
Joon, you're getting ready for a musical. Can you show us?

858
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,552
- Show you what?
- Don't be shy around your junior.

859
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:05,582
Show us as his senior.

00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,822
(At this moment)

862
00:27:08,823 --> 00:27:10,923
(Impressed)

863
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:13,022
Isn't he impressive because he's your senior?

864
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:14,362
He's really amazing.

865
00:27:14,363 --> 00:27:15,962
(He's really amazing.)

866
00:27:15,963 --> 00:27:17,762
Don't they look similar?

867
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,262
- Yes.
- They have a similar vibe.

868
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,879
- Their vibe is...
- We're on the same team.

869
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:23,803
Everyone, you'll do the mission as a team.

870
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:26,603
You'll take turns to express your feeling...

871
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:29,003
with facial expressions and gestures.

872
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:31,142
The other team members will guess the answer.

873
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:32,342
- Okay.
- You'll play...

874
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:33,582
- We got it.
- the speed quiz in a relay.

875
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:34,882
Last time on a carousel,

876
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:36,323
- we did something similar.
- Right.

877
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:37,482
The words were difficult.

878
00:27:37,483 --> 00:27:38,712
- "Sorrowful."
- "Joys and sorrows."

879
00:27:38,713 --> 00:27:40,429
- "Joys and sorrows."
- The words may be difficult.

880
00:27:40,453 --> 00:27:42,122
No one can talk, right?

881
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:43,692
If you can't talk,

882
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:44,752
- it'd be frustrating.
- Yes.

883
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:46,053
When explaining the keyword,

884
00:27:46,393 --> 00:27:49,522
you may say words related to food.

885
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:50,962
If the keyword is "sadness..."

886
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:52,162
(For example)

887
00:27:52,163 --> 00:27:54,002
- "Marinated crab."
- Exactly.

888
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:55,402
(Marinated crab)

889
00:27:55,403 --> 00:27:56,702
Within three minutes,

890
00:27:56,703 --> 00:27:58,732
the team that answers more questions will win.

891
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:00,372
- Who's on my team?
- For now...

892
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:01,672
- My team is...
- Seon Ho.

893
00:28:01,673 --> 00:28:02,943
- This is my team.
- Right.

894
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:04,542
We'll set things up.

895
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:05,573
- Okay.
- Okay.

896
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:07,313
We'll go in this order.

897
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:08,712
We can do it here.

898
00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:10,252
- After that, Sang Yi comes out.
- Yes.

899
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:12,583
The problem is that Sae Ho is slow.

900
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:13,953
You're right.

901
00:28:13,954 --> 00:28:15,383
- Could you...
- In that case...

902
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:17,193
- Can we get an advantage?
- Okay.

903
00:28:17,553 --> 00:28:19,633
- How much more time do you need?
- About this much.

904
00:28:19,693 --> 00:28:20,793
Bo Gum, what do you think?

905
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:24,433
- What would you like?
- I'd like 20 more seconds.

906
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:26,762
- What do you think, Bo Gum?
- Ten seconds?

907
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:27,902
Ten seconds?

908
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:28,903
(Impressed)

909
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:30,249
Bo Gum will give us ten more seconds.

910
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:31,473
- I'm so grateful.
- Okay.

911
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:33,072
That'd be right.

912
00:28:33,073 --> 00:28:34,142
The teams are well-balanced.

913
00:28:34,143 --> 00:28:35,373
Two actors and two comedians.

914
00:28:35,703 --> 00:28:36,712
(We recognize two actors.)

915
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:37,812
- They're equal.
- You're right.

916
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:38,813
This is good.

917
00:28:38,943 --> 00:28:40,112
(Are these two comedians?)

918
00:28:40,113 --> 00:28:41,212
(I'm not a comedian.)

919
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:42,782
- This is good.
- Is Bo Gum a comedian?

920
00:28:42,783 --> 00:28:43,853
Shut it.

921
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:45,782
They're the two actors.

922
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:47,752
(Just looking at him makes me laugh.)

923
00:28:47,753 --> 00:28:49,723
Team Sang Yi must try harder.

924
00:28:50,123 --> 00:28:51,222
With a score of 100 to 0,

925
00:28:51,223 --> 00:28:52,322
Team Bo Gum is ahead.

926
00:28:52,323 --> 00:28:54,263
How many points can we earn in this round?

927
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:56,562
I heard that you can earn 200 points and Americano.

928
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:59,033
Americano and strawberry mochis.

929
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:01,502
Let's say that the winning team gets...

930
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:03,133
glutinous rice cakes and coffee.

931
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,702
Would you like to bet on beverages?

932
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,232
Bo Gum, shall we bet coffee on the game?

933
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:07,842
- Bo Gum agrees.
- He's willing to do it.

934
00:29:07,843 --> 00:29:08,872
Okay.

935
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:09,873
Sang Yi will bet coffee.

936
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,042
- Say something.
- Iced Americano.

937
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:12,313
I'd like some iced Americano.

938
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:14,783
(Do we shout out what we want to eat?)

939
00:29:14,813 --> 00:29:16,382
I want some mocha.

940
00:29:16,383 --> 00:29:18,183
Whatever they say is possible.

941
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:21,853
All right, let's get started.

942
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:23,523
Get ready.

943
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:26,293
- Let's get started.
- Let's take it seriously.

944
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,922
We can name all the feelings.

945
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:29,439
- Can't we name all the feelings?
- Yes.

946
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:30,763
Set...

947
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:33,663
(Team Sang Yi starts.)

948
00:29:33,963 --> 00:29:36,103
(The first keyword: Wronged)

949
00:29:36,403 --> 00:29:37,433
"Wronged."

950
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:39,473
- Just do it.
- Surprised?

951
00:29:39,973 --> 00:29:40,973
- Flustered?
- Shocked?

952
00:29:40,973 --> 00:29:41,973
- Flustered?
- Flustered?

953
00:29:42,103 --> 00:29:43,103
Wait.

954
00:29:43,104 --> 00:29:44,373
Didn't he say the answer?

955
00:29:44,473 --> 00:29:45,473
Flustered?

956
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:46,512
(He spilled the answer.)

957
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:47,783
- Just do it.
- Surprised.

958
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:51,452
(Thankfully, they didn't hear him.)

959
00:29:51,453 --> 00:29:52,583
Flustered?

960
00:29:52,953 --> 00:29:53,953
In pain.

961
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:55,083
Shocked.

962
00:29:56,483 --> 00:29:58,523
- Flustered? Appalled?
- Say words related to food.

963
00:29:58,653 --> 00:29:59,753
- Food.
- Food.

964
00:30:00,023 --> 00:30:01,193
Ulmyeon!

965
00:30:01,263 --> 00:30:03,192
- Ulmyeon? Crying.
- Ulmyeon.

966
00:30:03,193 --> 00:30:04,333
- Sad.
- Furious.

967
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:05,832
- Ulmyeon.
- Furious.

968
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,203
(Joon who feels crazy wronged)

969
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,663
- It's...
- Disheartened?

970
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:12,183
You have to explain in a strange way.

971
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:14,672
- It must be...
- Sad.

972
00:30:14,673 --> 00:30:15,702
(Why is he grabbing his neck when he's wronged?)

973
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:17,642
What could this be?

974
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:18,873
- Ulmyeon.
- In pain?

975
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:20,083
In pain.

976
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:21,213
- We won.
- Death?

977
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:22,213
- What is it?
- Why can't you answer?

978
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:23,242
- Death?
- We'll skip it.

979
00:30:23,243 --> 00:30:24,812
- We'll skip it.
- Skip.

980
00:30:24,813 --> 00:30:26,112
- Why would you skip it?
- Skip it.

981
00:30:26,113 --> 00:30:27,422
Why can't you guess?

982
00:30:27,423 --> 00:30:28,663
(Exploding with feeling unjust)

983
00:30:28,923 --> 00:30:29,982
This is funny.

984
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:30,993
(The next keyword)

985
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:33,693
Say a type of food.

986
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:34,963
- Food.
- No.

987
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:36,932
(Laughing)

988
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:38,832
- Food.
- Don't repeat the word.

989
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:39,833
Say a type of food.

990
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:40,963
(Don't say "food.")

991
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,162
(Try to guess the keyword.)

992
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:44,273
- Angry?
- Angry.

993
00:30:44,673 --> 00:30:45,833
- Crying?
- Energetic?

994
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:47,702
Joyful? Cheering.

995
00:30:47,703 --> 00:30:48,773
- Joyful.
- Cheering.

996
00:30:49,073 --> 00:30:50,753
- Are you being tickled?
- Does it tickle?

997
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:52,173
This is easy to guess.

998
00:30:52,313 --> 00:30:54,182
- How can they not guess?
- It's easy to guess.

999
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:55,283
Are you being tickled?

1000
00:30:55,513 --> 00:30:56,542
What is he doing?

1001
00:30:56,543 --> 00:30:57,852
(Excited)

1002
00:30:57,853 --> 00:30:58,913
Look at him.

1003
00:30:59,883 --> 00:31:01,352
What is he doing?

1004
00:31:01,353 --> 00:31:02,522
(The ones who know the answer burst out laughing.)

1005
00:31:02,523 --> 00:31:03,552
His explanation is unbelievable.

1006
00:31:03,553 --> 00:31:05,353
- Are you being tickled?
- That's exactly it.

1007
00:31:05,593 --> 00:31:06,892
What is he trying to say?

1008
00:31:06,893 --> 00:31:08,262
(Those who don't know are full of questions.)

1009
00:31:08,263 --> 00:31:09,962
Are you being tickled?

1010
00:31:09,963 --> 00:31:11,392
- Are you being tickled?
- That's exactly it.

1011
00:31:11,393 --> 00:31:12,562
Tickled?

1012
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:13,603
What is it?

1013
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:15,632
- What?
- What is this?

1014
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:17,333
Wait, he can't do that on TV.

1015
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:20,542
(Bo Gum is laughing so hard that he's close to tears.)

1016
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:21,643
- Eel.
- What?

1017
00:31:21,873 --> 00:31:22,873
- Eel.
- I got it.

1018
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:23,873
- Eel.
- Eel?

1019
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:25,873
Stamina. Virility.

1020
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:27,543
- Yes.
- Virility.

1021
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:29,882
Manly?

1022
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:31,152
Let's skip and move on.

1023
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:32,629
- We can't help it.
- We have to skip it.

1024
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:33,982
- We have no time.
- What are we doing?

1025
00:31:33,983 --> 00:31:35,252
Sang Yi, show us your skills.

1026
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:36,253
They're terrible.

1027
00:31:36,253 --> 00:31:37,253
(Sang Yi's keyword: Sentimental)

1028
00:31:37,254 --> 00:31:38,693
- Let's go.
- Say a type of food.

1029
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:40,262
(Sang Yi gets into it right away.)

1030
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:41,699
- Let's go.
- Sorrowful. Joy and sorrow.

1031
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:42,723
- Jjajangmyeon.
- Dim.

1032
00:31:42,724 --> 00:31:43,732
- Jjajangmyeon.
- Jjajangmyeon.

1033
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:44,863
- Nostalgic.
- Nostalgic.

1034
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,762
- Sad.
- Sad.

1035
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:47,763
- Sorrowful.
- Sorrowful.

1036
00:31:47,763 --> 00:31:48,763
- Imploring.
- Frustrated.

1037
00:31:48,763 --> 00:31:49,763
- Imploring.
- Imploring.

1038
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:50,902
- Imploring.
- Gosh, what is this?

1039
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:52,202
- Jjajangmyeon.
- Desperate.

1040
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,673
- His acting is good.
- Oh, no.

1041
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:55,673
This is it.

1042
00:31:55,903 --> 00:31:57,012
That's crazy.

1043
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:58,013
- It's making me cry.
- I can't tell.

1044
00:31:58,014 --> 00:31:59,513
- In despair.
- Jjajangmyeon.

1045
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:00,682
(No one said the answer yet.)

1046
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:01,683
- He's crying.
- Jjajangmyeon.

1047
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:02,842
Sad.

1048
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:04,113
- Jjajangmyeon.
- Please.

1049
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:06,482
(Bo Gum watches his colleague's struggle.)

1050
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:08,453
- It's high quality.
- They're so clueless.

1051
00:32:08,483 --> 00:32:09,822
- It's high quality.
- Why don't we...

1052
00:32:09,823 --> 00:32:12,222
- After death.
- With the word's first letter...

1053
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:13,563
- Name the food?
- Yes.

1054
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:15,722
That's a great idea.

1055
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:17,463
(Bo Gum came up with a tactic.)

1056
00:32:17,693 --> 00:32:19,493
- When you say the word...
- Yes.

1057
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:20,983
- That's a great idea.
- I agree.

1058
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,333
- Jjajangmyeon.
- Resistance.

1059
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:23,673
- Jjajangmyeon.
- Try harder.

1060
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,202
- Perplexed?
- One more time.

1061
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:27,242
Just skip it.

1062
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:28,272
What's the answer?

1063
00:32:28,273 --> 00:32:29,372
They'll never guess if they don't know this.

1064
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:30,612
They didn't get any answer.

1065
00:32:30,613 --> 00:32:31,772
What's the answer?

1066
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:33,512
- Sentimental.
- "Sentimental?"

1067
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:35,013
The word is too difficult.

1068
00:32:36,013 --> 00:32:37,282
How should I explain this?

1069
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:38,553
- Try it.
- Go ahead.

1070
00:32:39,483 --> 00:32:40,723
Say a type of food.

1071
00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:45,893
What's that?

1072
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:48,062
I don't think he knows what it means.

1073
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:50,263
- Upset?
- It's over. Goodness.

1074
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:52,063
Promise? What's that?

1075
00:32:52,493 --> 00:32:53,493
He's the worst.

1076
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:54,502
- Three, - Begging?

1077
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:55,702
Two, one.

1078
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:56,703
What?

1079
00:32:56,703 --> 00:32:57,703
(Spinning)

1080
00:32:57,903 --> 00:32:59,002
(Their time ends with a cute turn.)

1081
00:32:59,003 --> 00:33:00,003
Is it over?

1082
00:33:00,004 --> 00:33:01,373
Perfect. You did a good job.

1083
00:33:01,643 --> 00:33:02,842
- Everyone.
- At this rate...

1084
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:03,872
Team Sang Yi.

1085
00:33:03,873 --> 00:33:04,873
Zero.

1086
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:06,112
You got zero.

1087
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:07,882
What was Joon's first keyword?

1088
00:33:07,883 --> 00:33:09,413
He said the answer.

1089
00:33:09,883 --> 00:33:10,912
He said "ulmyeon."

1090
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:12,752
He said "wronged."

1091
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:14,283
- No one guessed it.
- Really?

1092
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:16,659
Why couldn't you get it right when I told you the answer?

1093
00:33:16,683 --> 00:33:17,693
By the way,

1094
00:33:18,193 --> 00:33:19,392
what was this about?

1095
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:20,892
- When you get excited...
- How is this being excited?

1096
00:33:20,893 --> 00:33:22,092
Is this how you get excited?

1097
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:23,632
(Squealing)

1098
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:24,693
Is this being excited?

1099
00:33:25,193 --> 00:33:27,033
(Squealing)

1100
00:33:28,463 --> 00:33:29,662
What was this about?

1101
00:33:29,663 --> 00:33:31,972
- I was excited.
- He said, "Eel."

1102
00:33:31,973 --> 00:33:34,302
Bo Gum, if you were given "excited" as the keyword,

1103
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,672
how would you express it?

1104
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:36,842
- Excited.
- Excited.

1105
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:38,372
- Excited?
- Yes.

1106
00:33:38,373 --> 00:33:39,573
(Excited)

1107
00:33:39,873 --> 00:33:41,143
Excited.

1108
00:33:41,543 --> 00:33:44,383
- No, it's...
- Excited!

1109
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:47,422
He's good. So you did the right thing.

1110
00:33:47,423 --> 00:33:49,082
- Didn't I?
- What he did was good.

1111
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:51,169
- That's how to describe "excited."
- He did a good job.

1112
00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:53,922
- This is so difficult.
- Right, it's not easy.

1113
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:55,363
It's not easy. You'll be surprised.

1114
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:56,762
All right.

1115
00:33:56,763 --> 00:33:58,192
(Team Bo Gum's turn)

1116
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:00,192
- Are you ready?
- I'll show you how it's done.

1117
00:34:00,193 --> 00:34:02,033
Here we go. Ready,

1118
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,873
set...

1119
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:06,593
You still have a lot of time.

1120
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:07,973
Gosh, this one is hard.

1121
00:34:08,343 --> 00:34:09,542
- It's not easy?
- It's easy.

1122
00:34:09,543 --> 00:34:10,642
- Suspicious.
- Despicable.

1123
00:34:10,643 --> 00:34:12,042
- Suspicious.
- Despicable.

1124
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:13,342
Yes, you're close.

1125
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,483
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

1126
00:34:16,043 --> 00:34:18,052
- Iced Americano.
- Futile.

1127
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:19,413
- Iced Americano.
- Regretful.

1128
00:34:19,653 --> 00:34:20,653
It's hard to guess.

1129
00:34:20,654 --> 00:34:21,799
- Regretful.
- Say a type of food.

1130
00:34:21,823 --> 00:34:23,122
(Iced Americano)

1131
00:34:23,123 --> 00:34:24,692
(Does it start with "ah?")

1132
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:25,693
What is it?

1133
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:28,192
- Jealous.
- Bummed out.

1134
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:30,393
Regretful? Do it one more time.

1135
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:32,992
(What could it be?)

1136
00:34:32,993 --> 00:34:34,702
(Imitating his acting to mock him)

1137
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:35,833
It's a pity?

1138
00:34:35,863 --> 00:34:36,863
- Skip.
- It's a shame?

1139
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:37,972
- What is it?
- What?

1140
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:39,072
- It's hard.
- You need to hurry up.

1141
00:34:39,073 --> 00:34:40,372
We should change the tactic.

1142
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:41,373
What was the answer?

1143
00:34:41,573 --> 00:34:42,603
This one is so easy.

1144
00:34:42,703 --> 00:34:44,573
- It's very easy.
- It's way too easy.

1145
00:34:44,773 --> 00:34:47,343
Ulmyeon, jjajangmyeon.

1146
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:49,912
Startled.

1147
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:50,913
Correct.

1148
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:51,952
Startled.

1149
00:34:51,953 --> 00:34:53,313
- That was easy.
- That was easy.

1150
00:34:53,983 --> 00:34:55,683
(Gratified)

1151
00:34:55,983 --> 00:34:57,153
Canned food.

1152
00:34:57,753 --> 00:34:59,752
(The movement has nothing to do with being gratified.)

1153
00:34:59,753 --> 00:35:01,092
- Gratified.
- Gratified.

1154
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:02,122
(He doesn't know about Team Bo Gum's secret tactic.)

1155
00:35:02,123 --> 00:35:03,963
- Correct.
- That's great.

1156
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:07,363
That's good. We're doing well.

1157
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:08,532
Say a type of food.

1158
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:09,533
(Try to guess the answer.)

1159
00:35:09,534 --> 00:35:10,573
Food.

1160
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:12,103
What is it?

1161
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:13,773
Mustard greens kimchi.

1162
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:15,402
- Mustard greens kimchi?
- Mustard greens kimchi.

1163
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:17,143
Mustard? Mustard greens kimchi.

1164
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:18,473
- Kimchi.
- Mustard.

1165
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:20,642
- Mustard greens kimchi.
- Despicable.

1166
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:21,812
- No.
- Being fake.

1167
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:23,013
Seeming.

1168
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:25,083
Humph, mustard greens kimchi.

1169
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:27,652
- "Humph, mustard greens kimchi?"
- "Humph, mustard greens kimchi?"

1170
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:28,653
Sulky?

1171
00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:29,782
(You're close.)

1172
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:30,952
- Jealous.
- Mustard greens kimchi.

1173
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:32,223
- Correct.
- Okay.

1174
00:35:32,723 --> 00:35:34,083
- They're good.
- They really are.

1175
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:36,522
(Bad-tempered)

1176
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:37,563
What is it?

1177
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:39,993
Naengmyeon.

1178
00:35:40,663 --> 00:35:41,763
Naengmyeon!

1179
00:35:41,903 --> 00:35:43,772
- DinDin.
- Naengmyeon!

1180
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:44,773
(We've seen this side of him a lot.)

1181
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:45,832
How dare you, naengmyeon...

1182
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,003
Cynical.

1183
00:35:47,173 --> 00:35:49,442
- Naengmyeon!
- Violent? What is it?

1184
00:35:49,443 --> 00:35:50,812
- What is it?
- Jjajangmyeon.

1185
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,542
- Hey, jjajangmyeon.
- He's getting angry.

1186
00:35:52,543 --> 00:35:53,642
- Repressed anger? What is it?
- I got it.

1187
00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:54,712
- It's Lim Cheol.
- Repressed anger? What is it?

1188
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:55,842
Naengmyeon, jjajangmyeon.

1189
00:35:55,843 --> 00:35:57,382
- Excited.
- You're bad...

1190
00:35:57,383 --> 00:35:58,552
(Laughing)

1191
00:35:58,553 --> 00:35:59,882
Who do you think you are?

1192
00:35:59,883 --> 00:36:01,652
- Disgraceful.
- Suffering.

1193
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:03,013
- What is it?
- Harassing someone?

1194
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,392
- He's almost saying the answer.
- Is this allowed?

1195
00:36:05,393 --> 00:36:07,663
- This is...
- You're bad...

1196
00:36:08,093 --> 00:36:09,093
- Bad...
- Bad...

1197
00:36:09,094 --> 00:36:10,334
- Bad...
- Superhuman strength.

1198
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:11,733
Monster.

1199
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:12,932
- Bad...
- Suffering.

1200
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:14,302
Red bean porridge.

1201
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:16,332
- Darn it.
- This bizarre dish...

1202
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:18,603
- and red bean porridge.
- Bizarre dish?

1203
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:20,203
- Bizarre dish...
- Bad-tempered.

1204
00:36:20,603 --> 00:36:21,603
- You got it.
- That's correct.

1205
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:22,773
That's right.

1206
00:36:23,003 --> 00:36:24,512
(How did he guess that?)

1207
00:36:24,513 --> 00:36:25,513
How did he get it right?

1208
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:26,572
But this is...

1209
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:28,112
- You're very good.
- How did you know?

1210
00:36:28,113 --> 00:36:30,213
(Proud)

1211
00:36:30,283 --> 00:36:31,283
(Proud)

1212
00:36:31,284 --> 00:36:32,352
DinDin.

1213
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:33,913
(Proud? What starts with the letter P?)

1214
00:36:34,183 --> 00:36:35,522
Yummy.

1215
00:36:35,523 --> 00:36:36,523
(He loves it.)

1216
00:36:36,553 --> 00:36:38,953
Ta-da.

1217
00:36:39,593 --> 00:36:40,892
(Feeling proud)

1218
00:36:40,893 --> 00:36:42,363
- Relieved.
- Relieved.

1219
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,133
Feeling at ease.

1220
00:36:44,193 --> 00:36:46,393
- Being glad.
- Here I go.

1221
00:36:47,763 --> 00:36:48,802
(Proud)

1222
00:36:48,803 --> 00:36:49,803
Feeling proud.

1223
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:50,903
Correct.

1224
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:52,432
(Moon Se Yoon, the expert of expressions)

1225
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:53,673
He feels proud.

1226
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:55,972
(Getting chills)

1227
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:57,042
He's cold.

1228
00:36:57,043 --> 00:36:58,342
- Squid.
- "Squid?"

1229
00:36:58,343 --> 00:36:59,573
- Squid.
- Feeling cold.

1230
00:36:59,673 --> 00:37:00,743
Feeling cold.

1231
00:37:01,113 --> 00:37:02,142
- Squid.
- Surprised.

1232
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:03,312
- Squid.
- Very surprised.

1233
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:04,383
Squid.

1234
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,752
He's stimulated.

1235
00:37:06,753 --> 00:37:08,052
Tremble with fear.

1236
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:09,083
You're close.

1237
00:37:09,483 --> 00:37:10,522
You can't say that.

1238
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:11,523
(Giving hints isn't allowed.)

1239
00:37:11,524 --> 00:37:12,822
- Skip.
- That's right.

1240
00:37:12,823 --> 00:37:13,992
"Getting chills."

1241
00:37:13,993 --> 00:37:15,422
- "Getting chills."
- That's right.

1242
00:37:15,423 --> 00:37:16,423
(We almost had it.)

1243
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:17,463
Next.

1244
00:37:17,563 --> 00:37:18,633
Hurry.

1245
00:37:19,663 --> 00:37:20,903
This one is hard.

1246
00:37:22,803 --> 00:37:23,972
This one is hard.

1247
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:25,733
(Starting to act with his eyes)

1248
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:27,542
"Don't go." It must be tragic love.

1249
00:37:27,543 --> 00:37:28,572
(Show us...)

1250
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:31,943
(Show us, Bo Gum.)

1251
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:33,713
"Don't go." It must be tragic love.

1252
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:37,382
Plum.

1253
00:37:37,383 --> 00:37:39,983
(Plum)

1254
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:41,722
- "Plum?"
- Attractive.

1255
00:37:41,723 --> 00:37:42,783
Is it being attractive?

1256
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:44,792
- Plum.
- Plum.

1257
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:45,953
Plum.

1258
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:47,463
- Plum.
- He stuck his tongue out.

1259
00:37:47,493 --> 00:37:48,992
- Plum.
- He stuck his tongue out.

1260
00:37:48,993 --> 00:37:50,493
- Plum.
- Captivating.

1261
00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:52,692
(The plum is very captivating.)

1262
00:37:52,693 --> 00:37:54,333
- You're good.
- That was so captivating.

1263
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:56,862
- Okay.
- How many did we get right?

1264
00:37:56,863 --> 00:37:59,332
Your idea was good.

1265
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:00,742
- Great job.
- How many did we get right?

1266
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:01,802
Well done.

1267
00:38:01,803 --> 00:38:03,273
We should have done what they did.

1268
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:05,043
With food names, right?

1269
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:06,143
What's the score?

1270
00:38:06,643 --> 00:38:07,743
Team Bo Gum got...

1271
00:38:08,543 --> 00:38:10,113
- six questions.
- Yes.

1272
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:12,912
- We could've have gotten more.
- I agree.

1273
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:14,882
- A difference of 1 or 2...
- Is there something like this?

1274
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:15,922
What?

1275
00:38:15,923 --> 00:38:17,793
- A chance to revive.
- Let me ask.

1276
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:19,192
He's asking if we can get a chance to revive.

1277
00:38:19,193 --> 00:38:20,723
- Who?
- And so...

1278
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:21,962
One more time?

1279
00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:23,792
If you want to play one more round...

1280
00:38:23,793 --> 00:38:25,162
This team used...

1281
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:27,332
the first letter of the keyword as a hint.

1282
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,102
If you think...

1283
00:38:29,103 --> 00:38:30,433
that it was unjust,

1284
00:38:30,803 --> 00:38:31,932
we'll give you another chance.

1285
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:34,202
- There should be a condition.
- We'll ask Bo Gum...

1286
00:38:34,203 --> 00:38:36,042
- if we can get a chance.
- We should...

1287
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:37,672
at least get some coffee.

1288
00:38:37,673 --> 00:38:38,812
How about this?

1289
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:41,112
- Can we play 1 more round?
- Reduce their time by 30 seconds.

1290
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:42,382
Reduce their time by 30 seconds.

1291
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:44,212
- A chance...
- Sang Yi asked for it.

1292
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:45,382
Was the time limit three minutes?

1293
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:46,463
Let us do it one more time.

1294
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:47,683
Okay, go ahead.

1295
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:49,753
Two dollars?

1296
00:38:50,483 --> 00:38:52,029
- What's this?
- What's with the money?

1297
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:53,722
- Why are you giving it to us?
- I gave it to them.

1298
00:38:53,723 --> 00:38:55,622
- Okay.
- Okay.

1299
00:38:55,623 --> 00:38:56,922
- Go ahead.
- One more round.

1300
00:38:56,923 --> 00:38:57,962
One more round.

1301
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,832
- Play one more round.
- Okay.

1302
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:02,262
- We'll be strict with the time.
- Okay.

1303
00:39:02,263 --> 00:39:04,132
- Joon, are you ready?
- Yes.

1304
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,972
Let's be simple.

1305
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:07,102
Think simply.

1306
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:08,542
- Simply? Okay.
- Wait a minute.

1307
00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:10,912
Is it the same sketchbook that we used?

1308
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,512
- You start from where you left off.
- Thank you.

1309
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:13,673
It's a continuation.

1310
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:15,513
All right.

1311
00:39:15,743 --> 00:39:17,553
I think he looked at the words.

1312
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:19,582
- Sang Yi did?
- Did you look?

1313
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:21,323
- No, not at all.
- Really?

1314
00:39:22,023 --> 00:39:23,882
- Are you sure?
- I really didn't look.

1315
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:24,952
It's because of your question.

1316
00:39:24,953 --> 00:39:28,492
If you think I looked, I'll go first. I promise I didn't look.

1317
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:29,592
- It's okay.
- I don't want...

1318
00:39:29,593 --> 00:39:31,193
to make you suspicious of me at all.

1319
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:34,102
- Do you feel wronged?
- Wronged.

1320
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:35,933
- "Wronged" is my guess.
- It's okay.

1321
00:39:36,203 --> 00:39:37,472
Isn't "wronged" correct?

1322
00:39:37,473 --> 00:39:39,409
I don't want to make you suspicious of me at all.

1323
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:40,842
- No, it's okay.
- He looks wronged.

1324
00:39:40,843 --> 00:39:42,002
You're hilarious.

1325
00:39:42,003 --> 00:39:43,072
Joon, come here.

1326
00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:45,013
- I'll go first.
- All right.

1327
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:46,842
- Sang Yi.
- He's younger. Be good to him.

1328
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,312
- Good.
- He acted many sad characters.

1329
00:39:49,313 --> 00:39:50,382
- He's getting ready.
- Shall we start?

1330
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:51,952
- Let's get started.
- Let's go.

1331
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:53,683
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

1332
00:39:53,753 --> 00:39:55,353
- Get ready, - They won't make it.

1333
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:57,353
- It's difficult.
- set...

1334
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:02,923
- Now is the time.
- Okay.

1335
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:05,262
Food.

1336
00:40:05,263 --> 00:40:06,532
Is it a lamb skewer or what?

1337
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:08,133
- Brushing your teeth.
- A type of food.

1338
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:10,832
- Refreshing.
- I...

1339
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,232
- Correct.
- Refreshing.

1340
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,873
- All right.
- I didn't say anything.

1341
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:15,573
Refreshing.

1342
00:40:15,703 --> 00:40:16,803
Say a type of food.

1343
00:40:17,273 --> 00:40:18,273
(Restless)

1344
00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:19,413
You're cold.

1345
00:40:19,443 --> 00:40:21,312
- Beef brisket.
- Possessed by a spirit.

1346
00:40:21,313 --> 00:40:23,012
- Beef brisket.
- Could it be...

1347
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:24,813
- restless?
- Correct.

1348
00:40:25,013 --> 00:40:27,922
- It's over.
- The game is over.

1349
00:40:27,923 --> 00:40:29,283
- Jong Min is up.
- Okay.

1350
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:31,052
(A type of food that starts with R?)

1351
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:34,023
(Feces and urine)

1352
00:40:34,193 --> 00:40:35,262
Feces and urine.

1353
00:40:35,263 --> 00:40:37,162
(Suddenly, he released feces and urine.)

1354
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:39,863
- Go back in. Do another word.
- That doesn't count. Skip it.

1355
00:40:39,993 --> 00:40:42,262
What are you doing?

1356
00:40:42,263 --> 00:40:44,173
Feces and urine aren't food.

1357
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:45,432
What's wrong with him?

1358
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:47,003
- What are you doing?
- I hate it.

1359
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:49,043
How could he say that?

1360
00:40:50,643 --> 00:40:51,672
(Despite the atmosphere, Joon gets emotional.)

1361
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:52,743
Feces and urine.

1362
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:54,312
Is it the same?

1363
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:55,482
Feces and urine.

1364
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:57,813
- What is it?
- Nostalgic.

1365
00:40:58,513 --> 00:40:59,513
- What?
- "Nostalgic?"

1366
00:40:59,514 --> 00:41:00,682
I didn't say a word.

1367
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:02,983
- That's correct.
- How is that possible?

1368
00:41:03,953 --> 00:41:05,023
Say a type of food.

1369
00:41:05,393 --> 00:41:07,022
This one is difficult.

1370
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:08,092
A type of food.

1371
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:09,123
What is he doing?

1372
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:11,462
Isn't he asking for just one chance?

1373
00:41:11,463 --> 00:41:12,962
- Begging.
- Say a type of food.

1374
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:14,062
Earnest?

1375
00:41:14,063 --> 00:41:16,303
- Black beans.
- Wait. "Black beans?"

1376
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:18,002
- S...
- Black beans.

1377
00:41:18,003 --> 00:41:19,032
Sorrow.

1378
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:20,173
- That's correct.
- Correct.

1379
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:22,173
My goodness.

1380
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:23,572
Good job.

1381
00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:24,742
We got it from black beans.

1382
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:25,743
(Timid)

1383
00:41:26,813 --> 00:41:28,213
What's wrong with him?

1384
00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:29,782
(Squirming)

1385
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:31,159
- What's that?
- It's a webfoot octopus.

1386
00:41:31,183 --> 00:41:32,852
(The look on his face is obviously timid.)

1387
00:41:32,853 --> 00:41:34,283
What's wrong with him?

1388
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:36,752
Wait, what could it be?

1389
00:41:36,753 --> 00:41:37,993
Ox head bone soup.

1390
00:41:39,023 --> 00:41:40,553
- Timid.
- Correct.

1391
00:41:41,223 --> 00:41:42,422
(He's overwhelmingly timid.)

1392
00:41:42,423 --> 00:41:44,103
- What was that about?
- That was amazing.

1393
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:46,832
Joy...

1394
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,262
(You can't say the first syllable.)

1395
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:49,562
Wrong! Do it again.

1396
00:41:49,563 --> 00:41:51,032
What is he doing? Is he out of his mind?

1397
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:52,932
(He's banished again.)

1398
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:54,002
(My stomach hurts from laughing.)

1399
00:41:54,003 --> 00:41:55,242
"Joy" was hilarious.

1400
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:56,273
(Sobbing)

1401
00:41:58,343 --> 00:41:59,642
Say a type of food.

1402
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:01,412
- Squid.
- Sobbing.

1403
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:02,912
- That's correct.
- It's sobbing.

1404
00:42:02,913 --> 00:42:04,682
- No way.
- What happened?

1405
00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:05,882
I see.

1406
00:42:05,883 --> 00:42:07,483
(Excited)

1407
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:10,382
- He stopped talking.
- He's thinking of words.

1408
00:42:10,383 --> 00:42:11,492
(What starts with the letter E?)

1409
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:13,192
You ran out of words. Just act it.

1410
00:42:13,193 --> 00:42:15,023
S ramyeon.

1411
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:16,208
(Excited)

1412
00:42:16,991 --> 00:42:18,520
- He stopped talking.
- He's thinking of words.

1413
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:19,890
(What starts with the letter E?)

1414
00:42:19,891 --> 00:42:21,251
You ran out of words. Just act it.

1415
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:23,160
S ramyeon.

1416
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:24,330
You ran out of words. Just act it.

1417
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:26,030
S ramyeon!

1418
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:28,200
- Excited.
- That's correct.

1419
00:42:28,201 --> 00:42:30,200
(What is wrong with you?)

1420
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:31,930
- You seemed better than that.
- All right. Okay.

1421
00:42:31,931 --> 00:42:33,570
(They got the correct answer and still find it funny.)

1422
00:42:33,571 --> 00:42:35,200
(They picked the word and still find it funny.)

1423
00:42:35,201 --> 00:42:39,211
(Bo Gum, who was watching it with rapt attention...)

1424
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:41,311
(Flopping)

1425
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:46,010
(The performance of Bo Gum's fellow actor...)

1426
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:47,050
(made Bo Gum laugh.)

1427
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:48,851
Gosh, seriously. Goodness.

1428
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:51,391
That was impressive. Sang Yi is amazing.

1429
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:53,027
- He's amazing, indeed.
- It's Sae Ho's turn.

1430
00:42:53,051 --> 00:42:54,320
- I'm impressed. Oh, my.
- Indeed.

1431
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,561
(Lethargic)

1432
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:57,831
(Flabby)

1433
00:42:58,061 --> 00:42:59,567
- He's amazing, indeed.
- It's Sae Ho's turn.

1434
00:42:59,591 --> 00:43:00,600
- What's that?
- What does that mean?

1435
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:01,730
- Radish...
- What?

1436
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:02,800
Radish soup.

1437
00:43:02,801 --> 00:43:03,901
Radish... Lethargic.

1438
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:07,240
(Team Sang Yi is on a roll.)

1439
00:43:07,241 --> 00:43:08,440
- What was that?
- Okay.

1440
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:09,641
(Touched)

1441
00:43:09,871 --> 00:43:11,240
Please do it properly.

1442
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:12,671
- Persimmon...
- Touched.

1443
00:43:14,911 --> 00:43:16,140
(Touched!)

1444
00:43:16,141 --> 00:43:17,180
(Laughing)

1445
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:18,687
- Persimmon is the name of food.
- Okay.

1446
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:20,391
- Hey, mister!
- What? I said "persimmon."

1447
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:23,450
Jjajangmyeon!

1448
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:25,020
- Annoyed.
- Correct.

1449
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:26,050
(They have great teamwork.)

1450
00:43:26,051 --> 00:43:28,290
- Isn't it over yet?
- That's hilarious.

1451
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:29,360
- What is it?
- How much time do we have left?

1452
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:30,391
(Embarrassed)

1453
00:43:31,961 --> 00:43:33,330
What is it? Think of a word.

1454
00:43:33,331 --> 00:43:35,160
Flustered. Dumbfounded.

1455
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:36,300
- Why is he rubbing his head?
- Hey.

1456
00:43:36,301 --> 00:43:37,671
Idiot. No, that's not it.

1457
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:40,601
- Hesitating.
- Embarrassed.

1458
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:41,840
- Embarrassed.
- The keyword was "embarrassed."

1459
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:44,010
- But...
- That was unfair.

1460
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:45,011
(Team Sang Yi seemed as if they were sharing their brains.)

1461
00:43:45,012 --> 00:43:46,340
- Okay.
- Good job.

1462
00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:47,680
- Sang Yi.
- That was great.

1463
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:48,841
I'm sorry,

1464
00:43:49,741 --> 00:43:52,551
but when you said "S ramyeon," it almost sounded like "excited."

1465
00:43:52,811 --> 00:43:54,620
- He said "S ramyeon."
- It sounded like "excited."

1466
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:56,120
- "Excited?"
- We did all right.

1467
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:57,490
Even if we have to exclude the one that wasn't guessed fairly...

1468
00:43:57,491 --> 00:44:00,091
"Feces and urine" was too much. Why did you say that?

1469
00:44:00,191 --> 00:44:02,490
It can be turned into fertilizer to use to grow food we eat.

1470
00:44:02,491 --> 00:44:04,011
How many correct answers did they get?

1471
00:44:04,231 --> 00:44:05,330
- How many?
- Team Sang Yi...

1472
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:06,560
- Nine?
- got ten correct answers.

1473
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,860
- That's crazy.
- Yes!

1474
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:09,400
- Hold on a second.
- Okay.

1475
00:44:09,401 --> 00:44:10,770
- I'm sorry to him.
- It is what it is.

1476
00:44:10,771 --> 00:44:12,000
- Let us try one more time...
- Do you want to try again?

1477
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:13,400
- It's unfair.
- He gave Sae Ho back two dollars.

1478
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,940
- I feel bad.
- He gave Sae Ho back two dollars.

1479
00:44:14,941 --> 00:44:16,421
- Bo Gum...
- They want to try again.

1480
00:44:16,471 --> 00:44:17,810
- Bo Gum gave him...
- They got too many correct answers.

1481
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:19,171
(Bo Gum made an offer secretly!)

1482
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:21,040
- Okay.
- Bo Gum gave him back two dollars.

1483
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:22,310
Let's have the other team try again.

1484
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:23,950
- Let's just...
- I'm okay, to be honest.

1485
00:44:23,951 --> 00:44:25,280
Let's receive 100 points each.

1486
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:27,080
I don't think I can be funnier than that.

1487
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,480
- Exactly.
- It was hilarious.

1488
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:30,250
- Right.
- We let them play another round,

1489
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,690
so how about we get only drinks?

1490
00:44:31,691 --> 00:44:34,620
Then we'll give coffee to Team Bo Gum.

1491
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:35,990
- All right.
- Okay.

1492
00:44:35,991 --> 00:44:38,590
- Team Sang Yi gets points.
- "Feces and urine!"

1493
00:44:38,591 --> 00:44:40,330
- What do you say?
- So we get points,

1494
00:44:40,331 --> 00:44:42,531
- and they get coffee? Sounds fair.
- That sounds good.

1495
00:44:42,761 --> 00:44:45,130
The winner of Feeling Speed Quiz is...

1496
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:46,600
- That's good.
- Team Sang Yi.

1497
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:49,140
- Okay. Great.
- They did a good job.

1498
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:50,941
I'll announce the current scores.

1499
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:52,571
Team Bo Gum has 100 points.

1500
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,701
- And Team Sang Yi has 200 points.
- Oh, my.

1501
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:55,940
- I thought we had 200 points.
- We lost.

1502
00:44:55,941 --> 00:44:56,950
- Then...
- But I can't...

1503
00:44:56,951 --> 00:44:59,510
- We'll move to the next location.
- Got it.

1504
00:44:59,511 --> 00:45:00,780
- Okay.
- Let's get going.

1505
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,950
- Okay.
- Sang Yi is our guest,

1506
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:02,951
so give him some coffee.

1507
00:45:03,851 --> 00:45:06,150
- Give him some Americano.
- That's okay. I'm good.

1508
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:07,320
- I can hold back.
- You don't have to.

1509
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:09,320
- I want to keep it fair.
- So that we can share it.

1510
00:45:09,321 --> 00:45:11,281
(That's not my intention. I want us to share it.)

1511
00:45:11,331 --> 00:45:13,731
- I mean, it was...
- "S ramyeon."

1512
00:45:14,861 --> 00:45:16,901
I wanted to describe the emotion like an emoji.

1513
00:45:18,101 --> 00:45:19,331
That was so fun.

1514
00:45:19,931 --> 00:45:22,240
- Yes. Please fill it to the brim.
- Sure.

1515
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:23,510
(Team Bo Gum finished ordering coffee.)

1516
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:24,511
Can we share one cup of coffee?

1517
00:45:24,512 --> 00:45:25,670
- My gosh. This is...
- No, you cannot.

1518
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:27,110
- We can't?
- They're so strict.

1519
00:45:27,111 --> 00:45:28,211
They make no exception.

1520
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:33,051
(Let's go to the next location!)

1521
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:35,351
Se Yoon, the day after tomorrow is your birthday.

1522
00:45:35,621 --> 00:45:37,291
- Really?
- May 11.

1523
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:41,990
(May 11 is Se Yoon's birthday, 2 days after the shoot.)

1524
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:43,730
- I see.
- I won't ever forget his birthday.

1525
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:45,061
(Here's why.)

1526
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:48,701
(In the Dinner Game during the last trip to Yeoju, )

1527
00:45:49,031 --> 00:45:52,970
(no one could say Se Yoon's birthday correctly.)

1528
00:45:52,971 --> 00:45:54,101
(It's in May?)

1529
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:58,041
(The loyalty game ended, scarring Se Yoon.)

1530
00:45:58,571 --> 00:46:02,081
(None of them knows when my birthday is.)

1531
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:03,950
Wish me a happy birthday on my birthday from now on.

1532
00:46:03,951 --> 00:46:05,950
My children cried when they saw that episode.

1533
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:07,081
May 11?

1534
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:09,797
Because my colleagues didn't know my birth month, let alone the date.

1535
00:46:09,821 --> 00:46:11,021
Bo Gum, when is your birthday?

1536
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:12,650
Don't you know when his birthday is?

1537
00:46:12,651 --> 00:46:13,920
- Don't you know, Jong Min?
- Don't you know?

1538
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:15,061
How can you not know that?

1539
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:17,507
- It's like a national holiday.
- You'll be in big trouble.

1540
00:46:17,531 --> 00:46:18,731
You don't know?

1541
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:21,160
- Of course, I know.
- Just say his birth month.

1542
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:22,161
June.

1543
00:46:22,162 --> 00:46:23,871
- June?
- Yes. It's around the corner.

1544
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:25,270
- That's correct.
- Really?

1545
00:46:25,271 --> 00:46:26,751
- So he was right.
- He got it right.

1546
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:28,071
He was right.

1547
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:29,300
- He picked the right month.
- Then...

1548
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:31,811
Jong Min, did you take a wild guess and pick 1 of 12 months?

1549
00:46:32,171 --> 00:46:34,081
No, he gave me a hand signal.

1550
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:36,680
(Asking for help)

1551
00:46:36,681 --> 00:46:38,310
(Bo Gum caught Jong Min's desperate gaze.)

1552
00:46:38,311 --> 00:46:39,610
Just say his birth month, just the month.

1553
00:46:39,611 --> 00:46:41,331
(The kind Bo Gum gave him a hint secretly.)

1554
00:46:41,721 --> 00:46:45,150
(Only Jong Min saw his hand signal.)

1555
00:46:45,151 --> 00:46:46,221
Bo Gum is nice.

1556
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:47,661
Bo Gum gave you a hint?

1557
00:46:47,691 --> 00:46:49,651
I'm sure Bo Gum also knows when your birthday is.

1558
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:51,490
Of course, he knows.

1559
00:46:51,491 --> 00:46:52,690
(Asking for help)

1560
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:54,237
(This time, Bo Gum gives Jong Min a desperate gaze.)

1561
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:55,760
Jong Min's birthday?

1562
00:46:55,761 --> 00:46:57,277
(Jong Min repays him for his kindness.)

1563
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:58,601
Of course, he knows.

1564
00:46:58,971 --> 00:47:00,200
Just guess his birth month.

1565
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:01,201
September.

1566
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,171
September? I think it's October.

1567
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:05,221
- What month is it?
- It's September, you brat.

1568
00:47:06,141 --> 00:47:08,541
- He's better than the members.
- Okay. I admit it.

1569
00:47:08,681 --> 00:47:09,740
Oh, our drinks are here.

1570
00:47:09,741 --> 00:47:11,511
Here. I'll give you your drinks.

1571
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:14,021
These are for Team Bo Gum.

1572
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:16,751
- We all can share the drinks.
- Thank you.

1573
00:47:17,091 --> 00:47:18,750
- Bo Gum? Is this the right one?
- Yes.

1574
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:19,850
- It's a latte.
- It's Bo Gum's.

1575
00:47:19,851 --> 00:47:21,851
- This is Mongdol latte, obviously.
- That's mine.

1576
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:24,230
What? No, it's not.

1577
00:47:24,231 --> 00:47:25,937
- I ordered Mongdol latte.
- Oh, it's Se Yoon's? Okay.

1578
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:27,800
- Give me just a sip.
- It's their signature drink.

1579
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:29,060
I think this one is iced Americano.

1580
00:47:29,061 --> 00:47:30,301
Just give me a sip.

1581
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:33,470
Guess my emotion.

1582
00:47:33,471 --> 00:47:35,901
(Guess how I feel right now.)

1583
00:47:36,571 --> 00:47:37,640
In...

1584
00:47:37,641 --> 00:47:38,711
Insane.

1585
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:40,681
That is correct.

1586
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:45,310
Bo Gum, don't share it with anyone even if someone asks for a sip.

1587
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:46,880
We have our own rules...

1588
00:47:46,881 --> 00:47:48,920
- on this show.
- We have our own rules.

1589
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:50,590
You can only eat what you gain.

1590
00:47:50,591 --> 00:47:53,021
You may not share food, but you may tease the others.

1591
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:54,821
(That is the rule of 2 Days 1 Night.)

1592
00:47:55,561 --> 00:47:57,160
Since it's raining, I feel...

1593
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:58,931
(It keeps raining in Yeosu.)

1594
00:47:59,031 --> 00:48:01,230
Let's sing songs that come to our minds when it rains.

1595
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:02,460
- You go first.
- Let's start with you.

1596
00:48:02,461 --> 00:48:04,400
(It's raining)

1597
00:48:04,401 --> 00:48:07,040
(Songs about rain: 1. "In the Rain" by Lee Moon Sae)

1598
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:08,541
- "In the Rain."
- "In the Rain."

1599
00:48:09,771 --> 00:48:13,171
(On a rainy day)

1600
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:18,850
(2. "The Western Sky" by Lee Seung Chul)

1601
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:20,421
- "The Western Sky?"
- Yes.

1602
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:21,721
Oh, this song.

1603
00:48:21,722 --> 00:48:24,121
(This time, Sang Yi sings a song on his playlist.)

1604
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,390
What song is this?

1605
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,667
(What is this song that Sang Yi and Seon Ho are singing?)

1606
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:30,330
(3. "The Sound of Rain" by Yoon Do Hyun)

1607
00:48:30,331 --> 00:48:31,890
"The Sound of Rain" by Yoon Do Hyun.

1608
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:33,267
- Oh, "The Sound of Rain?"
- Did you know the song?

1609
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:35,461
- Not many people know the song.
- Seon Ho.

1610
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:36,761
Sang Yi.

1611
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:40,770
("Umbrella")

1612
00:48:40,771 --> 00:48:43,411
(With the playlist of rain songs, we're on a sentimental journey.)

1613
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,370
- Come to think of it, - Yes.

1614
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:47,080
- everyone here is a musician.
- We're all singers.

1615
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:48,457
- We all have released a song album.
- I...

1616
00:48:48,481 --> 00:48:51,080
saw Bo Gum sing "A Love Story of a Country Boy."

1617
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:52,350
- I was amazed.
- Right. It was so great.

1618
00:48:52,351 --> 00:48:55,071
- I watched it repeatedly for days.
- He sang it on "Golden Oldies."

1619
00:48:56,221 --> 00:48:59,890
(With his sentimental voice, )

1620
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:03,021
(Bo Gum performed "A Love Story of a Country Boy.")

1621
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:08,030
(With the sentiment that appealed to all ages, )

1622
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:11,871
(the performance drew a lot of attention.)

1623
00:49:11,971 --> 00:49:13,170
- That was amazing.
- I loved his stage outfit too.

1624
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:14,171
Thank you.

1625
00:49:14,172 --> 00:49:16,532
- I always listen to it in my car.
- Exactly. It's so good.

1626
00:49:16,701 --> 00:49:18,261
I like that he sings like he's talking.

1627
00:49:18,441 --> 00:49:20,481
- I... Right.
- He sings like he's talking.

1628
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:22,957
Sae Ho, aren't you good at singing like you're talking?

1629
00:49:22,981 --> 00:49:24,010
- Yes, indeed.
- He's good at delivering emotions.

1630
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:26,491
- He sings high notes that way too.
- I sing like I'm talking.

1631
00:49:26,711 --> 00:49:30,550
(He's singing like he's talking.)

1632
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,631
- That was sorrowful.
- Didn't your lymph node hurt?

1633
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:33,890
- The surgical incision...
- You must've flexed your muscles.

1634
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:36,051
Burst open for a moment, and then it was closed again.

1635
00:49:36,961 --> 00:49:38,360
(The tearful performance with a wound)

1636
00:49:38,361 --> 00:49:39,391
Oh, no. It hurts.

1637
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:41,461
What caused it?

1638
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,770
The cause was...

1639
00:49:43,771 --> 00:49:44,931
failed self-management.

1640
00:49:45,231 --> 00:49:46,271
(Laughing)

1641
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:50,131
- Mr. Cho Sae Ho, you failed.
- I said that because...

1642
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,010
- He failed to manage his health.
- the doctor said it was caused...

1643
00:49:52,011 --> 00:49:54,340
- by a poor immune system.
- I see.

1644
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:56,180
- You failed to look after yourself.
- I should've taken better care...

1645
00:49:56,181 --> 00:49:58,411
of my health to stay healthy.

1646
00:49:58,711 --> 00:50:00,620
Will you recover fully before our next shoot?

1647
00:50:00,621 --> 00:50:03,250
- He won't be able to come.
- I'll have to watch the progress.

1648
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,421
- Really?
- Jong Min, when will you go?

1649
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:07,520
- I'm leaving on May...
- At our next shoot?

1650
00:50:07,521 --> 00:50:09,160
- No, after that.
- The next shoot...

1651
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:10,260
- Where is he going?
- On his honeymoon.

1652
00:50:10,261 --> 00:50:11,560
So you'll miss the shoot after the next one, right?

1653
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:12,630
Since Sae Ho will miss it too,

1654
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:14,130
these two can replace Sae Ho and Jong Min.

1655
00:50:14,131 --> 00:50:15,230
- Right. That'd be great.
- Right.

1656
00:50:15,231 --> 00:50:16,360
Yes. That'd be perfect.

1657
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:17,371
I don't think they can.

1658
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:19,501
We'll do the shoot on June 6 and 7.

1659
00:50:19,701 --> 00:50:21,300
(The director can't miss the chance. And everyone bursts out laughing.)

1660
00:50:21,301 --> 00:50:23,540
- Just as I thought...
- He said it right in front of me.

1661
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:24,670
He said it right away.

1662
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:25,710
(We're disappointed, Jong Hyun.)

1663
00:50:25,711 --> 00:50:26,810
It would be nice if I were to come next month.

1664
00:50:26,811 --> 00:50:28,280
- Exactly. Instead of today.
- When the weather is...

1665
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:30,627
- When the weather is nice.
- You can come back on the show.

1666
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:32,711
(You're always welcome here.)

1667
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:34,780
Anyway, our show is...

1668
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,250
I don't know what they think of our show,

1669
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:37,921
but it's a travel show.

1670
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:41,690
- We introduce travel destinations, - It's a travel show.

1671
00:50:41,691 --> 00:50:43,620
Feel romance at those places,

1672
00:50:43,621 --> 00:50:44,961
and enjoy a relaxing time.

1673
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:47,030
What type of travel do you two like?

1674
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:49,200
- For example, with a large group...
- I enjoy traveling alone.

1675
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:50,600
- Oh, really?
- Really?

1676
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:51,601
(Surprised)

1677
00:50:51,602 --> 00:50:53,770
Last year, I had some time to rest...

1678
00:50:53,771 --> 00:50:56,141
while filming a drama.

1679
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:58,910
That night, I bought a plane ticket...

1680
00:50:58,911 --> 00:51:01,210
to Bohol as I heard it was beautiful there.

1681
00:51:01,211 --> 00:51:02,211
- Bohol in the Philippines?
- Really?

1682
00:51:02,212 --> 00:51:03,710
- Was it impulsive travel?
- Yes.

1683
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:05,480
- I left the next morning.
- Alone?

1684
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:06,657
You really went there by yourself?

1685
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:09,150
- Without any plans?
- There are local tour agencies...

1686
00:51:09,151 --> 00:51:10,950
- that sell tour packages, right?
- Tour packages, yes.

1687
00:51:10,951 --> 00:51:12,250
- I told them...
- Yes?

1688
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:14,090
- that I needed a friend.
- Really?

1689
00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:15,660
I asked the tour guide to be my friend.

1690
00:51:15,661 --> 00:51:17,490
And I traveled around the place with Mario, the tour guide.

1691
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,690
- Really?
- With Mario?

1692
00:51:18,691 --> 00:51:20,230
- Yes, his name was Mario.
- You became friends?

1693
00:51:20,231 --> 00:51:21,261
In Bohol?

1694
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:24,001
(During the trip he decided to go on impulsively, )

1695
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:26,570
(Sang Yi made a new friend and traveled with him.)

1696
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:28,601
(The local friend, Lani)

1697
00:51:28,771 --> 00:51:30,251
Bo Gum wouldn't like to travel alone.

1698
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:32,810
Yes. I prefer to travel with friends rather than traveling alone.

1699
00:51:32,811 --> 00:51:33,910
You prefer to travel with others.

1700
00:51:33,911 --> 00:51:35,881
Where did you go on a trip most recently?

1701
00:51:36,181 --> 00:51:37,481
- Recently?
- Yes.

1702
00:51:37,711 --> 00:51:39,781
- I went to Guam.
- Guam.

1703
00:51:39,951 --> 00:51:40,951
Oh, Guam?

1704
00:51:40,952 --> 00:51:44,121
- With whom?
- With my friends from the military.

1705
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:46,520
- You still keep in touch with them?
- Yes.

1706
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:47,960
You stay in touch with them?

1707
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:49,420
- That's amazing.
- That's not easy.

1708
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:50,430
(Bo Gum was discharged 3 years ago, but he still hangs out with them.)

1709
00:51:50,431 --> 00:51:51,830
There's this beatboxer called WING...

1710
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:53,730
- who drew attention not long ago.
- I know.

1711
00:51:53,731 --> 00:51:54,760
He created "Dopamine."

1712
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:56,630
He was Bo Gum's junior in the military, apparently.

1713
00:51:56,631 --> 00:51:58,471
- Really?
- No, he was my senior.

1714
00:51:59,171 --> 00:52:02,401
(Recently, he drew attention with his song "Dopamine.")

1715
00:52:03,911 --> 00:52:07,141
(The world champion beatboxer, WING)

1716
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:13,210
(He and Bo Gum served in the same military unit.)

1717
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:15,550
Did he perform a lot in the military?

1718
00:52:15,551 --> 00:52:16,980
Right, he taught me as well.

1719
00:52:16,981 --> 00:52:18,020
He taught you too?

1720
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:19,751
Does that mean you can beatbox?

1721
00:52:20,021 --> 00:52:21,560
I learned it from him.

1722
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:22,761
But it's really hard.

1723
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:24,330
You know it's really hard...

1724
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:25,360
(Everyone's clearing their throats to imitate WING's beatbox.)

1725
00:52:25,361 --> 00:52:26,430
- I can't.
- Goodness.

1726
00:52:26,431 --> 00:52:28,071
Isn't that what Sae Ho does all the time?

1727
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:31,800
It's like something's stuck in his throat.

1728
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:33,330
- It's really hard.
- Sae Ho, you can beatbox. Yes?

1729
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:34,640
- Sae Ho used to beatbox before.
- I can beatbox a bit.

1730
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:35,700
- He used to do it.
- I did it when I was young.

1731
00:52:35,701 --> 00:52:37,470
- You can? Show us.
- Show us.

1732
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:38,740
Come on. I'm not that good.

1733
00:52:38,741 --> 00:52:40,010
- Just show us how.
- Come on.

1734
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:41,251
(Trying to beatbox reluctantly)

1735
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:45,481
(High quality beatbox skills)

1736
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:47,481
(Surprised)

1737
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:49,741
He's putting his hand down. It'll be funny. Look.

1738
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:53,321
(Laughing)

1739
00:52:54,521 --> 00:52:56,060
There you go.

1740
00:52:56,061 --> 00:52:57,121
(Se Yoon loves it.)

1741
00:52:57,661 --> 00:52:59,361
- He's good.
- There you go.

1742
00:52:59,561 --> 00:53:00,800
- He's good.
- He's good.

1743
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:02,560
Se Yoon is good at it too.

1744
00:53:02,561 --> 00:53:04,330
- Se Yoon is good. Give it a try.
- I'm good at it.

1745
00:53:04,331 --> 00:53:05,400
Se Yoon can easily make sounds with his mouth.

1746
00:53:05,401 --> 00:53:07,640
I can do a quieter version.

1747
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:08,961
(How's Se Yoon's beatbox skills?)

1748
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:11,970
(Se Yoon's beatbox is different from Sae Ho's. It's still charming.)

1749
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:13,241
That's really smooth.

1750
00:53:13,311 --> 00:53:15,710
(Being cute)

1751
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:17,810
It will be cool if you perform together.

1752
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:19,010
- How about you perform together?
- I'll start.

1753
00:53:19,011 --> 00:53:20,751
One, two, three, four.

1754
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:28,591
(The beatbox not only hits the ears but also the retina.)

1755
00:53:28,691 --> 00:53:29,791
What genre is this?

1756
00:53:30,321 --> 00:53:31,431
What genre is this?

1757
00:53:31,731 --> 00:53:33,830
You can beatbox too, Sang Yi. Am I right?

1758
00:53:33,831 --> 00:53:35,301
- No.
- No?

1759
00:53:36,731 --> 00:53:37,731
- This is...
- No, I can't.

1760
00:53:37,732 --> 00:53:39,271
He knows how to say no with respect.

1761
00:53:39,331 --> 00:53:41,200
I learned it for the first time. "No, I can't."

1762
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:42,201
(A very polite way of saying no that's unusual on the show)

1763
00:53:42,202 --> 00:53:44,040
- This is how you say no.
- No.

1764
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:46,110
I didn't get offended...

1765
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,957
- even when I asked him.
- Right, it doesn't offend you.

1766
00:53:47,981 --> 00:53:49,811
I should learn from him. "No."

1767
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:52,680
- Show us.
- Sounds good.

1768
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:55,250
The view is amazing here when the weather's good, Jong Min.

1769
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:58,090
This is Dolsan Bridge, a famous bridge in Yeosu.

1770
00:53:58,091 --> 00:53:59,420
- You see how it spreads both ways.
- I know this bridge.

1771
00:53:59,421 --> 00:54:00,491
- Dolsan Bridge.
- Right.

1772
00:54:01,191 --> 00:54:02,491
Where are we headed now?

1773
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:04,090
- Now...
- You mean us?

1774
00:54:04,091 --> 00:54:06,007
- Are we headed to a lunch place?
- You want me to tell you?

1775
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:07,331
We're headed to a restaurant.

1776
00:54:07,731 --> 00:54:09,537
- We're headed to a restaurant.
- We're playing games there then.

1777
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:11,041
Are we playing games at a restaurant?

1778
00:54:11,371 --> 00:54:14,470
- We'll have to see.
- We'll do something there.

1779
00:54:14,471 --> 00:54:16,000
- Thank you for letting us know.
- Sure.

1780
00:54:16,001 --> 00:54:17,370
(Flustered at the warm response)

1781
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:18,970
Anyway, one of you...

1782
00:54:18,971 --> 00:54:20,111
cannot eat lunch with us.

1783
00:54:20,141 --> 00:54:21,661
- You are in different teams.
- Right.

1784
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:23,810
You should be informed about that.

1785
00:54:23,811 --> 00:54:25,971
(Which team will get to have pike conger shabu shabu?)

1786
00:54:26,711 --> 00:54:28,181
What? Where are we?

1787
00:54:29,751 --> 00:54:31,067
- That's a waiting room.
- Right.

1788
00:54:31,091 --> 00:54:33,620
- Are we getting on a boat?
- We must be getting on the boat.

1789
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:35,221
Come on. When it's raining?

1790
00:54:35,991 --> 00:54:37,460
Are we headed to an island?

1791
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:39,030
- What?
- Mr. Director.

1792
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:40,190
Let's see how things go.

1793
00:54:40,191 --> 00:54:42,351
What do we see from here? All I see is a waiting room.

1794
00:54:42,401 --> 00:54:44,071
We aren't going to Seoul from here.

1795
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:47,070
It's like "When Life Gives You Tangerines" if we get on a boat.

1796
00:54:47,071 --> 00:54:48,470
It's that swimming scene.

1797
00:54:48,471 --> 00:54:49,541
It's right here.

1798
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:57,311
(Gwan Sik jumped off the boat for Ae Sun on a stormy day.)

1799
00:54:57,611 --> 00:55:01,920
(Today's weather is stormy just like that scene.)

1800
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:03,850
- He can swim like a seal.
- Really?

1801
00:55:03,851 --> 00:55:05,320
- He's a good swimmer.
- He was a professional swimmer.

1802
00:55:05,321 --> 00:55:06,420
He's so good at it.

1803
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:07,920
- Really?
- He's very good at swimming.

1804
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:08,990
(Bo Gum is even good at swimming.)

1805
00:55:08,991 --> 00:55:10,420
- He's so talented.
- I know.

1806
00:55:10,421 --> 00:55:12,437
- He's good at everything.
- I wonder what he's bad at.

1807
00:55:12,461 --> 00:55:14,301
Sae Ho was supposed to get in the water today.

1808
00:55:14,631 --> 00:55:17,000
If that's the case, you should get on a different boat.

1809
00:55:17,001 --> 00:55:18,321
How about a lymphatic gland boat?

1810
00:55:18,901 --> 00:55:20,600
You mean lymph nodes?

1811
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:22,641
- Get on the lymphatic gland.
- Lymph nodes.

1812
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:26,041
(Let's get on the lymphatic gland boat)

1813
00:55:26,171 --> 00:55:29,040
Sae Ho's lymphatic gland boat.

1814
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:30,480
(On their way to lunch with Sae Ho's lymphatic gland boat)

1815
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:32,551
We're getting off. Everyone, get ready to get off.

1816
00:55:33,981 --> 00:55:35,741
It has been a while since I smelled the sea.

1817
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:39,151
- I smelled it a lot while shooting.
- I smelled it a lot in Busan.

1818
00:55:40,691 --> 00:55:43,490
(Will the boat be available on a stormy day like this?)

1819
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:45,330
- Will they let us get on the boat?
- It's headed to Gyeongdo Island.

1820
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:47,230
Gukdong of Gyeongdo Island? Where is that?

1821
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:49,401
(The boat says Gyeongdo Island, today's destination.)

1822
00:55:50,461 --> 00:55:52,370
- It's the boat Gwan Sik jumped off.
- Right.

1823
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:53,600
It's totally the same.

1824
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:55,161
(Everyone dreams of becoming Gwan Sik.)

1825
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:58,301
We're the only ones on the boat because of the bad weather.

1826
00:55:58,411 --> 00:56:00,540
It's great. The boat is amazing.

1827
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:03,481
(On their way to Gyeongdo Island)

1828
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:04,911
We aren't going somewhere far.

1829
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:06,987
- I knew it.
- We aren't going somewhere far.

1830
00:56:07,011 --> 00:56:10,151
(Bo Gum fixing Sang Yi's hair that got wet from the rain.)

1831
00:56:10,281 --> 00:56:11,521
They are warm people.

1832
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:15,220
(They're fixing each other's hair next to Bo Gum and Sang Yi.)

1833
00:56:15,221 --> 00:56:16,890
Wait a second.

1834
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:18,931
(Something's on your face.)

1835
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:21,260
Oh, there's nothing. Sorry.

1836
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:22,931
(His face had nothing on it.)

1837
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:25,671
(They get along well as usual.)

1838
00:56:26,071 --> 00:56:28,700
- Can we go casual when we talk?
- Let's go casual.

1839
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:30,541
- Please go casual.
- All right, Sang Yi.

1840
00:56:31,341 --> 00:56:33,610
Bo Gum. I can't believe a day like this has come.

1841
00:56:33,611 --> 00:56:34,880
Bo Gum, let's be good friends.

1842
00:56:34,881 --> 00:56:36,640
- All right.
- Brother Sae Ho.

1843
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:38,550
Nice to meet you. Just call me Sae Ho.

1844
00:56:38,551 --> 00:56:39,711
- Sae Ho.
- Sure.

1845
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:41,350
- Hi, Sae Ho.
- Nice to meet you, Sae Ho.

1846
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:42,550
- You look cute.
- Right.

1847
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:43,627
(They get along together only when they tease Sae Ho.)

1848
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:46,551
There you go. Let's all go casual including Sang Yi, okay?

1849
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:48,691
We don't have much time. We have to get close now.

1850
00:56:49,421 --> 00:56:54,500
(The boat reached Gyeongdo Island in no time.)

1851
00:56:54,501 --> 00:56:56,330
Everyone, we are here.

1852
00:56:56,331 --> 00:56:58,171
- We are here already?
- It was a bit shaky...

1853
00:56:58,771 --> 00:57:00,570
I thought we hadn't left yet. But we are here already.

1854
00:57:00,571 --> 00:57:01,741
What? We are here already?

1855
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:04,671
- We are here.
- What's going on?

1856
00:57:05,811 --> 00:57:06,910
Shall we get down?

1857
00:57:06,911 --> 00:57:08,810
(What will happen on Gyeongdo Island?)

1858
00:57:08,811 --> 00:57:10,041
We are here already?

1859
00:57:11,151 --> 00:57:12,281
It's quiet here.

1860
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:14,651
I'm cold and hungry.

1861
00:57:15,421 --> 00:57:16,481
Are we on an island?

1862
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:17,921
It's an island, right?

1863
00:57:18,821 --> 00:57:20,191
I'm so cold and hungry.

1864
00:57:20,421 --> 00:57:21,561
Aren't you starved?

1865
00:57:21,721 --> 00:57:24,061
I'm starving. What's that?

1866
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,030
It must be the pike conger.

1867
00:57:26,031 --> 00:57:28,331
Gosh, we have to eat this.

1868
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:29,531
It looks delicious.

1869
00:57:31,071 --> 00:57:32,330
(They got on the boat...)

1870
00:57:32,331 --> 00:57:34,701
(to taste the first flavor of Yeosu.)

1871
00:57:35,071 --> 00:57:39,911
(Pike conger shabu shabu)

1872
00:57:40,441 --> 00:57:44,111
(Which team will get to enjoy the first dish of Yeosu?)

1873
00:57:45,851 --> 00:57:47,410
- Here's the current score.
- I'm starving.

1874
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:48,621
Team Bo Gum earned 100 points.

1875
00:57:48,921 --> 00:57:50,720
Team Sang Yi earned 200 points.

1876
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:52,250
- The tables have turned.
- We shouldn't have lost.

1877
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:53,350
I know.

1878
00:57:53,351 --> 00:57:55,360
I told you that we were going to serve you lunch.

1879
00:57:55,361 --> 00:57:57,861
You will earn 500 points if you win this last game.

1880
00:57:58,061 --> 00:57:59,231
This mission...

1881
00:57:59,361 --> 00:58:00,460
What, 500 points?

1882
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:01,807
(You're giving 500 points out of the blue?)

1883
00:58:01,831 --> 00:58:04,001
So playing the games here doesn't mean much.

1884
00:58:04,131 --> 00:58:05,500
You will earn 500 points if you win this game.

1885
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:06,531
What's the game?

1886
00:58:07,131 --> 00:58:08,700
Spotting People in the Moment.

1887
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:10,971
- Spotting People in the Moment.
- That's right.

1888
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:14,381
We'll show you various people on the boards.

1889
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:16,711
What was the color of Sang Yi's tie?

1890
00:58:16,941 --> 00:58:18,611
Sang Yi! It was orange.

1891
00:58:19,051 --> 00:58:20,880
- Is this how we play the game?
- That is correct.

1892
00:58:20,881 --> 00:58:22,081
- He's good.
- It's difficult.

1893
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:24,490
- It's difficult.
- This doesn't look easy.

1894
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:26,951
You have to get up if you get the correct answer.

1895
00:58:27,321 --> 00:58:29,060
- It's how the game is done.
- Yes.

1896
00:58:29,061 --> 00:58:30,860
The first team with the empty table is the winner.

1897
00:58:30,861 --> 00:58:32,290
- That's right.
- The table has to be empty.

1898
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,800
DinDin cheats a lot.

1899
00:58:34,801 --> 00:58:36,230
I hope you don't let it slide.

1900
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:38,130
- He might tell his teammates.
- How can I even cheat?

1901
00:58:38,131 --> 00:58:39,200
You might tell your teammates.

1902
00:58:39,201 --> 00:58:40,900
DinDin won't cheat when we have guests here.

1903
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:42,981
- He sure will.
- It doesn't matter if we have them.

1904
00:58:43,201 --> 00:58:44,470
Are you going to cheat?

1905
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:45,641
What? I won't.

1906
00:58:46,171 --> 00:58:48,310
(Stepping back)

1907
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:49,640
Sang Yi's good.

1908
00:58:49,641 --> 00:58:51,750
- What's with him? It's strange.
- DinDin.

1909
00:58:51,751 --> 00:58:53,581
(Looking at DinDin)

1910
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:55,081
Aren't his lips really pretty?

1911
00:58:56,681 --> 00:58:58,450
- Don't let him get up.
- Bo Gum...

1912
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,020
- Why are you so shy?
- His lips?

1913
00:59:00,021 --> 00:59:01,260
Why are you blushing?

1914
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:02,291
(You're making me shy.)

1915
00:59:02,391 --> 00:59:04,061
His lips have always been pretty.

1916
00:59:04,661 --> 00:59:05,890
All right, let's start.

1917
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:07,730
- I'll give you five seconds.
- You just have to go out first.

1918
00:59:07,731 --> 00:59:10,051
- Take pictures in your head.
- Just walk out if you know.

1919
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:12,670
- One, two, three.
- We look at it for five seconds.

1920
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:14,241
Here. One...

1921
00:59:17,141 --> 00:59:20,641
Two, three, four, five.

1922
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:22,880
- Okay.
- This is so hard.

1923
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:24,680
(He already started to forget what was on the board.)

1924
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:25,751
I know. I got it.

1925
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:27,351
Here's the question.

1926
00:59:27,821 --> 00:59:29,720
Who was Sang Yi's bride?

1927
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:31,190
- Sang Yi. Oh, right.
- Jong Min.

1928
00:59:31,191 --> 00:59:33,050
Sae Ho raised his hand first.

1929
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:34,051
(Does Sae Ho know the answer?)

1930
00:59:34,052 --> 00:59:35,321
It was an aristocrat.

1931
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:37,090
Bo Gum.

1932
00:59:37,091 --> 00:59:38,890
- The bride!
- Bo Gum.

1933
00:59:38,891 --> 00:59:40,130
- What?
- It was DinDin.

1934
00:59:40,131 --> 00:59:41,261
No!

1935
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:42,331
- Incorrect.
- No?

1936
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:43,430
- Sang Yi.
- Sang Yi.

1937
00:59:43,431 --> 00:59:45,471
(DinDin is Bo Gum's bride.)

1938
00:59:45,631 --> 00:59:47,570
- This is hard.
- Bo Gum.

1939
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:48,571
(Seon Ho's going for it.)

1940
00:59:48,572 --> 00:59:49,900
- Sang Yi.
- Bo Gum.

1941
00:59:49,901 --> 00:59:52,301
I saw another Sang Yi dressed up as a woman next to Sang Yi.

1942
00:59:52,341 --> 00:59:53,947
- What is he talking about?
- It's Sang Yi.

1943
00:59:53,971 --> 00:59:55,180
Is this real?

1944
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:56,740
- Incorrect.
- Sang Yi.

1945
00:59:56,741 --> 00:59:59,181
(Sang Yi dressed up as a woman?)

1946
00:59:59,651 --> 01:00:01,950
- Sang Yi.
- Sang Yi.

1947
01:00:01,951 --> 01:00:02,951
Lee Joon.

1948
01:00:03,151 --> 01:00:04,520
I also thought it was either Joon or Sang Yi.

1949
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,281
- It must be the answer.
- I don't think so.

1950
01:00:06,751 --> 01:00:08,961
- It must be the answer.
- I don't think so.

1951
01:00:09,061 --> 01:00:10,061
Correct.

1952
01:00:10,421 --> 01:00:11,731
How did you see that?

1953
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,667
- I just guessed it.
- Let's see the board again.

1954
01:00:13,691 --> 01:00:14,861
We look alike.

1955
01:00:15,201 --> 01:00:16,901
- We look alike.
- That's Joon?

1956
01:00:19,201 --> 01:00:21,071
(Joon standing as Sang Yi's bride)

1957
01:00:21,471 --> 01:00:24,440
(A doppelganger couple is born.)

1958
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:26,670
Wasn't that Han Na next to Joon?

1959
01:00:26,671 --> 01:00:27,940
Wasn't that Han Na?

1960
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:30,080
That was another photo.

1961
01:00:30,081 --> 01:00:31,911
- I saw it on the bottom left.
- Really?

1962
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,681
I'm the ace here.

1963
01:00:35,821 --> 01:00:38,020
- Where was Joon's photo?
- Please check the board.

1964
01:00:38,021 --> 01:00:39,720
We can't check the board again.

1965
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:41,360
- You have more questions?
- Yes.

1966
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:43,120
- We'll give you the next question.
- We can't see the board again?

1967
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:44,890
Shouldn't we see it one more time?

1968
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,230
- No, let's not see it.
- Let's not.

1969
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,001
All right, let's go.

1970
01:00:49,501 --> 01:00:51,370
We're winning.

1971
01:00:51,371 --> 01:00:53,170
- Here's the next question.
- This is going well for us.

1972
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:54,201
This is going well.

1973
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,910
On the board, you could see some moments from dramas.

1974
01:00:57,911 --> 01:00:59,011
- I know.
- Oh, my.

1975
01:00:59,411 --> 01:01:01,910
Please name all the drama series you saw on the board.

1976
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:03,740
- All the drama series?
- How can we remember that?

1977
01:01:03,741 --> 01:01:04,750
- How can we remember it all?
- We don't watch...

1978
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:07,181
drama series all the time.

1979
01:01:07,611 --> 01:01:09,881
How can we remember it all?

1980
01:01:10,991 --> 01:01:12,420
- Raise your hand.
- Bo Gum.

1981
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:13,490
- Goodness.
- Go ahead.

1982
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:15,390
- Okay.
- "Love in the Moonlight."

1983
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,721
"Once Again."

1984
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:20,160
(That sounds like the answer.)

1985
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:22,960
("Once Again," "Love in the Moonlight")

1986
01:01:22,961 --> 01:01:25,771
(The last one is "Bloody Heart.")

1987
01:01:25,871 --> 01:01:29,301
(Bo Gum remembered Han Na standing next to Joon.)

1988
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:30,541
(Will Team Bo Gum tie the score?)

1989
01:01:30,542 --> 01:01:32,641
Three, two...

1990
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:34,211
"Mask."

1991
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:36,211
Incorrect.

1992
01:01:36,781 --> 01:01:37,980
- How many did he get?
- Sang Yi.

1993
01:01:37,981 --> 01:01:39,050
- Sang Yi.
- Five...

1994
01:01:39,051 --> 01:01:40,910
(Trying to copy Bo Gum's answer)

1995
01:01:40,911 --> 01:01:43,051
"Once Again," "Love in the Moonlight,"

1996
01:01:43,081 --> 01:01:44,151
and "Ninja Assasin."

1997
01:01:44,551 --> 01:01:45,990
- Incorrect.
- Bo Gum.

1998
01:01:45,991 --> 01:01:46,991
Bo Gum.

1999
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:49,091
"Once Again."

2000
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:50,721
"Love in the Moonlight."

2001
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,551
"Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Dan."

2002
01:01:52,991 --> 01:01:54,530
- That's not correct.
- I know the answer.

2003
01:01:54,531 --> 01:01:57,360
(That's not correct.)

2004
01:01:57,361 --> 01:01:58,471
- Sang Yi.
- Sang Yi.

2005
01:01:58,501 --> 01:01:59,871
- "Once Again."
- Yes.

2006
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:01,140
- "Love in the Moonlight."
- Yes.

2007
01:02:01,141 --> 01:02:02,470
"Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo."

2008
01:02:02,471 --> 01:02:03,471
Seon Ho! No, I mean Bo Gum.

2009
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:04,471
- Incorrect.
- Bo Gum.

2010
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:05,511
Sang Yi.

2011
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,410
- I know the answers now.
- Sang Yi.

2012
01:02:07,411 --> 01:02:08,917
- Hey, I know the answers.
- It's correct.

2013
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:09,941
- Bo Gum.
- Bo Gum.

2014
01:02:09,942 --> 01:02:11,251
(Are you sure?)

2015
01:02:11,551 --> 01:02:13,251
"Once Again."

2016
01:02:13,351 --> 01:02:15,521
"Love in the Moonlight," and "Bloody Heart."

2017
01:02:16,021 --> 01:02:17,350
- That's right.
- Correct.

2018
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:19,090
(Seon Ho got it correct.)

2019
01:02:19,091 --> 01:02:21,021
Yes!

2020
01:02:21,761 --> 01:02:23,621
- I saw Han Na.
- Correct.

2021
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:26,631
I thought that nobleman was Sang Yi.

2022
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:29,500
Did you make this by cutting out every picture?

2023
01:02:29,501 --> 01:02:31,200
- That's right.
- Thank you.

2024
01:02:31,201 --> 01:02:32,231
Sang Yi...

2025
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:34,030
It's not easy.

2026
01:02:34,031 --> 01:02:36,171
- It's so difficult.
- But it's fun.

2027
01:02:36,271 --> 01:02:37,970
- Everyone.
- I'm not confident.

2028
01:02:37,971 --> 01:02:40,011
- It's so hard.
- I think...

2029
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:42,040
this one is harder than the previous one.

2030
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:43,140
Okay, good.

2031
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:44,657
- Just get one of them.
- I should just dig into one.

2032
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:47,351
- You must be immersed.
- One, two, three!

2033
01:02:47,651 --> 01:02:48,981
- Goodness.
- One...

2034
01:02:49,281 --> 01:02:50,420
(What pictures are on the more difficult round?)

2035
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:52,451
One, two...

2036
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:55,721
(It's full of pink.)

2037
01:02:59,391 --> 01:03:02,901
Three, four, five.

2038
01:03:03,161 --> 01:03:05,071
(5 seconds are up.)

2039
01:03:05,271 --> 01:03:06,430
Okay.

2040
01:03:06,431 --> 01:03:09,141
(What did I just see?)

2041
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:11,371
You're making fun of me.

2042
01:03:11,471 --> 01:03:13,911
If you made that to make fun of me, you're going to pay.

2043
01:03:14,071 --> 01:03:15,711
- Right...
- It's so...

2044
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:18,310
- Name all the food...
- DinDin!

2045
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:19,680
- Bookku Ddoong was eating.
- DinDin!

2046
01:03:19,681 --> 01:03:20,757
- Name all of them?
- All of them.

2047
01:03:20,781 --> 01:03:22,480
(DinDin makes an attempt as soon as he hears the question.)

2048
01:03:22,481 --> 01:03:25,350
Oyster, marinated crab, and mustard greens kimchi.

2049
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:28,621
That's right. I was only memorizing this.

2050
01:03:29,291 --> 01:03:30,320
Is it correct?

2051
01:03:30,321 --> 01:03:32,590
- Correct.
- Yes!

2052
01:03:32,591 --> 01:03:33,690
(DinDin got it.)

2053
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:35,631
I was only memorizing this.

2054
01:03:35,831 --> 01:03:37,700
I was only memorizing the features.

2055
01:03:37,701 --> 01:03:40,071
- He has the sense.
- Mustard greens kimchi.

2056
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:42,571
- That's the only thing I saw.
- Well done.

2057
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:44,870
I wasn't sure if the last one was oyster.

2058
01:03:44,871 --> 01:03:46,770
- Goodness.
- It's amazing.

2059
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:48,280
That's the only thing I looked at.

2060
01:03:48,281 --> 01:03:49,640
Was the first one kimchi?

2061
01:03:49,641 --> 01:03:50,980
- Okay.
- It was the last one.

2062
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:52,980
- I thought it was Pepero.
- Seriously?

2063
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:54,380
I thought it was ribs.

2064
01:03:54,381 --> 01:03:55,950
What did you memorize? What did you see?

2065
01:03:55,951 --> 01:03:57,580
I looked at the forest.

2066
01:03:57,581 --> 01:03:58,621
Okay.

2067
01:03:59,021 --> 01:04:01,221
- The forest.
- It will be asked.

2068
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:03,160
I'm sorry,

2069
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:05,431
but this is a quiz where you have to see the trees.

2070
01:04:05,831 --> 01:04:07,030
This is the next question.

2071
01:04:07,031 --> 01:04:08,660
- You have to do it, Se Yoon.
- I can't remember anything.

2072
01:04:08,661 --> 01:04:10,501
You'd know something since you saw the forest.

2073
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:12,770
Name all the people...

2074
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:14,331
- Sang Yi!
- who weren't Bookku Ddoong.

2075
01:04:14,641 --> 01:04:16,901
Hong Yun Hwa, Taeyeon, and WINTER.

2076
01:04:17,141 --> 01:04:18,510
- There's more.
- Bo Gum!

2077
01:04:18,511 --> 01:04:19,570
- Sang Yi.
- Bo Gum!

2078
01:04:19,571 --> 01:04:20,840
- Bo Gum.
- Bo Gum.

2079
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:24,141
Hong Yun Hwa, NINGNING, Taeyeon,

2080
01:04:24,441 --> 01:04:26,480
Se Yoon. Right. It was except Booku Ddoong.

2081
01:04:26,481 --> 01:04:27,780
- Sang Yi.
- Sae Ho.

2082
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,221
Sae Ho.

2083
01:04:29,351 --> 01:04:32,091
- NINGNING, Taeyeon, - Memorize that.

2084
01:04:32,891 --> 01:04:34,961
And NINGNING.

2085
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:36,860
(He keeps saying NINGNING.)

2086
01:04:36,861 --> 01:04:37,991
And NINGNING.

2087
01:04:38,061 --> 01:04:39,490
(The answer is revealed.)

2088
01:04:39,491 --> 01:04:41,060
(DinDin, Taeyeon, V, Go Eun Ae, GISELLE, )

2089
01:04:41,061 --> 01:04:42,661
(G-DRAGON, Hong Yun Hwa)

2090
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:43,860
- Sang Yi.
- Sang Yi.

2091
01:04:43,861 --> 01:04:45,861
- Sang Yi will go first.
- Sang Yi is ready to go.

2092
01:04:45,931 --> 01:04:47,631
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2093
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:49,141
- Can I say the answer...
- Yes?

2094
01:04:49,301 --> 01:04:51,370
In a soft voice so they don't hear it?

2095
01:04:51,371 --> 01:04:53,210
- No.
- You can't do that.

2096
01:04:53,211 --> 01:04:56,241
- Good!
- You can't do that.

2097
01:04:56,411 --> 01:04:57,440
Just do it like that.

2098
01:04:57,441 --> 01:04:59,711
You're weird, Sang Yi.

2099
01:04:59,781 --> 01:05:00,980
Why are you doing that?

2100
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,451
Listen to him.

2101
01:05:03,121 --> 01:05:04,951
I'll start.

2102
01:05:05,021 --> 01:05:07,151
Go Eun Ae, Hong Yun Hwa,

2103
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:10,091
G-DRAGON, Taeyeon...

2104
01:05:11,191 --> 01:05:12,460
Please look at me.

2105
01:05:12,461 --> 01:05:13,960
(Please look at me.)

2106
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:15,301
What is he doing?

2107
01:05:16,061 --> 01:05:17,630
- Right.
- Okay.

2108
01:05:17,631 --> 01:05:19,201
- He can't hear you.
- This friend?

2109
01:05:19,571 --> 01:05:21,700
(He's suddenly playing The Shout in Silence.)

2110
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:22,841
Lee Joon.

2111
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:26,940
- What?
- Why did you say that?

2112
01:05:26,941 --> 01:05:28,380
- Wasn't that Lee Joon?
- Sang Yi.

2113
01:05:28,381 --> 01:05:29,381
(I told them instead since they couldn't hear you.)

2114
01:05:29,382 --> 01:05:31,110
Why did you say that?

2115
01:05:31,111 --> 01:05:32,111
Wrong!

2116
01:05:32,112 --> 01:05:33,592
(Lee Joon was a wrong answer anyway!)

2117
01:05:33,781 --> 01:05:35,820
- I'll show you for two seconds.
- Okay.

2118
01:05:35,821 --> 01:05:37,881
Just do it like this.

2119
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:39,150
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

2120
01:05:39,151 --> 01:05:40,620
Do it ten times.

2121
01:05:40,621 --> 01:05:42,360
- Two times.
- Was there DinDin?

2122
01:05:42,361 --> 01:05:43,521
There was DinDin.

2123
01:05:44,121 --> 01:05:45,230
One.

2124
01:05:45,231 --> 01:05:46,491
(Flapping)

2125
01:05:46,761 --> 01:05:47,830
Two.

2126
01:05:47,831 --> 01:05:49,501
- Se Yoon! All right!
- I couldn't see!

2127
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:51,130
- Se Yoon!
- I couldn't see!

2128
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:52,131
- Se Yoon! All right!
- I couldn't see!

2129
01:05:52,132 --> 01:05:54,331
You should say "Bo Gum." You said "Se Yoon."

2130
01:05:54,471 --> 01:05:56,241
He has to say "Se Yoon."

2131
01:05:56,501 --> 01:05:58,111
He can say "Se Yoon."

2132
01:05:58,711 --> 01:06:00,840
- Really?
- Please focus!

2133
01:06:00,841 --> 01:06:02,741
Let's please focus.

2134
01:06:02,941 --> 01:06:05,610
We have to bring the flow to our side now.

2135
01:06:05,611 --> 01:06:06,981
- I'll go slowly.
- Okay.

2136
01:06:08,351 --> 01:06:11,151
Taeyeon, Hong Yun Hwa,

2137
01:06:11,821 --> 01:06:14,491
- GISELLE, Go Eun Ae, - GISELLE?

2138
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:16,791
V,

2139
01:06:17,221 --> 01:06:20,891
(He named 5 of them correctly.)

2140
01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:22,901
G-DRAGON...

2141
01:06:23,461 --> 01:06:25,601
(There's only DinDin left.)

2142
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:27,870
(Team Bo Gum would be ahead if he names DinDin.)

2143
01:06:27,871 --> 01:06:28,941
You're there.

2144
01:06:29,541 --> 01:06:30,600
You're there.

2145
01:06:30,601 --> 01:06:33,211
- DinDin is DinDin.
- DinDin is DinDin.

2146
01:06:33,371 --> 01:06:35,510
- Correct!
- Okay!

2147
01:06:35,511 --> 01:06:37,641
(Se Yoon got it correct.)

2148
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:40,010
- Se Yoon was eating me.
- DinDin.

2149
01:06:40,011 --> 01:06:41,651
He was on the third floor. At the top.

2150
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:44,621
This isn't fair. Isn't that right, Sang Yi?

2151
01:06:44,691 --> 01:06:46,550
We three have answered.

2152
01:06:46,551 --> 01:06:48,090
- If we can't eat...
- Only Bo Gum needs to answer.

2153
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:50,067
- Did we get four questions already?
- We shouldn't be relaxed.

2154
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:51,760
- Let's focus.
- The next question...

2155
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:52,931
Here we go.

2156
01:06:53,161 --> 01:06:54,860
You have to see what they're eating as well.

2157
01:06:54,861 --> 01:06:56,030
You have to see the details.

2158
01:06:56,031 --> 01:06:58,701
(Team Bo Gum will get to eat if Bo Gum gets it correct.)

2159
01:06:58,831 --> 01:07:00,030
- You get it, right?
- One, two,

2160
01:07:00,031 --> 01:07:01,840
- Check what's there.
- three!

2161
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:02,971
Three!

2162
01:07:03,401 --> 01:07:06,141
(There are people and numbers.)

2163
01:07:11,311 --> 01:07:12,980
- This is hard. There are numbers.
- Okay.

2164
01:07:12,981 --> 01:07:14,820
- One, two, - What is this?

2165
01:07:14,821 --> 01:07:17,851
Three, four, five.

2166
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:18,950
- This is hard.
- It's really hard.

2167
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:19,990
- Sang Yi!
- Right.

2168
01:07:19,991 --> 01:07:21,760
(He makes an attempt before he hears the question.)

2169
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:23,161
You called for it.

2170
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:24,661
Five times eight is thirty-six.

2171
01:07:25,231 --> 01:07:26,390
What?

2172
01:07:26,391 --> 01:07:27,431
(Laughing)

2173
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,860
- The question...
- We can answer it slowly.

2174
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:31,100
Is really hard.

2175
01:07:31,101 --> 01:07:32,870
- It's so hard. I barely saw them.
- The question...

2176
01:07:32,871 --> 01:07:34,131
The difficulty...

2177
01:07:34,331 --> 01:07:35,970
I'll give you the question.

2178
01:07:35,971 --> 01:07:39,541
Name all the people who are making hearts with their hands.

2179
01:07:39,611 --> 01:07:40,870
I didn't see that.

2180
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:42,641
The numbers were a trick.

2181
01:07:43,281 --> 01:07:44,950
- He's going his way...
- You can't get this.

2182
01:07:44,951 --> 01:07:46,481
I don't even know who was there.

2183
01:07:46,981 --> 01:07:49,681
- Bo Gum! Let's go.
- Finger heart.

2184
01:07:49,821 --> 01:07:51,251
- You can't see it.
- Bo Gum!

2185
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:52,521
- Bo Gum!
- Focus.

2186
01:07:53,091 --> 01:07:54,150
What?

2187
01:07:54,151 --> 01:07:55,161
(Don't do that, Bo Gum.)

2188
01:07:55,221 --> 01:07:56,261
Please.

2189
01:07:56,561 --> 01:07:57,691
IU and Hye Ri.

2190
01:07:58,461 --> 01:08:00,431
- Goodness.
- Wrong! It's wrong!

2191
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:02,060
- Wrong.
- I thought it was correct.

2192
01:08:02,061 --> 01:08:03,100
He saw two people, at least.

2193
01:08:03,101 --> 01:08:05,400
I couldn't even see who were there.

2194
01:08:05,401 --> 01:08:07,270
Who was the man sitting at the side?

2195
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:10,140
The man wearing a white suit.

2196
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:11,411
- Bo Gum!
- What?

2197
01:08:12,011 --> 01:08:14,811
- Yes!
- Five, four, three,

2198
01:08:14,981 --> 01:08:16,911
- two, one.
- Really?

2199
01:08:17,111 --> 01:08:18,611
- Park Bo Gum, - Yes.

2200
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,281
- Byeon Woo Seok, - Yes.

2201
01:08:21,081 --> 01:08:23,021
(It was Byeon Woo Seok!)

2202
01:08:23,521 --> 01:08:24,651
IU, and Hye Ri.

2203
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:25,921
That's crazy.

2204
01:08:26,621 --> 01:08:27,750
- Really?
- Really?

2205
01:08:27,751 --> 01:08:29,221
(He's certain.)

2206
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:30,491
- Really?
- Really?

2207
01:08:30,996 --> 01:08:32,036
IU, and Hye Ri.

2208
01:08:32,306 --> 01:08:33,366
That's crazy.

2209
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:35,235
- Really?
- Really?

2210
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,736
(He's certain.)

2211
01:08:36,976 --> 01:08:38,076
- Really?
- Really?

2212
01:08:38,476 --> 01:08:39,506
Wrong!

2213
01:08:40,106 --> 01:08:41,646
- First...
- I have no idea.

2214
01:08:41,816 --> 01:08:43,346
(The answer is revealed.)

2215
01:08:43,716 --> 01:08:45,685
(IU)

2216
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:47,615
(Byeon Woo Seok)

2217
01:08:47,616 --> 01:08:49,456
(Hye Ri)

2218
01:08:49,786 --> 01:08:52,256
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2219
01:08:52,426 --> 01:08:54,286
- Sae Ho.
- You're almost there.

2220
01:08:55,056 --> 01:08:56,495
- Byeon Woo Seok.
- And?

2221
01:08:56,496 --> 01:08:58,926
It wasn't Park Bo Gum. It was Choo Young Woo.

2222
01:08:59,366 --> 01:09:00,626
- Wrong!
- That's wrong?

2223
01:09:00,696 --> 01:09:01,796
Good. It's our turn.

2224
01:09:02,236 --> 01:09:03,996
- I'll give you a hint.
- Yes.

2225
01:09:04,036 --> 01:09:06,435
- The...
- Can I just trust myself and go?

2226
01:09:06,436 --> 01:09:08,276
- Sure. Go ahead.
- Sang Yi.

2227
01:09:08,676 --> 01:09:09,775
Do you not need a hint?

2228
01:09:09,776 --> 01:09:10,835
I'll just go.

2229
01:09:10,836 --> 01:09:12,996
- You can just try too.
- I'll go with my gut feeling.

2230
01:09:13,446 --> 01:09:14,846
Hye Ri, IU,

2231
01:09:15,176 --> 01:09:16,815
- Byeon Woo Seok, - Right!

2232
01:09:16,816 --> 01:09:18,685
- That's right.
- Just name them.

2233
01:09:18,686 --> 01:09:20,016
Name people you didn't see.

2234
01:09:21,086 --> 01:09:22,186
Lim Ji Yeon?

2235
01:09:22,316 --> 01:09:24,416
(Shocked)

2236
01:09:24,686 --> 01:09:26,226
Lim Ji Yeon?

2237
01:09:27,626 --> 01:09:29,726
- Okay. It's us.
- I think he got it wrong.

2238
01:09:29,856 --> 01:09:33,026
Ji Yeon didn't make a finger heart. She was waving.

2239
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:34,296
Correct.

2240
01:09:34,766 --> 01:09:35,796
Really?

2241
01:09:36,766 --> 01:09:38,936
- That's right.
- Really? Let's see.

2242
01:09:39,066 --> 01:09:41,406
- Ji Yeon was doing this.
- We can't see it.

2243
01:09:41,506 --> 01:09:43,235
There are more questions.

2244
01:09:43,236 --> 01:09:44,406
Right. It's okay.

2245
01:09:44,706 --> 01:09:46,145
- You guessed.
- I really guessed.

2246
01:09:46,146 --> 01:09:47,646
It's amazing.

2247
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:49,975
Please put in a little more effort, Bo Gum.

2248
01:09:49,976 --> 01:09:51,176
Okay.

2249
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:52,885
You have to. They only have two people left.

2250
01:09:52,886 --> 01:09:54,115
You're doing so well.

2251
01:09:54,116 --> 01:09:56,756
Jong Min is good at taking your answers.

2252
01:09:56,886 --> 01:09:58,425
- You have to be careful of that.
- Okay.

2253
01:09:58,426 --> 01:09:59,826
He takes your answers well.

2254
01:10:00,086 --> 01:10:01,355
- Go with fake answers.
- He might take it.

2255
01:10:01,356 --> 01:10:02,396
Let's start.

2256
01:10:02,826 --> 01:10:03,896
Here.

2257
01:10:04,226 --> 01:10:07,126
One, two, three,

2258
01:10:07,396 --> 01:10:09,166
- Goodness.
- four, five!

2259
01:10:09,736 --> 01:10:12,166
- It's so difficult.
- I couldn't see it well.

2260
01:10:12,266 --> 01:10:13,635
- Okay.
- I feel like the question...

2261
01:10:13,636 --> 01:10:14,976
would be about me.

2262
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:16,336
For this question,

2263
01:10:17,436 --> 01:10:19,605
you have to say the right reason to get it correct.

2264
01:10:19,606 --> 01:10:21,246
- A reason?
- You need to say the reason?

2265
01:10:21,476 --> 01:10:23,475
You have to say the right reason to get it correct.

2266
01:10:23,476 --> 01:10:25,716
If Lee Sang Yi and Lee Jun Young...

2267
01:10:26,716 --> 01:10:29,616
fight each other, who would win?

2268
01:10:30,816 --> 01:10:33,355
(He looks perplexed because of the unexpected question.)

2269
01:10:33,356 --> 01:10:35,596
Hurry and answer.

2270
01:10:35,756 --> 01:10:38,295
I'd like to change the game.

2271
01:10:38,296 --> 01:10:39,625
- Do you mean the question?
- Right.

2272
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:42,466
(Did you notice the answer?)

2273
01:10:42,896 --> 01:10:44,066
- Sae Ho.
- What?

2274
01:10:44,936 --> 01:10:47,266
When Lee Jun Young...

2275
01:10:47,466 --> 01:10:50,135
and Lee Sang Yi fight, Lee Sang Yi could win.

2276
01:10:50,136 --> 01:10:52,405
That's because Lee Jun Young has to fight alone,

2277
01:10:52,406 --> 01:10:55,345
while there are two Lee Sang Yis.

2278
01:10:55,346 --> 01:10:56,716
It's a 2 versus 1 fight.

2279
01:10:56,846 --> 01:10:58,645
- It's accurate.
- Wrong!

2280
01:10:58,646 --> 01:11:00,086
There were two Lee Sang Yis.

2281
01:11:00,146 --> 01:11:01,315
- There were more.
- You're wrong.

2282
01:11:01,316 --> 01:11:02,332
(Having more people doesn't guarantee victory.)

2283
01:11:02,356 --> 01:11:05,285
(Bo Gum is in deep thought.)

2284
01:11:05,286 --> 01:11:06,456
It's Bo Gum's turn.

2285
01:11:06,656 --> 01:11:08,556
- Bo Gum.
- Really?

2286
01:11:08,696 --> 01:11:09,795
Don't be burdened.

2287
01:11:09,796 --> 01:11:10,896
- I'll go.
- Yes.

2288
01:11:10,956 --> 01:11:13,866
(If Bo Gum gets it right, the game will be over.)

2289
01:11:14,326 --> 01:11:16,636
Jun Young was holding his fist.

2290
01:11:17,266 --> 01:11:19,305
Sang Yi was playing paper.

2291
01:11:19,306 --> 01:11:21,135
- My goodness!
- My goodness!

2292
01:11:21,136 --> 01:11:22,505
(Sang Yi wins in rock-paper-scissors?)

2293
01:11:22,506 --> 01:11:23,535
You made that approach?

2294
01:11:23,536 --> 01:11:24,735
- My goodness!
- My goodness!

2295
01:11:24,736 --> 01:11:26,876
- Gosh!
- No way!

2296
01:11:27,006 --> 01:11:28,546
Is this rock-paper-scissors?

2297
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:29,875
- It can't be.
- Correct.

2298
01:11:29,876 --> 01:11:33,016
(Bo Gum is correct.)

2299
01:11:33,416 --> 01:11:35,615
(Bo Gum finally did it!)

2300
01:11:35,616 --> 01:11:36,755
- What?
- What?

2301
01:11:36,756 --> 01:11:38,826
- Gosh!
- Gosh, that was insane!

2302
01:11:39,556 --> 01:11:40,556
Gosh!

2303
01:11:40,856 --> 01:11:42,355
For Spotting People in the Moment,

2304
01:11:42,356 --> 01:11:44,236
- Team Bo Gum takes the win.
- This is amazing.

2305
01:11:44,456 --> 01:11:45,895
- Yes!
- Bo Gum!

2306
01:11:45,896 --> 01:11:48,535
This mission was for the pike conger shabu shabu,

2307
01:11:48,536 --> 01:11:50,095
- and Team Bo Gum wins.
- Yes!

2308
01:11:50,096 --> 01:11:51,395
(Bo Gum's brilliance shined at the last moment.)

2309
01:11:51,396 --> 01:11:52,435
- But this was...
- We didn't even get any coffee.

2310
01:11:52,436 --> 01:11:53,605
We didn't even get any coffee.

2311
01:11:53,606 --> 01:11:55,206
- We didn't even get the bread.
- Right.

2312
01:11:55,876 --> 01:11:57,906
Gosh, I felt so nervous.

2313
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:01,505
They're eating right in front of us like this?

2314
01:12:01,506 --> 01:12:02,615
This is the worst.

2315
01:12:02,616 --> 01:12:04,745
This feels so stressful.

2316
01:12:04,746 --> 01:12:06,506
(Not being able to eat is upsetting enough.)

2317
01:12:06,886 --> 01:12:10,356
(Empty, stacked)

2318
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:14,926
(Front row seat of the eating show)

2319
01:12:14,986 --> 01:12:17,155
You all are hungry, right?

2320
01:12:17,156 --> 01:12:18,425
- Yes.
- Yes.

2321
01:12:18,426 --> 01:12:20,295
This is today's lunch.

2322
01:12:20,296 --> 01:12:22,935
Its taste and nutrients enhance starting from April,

2323
01:12:22,936 --> 01:12:24,272
and it is the representative dish of Yeosu.

2324
01:12:24,296 --> 01:12:25,535
It's the pike conger shabu shabu.

2325
01:12:25,536 --> 01:12:27,636
(One of Yeosu's top 10 dishes)

2326
01:12:31,676 --> 01:12:33,645
Gosh, the pike conger looks amazing!

2327
01:12:33,646 --> 01:12:35,726
(An invigorating ingredient sent from the clean sea)

2328
01:12:36,676 --> 01:12:37,775
It looks like a flower.

2329
01:12:37,776 --> 01:12:39,386
Really? A flower?

2330
01:12:41,986 --> 01:12:44,715
(The raw pike conger becomes savory with each bite.)

2331
01:12:44,716 --> 01:12:46,055
- It's amazing.
- I don't think I've ever had...

2332
01:12:46,056 --> 01:12:47,985
- the pike conger shabu shabu.
- This?

2333
01:12:47,986 --> 01:12:49,986
- It's a must.
- You need to be here to have this.

2334
01:12:50,896 --> 01:12:52,125
Enjoy your meal!

2335
01:12:52,126 --> 01:12:54,126
- Enjoy your meal.
- This is insane! Look at this!

2336
01:12:54,526 --> 01:12:56,666
- Are you okay, Sang Yi?
- No.

2337
01:12:58,366 --> 01:13:01,206
(I can't have the food that is right in front of me.)

2338
01:13:01,336 --> 01:13:02,476
Place this here.

2339
01:13:03,206 --> 01:13:05,606
(Bo Gum starts laughing after spotting something.)

2340
01:13:05,876 --> 01:13:06,905
(Laughing)

2341
01:13:06,906 --> 01:13:08,875
Joon's eyebags have become darker.

2342
01:13:08,876 --> 01:13:10,615
- Right.
- Enjoy your meal!

2343
01:13:10,616 --> 01:13:11,675
Joon!

2344
01:13:11,676 --> 01:13:13,385
I'll do it for you as you went through a lot.

2345
01:13:13,386 --> 01:13:14,985
- Enjoy your meal!
- Thank you.

2346
01:13:14,986 --> 01:13:17,085
- Give it a try.
- Try this first.

2347
01:13:17,086 --> 01:13:18,185
- Make a wrap.
- Give it a try.

2348
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:19,755
Do you eat raw fish, Bo Gum?

2349
01:13:19,756 --> 01:13:21,325
- Yes. I like raw fish.
- You do?

2350
01:13:21,326 --> 01:13:23,025
- This is a treat.
- Is that so?

2351
01:13:23,026 --> 01:13:24,155
(Fortunately, everyone is a seafood lover.)

2352
01:13:24,156 --> 01:13:25,695
Before you have this,

2353
01:13:25,696 --> 01:13:29,066
try the raw pike conger as an appetizer.

2354
01:13:29,436 --> 01:13:31,465
- Let's enjoy our meal.
- Thank you for the meal!

2355
01:13:31,466 --> 01:13:32,665
- Thank you!
- Gosh.

2356
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:34,105
(Excited)

2357
01:13:34,106 --> 01:13:35,905
Make a wrap with the perilla leaf.

2358
01:13:35,906 --> 01:13:37,906
- Have it with the makjang.
- Place it right here.

2359
01:13:38,036 --> 01:13:39,676
Put in a lot at once.

2360
01:13:39,876 --> 01:13:41,545
Eat comfortably.

2361
01:13:41,546 --> 01:13:43,116
(Mouth watering)

2362
01:13:43,176 --> 01:13:44,645
Can I put in this much, Se Yoon?

2363
01:13:44,646 --> 01:13:46,585
- You can put in more.
- Put in more. What is that?

2364
01:13:46,586 --> 01:13:48,686
- Do it again.
- We're the only ones eating.

2365
01:13:49,116 --> 01:13:51,016
- Really?
- Isn't that too big?

2366
01:13:51,356 --> 01:13:53,586
- Let's make a toast with our wraps.
- Go ahead.

2367
01:13:54,026 --> 01:13:55,556
- Let's get our wraps ready.
- Right.

2368
01:13:55,926 --> 01:13:57,455
Let's cheer up with this.

2369
01:13:57,456 --> 01:13:59,525
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

2370
01:13:59,526 --> 01:14:01,125
Do you know how bad Bo Gum is feeling right now?

2371
01:14:01,126 --> 01:14:02,995
I do feel bad about this.

2372
01:14:02,996 --> 01:14:04,865
Just choose to eat, Bo Gum.

2373
01:14:04,866 --> 01:14:06,665
But as I do this every week,

2374
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:08,906
I can't see them at all.

2375
01:14:09,106 --> 01:14:10,376
That's what it's like now.

2376
01:14:11,036 --> 01:14:13,446
(I'm jealous.)

2377
01:14:13,746 --> 01:14:15,005
Try this first.

2378
01:14:15,006 --> 01:14:18,346
(Taking a big bite after opening wide)

2379
01:14:21,146 --> 01:14:22,632
Are we not allowed to have the vegetables too?

2380
01:14:22,656 --> 01:14:25,016
(Eating it with just the soy sauce to enjoy its true taste)

2381
01:14:25,356 --> 01:14:27,556
Gosh, it's good. It's savory.

2382
01:14:27,826 --> 01:14:29,296
Try this first.

2383
01:14:29,856 --> 01:14:31,295
- Go ahead and eat.
- I personally think...

2384
01:14:31,296 --> 01:14:32,325
you look really handsome.

2385
01:14:32,326 --> 01:14:33,726
May I take a picture of you?

2386
01:14:34,096 --> 01:14:35,166
One, two, three.

2387
01:14:35,866 --> 01:14:37,195
- Gosh.
- He looks totally different.

2388
01:14:37,196 --> 01:14:38,466
(You look stunning, Bo Gum.)

2389
01:14:39,236 --> 01:14:40,536
This is like a commercial.

2390
01:14:40,606 --> 01:14:41,665
Is this bone-in sliced pike conger?

2391
01:14:41,666 --> 01:14:43,375
- Yes.
- Gosh, it's so good.

2392
01:14:43,376 --> 01:14:45,036
- How is it?
- It's amazing, isn't it?

2393
01:14:45,446 --> 01:14:46,846
How is it?

2394
01:14:48,246 --> 01:14:49,845
Really? It's that good?

2395
01:14:49,846 --> 01:14:50,946
Is it chewy?

2396
01:14:52,386 --> 01:14:53,546
It's chewy...

2397
01:14:54,016 --> 01:14:55,685
- How does it taste?
- and savory.

2398
01:14:55,686 --> 01:14:57,415
Right. The savoriness is amazing.

2399
01:14:57,416 --> 01:15:00,025
- Really?
- You can't really feel the bones.

2400
01:15:00,026 --> 01:15:02,395
It's different from the eel dishes we are used to, right?

2401
01:15:02,396 --> 01:15:03,995
- It's like tartar sauce.
- I'll do it for you.

2402
01:15:03,996 --> 01:15:05,056
(It's soft.)

2403
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:07,325
(Eating)

2404
01:15:07,326 --> 01:15:08,866
- Was that it?
- Yes.

2405
01:15:10,736 --> 01:15:11,736
(The good-looking ones love it.)

2406
01:15:11,737 --> 01:15:13,506
- It's really good.
- It's good.

2407
01:15:16,336 --> 01:15:18,135
This can actually be eaten as is.

2408
01:15:18,136 --> 01:15:21,105
Just blanch it slightly on the outside...

2409
01:15:21,106 --> 01:15:22,266
and take it back out quickly.

2410
01:15:22,946 --> 01:15:26,086
Look at how it looks. It's so bouncy.

2411
01:15:27,346 --> 01:15:28,685
(I can see it.)

2412
01:15:28,686 --> 01:15:30,186
I guess all the bones were removed.

2413
01:15:31,516 --> 01:15:33,056
This is amazing.

2414
01:15:33,156 --> 01:15:34,985
This must be eaten when visiting Yeosu.

2415
01:15:34,986 --> 01:15:36,896
(This is paradise.)

2416
01:15:37,856 --> 01:15:39,895
It's fluffy on the outside...

2417
01:15:39,896 --> 01:15:41,595
and as you chew inside,

2418
01:15:41,596 --> 01:15:44,235
you can taste the chewiness and savoriness of raw fish.

2419
01:15:44,236 --> 01:15:46,135
Just dip it slightly in the soy sauce.

2420
01:15:46,136 --> 01:15:48,656
(When you dip it slightly into the soy sauce and take a bite, )

2421
01:15:48,976 --> 01:15:51,536
(it's fluffy on the outside and chewy on the inside.)

2422
01:15:51,876 --> 01:15:53,446
- This time, - Thank you.

2423
01:15:53,506 --> 01:15:55,376
Try it by placing it on the onion slice.

2424
01:15:55,616 --> 01:15:56,975
Just the makjang and onion slice.

2425
01:15:56,976 --> 01:15:58,786
(Onion, pike conger, and makjang combination)

2426
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:00,546
(Eating)

2427
01:16:01,216 --> 01:16:03,016
It's amazing with the onion.

2428
01:16:03,456 --> 01:16:04,615
It's good, isn't it?

2429
01:16:04,616 --> 01:16:06,026
(This is a good combination.)

2430
01:16:06,826 --> 01:16:09,556
(Enjoy Bo Gum's eating show.)

2431
01:16:11,896 --> 01:16:13,296
(Chewing)

2432
01:16:18,236 --> 01:16:19,306
It's so good.

2433
01:16:20,336 --> 01:16:21,336
(Amazed)

2434
01:16:21,337 --> 01:16:22,812
- It's so good.
- It's good, isn't it?

2435
01:16:22,836 --> 01:16:24,536
I get it now.

2436
01:16:24,676 --> 01:16:26,406
It's really soft.

2437
01:16:26,646 --> 01:16:28,715
- It just melts in your mouth.
- It melts?

2438
01:16:28,716 --> 01:16:30,145
The raw pike conger needed to be chewed,

2439
01:16:30,146 --> 01:16:31,275
but this just melts in your mouth.

2440
01:16:31,276 --> 01:16:33,245
- It just disappears in your mouth.
- Right.

2441
01:16:33,246 --> 01:16:34,716
(Soft as cotton candy)

2442
01:16:34,846 --> 01:16:37,386
You can taste the chewiness and savoriness of raw fish.

2443
01:16:37,486 --> 01:16:38,932
Just dip it slightly in the soy sauce.

2444
01:16:38,956 --> 01:16:40,025
Gosh.

2445
01:16:40,026 --> 01:16:41,585
(A taste that just makes you groan)

2446
01:16:41,586 --> 01:16:42,696
This is crazy.

2447
01:16:42,926 --> 01:16:44,755
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2448
01:16:44,756 --> 01:16:46,826
(Reaching his limit of patience)

2449
01:16:46,926 --> 01:16:48,466
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

2450
01:16:49,796 --> 01:16:50,865
- It doesn't taste like fish?
- Team Sang Yi.

2451
01:16:50,866 --> 01:16:51,896
- Yes?
- Yes?

2452
01:16:52,366 --> 01:16:53,906
You have to eat.

2453
01:16:54,066 --> 01:16:55,235
- Yes.
- Of course.

2454
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:57,235
- Then...
- Sang Yi is struggling right now.

2455
01:16:57,236 --> 01:17:00,406
Team Sang Yi will be served with lunch as well.

2456
01:17:01,446 --> 01:17:03,446
(Excited)

2457
01:17:03,546 --> 01:17:05,275
- Please serve them.
- We don't make people starve.

2458
01:17:05,276 --> 01:17:07,015
- What is that?
- We don't make people starve.

2459
01:17:07,016 --> 01:17:08,655
- What?
- What?

2460
01:17:08,656 --> 01:17:10,155
- Are you serious?
- What is that?

2461
01:17:10,156 --> 01:17:12,385
Sang Yi did ask about having vegetables earlier.

2462
01:17:12,386 --> 01:17:14,232
(Losing team's dish, vegetables and assorted mushrooms)

2463
01:17:14,256 --> 01:17:16,025
This is a feast.

2464
01:17:16,026 --> 01:17:18,826
- We just eat it like this?
- Can we put it in here?

2465
01:17:19,126 --> 01:17:21,472
- That mustn't be the case.
- We can have it as shabu shabu?

2466
01:17:21,496 --> 01:17:24,365
If the winning team allows it,

2467
01:17:24,366 --> 01:17:25,966
using the broth will be okay.

2468
01:17:26,366 --> 01:17:28,635
- Can we use the broth?
- Of course.

2469
01:17:28,636 --> 01:17:29,805
Go ahead.

2470
01:17:29,806 --> 01:17:31,112
(Gladly letting them use the broth)

2471
01:17:31,136 --> 01:17:33,345
Let's think the mushrooms are pieces of meat.

2472
01:17:33,346 --> 01:17:35,006
Right. Let's do that.

2473
01:17:35,476 --> 01:17:38,276
- But still...
- I'm saying this out of concern.

2474
01:17:38,576 --> 01:17:41,145
You can't be eating the pike conger by accident.

2475
01:17:41,146 --> 01:17:43,486
- Of course not. Come on!
- Come on!

2476
01:17:43,656 --> 01:17:45,156
That's a bit disappointing to hear.

2477
01:17:45,216 --> 01:17:48,085
I'll get rid of the ladle so they can just get the vegetables.

2478
01:17:48,086 --> 01:17:50,595
- Okay. That sounds good.
- They can't be drinking the soup.

2479
01:17:50,596 --> 01:17:52,195
We can't have any of the soup?

2480
01:17:52,196 --> 01:17:53,895
- No. Just the vegetables.
- Why not?

2481
01:17:53,896 --> 01:17:55,136
- Just the vegetables?
- Right.

2482
01:17:56,766 --> 01:17:59,666
(This isn't a mushroom. It's a piece of beef.)

2483
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:03,336
(He feels grateful with the vegetables alone.)

2484
01:18:05,006 --> 01:18:06,776
Isn't that too much?

2485
01:18:06,906 --> 01:18:07,975
Gosh, Jong Min.

2486
01:18:07,976 --> 01:18:09,775
This isn't being considerate about others at all.

2487
01:18:09,776 --> 01:18:10,876
(Selfish use of the broth)

2488
01:18:11,116 --> 01:18:13,215
The mushroom looks really good, to be honest.

2489
01:18:13,216 --> 01:18:14,315
Would you like to make a trade?

2490
01:18:14,316 --> 01:18:16,156
A trade with the mushroom and the pike conger?

2491
01:18:16,186 --> 01:18:17,985
Really? Can we do that?

2492
01:18:17,986 --> 01:18:20,326
- Should we do that?
- Bo Gum wants the mushroom.

2493
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:22,395
- That can't happen.
- No?

2494
01:18:22,396 --> 01:18:23,496
(That can't happen.)

2495
01:18:24,226 --> 01:18:25,395
Don't do that.

2496
01:18:25,396 --> 01:18:27,426
What? He drank the soup!

2497
01:18:27,966 --> 01:18:29,635
(A natural sip of the soup)

2498
01:18:29,636 --> 01:18:31,495
- Wasn't having the soup allowed?
- No.

2499
01:18:31,496 --> 01:18:33,265
You can only put the vegetables in the broth.

2500
01:18:33,266 --> 01:18:34,412
(DinDin just had to catch him.)

2501
01:18:34,436 --> 01:18:36,605
I didn't expect this show to be this strict.

2502
01:18:36,606 --> 01:18:37,676
Sang Yi.

2503
01:18:38,036 --> 01:18:39,645
It's not just Sang Yi.

2504
01:18:39,646 --> 01:18:41,346
Joon,

2505
01:18:41,576 --> 01:18:43,745
- Jong Min, and Sae Ho...
- What?

2506
01:18:43,746 --> 01:18:45,416
Must want to eat more.

2507
01:18:45,516 --> 01:18:47,545
- One person can be saved?
- We have a few questions left.

2508
01:18:47,546 --> 01:18:49,116
- Okay.
- Right.

2509
01:18:49,216 --> 01:18:50,615
- Sure.
- Just one person.

2510
01:18:50,616 --> 01:18:53,226
- I want to save one of them.
- Let's let that happen.

2511
01:18:53,356 --> 01:18:55,286
The first person to answer the question.

2512
01:18:55,896 --> 01:18:57,195
If they get it right...

2513
01:18:57,196 --> 01:18:58,596
(Full participation)

2514
01:18:58,756 --> 01:18:59,895
How does a raw pike conger wrap...

2515
01:18:59,896 --> 01:19:01,865
and three pieces of the shabu shabu sound?

2516
01:19:01,866 --> 01:19:04,096
- Okay.
- Three pieces? Let's do it.

2517
01:19:04,496 --> 01:19:06,635
- All right.
- Hurry! We don't have time.

2518
01:19:06,636 --> 01:19:08,436
(The relief mission begins.)

2519
01:19:08,736 --> 01:19:11,336
All right. It will be revealed for just five seconds.

2520
01:19:12,506 --> 01:19:14,776
One, two, three!

2521
01:19:14,906 --> 01:19:16,576
- Take a picture in your head.
- One.

2522
01:19:20,146 --> 01:19:23,486
- Three, four, five.
- What is that?

2523
01:19:24,156 --> 01:19:25,216
Okay!

2524
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:27,856
- Here's the question.
- It's a hard one.

2525
01:19:28,056 --> 01:19:29,336
I have no idea what it could be.

2526
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:31,295
Name all the people...

2527
01:19:31,296 --> 01:19:32,616
- who have red hats on.
- Sae Ho!

2528
01:19:32,926 --> 01:19:35,696
Park Bo Gum, Heo Sung Tae,

2529
01:19:36,296 --> 01:19:37,296
and Moon Se Yoon.

2530
01:19:37,297 --> 01:19:38,396
- What?
- What?

2531
01:19:39,136 --> 01:19:40,466
- That's incorrect.
- Really?

2532
01:19:41,506 --> 01:19:42,506
Incorrect.

2533
01:19:42,776 --> 01:19:44,006
- Lee Joon.
- Joon.

2534
01:19:44,476 --> 01:19:46,806
Park Bo Gum, Heo Sung Tae, Cho Sae Ho.

2535
01:19:47,376 --> 01:19:48,376
- No.
- Incorrect.

2536
01:19:48,377 --> 01:19:49,416
DinDin!

2537
01:19:49,946 --> 01:19:50,975
- I know!
- Jong Min!

2538
01:19:50,976 --> 01:19:52,145
- DinDin!
- You seem to know, so you can't.

2539
01:19:52,146 --> 01:19:53,615
(Learn when to join in, Cheol.)

2540
01:19:53,616 --> 01:19:54,716
Sae Ho!

2541
01:19:54,886 --> 01:19:58,055
Park Bo Gum, Heo Sung Tae, Kim Jong Min.

2542
01:19:58,056 --> 01:19:59,126
He's right.

2543
01:19:59,956 --> 01:20:00,985
Is that the answer?

2544
01:20:00,986 --> 01:20:03,056
(Will that be the right answer?)

2545
01:20:03,326 --> 01:20:04,956
- Correct.
- Thank you.

2546
01:20:05,696 --> 01:20:07,565
But this was to give Sang Yi a chance to eat.

2547
01:20:07,566 --> 01:20:08,695
(Sae Ho takes away Sang Yi's chance to eat.)

2548
01:20:08,696 --> 01:20:09,795
- He ate a lot.
- Gosh.

2549
01:20:09,796 --> 01:20:11,435
That was unbelievable.

2550
01:20:11,436 --> 01:20:12,936
- Gosh.
- Come on, Sae Ho!

2551
01:20:13,466 --> 01:20:16,776
(Heo Sung Tae, Park Bo Gum, Kim Jong Min)

2552
01:20:16,876 --> 01:20:19,246
(The pike conger goes into Sae Ho's mouth.)

2553
01:20:21,476 --> 01:20:23,015
- I'm sorry. I just had to.
- All right, everyone.

2554
01:20:23,016 --> 01:20:24,576
(Look here, everyone.)

2555
01:20:24,716 --> 01:20:26,346
- One more person will be saved.
- Okay.

2556
01:20:26,546 --> 01:20:28,185
- Sure.
- We still have a lot of food.

2557
01:20:28,186 --> 01:20:29,315
I must take this chance.

2558
01:20:29,316 --> 01:20:30,356
(Desperate)

2559
01:20:30,516 --> 01:20:31,815
- Good luck!
- Here it comes.

2560
01:20:31,816 --> 01:20:32,856
(Let's go, Sang Yi!)

2561
01:20:33,056 --> 01:20:35,056
One, two, three!

2562
01:20:35,596 --> 01:20:37,355
- One, two, three, - Five, eight, three, two, seven,

2563
01:20:37,356 --> 01:20:38,796
one, four, six.

2564
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:40,866
Four, five.

2565
01:20:41,696 --> 01:20:42,766
This is hard.

2566
01:20:42,996 --> 01:20:44,996
- Bo Gum.
- The number?

2567
01:20:45,496 --> 01:20:47,235
What was the color of his handkerchief?

2568
01:20:47,236 --> 01:20:48,266
Sang Yi.

2569
01:20:48,336 --> 01:20:50,176
- Handkerchief?
- I'm not sure.

2570
01:20:50,936 --> 01:20:52,506
- Blue.
- Incorrect.

2571
01:20:52,906 --> 01:20:54,745
- Lee Joon! Black.
- Joon!

2572
01:20:54,746 --> 01:20:56,746
- Sorry?
- MBLAQ.

2573
01:20:57,676 --> 01:20:59,545
- DinDin!
- Sang Yi!

2574
01:20:59,546 --> 01:21:01,045
(Why do you keep butting in?)

2575
01:21:01,046 --> 01:21:03,016
- Sang Yi.
- Sang Yi.

2576
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:04,316
White.

2577
01:21:04,386 --> 01:21:05,456
Incorrect.

2578
01:21:05,556 --> 01:21:07,426
- Lee Joon!
- What are you doing, Sang Yi?

2579
01:21:07,626 --> 01:21:08,626
Purple.

2580
01:21:09,126 --> 01:21:10,495
- Sang Yi...
- Correct.

2581
01:21:10,496 --> 01:21:11,925
(Lee Joon is correct.)

2582
01:21:11,926 --> 01:21:12,965
Lee Joon.

2583
01:21:12,966 --> 01:21:14,196
(Finally!)

2584
01:21:17,866 --> 01:21:20,206
(Joon joins them to enjoy pike conger.)

2585
01:21:21,766 --> 01:21:23,535
Aren't we doing it again? The last one, seriously.

2586
01:21:23,536 --> 01:21:25,175
Jong Min, do you want to take this to the end?

2587
01:21:25,176 --> 01:21:26,205
Let's do that.

2588
01:21:26,206 --> 01:21:27,906
(Let's see it through to the end.)

2589
01:21:28,506 --> 01:21:30,846
This is the last round, Sang Yi.

2590
01:21:31,076 --> 01:21:33,946
One, two. Ta-da.

2591
01:21:34,246 --> 01:21:35,446
Jong Min!

2592
01:21:35,586 --> 01:21:37,385
Jong Min. Twelve.

2593
01:21:37,386 --> 01:21:38,462
(Jong Min gets the chance first.)

2594
01:21:38,486 --> 01:21:39,486
Jong Min is correct.

2595
01:21:39,487 --> 01:21:41,626
(The pike conger is mine.)

2596
01:21:42,256 --> 01:21:45,526
(The question to save Sang Yi saved everyone except for Sang Yi.)

2597
01:21:45,996 --> 01:21:47,666
- He's our guest, after all.
- Yes.

2598
01:21:47,826 --> 01:21:49,495
He should have at least one bite. He came all the way here to Yeosu.

2599
01:21:49,496 --> 01:21:50,935
He couldn't sleep in the morning.

2600
01:21:50,936 --> 01:21:53,436
Okay. Let's do that. What about just one bite?

2601
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:55,135
- One bite?
- Sang Yi's one bite.

2602
01:21:55,136 --> 01:21:56,136
Yes. One bite.

2603
01:21:56,137 --> 01:21:57,936
But he can eat only one bite.

2604
01:21:57,976 --> 01:21:59,276
He can't continue eating.

2605
01:21:59,676 --> 01:22:01,946
(Giving it a try)

2606
01:22:02,006 --> 01:22:03,915
You need some of the onions.

2607
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:05,715
I'll add the pickled onion.

2608
01:22:05,716 --> 01:22:06,716
- The pickled one.
- Yes.

2609
01:22:06,717 --> 01:22:09,085
- Do you not like chives? Okay.
- I'll add some chives.

2610
01:22:09,086 --> 01:22:10,562
(He adds a generous serving of pike conger.)

2611
01:22:10,586 --> 01:22:12,325
Can you put the whole thing in your mouth?

2612
01:22:12,326 --> 01:22:14,126
- Of course.
- It's hot. Will you be okay?

2613
01:22:14,526 --> 01:22:15,655
It's hot.

2614
01:22:15,656 --> 01:22:16,825
It's okay.

2615
01:22:16,826 --> 01:22:17,996
(It's possible.)

2616
01:22:18,556 --> 01:22:20,696
(Expectant)

2617
01:22:22,666 --> 01:22:23,795
Here it comes.

2618
01:22:23,796 --> 01:22:26,366
(Putting straight into his mouth)

2619
01:22:26,536 --> 01:22:28,335
You have to put it in at one go.

2620
01:22:28,336 --> 01:22:29,376
(Going in)

2621
01:22:30,736 --> 01:22:31,936
You have a big mouth.

2622
01:22:32,136 --> 01:22:34,505
- The inside is...
- It stretches like this.

2623
01:22:34,506 --> 01:22:36,145
(He eats so well.)

2624
01:22:36,146 --> 01:22:38,076
- His mouth can hold a lot.
- It's good, right?

2625
01:22:38,946 --> 01:22:40,846
Sang Yi, it's your last bite. Chew it slowly.

2626
01:22:41,816 --> 01:22:43,015
It's so good.

2627
01:22:43,016 --> 01:22:44,016
(Impressed)

2628
01:22:45,516 --> 01:22:47,656
(Sang Yi, eat this in secret.)

2629
01:22:48,256 --> 01:22:50,425
(It's sad when you're the only one who doesn't get to eat it.)

2630
01:22:50,426 --> 01:22:52,796
- The kalguksu is good.
- It's good.

2631
01:22:54,566 --> 01:22:57,836
(He hides the food in the cabbage and savors it.)

2632
01:22:57,996 --> 01:22:59,436
- My gosh.
- It wasn't there.

2633
01:23:01,506 --> 01:23:02,575
But it's here.

2634
01:23:02,576 --> 01:23:04,476
Sang Yi is eating in secret.

2635
01:23:04,836 --> 01:23:06,145
I just tried dipping it in the soy sauce.

2636
01:23:06,146 --> 01:23:07,606
To see how the color changes.

2637
01:23:08,706 --> 01:23:11,075
- My gosh.
- Sang Yi is very curious.

2638
01:23:11,076 --> 01:23:12,815
- Seriously.
- What color did it turn into?

2639
01:23:12,816 --> 01:23:14,016
In the soy sauce?

2640
01:23:14,586 --> 01:23:16,055
- It turned brown.
- I see.

2641
01:23:16,056 --> 01:23:17,955
- Really?
- White and...

2642
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:19,255
You could pretend it was just rice.

2643
01:23:19,256 --> 01:23:21,356
- The colors are similar.
- Yes.

2644
01:23:24,496 --> 01:23:25,766
Sang Yi is eating the conger.

2645
01:23:27,166 --> 01:23:29,166
Sang Yi, do you still want to be friends with him?

2646
01:23:30,236 --> 01:23:31,935
Think carefully.

2647
01:23:31,936 --> 01:23:33,976
If you want to take it back, you have to do it now.

2648
01:23:34,366 --> 01:23:37,106
(I should think about it.)

2649
01:23:37,176 --> 01:23:39,175
Bo Gum, you eat a lot. Is the food enough for you?

2650
01:23:39,176 --> 01:23:40,476
You need to eat more.

2651
01:23:41,046 --> 01:23:42,776
You need more, right? Be honest.

2652
01:23:43,016 --> 01:23:45,215
- He seems to want more.
- I bet it's not enough.

2653
01:23:45,216 --> 01:23:46,516
(A little?)

2654
01:23:47,616 --> 01:23:50,456
(Kalguksu is a must.)

2655
01:23:50,556 --> 01:23:52,625
Gosh, kalguksu with mustard greens kimchi.

2656
01:23:52,626 --> 01:23:53,985
Yes. It's insane.

2657
01:23:53,986 --> 01:23:55,332
- My gosh.
- It's the best combination.

2658
01:23:55,356 --> 01:23:57,225
This is what we're eating.

2659
01:23:57,226 --> 01:24:00,096
You have to eat this when you're in Yeosu.

2660
01:24:00,996 --> 01:24:03,336
(It looks delicious.)

2661
01:24:04,266 --> 01:24:05,866
(Slurping)

2662
01:24:07,336 --> 01:24:10,206
(Warm kalguksu is the best on a rainy day.)

2663
01:24:11,206 --> 01:24:13,106
(Slurping)

2664
01:24:16,716 --> 01:24:18,946
The noodles are perfectly cooked. I love it.

2665
01:24:19,076 --> 01:24:20,746
- The kimchi is really good.
- Yes.

2666
01:24:21,786 --> 01:24:22,855
What's this?

2667
01:24:22,856 --> 01:24:25,716
(They're eating so well.)

2668
01:24:26,026 --> 01:24:28,086
Can you make an acrostic poem with kalguksu?

2669
01:24:28,286 --> 01:24:29,356
I'll try.

2670
01:24:29,496 --> 01:24:30,795
It won't be easy.

2671
01:24:30,796 --> 01:24:32,326
It's hard even for Cho Sae Ho.

2672
01:24:32,596 --> 01:24:33,666
First letter.

2673
01:24:33,726 --> 01:24:36,266
I really want to eat kalguksu.

2674
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:37,696
Second letter.

2675
01:24:38,536 --> 01:24:42,436
The best noodle dish is kalguksu.

2676
01:24:43,576 --> 01:24:44,636
Third letter.

2677
01:24:44,676 --> 01:24:48,546
(Sang Yi, you're almost there. You're about to eat kalguksu.)

2678
01:24:49,976 --> 01:24:52,415
(Su)

2679
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:55,386
(Su)

2680
01:24:56,256 --> 01:24:57,515
Sae Ho, an acrostic poem with kalguksu.

2681
01:24:57,516 --> 01:24:58,585
- I can do that.
- First letter.

2682
01:24:58,586 --> 01:25:00,802
I was told that they had to cut my thigh open with a scalpel.

2683
01:25:00,826 --> 01:25:01,986
(Laughing)

2684
01:25:02,626 --> 01:25:04,695
- Sae Ho, I'll give you some.
- Continue.

2685
01:25:04,696 --> 01:25:05,895
- Go ahead.
- Second letter.

2686
01:25:05,896 --> 01:25:07,126
So with local anesthesia,

2687
01:25:07,596 --> 01:25:08,876
- Third letter.
- I had surgery.

2688
01:25:10,296 --> 01:25:11,496
- Sae Ho.
- Yes.

2689
01:25:12,236 --> 01:25:13,405
Take this.

2690
01:25:13,406 --> 01:25:14,635
(A plate for Sae Ho, who did a great job)

2691
01:25:14,636 --> 01:25:16,076
Place your hands under the plate.

2692
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:17,536
You have to hold it like this.

2693
01:25:17,736 --> 01:25:19,305
- Like this.
- Isn't this a strainer?

2694
01:25:19,306 --> 01:25:20,446
I'll give you some soup.

2695
01:25:21,046 --> 01:25:23,946
(He got a bowl of noodles anyway.)

2696
01:25:24,316 --> 01:25:26,597
You prepared an acrostic poem with mustard greens kimchi?

2697
01:25:26,986 --> 01:25:27,986
First letter.

2698
01:25:27,987 --> 01:25:31,416
The freshly caught pike conger.

2699
01:25:32,286 --> 01:25:33,326
Second letter.

2700
01:25:33,626 --> 01:25:35,425
Wrap it in kimchi.

2701
01:25:35,426 --> 01:25:37,456
You're almost there. Third letter.

2702
01:25:37,696 --> 01:25:39,295
If you eat it like that, it's delicious.

2703
01:25:39,296 --> 01:25:40,765
All right!

2704
01:25:40,766 --> 01:25:42,295
- It's a little disappointing.
- It is, but...

2705
01:25:42,296 --> 01:25:44,136
Is there anyone who wants to challenge him?

2706
01:25:44,866 --> 01:25:46,105
- First letter.
- First letter.

2707
01:25:46,106 --> 01:25:47,136
(Give it a try, Bo Gum.)

2708
01:25:47,566 --> 01:25:48,966
I think I'll have an upset stomach.

2709
01:25:49,506 --> 01:25:51,306
- Second letter.
- I will eat little.

2710
01:25:51,376 --> 01:25:53,376
- That was...
- It's cute.

2711
01:25:53,506 --> 01:25:55,345
"I think I'll have an upset stomach. I'll eat little."

2712
01:25:55,346 --> 01:25:57,245
- He's good.
- That's simple and nice.

2713
01:25:57,246 --> 01:25:59,176
- It's a high quality.
- First letter.

2714
01:25:59,486 --> 01:26:01,245
- My body...
- My body.

2715
01:26:01,246 --> 01:26:02,686
Is full of urine.

2716
01:26:03,456 --> 01:26:04,456
(Laughing)

2717
01:26:04,457 --> 01:26:05,556
Feces and urine!

2718
01:26:07,056 --> 01:26:09,156
(I lost.)

2719
01:26:09,356 --> 01:26:11,455
Did you enjoy the food?

2720
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,566
- Yes.
- Yes.

2721
01:26:12,696 --> 01:26:14,965
Then, we will go and enjoy...

2722
01:26:14,966 --> 01:26:17,035
another taste of Yeosu.

2723
01:26:17,036 --> 01:26:18,495
- We're eating again?
- Really?

2724
01:26:18,496 --> 01:26:20,205
- I knew it.
- We keep eating today?

2725
01:26:20,206 --> 01:26:21,565
- We should.
- Nice.

2726
01:26:21,566 --> 01:26:22,812
(What taste is waiting for them this time?)

2727
01:26:22,836 --> 01:26:25,406
(Bo Gum sits down.)

2728
01:26:25,636 --> 01:26:27,075
You should sit next to Bo Gum so you'll look horrible.

2729
01:26:27,076 --> 01:26:28,076
Should I sit here?

2730
01:26:28,077 --> 01:26:30,476
- Sit there.
- Well... What?

2731
01:26:30,646 --> 01:26:32,445
- Are you going to be okay?
- Sure.

2732
01:26:32,446 --> 01:26:33,845
- Seriously...
- Is it too cramped because of me?

2733
01:26:33,846 --> 01:26:34,916
No.

2734
01:26:36,116 --> 01:26:37,516
No. I'm comfortable.

2735
01:26:37,886 --> 01:26:38,986
(Happy)

2736
01:26:39,256 --> 01:26:41,826
Wherever I sit, my shoulder touches the person next to me.

2737
01:26:42,726 --> 01:26:44,655
This is really nice.

2738
01:26:44,656 --> 01:26:46,296
(Heading to the next glutton course)

2739
01:26:46,426 --> 01:26:47,795
Are you full, Sang Yi?

2740
01:26:47,796 --> 01:26:49,596
You ate quite a lot, anyway.

2741
01:26:50,366 --> 01:26:52,236
I just had some rice and vegetables.

2742
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:55,265
I felt like I was on a diet, which was nice.

2743
01:26:55,266 --> 01:26:57,206
I'm quite full anyway.

2744
01:26:57,306 --> 01:26:58,335
- Are you full?
- Yes.

2745
01:26:58,336 --> 01:26:59,706
But I want to eat more.

2746
01:26:59,876 --> 01:27:01,776
How are things with DinDin? Is it better now?

2747
01:27:02,376 --> 01:27:04,776
I don't think it will be easy.

2748
01:27:05,146 --> 01:27:06,646
Give him a hug.

2749
01:27:06,716 --> 01:27:08,785
Hug him from behind.

2750
01:27:08,786 --> 01:27:10,385
- Hug him from behind?
- Give him a hug.

2751
01:27:10,386 --> 01:27:11,556
- You're friends.
- Go ahead.

2752
01:27:12,386 --> 01:27:13,925
(Holding his hand)

2753
01:27:13,926 --> 01:27:15,655
His hand is too big.

2754
01:27:15,656 --> 01:27:17,695
Whenever we talk, I can't help but stare at his hands.

2755
01:27:17,696 --> 01:27:19,255
I look at his hands after saying something.

2756
01:27:19,256 --> 01:27:20,795
Is the amount of food okay for you?

2757
01:27:20,796 --> 01:27:22,995
You eat a lot, so I'm worried if you didn't eat your full.

2758
01:27:22,996 --> 01:27:24,635
- It was just a proper amount.
- Really?

2759
01:27:24,636 --> 01:27:27,405
But I can eat more.

2760
01:27:27,406 --> 01:27:29,106
What's your favorite snack?

2761
01:27:29,806 --> 01:27:31,335
- Your favorite.
- Snack?

2762
01:27:31,336 --> 01:27:33,245
- I like chocolate cake.
- A dessert after a meal.

2763
01:27:33,246 --> 01:27:34,675
- Chocolate cake?
- Chocolate cake.

2764
01:27:34,676 --> 01:27:35,946
I love chocolate.

2765
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:37,546
Ice cream.

2766
01:27:37,976 --> 01:27:39,385
- I see.
- Ice cream? What kind?

2767
01:27:39,386 --> 01:27:40,645
- Chocolate or vanilla.
- I like green tea ice cream.

2768
01:27:40,646 --> 01:27:42,485
- Green tea ice cream.
- Green tea.

2769
01:27:42,486 --> 01:27:44,285
- I love it.
- There's ice cream.

2770
01:27:44,286 --> 01:27:45,886
- Really?
- There's ice cream.

2771
01:27:46,556 --> 01:27:48,656
(There's an ice cream store next to them.)

2772
01:27:48,886 --> 01:27:50,055
(Maybe we're eating ice cream.)

2773
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:51,426
Please close the curtains.

2774
01:27:51,626 --> 01:27:52,695
- Are we going there?
- Everyone.

2775
01:27:52,696 --> 01:27:54,402
- I bet this place is famous.
- Cover the window?

2776
01:27:54,426 --> 01:27:55,726
- This is...
- What?

2777
01:27:55,826 --> 01:27:58,136
- This place is really good.
- Everyone, now...

2778
01:27:58,196 --> 01:27:59,665
For your sake,

2779
01:27:59,666 --> 01:28:01,966
you have to go secretly now.

2780
01:28:02,006 --> 01:28:03,535
Hey, you guys.

2781
01:28:03,536 --> 01:28:05,752
You two shouldn't get caught. If you do, we won't get to eat.

2782
01:28:05,776 --> 01:28:07,276
- What do we do?
- We can't eat.

2783
01:28:07,706 --> 01:28:09,246
- What is it?
- Are we going?

2784
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:12,016
(Running hurriedly)

2785
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:14,116
- It's slippery. Be careful.
- Thanks.

2786
01:28:15,086 --> 01:28:16,255
(They got out secretly and came into the place.)

2787
01:28:16,256 --> 01:28:17,615
I thought we'd eat ice cream.

2788
01:28:17,616 --> 01:28:19,156
Gosh, it looked delicious.

2789
01:28:19,356 --> 01:28:21,455
(Why did you tell us to come in secretly?)

2790
01:28:21,456 --> 01:28:24,955
The place behind you is Yi Sun Shin Square in Yeosu.

2791
01:28:24,956 --> 01:28:26,265
- Yi Sun Shin?
- That's Yi Sun Shin Square.

2792
01:28:26,266 --> 01:28:27,765
- That's really cool.
- It's over there.

2793
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:29,735
Right. There's the turtle ship over there.

2794
01:28:29,736 --> 01:28:31,035
- Really?
- It's a famous spot.

2795
01:28:31,036 --> 01:28:32,395
That's right. If you turn at the corner,

2796
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:33,742
- you see the turtle ship.
- There's the turtle ship.

2797
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:35,135
And this street has...

2798
01:28:35,136 --> 01:28:38,075
a lot of famous dessert places...

2799
01:28:38,076 --> 01:28:40,005
with many customers waiting in line.

2800
01:28:40,006 --> 01:28:41,575
(The place is full of delicious desserts.)

2801
01:28:41,576 --> 01:28:43,475
It's the mecca of desserts in Yeosu.

2802
01:28:43,476 --> 01:28:45,076
It must be delicious.

2803
01:28:45,176 --> 01:28:46,415
I just saw a lot of people...

2804
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:48,185
- waiting in line.
- Right.

2805
01:28:48,186 --> 01:28:49,455
- Yes. Now that we're here, - Let's go.

2806
01:28:49,456 --> 01:28:51,785
I'd like you to taste the popular desserts.

2807
01:28:51,786 --> 01:28:53,326
So we bought all of them.

2808
01:28:53,886 --> 01:28:55,525
- I'll show you the menu first.
- There's...

2809
01:28:55,526 --> 01:28:56,725
Look at the ice cream.

2810
01:28:56,726 --> 01:28:58,025
(Bo Gum is amazed.)

2811
01:28:58,026 --> 01:28:59,226
Seriously?

2812
01:28:59,496 --> 01:29:00,865
(It makes Sang Yi stand up.)

2813
01:29:00,866 --> 01:29:02,735
- There are dumplings.
- Don't touch it.

2814
01:29:02,736 --> 01:29:04,135
- My goodness.
- This one looks nice.

2815
01:29:04,136 --> 01:29:06,096
This is what the people were waiting in line for.

2816
01:29:06,266 --> 01:29:07,305
Mugwort ice cream.

2817
01:29:07,306 --> 01:29:08,606
- It looks so good.
- Mugwort.

2818
01:29:08,636 --> 01:29:10,835
And there are samhap dumplings that have...

2819
01:29:10,836 --> 01:29:12,075
mustard greens kimchi, small octopus, and shrimp.

2820
01:29:12,076 --> 01:29:13,875
- It looks so good.
- These are dumplings?

2821
01:29:13,876 --> 01:29:15,145
Twisted donuts with chewy glutinous rice...

2822
01:29:15,146 --> 01:29:17,215
and a soft texture.

2823
01:29:17,216 --> 01:29:18,645
- A soft texture?
- It's soft.

2824
01:29:18,646 --> 01:29:20,446
- Soft?
- It's tender and fluffy.

2825
01:29:20,746 --> 01:29:23,985
Yeosu strawberry sticky rice cake with a fresh strawberry in it.

2826
01:29:23,986 --> 01:29:25,785
Rich flavored salt bread that's crispy on the outside...

2827
01:29:25,786 --> 01:29:27,525
and chewy on the inside.

2828
01:29:27,526 --> 01:29:29,155
- Salt bread.
- Let's begin.

2829
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:30,295
(Fully motivated)

2830
01:29:30,296 --> 01:29:33,266
You have to go out and buy the desserts you want...

2831
01:29:33,366 --> 01:29:35,765
- in order to eat them.
- I see.

2832
01:29:35,766 --> 01:29:37,865
So we prepared this mission.

2833
01:29:37,866 --> 01:29:41,336
It's called I'll Try Going Once. It's ITGO for short.

2834
01:29:41,536 --> 01:29:43,336
- All right. What is it about?
- ITGO.

2835
01:29:44,076 --> 01:29:46,675
The team leaders of each team will take one team member...

2836
01:29:46,676 --> 01:29:48,106
and go out together.

2837
01:29:48,206 --> 01:29:51,015
Once they buy a dessert they want and come back, they succeed.

2838
01:29:51,016 --> 01:29:52,315
- Is that it?
- But...

2839
01:29:52,316 --> 01:29:53,386
- But.
- But...

2840
01:29:53,416 --> 01:29:55,646
before they get their dessert,

2841
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:57,615
- if someone...
- Recognize them?

2842
01:29:57,616 --> 01:29:59,215
- recognizes them...
- My gosh.

2843
01:29:59,216 --> 01:30:00,386
And calls their name,

2844
01:30:00,756 --> 01:30:02,256
the mission fails immediately.

2845
01:30:02,286 --> 01:30:04,695
Even if one of them fails first during the mission,

2846
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:06,425
- if the other survives alone, - Does that count?

2847
01:30:06,426 --> 01:30:08,365
He can continue the mission.

2848
01:30:08,366 --> 01:30:09,896
(Team Bo Gum, success!)

2849
01:30:10,936 --> 01:30:13,736
(Enjoy the desserts you want.)

2850
01:30:14,466 --> 01:30:16,575
- How can you not recognize Bo Gum?
- No.

2851
01:30:16,576 --> 01:30:19,076
People will definitely recognize Sang Yi and Bo Gum.

2852
01:30:19,106 --> 01:30:20,375
- No.
- He...

2853
01:30:20,376 --> 01:30:21,675
We have a chance.

2854
01:30:21,676 --> 01:30:23,746
- People only look at their phones.
- Right.

2855
01:30:24,546 --> 01:30:25,945
I don't think so.

2856
01:30:25,946 --> 01:30:27,945
- This is...
- But here's what I think.

2857
01:30:27,946 --> 01:30:30,085
If I was living in Yeosu,

2858
01:30:30,086 --> 01:30:31,285
I would just pass by him.

2859
01:30:31,286 --> 01:30:32,555
- They don't expect to see him here.
- "Why would Bo Gum be here now?"

2860
01:30:32,556 --> 01:30:33,855
This is what people would think.

2861
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:34,956
Can you pass by?

2862
01:30:35,086 --> 01:30:37,086
- Pass by what?
- Someone will ask for his number.

2863
01:30:37,956 --> 01:30:39,355
"Can I get your number?"

2864
01:30:39,356 --> 01:30:41,472
- That's possible.
- Then give her everything you have.

2865
01:30:41,496 --> 01:30:43,536
- Can we wear a disguise?
- If...

2866
01:30:43,866 --> 01:30:47,105
As long as you don't cover your face completely,

2867
01:30:47,106 --> 01:30:49,065
- you can wear a disguise.
- Is Jae Hyun here?

2868
01:30:49,066 --> 01:30:50,736
His glasses are perfect for this.

2869
01:30:51,136 --> 01:30:52,735
(The magic glasses that make your eyes half the size)

2870
01:30:52,736 --> 01:30:54,945
- Bo Gum needs the magic glasses.
- Right.

2871
01:30:54,946 --> 01:30:56,106
Or you can make a face.

2872
01:30:56,216 --> 01:30:57,615
(Expanding as much as possible)

2873
01:30:57,616 --> 01:30:58,676
Are you Cho Sae Ho?

2874
01:30:58,746 --> 01:31:01,185
(Is the expression disguise okay?)

2875
01:31:01,186 --> 01:31:02,785
- We can try this.
- Cho Sae Ho.

2876
01:31:02,786 --> 01:31:03,985
(That's a good idea.)

2877
01:31:03,986 --> 01:31:05,986
- Cho Sae Ho.
- Like this.

2878
01:31:06,056 --> 01:31:07,056
Sae Ho.

2879
01:31:07,586 --> 01:31:08,856
(He saw Sang Yi.)

2880
01:31:10,056 --> 01:31:11,056
(What's that?)

2881
01:31:11,057 --> 01:31:12,226
Aren't you Cho Sae Ho?

2882
01:31:12,496 --> 01:31:13,666
How did you guess?

2883
01:31:13,896 --> 01:31:15,425
If I crease my eyelids,

2884
01:31:15,426 --> 01:31:16,465
- I look really different.
- Try it.

2885
01:31:16,466 --> 01:31:17,566
I look like this.

2886
01:31:18,596 --> 01:31:19,665
What's he doing?

2887
01:31:19,666 --> 01:31:20,706
(Curious)

2888
01:31:23,036 --> 01:31:24,436
How do I look now?

2889
01:31:24,706 --> 01:31:26,305
- Hey.
- Don't I look different?

2890
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:27,306
Joon.

2891
01:31:28,346 --> 01:31:29,406
For real.

2892
01:31:30,116 --> 01:31:31,516
Joon. I can't recognize you.

2893
01:31:31,846 --> 01:31:33,686
- Right?
- I can't recognize you.

2894
01:31:34,186 --> 01:31:35,815
"Give me an ice cream."

2895
01:31:35,816 --> 01:31:38,285
I can move my eyebrows, so they won't recognize me.

2896
01:31:38,286 --> 01:31:39,786
- Do it.
- I can do this.

2897
01:31:39,886 --> 01:31:41,255
- Hey, I can't tell it's you.
- Look at him.

2898
01:31:41,256 --> 01:31:43,226
Hey. Sang Yi's impossible to recognize.

2899
01:31:43,896 --> 01:31:44,896
Hey!

2900
01:31:46,796 --> 01:31:48,026
Who are you?

2901
01:31:48,066 --> 01:31:49,166
Look at Sang Yi.

2902
01:31:50,566 --> 01:31:52,735
(I want to try too.)

2903
01:31:52,736 --> 01:31:54,505
- I can't recognize you.
- Seriously.

2904
01:31:54,506 --> 01:31:56,705
- I really can't tell it's you.
- How do you do that?

2905
01:31:56,706 --> 01:31:58,106
"Give me an ice cream."

2906
01:31:58,736 --> 01:31:59,905
- Give it a go.
- Hey.

2907
01:31:59,906 --> 01:32:01,376
How will we manage?

2908
01:32:01,606 --> 01:32:03,715
Personally, if I were an employee,

2909
01:32:03,716 --> 01:32:05,916
I wouldn't go up to you even if I recognized you.

2910
01:32:06,176 --> 01:32:08,045
I don't think you should be recognized.

2911
01:32:08,046 --> 01:32:09,046
(You might get told off for talking to him.)

2912
01:32:09,047 --> 01:32:10,056
Hey.

2913
01:32:10,456 --> 01:32:12,255
- You guys...
- That's awesome.

2914
01:32:12,256 --> 01:32:14,456
- That's incredible.
- From our team, Sang Yi...

2915
01:32:14,856 --> 01:32:16,085
- and Joon should go.
- Yes.

2916
01:32:16,086 --> 01:32:17,926
- Right.
- Korea National University of Arts.

2917
01:32:18,256 --> 01:32:19,525
We're at a serious disadvantage.

2918
01:32:19,526 --> 01:32:21,565
- Bo Gum should do something.
- How can he do this?

2919
01:32:21,566 --> 01:32:22,896
Can you change your face?

2920
01:32:23,036 --> 01:32:24,965
- I'll try.
- What can you do?

2921
01:32:24,966 --> 01:32:26,866
Is his face even changeable?

2922
01:32:27,066 --> 01:32:29,166
"Hello, I'm Park Bo Gum."

2923
01:32:29,776 --> 01:32:31,335
- "Hello."
- You should go like this.

2924
01:32:31,336 --> 01:32:32,336
(If not the face, change the voice.)

2925
01:32:32,337 --> 01:32:34,946
Can't you do that? You must, Bo Gum.

2926
01:32:35,506 --> 01:32:36,615
"Hello!"

2927
01:32:36,616 --> 01:32:37,816
- "Hello."
- Yes.

2928
01:32:37,976 --> 01:32:39,145
What's that?

2929
01:32:39,146 --> 01:32:41,786
(Has he decided to give up his sight?)

2930
01:32:42,186 --> 01:32:44,485
- That might work.
- Gosh...

2931
01:32:44,486 --> 01:32:45,986
Se Yoon, isn't this obvious?

2932
01:32:46,286 --> 01:32:47,386
Who...

2933
01:32:48,156 --> 01:32:49,796
What's this? I can't tell it's you.

2934
01:32:50,456 --> 01:32:51,802
What's this? I can't tell it's you.

2935
01:32:51,826 --> 01:32:56,026
- What is this?
- Do the eyebrows too.

2936
01:32:57,036 --> 01:32:58,196
I can't recognize you at all.

2937
01:32:59,236 --> 01:33:00,435
This is incredible.

2938
01:33:00,436 --> 01:33:02,306
(He looked so sweet and charming.)

2939
01:33:03,106 --> 01:33:04,305
(2 Days 1 Night modification complete)

2940
01:33:04,306 --> 01:33:05,436
Three mochi, please.

2941
01:33:06,946 --> 01:33:08,675
(I want that talent.)

2942
01:33:08,676 --> 01:33:09,746
This is insane.

2943
01:33:10,116 --> 01:33:11,446
Who are you this time?

2944
01:33:12,016 --> 01:33:13,286
You're another person now.

2945
01:33:13,786 --> 01:33:15,885
- His face keeps...
- He looks like a student in the US.

2946
01:33:15,886 --> 01:33:17,386
His face keeps changing.

2947
01:33:17,586 --> 01:33:19,085
(Lee Sang Yi's continuous change)

2948
01:33:19,086 --> 01:33:20,885
He has a thousand different faces.

2949
01:33:20,886 --> 01:33:22,385
- Sang Yi.
- You're really something.

2950
01:33:22,386 --> 01:33:23,995
- I want what he can do.
- Gosh.

2951
01:33:23,996 --> 01:33:25,025
It's hilarious.

2952
01:33:25,026 --> 01:33:26,725
(Team Bo Gum, Team Sang Yi)

2953
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:29,195
(Disguise complete)

2954
01:33:29,196 --> 01:33:30,836
(Next episode)

2955
01:33:31,336 --> 01:33:33,866
(Music floats through Yeosu's night sky.)

2956
01:33:35,106 --> 01:33:36,735
(Bo Gum...)

2957
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:40,305
(and Sang Yi prepared...)

2958
01:33:40,306 --> 01:33:42,646
(a special gift.)

2959
01:33:43,546 --> 01:33:46,615
(They're falling...)

2960
01:33:46,616 --> 01:33:48,385
(deep in their charm...)

2961
01:33:48,386 --> 01:33:49,415
One, two.

2962
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:51,085
(The good boys...)

2963
01:33:51,086 --> 01:33:52,556
(are getting into it.)

2964
01:33:53,056 --> 01:33:55,255
(Challenge)

2965
01:33:55,256 --> 01:33:56,625
(Accepted)

2966
01:33:56,626 --> 01:33:57,855
- Nice!
- Gosh, look.

2967
01:33:57,856 --> 01:33:59,795
(Who dared to wake...)

2968
01:33:59,796 --> 01:34:01,266
(a sleeping good boy?)

2969
01:34:02,596 --> 01:34:04,896
(Their pride as men is at stake.)

2970
01:34:05,466 --> 01:34:07,606
(A fiery contention)

2971
01:34:07,666 --> 01:34:09,206
We need to stop them!

2972
01:34:10,076 --> 01:34:12,236
(Bo Gum and Sang Yi...)

2973
01:34:12,606 --> 01:34:14,875
(made 2 Days 1 Night sweeter and scarier.)

2974
01:34:14,876 --> 01:34:16,675
Come and check it out.

2975
01:34:16,676 --> 01:34:18,676
(See you on Sunday night at 6:10pm.)
