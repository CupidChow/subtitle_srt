1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,369
(DAY6 is on 2 Days 1 Night!)

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,370
One, two, three.

3
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:07,069
(Hello, we're DAY6.)

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,439
(They can enjoy small octopus bossam...)

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,779
(at a famous place in Samcheok...)

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,910
(with a meal ticket.)

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,880
(They set off on a youthful race to win meal tickets.)

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,419
(It's possible to take out and eat a flea's liver.)

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,450
(Yes, No)

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,159
(In the first mission, )

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,600
(Team Youngpil wins 2 meal tickets.)

12
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,330
(The Swim Fins Ocean Operation is next.)

13
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,770
(After a fierce contention, )

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,370
(Dowoon helps his team catch up.)

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,769
(In the second mission, )

16
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,200
(Team Dojin wins 2 meal tickets.)

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,440
(Back to square one)

18
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,656
(The last mission between them and small octopus bossam)

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,580
(Count-up Naming Game)

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,450
Korean male singers.

21
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,249
(Team Youngpil goes hard from the start.)

22
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,850
(Team Youngpil: 1 point)

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,219
(This is so much fun.)

24
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,550
- "Bruise."
- "I Love You."

25
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,760
(Team Dojin catches up.)

26
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,730
(Successful catch-up)

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,860
(Youngest, let's eat lunch.)

28
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,910
(Which team will get the plentiful lunch?)

29
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,229
(2 Days 1 Night)

30
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,900
(I got it!)

31
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,569
- Okay.
- It's one all.

32
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,739
(Team Youngpil 1, Team Dojin 1)

33
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,840
All right.

34
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,579
Fruits and vegetables.

35
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,580
- Youngpil!
- Dojin!

36
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,580
- Youngpil.
- Youngpil.

37
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,580
Beans.

38
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,809
- Three...
- Grapes.

39
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,549
- Three, two...
- Tomatoes.

40
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,850
Three, two, one!

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,450
Three, two, one!

42
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,919
- Wrong.
- Potato chips.

43
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,389
- Dojin.
- Beans.

44
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,859
- Three...
- Grapes.

45
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,159
(Fruits and vegetables)

46
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
- Three...
- Tomatoes!

47
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,589
- Three, two...
- Pineapples.

48
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,730
- Pineapples.
- Three, two...

49
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,500
- one!
- Nectarines!

50
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,169
- Nectarines!
- Correct!

51
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,170
(Team Dojin, correct.)

52
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,809
(We got 1 more point.)

53
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,339
They helped. You saw.

54
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,839
He gave him the answer.

55
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,879
- They cheated.
- He helped.

56
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
- He helped.
- Who did?

57
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:52,279
Are they allowed to keep going?

58
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,480
- VAR.
- They cheated.

59
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,550
- This is really not fair.
- Who was it?

60
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,650
Jong Min told him what to say.

61
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,249
We'll ask. Sit back down.

62
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,649
- Sit.
- Dowoon went,

63
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,859
"Oh, okay, nectarines."

64
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,920
(Laughing)

65
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,690
Jong Min, be honest. Look into my eyes.

66
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
(Thudding)

67
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,129
Did you give him the answer?

68
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,329
Relax your fist.

69
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,899
I'll ask one last time.

70
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,110
Did you tell him to say nectarines?

71
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,340
Yes.

72
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,780
(Our big brother can't lie.)

73
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,480
What...

74
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,680
What...

75
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,649
(Dowoon couldn't think of something with five syllables.)

76
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,019
Three, two...

77
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,859
(He hides behind Se Yoon.)

78
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,920
- One!
- Nectarines!

79
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,530
(Glancing)

80
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,830
(Exclaiming shamelessly)

81
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,499
Can't you play fair?

82
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
(This round is void.)

83
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,729
I think we've been playing for 30 minutes.

84
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,399
Let's do a nonsense quiz or something.

85
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,139
- We might fight.
- One person must be gagged...

86
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,669
- and made to look down.
- Yes.

87
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,869
It's impossible.

88
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,340
- Shall I sit over there?
- Yes.

89
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,810
Do you have anything else?

90
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,709
Let's really play fair now.

91
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,640
- No helping out.
- Okay!

92
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,550
- Okay, then.
- We're sorry.

93
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,879
Let's play on.

94
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,779
(The third round again.)

95
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,979
- Musical instruments.
- Dojin!

96
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,990
Dojin!

97
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,289
Three, two, one!

98
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,290
- Youngpil!
- Wrong!

99
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,290
- Youngpil.
- Youngpil.

100
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,120
- A gong.
- Three, two...

101
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,629
- one.
- A danso.

102
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,760
- Three, two...
- A bass.

103
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,229
- Three...
- Drumsticks.

104
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,230
- That works.
- Three...

105
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,799
- A bass drum.
- A bass drum.

106
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,929
A bass drum is...

107
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,100
- Correct.
- Okay!

108
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,639
Let's stay calm and keep going.

109
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,139
(Thinking)

110
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,339
Drumsticks aren't an instrument.

111
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,810
- Excuse us.
- Sticks?

112
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,439
We have a drummer here.

113
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,909
Drumsticks don't make...

114
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,810
I get that a bass drum is an instrument.

115
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,879
But to say drumsticks are an instrument...

116
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,749
Okay. We'll say you got it wrong.

117
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,149
- Okay, that's wrong.
- Dojin!

118
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,220
Dojin!

119
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,520
A gong.

120
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,090
- A danso.
- They could get it wrong.

121
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,320
A saxophone.

122
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,819
Drumsticks.

123
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,859
- What?
- Wrong!

124
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,630
(Instruments: Drumsticks)

125
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,029
- What happened?
- That's an instrument?

126
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,199
(He just said drumsticks weren't instruments.)

127
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,630
Hang on. What four-syllable word is there?

128
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,669
- Wrong!
- Youngpil!

129
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,039
Musical instruments. Go slow.

130
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,070
- Sae Ho.
- Yes.

131
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,809
- Three, two...
- A gong.

132
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,310
Three, two...

133
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,639
- one!
- A danso.

134
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,209
- Three...
- A bass.

135
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,879
- Three, two...
- A violin.

136
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,109
- A violin.
- Three...

137
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,579
- A bass drum.
- A bass drum.

138
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,649
(Instruments: Bass drum)

139
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,150
- Okay!
- Correct.

140
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,120
- We did it!
- Gosh.

141
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,649
Drumsticks. Nice one!

142
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,889
Dowoon, well done.

143
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,219
I'm so sorry.

144
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,529
I couldn't think of anything else.

145
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,859
He's hilarious.

146
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,029
- I'm sorry.
- Dowoon.

147
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,729
- I'm so sorry.
- You don't want to eat.

148
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,930
Thanks so much.

149
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,430
The score is 2 to 1.

150
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,299
Director Joo, let's do an interview.

151
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,340
Okay.

152
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,369
You play the drums.

153
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,239
You said drumsticks were wrong, and we got a shot.

154
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,979
- You said they were wrong.
- My bad.

155
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,710
Are drumsticks instruments or not?

156
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,379
My brain just froze.

157
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,949
- It's okay.
- Let's keep going.

158
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,079
Relax.

159
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,449
Like Joon. Stay calm and collected.

160
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,589
- Of course.
- Okay.

161
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,450
(Team Youngpil 2, Team Dojin 1)

162
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,289
- A noun starting with B.
- I got it!

163
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,320
- Dojin!
- Dojin!

164
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,630
- Illness.
- Okay, go!

165
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,990
Boulder.

166
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,930
- Three, two...
- Saxophone.

167
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,160
- What?
- Darn you!

168
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,500
- What?
- What was that?

169
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,230
What?

170
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,070
What was that?

171
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,940
What was that?

172
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,900
- Darn it.
- What's wrong?

173
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,110
Time-out.

174
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:08,809
Nouns starting with B.

175
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,840
(Idiot)

176
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,139
- Star.
- Star.

177
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,310
Three, two...

178
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
- one.
- Boulder.

- Yes!

184
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,059
- It's right.
- It's right!

185
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,089
(Oh, dear.)

186
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,660
- Vibranium suddenly came to mind.
- Well done.

187
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,059
I thought you'd say violin.

188
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,499
Vibranium was a great answer. That was incredible.

189
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,529
Jong Min... Why did he say saxophone?

190
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,300
Jong Min, why did you say saxophone?

191
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,699
I was distracted.

192
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
(Laughing)

193
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,909
- It was a short while.
- What's up with him?

194
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,179
- What's wrong with our team?
- Luck's on our side.

195
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,549
Young K's good at this game.

196
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,649
You're doing good.

197
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,810
- Bass drum.
- Yes.

198
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,480
We're almost there.

199
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,150
This time, we'll go...

200
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,519
five syllables, four, three,

201
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,989
two, and then one.

202
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,990
- The other way round?
- Let's swap seats.

203
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,430
Korean movies.

204
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,059
- Youngpil.
- Dojin.

205
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,060
- Youngpil.
- Five syllables.

206
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,129
- Do you know one?
- Three...

207
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,300
"Address Unknown."

208
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,729
- That's a movie title.
- Three,

209
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,029
- two...
- "Big Deal."

210
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,369
- "Big Deal," a new release.
- It's a movie.

211
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,770
- Three, two...
- "Veteran."

212
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,099
Three, two...

213
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,239
- "Tazza: The High Rollers."
- "Tazza: The High Rollers."

214
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,570
Three, two...

215
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,769
- one.
- "Star."

216
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,339
- "Star."
- There's no movie titled that.

217
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,709
- I know it.
- It exists.

218
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,549
- There's bound to be one.
- It exists.

219
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,309
- There has to be a "Star."
- There is.

220
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,849
- Look it up.
- There's bound to be one.

221
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,649
(Is there a movie titled "Star?")

222
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,849
- Youngpil.
- I saw one.

223
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,220
(Relaxed)

224
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,659
- Youngpil, correct.
- Okay.

225
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,789
We're almost there!

226
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,790
(Proud)

227
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,929
We're almost there.

228
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,690
- Well done.
- You went with "Star."

229
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,960
They're intimidated.

230
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,369
(Exclaiming)

231
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,669
That was a total trick.

232
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,269
I knew it.

233
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,700
It's a masterpiece.

234
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,670
I loved that movie.

235
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,110
These guys...

236
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,779
They shout their team name too quickly.

237
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,909
- You're praising them?
- Yes.

238
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,910
Thank you.

239
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,079
Well done, you guys.

240
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,309
Thank you.

241
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,349
You're doing great.

242
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,849
- Well done.
- You're really quick.

243
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,850
- You're such a nice guy.
- He is.

244
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,389
Jong Min's so nice.

245
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,819
- He's the best.
- They're too quick.

246
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,319
- They're good.
- We've seen you...

247
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,389
come from far behind.

248
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,489
When and where?

249
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,289
- We have...
- Do you have 20 more questions?

250
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,829
We have to do 20 more?

251
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,159
No, if you get 5 right 1st,

252
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,459
- then it's over.
- Okay.

253
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,570
- This could be the last one.
- Okay.

254
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,040
It's nothing. We can catch up.

255
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,570
Is it the same? Going 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?

256
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,540
- I wonder what this one is.
- Yes.

257
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,079
- What?
- Decide on the order.

258
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,279
This time, we'll start with one syllable.

259
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,349
Okay.

260
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,779

261
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,849

267

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,430

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,530

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,500
One, wrong!

278
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,710
- Hi...
- Dojin!

279
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,470

288

- Why?

289
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,190
- Tiger Balm.
- Tiger Balm.

290
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,319
No. That's two words.

291
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,329
Tiger Balm.

292
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,859
- That's two words.
- Tiger Balm...

293
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,459
It's a registered brand name.

294
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,530
- What?
- Wrong.

295
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,470
(Incredulous)

296
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,369
(It was almost their last chance.)

297
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,499
- Hurry up.
- Go on.

298
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,740

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,719
Five syllables are hard.

308
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,249

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,349

- Young K.
- Young K.

312
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,960
Correct.

313
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,589
How are you so good at this?

314
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,590
We won!

315
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,429
- You're so good at this.
- It was hard for me too.

316
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,430
Thank you.

317
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,480
- Thanks for giving me a shot.
- Okay, everyone.

318
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,230
That was the Count-up Naming Game.

319
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,969
- Thank you.
- Team Youngpil won.

320
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,369
(Team Youngpil crushed their opponent, 5 to 1.)

321
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,869
- Food!
- You get...

322
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,569
- three meal tickets.
- Okay.

323
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,609
We'll give it to you later on.

324
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,479
(They get 5 meal tickets and mung bean jeon.)

325
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,010
You're so good at this game.

326
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,180
We joined the program together, but good going, Joon.

327
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,520
He was so relaxed, sitting with his legs crossed.

328
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,250
"Tiger Balm."

329
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,919
(We hope some balm will sooth your aching heart.)

330
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,059
Do we get to eat?

331
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,029
- That Tiger Balm thing...
- Tiger Balm.

332
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,030
(Let's dig into the first meal of the day.)

333
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,730
(The food appears.)

334
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,169
Is this one portion?

335
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,139
(Exclaiming)

336
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,269
It looks so good.

337
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,810
Everyone gets a plate of this, right?

338
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,869
- What?
- Is that for one person?

339
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,510
- What? That's...
- It's for five people.

340
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,509
- It's for five people.
- But...

341
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,579
(Joking)

342
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,979
- They're getting a lot of food too.
- This is a good amount of food.

343
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,049
- Right.
- That must be two portions.

344
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,479
- The portion is pretty good.
- Hey. The portion...

345
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,780
isn't so bad.

346
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,189
The portion is as big as...

347
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,590
- the Tiger Balm.
- That's not bad.

348
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,959
- Right.
- That will give you good energy.

349
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,266
- You have enough for six people.
- Yes.

350
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,990
We got a similar amount of food, actually.

351
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,230
- So this is about the same amount?
- I mean, look. That's...

352
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,559
- Must we get our own side dishes?
- It's not a significant difference.

353
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,000
You'll get your side dishes soon.

354
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,130
We've got small octopuses too.

355
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,706
Should we cut them into the smallest pieces possible?

356
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,170
- Right.
- Chop them up.

357
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,099
- Yes. That's great.
- Great.

358
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,070
I can already smell the spicy, smoky flavor.

359
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,609
- You're Edward Scissorhands.
- I should chop them up.

360
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,439
- Look at his hands.
- One, two, three, four,

361
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,149
- five, six, seven, eight, nine, - He's counting the pieces.

362
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,549
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

363
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,680
There are 26 pieces.

364
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
- Okay.
- What's 26 divided by 5?

365
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,319
- Here you go.
- We get five each.

366
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,390
- Five.
- Thank you.

367
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,759
- We get to eat five pieces each.
- We...

368
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,306
(He announces that they get 5 meat pieces each.)

369
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,089
- Five each?
- Five each.

370
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,029
The bossam is so good too. We don't have to cut them, right?

371
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,559
- No need to cut them into pieces.
- Let's just eat them.

372
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,629
- Thank you for the food.
- Sure. Enjoy.

373
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,670
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

374
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,670
Gosh, look at this small octopus.

375
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,440
- This guy has three hearts.
- Leave it.

376
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,209
That was the lesson of the day.

377
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,969
- Small octopuses have three hearts.
- I'll never forget that.

378
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,910
- I'll never forget that.
- Gosh.

379
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,449
- What is this?
- Gosh, this is good.

380
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,779
(Let's make a delicious wrap with the small octopus bossam.)

381
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,850
- Can I add two pieces of meat?
- Of course.

382
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,719
You'll eat 2 pieces of meat in 1 bite?

383
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,150
(Envious)

384
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,250
The meat tastes so good too.

385
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,460
(Taking a big bite)

386
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,260
You know what?

387
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,969
It would've been disappointing if it weren't slightly spicy.

388
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,569
- Right.
- This is perfect.

389
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,290
If we only got the small octopus, it might've been too spicy for me.

390
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,430
- Right.
- But the overall balance is great.

391
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,510
The wrap tastes so good.

392
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,610
- But eating it with the meat...
- It's tasty.

393
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,609
- makes the texture interesting.
- Really?

394
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,879
(It's got both chewy and tender textures.)

395
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,249
The smoky flavor of the small octopus...

396
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,250
Gosh, this is crazy.

397
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,479
The smoky flavor is so robust.

398
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,519
(Team Youngpil fully enjoys the smoky flavor...)

399
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,149
If this restaurant were nearby, I'd get this all the time.

400
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,960
(as they eat the small octopuses whole.)

401
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,190
(On the other hand, Team Dojin chopped up the small octopuses.)

402
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,830
(They're having the meal with chopped pieces.)

403
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,370
- It's tasty, indeed.
- Yes.

404
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,800
- It's good, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

405
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,340
- Gosh, this is so good.
- Yes.

406
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,539
- I can taste the smoky flavor.
- It's perfect.

407
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,780
(It's good all chopped up too.)

408
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,809
- I can mix the rice with the sauce.
- Yes.

409
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,156
- Right. Mix it with the sauce.
- Mix the rice with the sauce.

410
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,020
I should mix the rice with some of this sauce.

411
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,709
- It's nice and spicy.
- Yes.

412
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,656
(Like Dowoon suggested, they mix rice with small octopuses.)

413
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,219
(The small octopus bibimbap is delicious too.)

414
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,860
Mixing the rice with the sauce helps me eat a lot of rice.

415
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,020
Right. It's great with the sauce.

416
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,389
- Gosh, the mung bean jeon...
- It's good.

417
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,260
It's so thick, but crispy at the same time.

418
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,060
- Really?
- Yes.

419
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,399
Try it.

420
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,070
(We didn't get the mung bean jeon.)

421
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,800
- Is it good?
- Yes.

422
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,409
(Taking a big bite)

423
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,809
- This is good, indeed.
- Isn't it?

424
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,580
- The mung bean jeon is good.
- The flavor isn't too bold.

425
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,049
(It's a pie in the sky for Team Dowoon.)

426
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,280
You know what? Why don't you let SungJin and Dowoon...

427
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,550
taste the mung bean jeon?

428
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,649
- Right.
- Can't you do that?

429
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,790
- It's okay. We're one.
- We're fine.

430
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,989
- Let's...
- Don't say anything.

431
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,990
Really?

432
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,630
- Don't say anything.
- I see. I get it.

433
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,400
Should I do a freeze?

434
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,969
- Really?
- Really?

435
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,970
(That was sudden.)

436
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:49,029
Do you mean it?

437
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,669
- You'll do it now?
- Will you give us some food then?

438
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,500
- Okay.
- Making a V.

439
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,770
What?

440
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,240
(After executing precise steps...)

441
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,780
(The 1-second freeze)

442
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,279
(Looking confident)

443
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,849
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

444
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,389
- I mean...
- Then...

445
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,549
- He's acting like a thug.
- Can't you hold the pose?

446
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,220
- Dowoon, here you go.
- Right.

447
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,419
- Can't you hold it longer?
- No. It's too high.

448
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,489
- Really?
- It's okay, Dowoon.

449
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,729
It's okay. You did enough.

450
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,929
- Here you go.
- Really?

451
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,200
Let's bow to them.

452
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
(Why is he standing up?)

453
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:19,659
- Thank you.
- But...

454
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,699
- Not me?
- You didn't show us a freeze.

455
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,830
Should I do it then?

456
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,199
Gosh, they're both doing the freeze.

457
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,069
- SungJin will do a freeze?
- I'll give him some if he does it.

458
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,316
- This means he's really hungry.
- He's never done this on TV before.

459
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,739
- He's never done it on TV.
- He's really hungry right now.

460
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,779
Okay. DAY6...

461
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,050
is doing the freeze for food.

462
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,649
- DAY6...
- What?

463
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,719
Is doing the freeze for food.

464
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,160
(Doing a freeze is a piece of cake.)

465
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,319
(Shaking)

466
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,349
His legs are shaking.

467
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,419
SungJin, take this.

468
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,789
- Gosh, that was tough.
- Take it.

469
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,790
Thank you.

470
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,929
(He gets the right to eat the mung bean jeon.)

471
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,930
Only they...

472
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,130
(They shared the jeon with the others.)

473
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:50,629
- My gosh, no.
- No.

474
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,359
- We get to eat this all the time.
- Come on.

475
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,629
- Gosh, it's okay.
- My gosh.

476
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,470
- You should have some.
- Let's all share it.

477
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,840
(Team Dojin is already done as the amount wasn't a lot.)

478
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,739
The small octopus is bigger than the meat.

479
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,880
(On the other hand, Team Youngpil has a lot of food.)

480
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,679
(Happily swinging his feet)

481
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,150
(They continue eating with satisfaction.)

482
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,479
(Young K is especially enjoying his meal.)

483
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,790
Young K eats a lot.

484
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,320
(Let's watch Young K's eating show for a little while.)

485
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,630
Wonpil, why don't you...

486
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,200
You won't eat that?

487
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,499
Yes, enjoy your food.

488
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,670
(I can eat a lot too.)

489
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,139
- I'm envious.
- The small octopus...

490
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,539
(I want to eat more.)

491
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,240
I'd love to eat to my fill like him.

492
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,980
- People underestimate...
- Guys, we prepared...

493
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,450
a rescue mission, just in case one of the teams...

494
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,650
didn't get any food.

495
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,290
But it seems you're done with the food.

496
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,390
We can eat their leftover.

497
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,260
You know what? Wonpil, why don't you...

498
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,929
make two delicious wraps for them?

499
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,030
Thank you.

500
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,029
We came up with this game when we heard DAY6 was joining us.

501
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,300
It's a simple mission.

502
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,470
Tempo is crucial for bands.

503
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,999
- Right.
- This is a popular game now.

504
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,739
We'll play the soundtrack of the movie, "The Bodyguard."

505
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,240
- When the intro plays, - What?

506
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,709
- "I Will Always Love You."
- you have to hit the pot...

507
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,539
to match the timing of the drums.

508
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,350
- I see.
- Then you'll get some food.

509
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,509
- I saw the video for that.
- Right.

510
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,179
- That's a new thing?
- It happens quite suddenly.

511
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,556
- That's the one. Yes.
- That? Yes.

512
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,549
Why don't you give it a try, Young K?

513
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,750
- To demonstrate?
- Show us.

514
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,890
Let's play it.

515
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:25,651
It will be harder even if you know the song.

516
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,830
(Thudding)

517
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,469
(To succeed, they must hit the pot right at the sound.)

518
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,339
This is the timing you need to nail.

519
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,369
- Okay.
- The thud?

520
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,979
- Gosh.
- This is hard!

521
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,516
- That's the mission.
- Okay. You got it?

522
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
It's not about the tempo.

523
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,709
- SungJin. Isn't there a tempo?
- If...

524
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,979
- I have a question.
- There's no tempo.

525
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,279
- No?
- No.

526
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,479
- If someone over there...
- It's about guessing the timing.

527
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,849
- It's...
- If someone over there...

528
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,289
Dowoon's gaze changed just now.

529
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,419
(The drummer quietly gets ready with determination.)

530
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,860
I think I can pull it off.

531
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,219
Will you go first, SungJin?

532
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,530
- I'd like to try it.
- Okay.

533
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,829
SungJin. All right. Let's try it.

534
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,929
(SungJin says it's not about the tempo.)

535
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,999
(Can he succeed?)

536
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,330
Play the song.

537
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,280
(Thudding)

538
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,309
(He was a tad bit late.)

539
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,609
- You failed.
- I should've just hit it.

540
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,050
(Guitarist SungJin fails.)

541
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,120
He was slightly offbeat.

542
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,189
(Joon is up next.)

543
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,259
For your information, I love...

544
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,589
- Yes?
- Whitney Houston.

545
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,630
- Okay.
- Try it.

546
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,800
- I know the song by heart.
- Yes.

547
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,659
- Okay.
- I know all the lyrics.

548
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,899
"If I should stay, I would only be in your way."

549
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,040
"So I'll go, but I know I'll think of you every step of the day."

550
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,609
(Shockingly, he recited the lyrics correctly.)

551
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,809
All right. I can even do this in my sleep.

552
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,770
- To me, this is a piece of cake.
- He loves her.

553
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,379
- I didn't know you were her fan.
- Yes.

554
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,410
Here it goes.

555
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,250
I'll be confident.

556
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,920
(Relaxed)

557
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,360
(Thudding)

558
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,959
(Joon fails as he hit the pot too soon.)

559
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,330
You were close, but you failed.

560
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,199
- I was too arrogant.
- That's the sweet spot you want.

561
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,659
- Don't be arrogant.
- I was too arrogant.

562
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,759
Didn't he get it right?

563
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,399
I used to listen to this every day when I was a kid.

564
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,960
I even know the scene by heart. It's impossible to get it wrong.

565
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,940
(Se Yoon gives it a try with his memory from 18 years ago.)

566
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,550
(Thudding)

567
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,849
- I hit it a bit too soon.
- That was close.

568
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,256
(Se Yoon fails because he hit it a bit too soon.)

569
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,220
- I hit it a bit too soon.
- That was close.

570
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,289
(Taking a big bite)

571
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,319
(No!)

572
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
He's eating another wrap.

573
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,319
(No one has succeeded so far.)

574
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,490
This is so big.

575
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,030
- KOYOTE.
- Like this.

576
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,360
Wouldn't Mr. KOYOTE succeed?

577
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,099
I sing dance songs.

578
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,629
- He has 20 years of experience.
- Play...

579
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,999
I can break down the beats. You know?

580
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,799
(The man who can break down the beats)

581
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,940
- He's acting cheeky again.
- All right.

582
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,239
Let's do it. Play the song.

583
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,521
(Jong Min, who can break down the beats, gives it a try.)

584
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,390
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

585
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,589
(Thudding)

586
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,820
- He got it right.
- Didn't he do it?

587
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,489
(Jong Min was very close.)

588
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,759
No? Even this doesn't count?

589
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,829
(Chattering)

590
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,900
You failed.

591
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,469
- That's really hard.
- He got it right.

592
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,599
- I think he got it.
- If he did...

593
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,799
Seriously. From the back, it seemed he got it.

594
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,039
- I thought so too.
- I think you got it.

595
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,810
What do you think? Was he completely off?

596
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,169
The sounds didn't overlap like when we tried it.

597
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,140
- It's just that he didn't...
- Right.

598
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,879
Hit the pot clearly. His pose just seemed weird.

599
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,279
- But I think he was on the beat.
- Right.

600
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,579
I was hesitant to hit it at first. Then I hit the pot afterward.

601
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,949
We should let the others finish.

602
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,489
- Yes.
- If everyone fails,

603
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,719
let's give one to Jong Min.

604
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,389
- Yes.
- He was the closest so far.

605
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,889
- I was the closest? Okay.
- So...

606
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,229
- Dowoon is next.
- Dowoon.

607
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,559
- Dowoon.
- He's a drummer, though.

608
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,689
There's no way he'd fail.

609
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,399
- Show us, Dowoon.
- He's got a good sense of rhythm.

610
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,929
- There he goes.
- Yes.

611
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,130
(He's in charge of keeping the tempo in his band.)

612
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,700
(The highlight of band music)

613
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,010
Isn't he the pride of DAY6?

614
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,209
- About this...
- If someone...

615
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,009
(Dowoon kept on practicing in the back.)

616
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,809
- You know?
- Exactly.

617
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,210
- Play the song.
- I bet he's good.

618
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,450
Let's go.

619
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,720
(Will Dowoon be able to succeed easily?)

620
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,820
(Thudding)

621
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,889
(Even Drummer Dowoon fails.)

622
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,159
He was completely off.

623
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,729
- He was so off.
- He was off?

624
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,030
- He was completely off.
- He wasn't even close.

625
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,029
- You'd rank last.
- You know what?

626
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,699
- He was a full beat ahead.
- Do you want to try again?

627
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,039
- My gosh.
- Can I try one last time?

628
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,339
- Right.
- One last time. Okay.

629
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,909
- But still, - It's your last try. I mean it.

630
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,239
- I'm a drummer.
- Even if you succeed,

631
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,779
- you won't eat the food?
- Dowoon, take a look.

632
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,979
Look. He made a really nice wrap.

633
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,650
Food isn't important right now.

634
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,570
- Okay. He's serious.
- He's serious about this.

635
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,020
The pot is quite dented now.

636
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,919
Go for it confidently.

637
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,240
- Right. You can do it.
- It's...

638
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,610
Can you give a performance and then hit it?

639
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,159
- Is that too much?
- All right. I'm ready.

640
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,689
- Let's see.
- All right. Play the song.

641
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,760
(Will he be able to regain his pride?)

642
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,969
(Focused)

643
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,704
All right.

644
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:03,465
Play the song.

645
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,257
(Will he be able to regain his pride?)

646
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:09,603
(Focused)

647
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:10,604
All right.

648
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:14,244
(Thudding)

649
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:18,213
You have to hit it half a beat later than you think.

650
00:20:18,214 --> 00:20:20,413
- Gosh, this is hard.
- It's...

651
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:21,783
You were the closest.

652
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:23,013
(The wrap goes to Jong Min.)

653
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,223
I can't believe Jong Min is taking it. He's a lucky guy.

654
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,523
(The wrap goes to Jong Min.)

655
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:28,093
Everyone, did you enjoy your food?

656
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,153
- Yes.
- Yes.

657
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:30,164
Yes.

658
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:31,724
All right.

659
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:33,863
- Let's go to the next spot...
- Yes.

660
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:35,764
- Okay.
- for an activity worthy of a trip.

661
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,303
For an activity worthy of a trip.

662
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:39,503
(Looking forward to it)

663
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:40,873
I guess we'll get to relax there.

664
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:42,033
(Will they be able to get to relax at the next spot?)

665
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,104
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

666
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:44,943
- Thank you for the food.
- It was good.

667
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,344
(Everyone is done with their meal.)

668
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:49,943
(But Young K is still eating.)

669
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:51,304
(Finishing the cold cucumber soup)

670
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:52,984
(Finishing the steamed eggs)

671
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,554
(Finishing the 2nd bowl of steamed eggs)

672
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,723
(Finishing everything)

673
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:05,693
(Eater K is done with his meal too.)

674
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:06,863
Can I try it one more time?

675
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:08,234
- Sure.
- Sure.

676
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:12,504
(He's the competitive type.)

677
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:15,604
(Completely engrossed)

678
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:19,973
(He fails again.)

679
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:21,513
- I can't do it.
- Let me try it.

680
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,313
- Let me try it for real.
- Once more.

681
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:26,084
(Keyboardist Wonpil tries it.)

682
00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:32,783
(Thudding)

683
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:33,793
(He missed it by a fraction of a second.)

684
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,124
Gosh, I think I got it now.

685
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:36,424
Let me try one more time.

686
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:38,023
- This is hard.
- I'll try it at home.

687
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,584
- "At home?"
- I'll try it again later.

688
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:42,563
- Where are we going now?
- Where are we going?

689
00:21:42,564 --> 00:21:43,863
Will it be an activity that will make our trip worthwhile?

690
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:45,624
- Right. Yes.
- To make our trip worthwhile?

691
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:48,404
Why does that sound scary? "Making our trip worthwhile."

692
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:50,484
Will it be another difficult mission?

693
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:51,743
Guys.

694
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,914
- Okay. Yes.
- We'll continue with our trip.

695
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:57,413
Do you know who Jean-Paul Sartre is?

696
00:21:57,414 --> 00:21:58,984
- What?
- Jean-Paul Sartre.

697
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,254
"Life is C between B and D."

698
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:04,583
- Right. Yes.
- We played a game about that.

699
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:05,883
At the next spot,

700
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:08,454
you'll be given some free time for sightseeing.

701
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,663
We prepared two things for you.

702
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,363
We must pick the right one. If not, we'll be in trouble.

703
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,840
- For the sightseeing programs, - Right.

704
00:22:13,864 --> 00:22:15,994
There are Type B and Type D.

705
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:18,504
I bet one of them will be a hiking course.

706
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,903
- D sounds too scary, doesn't it?
- There are no examples?

707
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:22,273
- Like death?
- Right.

708
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,103
By choosing a ticket,

709
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:26,404
you'll be selecting the sightseeing program.

710
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:28,944
- So it's random in the end.
- Yes.

711
00:22:29,044 --> 00:22:31,144
What were the programs from our past trip?

712
00:22:31,444 --> 00:22:33,353
- A hiking course to Mount Halla.
- What was the other option?

713
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:34,983
- Remember?
- Lake Baengnok and dolphins.

714
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:36,183
D was for a dolphin watching program.

715
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:37,453
- We...
- Lake Baengnok.

716
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:39,214
B was for a hiking program to Lake Baengnok.

717
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:43,763
(Confused)

718
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:45,624
They might use reverse psychology on us.

719
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,933
You think they'd do that?

720
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:49,663
Can't you give us a hint? A hint about the programs?

721
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:51,304
We don't know which one is which, anyway.

722
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:54,134
Will it be a therapeutic program? Or will some of us...

723
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:55,903
You guys are already good at reading our hands.

724
00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:57,573
We'll proceed without any hints.

725
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:59,204
- Okay. Let's keep it clean.
- Okay.

726
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,924
This is all about reading their mind.

727
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:02,114
There's a good chance that...

728
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,683
- it may begin with the letter D.
- Starting with D...

729
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:04,684
Right.

730
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:06,284
- Like diving.
- Gosh.

731
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:08,684
What are you leaning toward?

732
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:10,284
- I'm not sure.
- Driving?

733
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:12,253
- It could be driving.
- Driving?

734
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:13,254
Yes.

735
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:14,994
What program could start with B?

736
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:17,563
- Bakery?
- Yes, bakery.

737
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,263
- That'd be so nice.
- Bakery.

738
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,333
We had our meal,

739
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:21,334
- so it's time for desserts.
- Desserts.

740
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:22,394
- Bakery.
- Gosh.

741
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,264
B must be bungee jumping.

742
00:23:24,964 --> 00:23:26,404
Do you think it will be that simple?

743
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:29,004
Actually, there's no point in thinking about it.

744
00:23:29,404 --> 00:23:31,044
We must chase after pain.

745
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,304
- What?
- You know?

746
00:23:32,604 --> 00:23:33,643
What did you say?

747
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:34,843
(Startled)

748
00:23:34,844 --> 00:23:37,114
- We must seek pain.
- Right.

749
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:40,064
- So we can grow as a person.
- It will help us grow.

750
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:41,313
- Think about it.
- But it was...

751
00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:42,983
Didn't you feel great after hiking Mount Halla?

752
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:44,254
- I did.
- Didn't you?

753
00:23:44,554 --> 00:23:46,223
- Are you good with that?
- We got a new experience.

754
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,993
We must seek pain. So I'll choose B.

755
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,524
(Joon chooses B.)

756
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:51,794
Then I'll choose D.

757
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:54,470
- You shouldn't follow him.
- You'll choose B?

758
00:23:54,494 --> 00:23:56,264
- I'll choose B.
- I'll choose D, then!

759
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:57,504
I'll choose D too.

760
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:01,033
- You'll all regret this.
- I'll join my colleague. B.

761
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:02,203
- I'll go with B too.
- B!

762
00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:03,673
- Great. B will be great.
- B.

763
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:04,773
- I'll pick B too.
- Great.

764
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:06,303
(B: Sae Ho, Joon, DinDin, SungJin, Wonpil)

765
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:07,973
(D: Jong Min, Se Yoon, Seon Ho, Young K, Dowoon)

766
00:24:07,974 --> 00:24:09,514
This is quite exciting.

767
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:12,144
Not knowing what will happen next.

768
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:13,413
It's the not-knowing part.

769
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:16,013
It's definitely more fun because we don't know what's next.

770
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:18,024
- Really?
- It'd be different if we knew.

771
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:19,924
I can see the sea.

772
00:24:20,454 --> 00:24:22,124
The sea looks beautiful right now.

773
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:23,794
It's so blue.

774
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:26,024
I can just get off the bus with the ticket, right?

775
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:28,464
- This is the spot for B.
- B.

776
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:29,894
Is it a walking tour?

777
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:31,663
It's ominous that we're in front of a boat.

778
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:33,263
(Will some of us get on a boat?)

779
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,734
If you chose Ticket D, come this way.

780
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,343
- Where?
- Ticket D?

781
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:38,874
You won't tell us where we're going?

782
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:41,243
- Should we follow you?
- Yes, you can follow me.

783
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:42,914
It looks like we're going to walk.

784
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,114
- Let's go.
- Okay.

785
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,513
- Bye.
- Bye.

786
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:47,214
- Stay alive.
- Bye.

787
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:48,713
- Stay alive.
- Please...

788
00:24:48,714 --> 00:24:51,254
So we won't find out what each team has?

789
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:54,493
You know that for games like this, it's always wise to follow Jong Min.

790
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,023
- He's the icon of luck.
- Yes, he always picks good ones.

791
00:24:57,024 --> 00:24:58,940
Look at us. Because we're with him, we're off to an easy start.

792
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,093
(I believe in you, my role model.)

793
00:25:01,094 --> 00:25:02,994
I'm certain D doesn't stand for death.

794
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:05,104
Where are we? Candlestick Rock Trail?

795
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,164
- Candlestick Rock Trail?
- Will this be a difficult trail?

796
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:11,373
The mix of the blue ocean and oddly shaped rocks...

797
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:12,703
creates a stunning landscape,

798
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,790
earning it the nickname of Mount Kumgang of the Ocean.

799
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,984
It's Chogok Yonggul Candlestick Rock Trail.

800
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:20,754
(It opened to visitors, starting from 2019.)

801
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:24,354
(It's a 660m coastal trail.)

802
00:25:24,754 --> 00:25:26,923
Did you figure out what the D stands for?

803
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:28,694
D from a candlestick or a day of hiking?

804
00:25:29,054 --> 00:25:30,663
Is D from Candlestick Rock?

805
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:31,744
(His lips are getting dry.)

806
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:32,894
- D...
- Candlestick.

807
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,234
- "Deck."
- "Deck."

808
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:35,433
- What does this mean?
- What's that?

809
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,510
- What does that mean?
- We can just go to the deck?

810
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:39,434
- What?
- Those of you who chose Ticket D...

811
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,403
will walk on the deck,

812
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:42,703
built along the seashore cliff.

813
00:25:42,704 --> 00:25:45,173
You'll take this time to admire Chogok Yonggul...

814
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:47,373
and the magnificence of the Candlestick Rock up close.

815
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:48,444
- Gosh.
- What?

816
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,573
(Current location, Suspension bridge, )

817
00:25:49,574 --> 00:25:50,613
(Candlestick Rock, Turtle Rock, )

818
00:25:50,614 --> 00:25:51,783
(Pyramid Rock, Lion Rock, Dragon Cave)

819
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,624
- Gosh, this is crazy.
- Is that a good thing?

820
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:55,254
- It's 36°C today.
- No.

821
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,654
- They just want us to walk.
- This is crazy.

822
00:25:57,854 --> 00:25:59,984
Well, it's all relative.

823
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:01,894
Tell us what the other team got.

824
00:26:02,224 --> 00:26:04,663
You'll find out once you begin your sightseeing program.

825
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:06,664
- We might run into each other?
- The direction...

826
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:08,234
- Let's begin.
- Gosh.

827
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:10,210
Which group has a better program? Us or them?

828
00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:11,954
- You'll find out about that too.
- Really?

829
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,034
If I knew we got the better one, I could go happily.

830
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:19,203
(Team Deck)

831
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:20,244
- Seriously.
- Right.

832
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:21,544
It's so hot.

833
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,913
- This is crazy.
- It's killing us too.

834
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:25,013
Gosh, it's so hot.

835
00:26:25,014 --> 00:26:27,130
(They're off to a difficult start due to the heatwave.)

836
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:28,854
- Right.
- I'm already sweating.

837
00:26:29,514 --> 00:26:30,724
It's an uphill path.

838
00:26:31,984 --> 00:26:33,053
It's an uphill path.

839
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:35,053
(Because it's too hot, even a flat path feels like an incline.)

840
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:36,254
This will help me lose weight.

841
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:38,024
This is great.

842
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:41,063
- Gosh, the ladies are here too.
- Jong Min, I'm a fan.

843
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:42,264
- My gosh.
- They're his fans.

844
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:46,033
- Did you see that?
- He's the star of the universe.

845
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:47,633
- You bet.
- That's your role model.

846
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:48,704
I knew it.

847
00:26:49,204 --> 00:26:51,164
- Dowoon, you could be like him too.
- Of course.

848
00:26:51,204 --> 00:26:52,944
The color of the water is beautiful.

849
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:54,773
- The color of the water is crazy.
- We should dive in.

850
00:26:54,774 --> 00:26:55,874
Seon Ho, dive in.

851
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,284
How about a dive?

852
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:00,254
- Check out the color!
- What a gorgeous color.

853
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:03,244
Has it always been this beautiful?

854
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:04,924
- Seon Ho, how about a dive?
- A dive?

855
00:27:06,784 --> 00:27:07,893
If you do it, I'll do it.

856
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:08,934
(They arrive at the deck.)

857
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:11,464
- The breeze feels refreshing.
- Hey. But...

858
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:13,324
- Hey. The ocean breeze is cool.
- Gosh.

859
00:27:13,494 --> 00:27:15,374
- It's cool.
- Why does it feel so breezy here?

860
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:16,733
The trail is shaded too.

861
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:17,833
- Right, it's not bad.
- Right.

862
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,563
- It's not bad at all.
- This is excellent.

863
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:20,934
I like it. It's breezy here.

864
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:22,774
- It's cool here with the breeze.
- Gosh.

865
00:27:24,504 --> 00:27:27,214
(Snapping a picture)

866
00:27:28,444 --> 00:27:29,774
It's so beautiful.

867
00:27:30,414 --> 00:27:32,044
- It's breezy here.
- Yes.

868
00:27:32,144 --> 00:27:33,914
- Should we take a break?
- Shall we?

869
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:35,954
- Let's take a break.
- Gosh, I love it.

870
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:38,523
- It's so breezy.
- I'm filming the drone camera.

871
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,253
(They get to relax for a bit while gazing at the East Sea.)

872
00:27:40,254 --> 00:27:41,923
I'd love to try scuba diving in summer.

873
00:27:41,924 --> 00:27:43,124
- That's so fast.
- I love it.

874
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:46,293
- The color is stunning.
- I'd love to go into the water.

875
00:27:46,294 --> 00:27:47,394
- Right?
- Yes.

876
00:27:48,064 --> 00:27:49,863
I think they might be on that. Isn't that a canoe?

877
00:27:49,864 --> 00:27:50,934
Gosh, it's a canoe.

878
00:27:51,464 --> 00:27:52,833
- Is it a boat?
- A boat?

879
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:54,004
- Just a boat.
- That's it?

880
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:55,904
It will definitely make them sweat.

881
00:27:56,204 --> 00:27:57,673
- It could seriously kill you.
- Right.

882
00:27:57,674 --> 00:27:59,604
- There's no shade for them.
- Exactly.

883
00:27:59,974 --> 00:28:01,814
- It's so breezy here.
- They can't even rest.

884
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:03,314
Canoeing is really difficult.

885
00:28:04,514 --> 00:28:07,084
Those of you who chose Ticket B, come this way.

886
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:09,413
Here's what I feel. Last time, Joon chose B...

887
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:11,383
- and had a tough time with it.
- What?

888
00:28:11,384 --> 00:28:13,544
- B might be a good program today.
- Could it be that?

889
00:28:14,354 --> 00:28:16,293
- Could it be that?
- That's it.

890
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,323
- That must be it.
- There are cameras on it.

891
00:28:17,324 --> 00:28:18,923
- I'm getting a feeling that's it.
- There are cameras on it.

892
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:20,210
- So it's a boat.
- That will be fun.

893
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:21,633
Gosh, we got a good program!

894
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:22,733
That's not a fishing boat.

895
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:23,763
- Riding that will be fun.
- Right.

896
00:28:23,764 --> 00:28:24,903
- This is it.
- This is great. This is it.

897
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:26,103
- No way!
- Yes!

898
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,503
(No way!)

899
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:28,533
I love it.

900
00:28:28,534 --> 00:28:29,534
(I think this boat is for us.)

901
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,304
- This is great.
- That has to be it, right?

902
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:34,373
- Everyone.
- That was impressive.

903
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:36,843
Did you notice what B could mean?

904
00:28:36,844 --> 00:28:38,683
You picked Ticket B.

905
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:39,744
Does it stand for "boat?"

906
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:41,684
It means boat.

907
00:28:41,984 --> 00:28:44,524
(Boat is correct.)

908
00:28:45,354 --> 00:28:47,793
(Very satisfied)

909
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,193
- It will be relaxing from now on.
- Awesome.

910
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:50,763
- This is great.
- It'll be relaxing.

911
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:53,794
You chose Ticket B. While listening to lively music,

912
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:56,534
you will go on a private boat tour where you can enjoy...

913
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,063
- the East Sea's beautiful view.
- This is amazing.

914
00:28:59,064 --> 00:29:00,703
Isn't this too good to be true?

915
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:02,374
- Right.
- This is good.

916
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:04,003
- I'm so happy.
- You worked very hard.

917
00:29:04,004 --> 00:29:05,843
I know. I feel so happy.

918
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,444
- Well done, Joon.
- I'm so happy.

919
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:08,643
- Gosh.
- Well done.

920
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:10,713
- This is amazing.
- Joon finally avoided trouble...

921
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:11,944
after a very long time.

922
00:29:13,244 --> 00:29:14,653
(We got the good ticket.)

923
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:16,290
It means that it's hard for the other team.

924
00:29:16,314 --> 00:29:17,783
- Right.
- It must be hard.

925
00:29:17,784 --> 00:29:18,784
All right.

926
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:20,223
- Please put on a life vest...
- Okay.

927
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:21,493
- and get on the boat right away.
- Yes!

928
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:22,523
- All right.
- Yes.

929
00:29:22,524 --> 00:29:23,524
- Yes.
- Seriously?

930
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:25,393
- It's never happened before.
- I know.

931
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:26,764
I feel so happy.

932
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:29,793
Honestly, this is such a sweet deal.

933
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:30,833
Seriously.

934
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:32,703
This has never happened to me before.

935
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:33,773
(Joon is moved by this rare stroke of luck.)

936
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:35,774
Before that, we had to climb Mount Halla...

937
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:37,774
and watch the dolphins.

938
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:41,343
There was a rainstorm at that time.

939
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,474
We had to move as the rain hit us sideways.

940
00:29:44,314 --> 00:29:45,813
I want to go back.

941
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:47,253
(He ends up showing his climbing video.)

942
00:29:47,254 --> 00:29:48,984
- Seriously?
- This is what happened.

943
00:29:49,114 --> 00:29:51,453
Did you really have to do something like this?

944
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:55,054
(DAY6 finds everything fascinating.)

945
00:29:55,354 --> 00:29:57,464
To be honest,

946
00:29:57,724 --> 00:29:59,924
I avoided what Young K picked.

947
00:30:00,124 --> 00:30:02,563
First, I avoided what Young K picked.

948
00:30:02,564 --> 00:30:03,703
And...

949
00:30:03,704 --> 00:30:06,234
And sure enough...

950
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,133
(Jong Min is lucky when it comes to this.)

951
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:11,473
(Clueless about what's coming next, )

952
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:12,943
(they think that they got lucky.)

953
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,713
- Hello.
- Hello.

954
00:30:14,714 --> 00:30:15,774
This is great.

955
00:30:16,474 --> 00:30:18,674
- We get to go sightseeing.
- Please show a peace sign.

956
00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:19,814
Seriously.

957
00:30:20,114 --> 00:30:21,853
We're going sightseeing.

958
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,584
- Thank you so much.
- Have fun, everyone.

959
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:25,823
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

960
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,253
- It's like we're going sightseeing.
- This is amazing.

961
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:30,134
- We just have to ride the boat.
- What's this?

962
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:33,124
(The boat gets farther away from the port.)

963
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:34,593
I wonder what D stands for.

964
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:36,393
(The other team's sightseeing course remains a mystery.)

965
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:37,834
- Diving.
- "Diving?"

966
00:30:37,964 --> 00:30:39,034
Diving.

967
00:30:39,364 --> 00:30:40,804
But diving is fun.

968
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:42,803
(I hope that they have a hard time.)

969
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:44,404
We're setting off now.

970
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:46,243
We're setting off.

971
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,773
(Increasing the speed)

972
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:48,813
The boat is quite fast.

973
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:49,914
- Isn't it fast?
- Yes.

974
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:51,984
This is great.

975
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:54,653
- This is wonderful.
- On a boat...

976
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:58,424
(The boat glides swiftly across the blue sea.)

977
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,353
- Thank you.
- Yes.

978
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:02,593
Thank you.

979
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,594
(Deeply touched)

980
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,623
It's speedy.

981
00:31:04,624 --> 00:31:06,193
Joon, luck is on your side now.

982
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:07,363
It's on your side.

983
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:09,233
- Usually, he's unlucky.
- Really?

984
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,763
I think luck is on his side now.

985
00:31:10,764 --> 00:31:12,134
(Joon got lucky as DAY6 arrived.)

986
00:31:14,574 --> 00:31:15,674
This is nice.

987
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,033
(Enjoying the view of the sea)

988
00:31:17,034 --> 00:31:18,103
This is great.

989
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:19,444
The water is very clear.

990
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:21,643
Right. It's because we're at the East Sea.

991
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:23,613
- Yes, the water looks lovely.
- It's very transparent.

992
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:25,743
(They enjoy the emerald East Sea on a boat.)

993
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:26,814
It's so beautiful.

994
00:31:28,914 --> 00:31:30,454
- It's really refreshing.
- It's nice.

995
00:31:30,684 --> 00:31:31,854
It's very lovely.

996
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,383
It's nice.

997
00:31:33,384 --> 00:31:35,294
(Enjoy the East Sea for a minute.)

998
00:31:36,524 --> 00:31:39,594
(Truly unwinding by enjoying the view of the clear sea)

999
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:42,934
It's refreshing.

1000
00:31:43,564 --> 00:31:44,804
- This is amazing.
- Seriously.

1001
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,504
Even when the water splashes on me, I feel great.

1002
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:49,303
It's wonderful.

1003
00:31:49,304 --> 00:31:50,473
I'm so happy...

1004
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:52,803
that I don't care about sleeping outdoors tonight.

1005
00:31:52,804 --> 00:31:54,244
- I really don't care.
- Me neither.

1006
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,344
It looks amazing.

1007
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,383
(Sparkling)

1008
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:01,053
Is it okay to be so happy?

1009
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:02,553
- Look.
- It's refreshing.

1010
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:05,853
(They enjoyed some happy moments.)

1011
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:06,884
It feels cool.

1012
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,033
- They're going up.
- Really?

1013
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:17,504
Look over there. You can see a path where you walk up.

1014
00:32:17,764 --> 00:32:19,103
They'll probably be walking up there.

1015
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,533
(Presuming that Team D probably walked)

1016
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:22,803
- Do you see that?
- Yes.

1017
00:32:22,804 --> 00:32:23,843
That must be it.

1018
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:25,544
(Members, are you walking over there?)

1019
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,914
Isn't it them?

1020
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:30,544
- There they are.
- I think that it's them.

1021
00:32:30,684 --> 00:32:31,843
They're really over there.

1022
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:33,543
- Over there.
- I see them.

1023
00:32:33,544 --> 00:32:34,984
- Where?
- It must be them.

1024
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:36,713
- It's them.
- They're here.

1025
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:39,683
(Both teams head to the suspension bridge.)

1026
00:32:39,684 --> 00:32:40,854
It's swaying.

1027
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:43,293
(Team Deck is walking without knowing anything.)

1028
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,700
I used to be scared, but I overcame the fear of walking on it.

1029
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:46,994
Hello!

1030
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,103
(Sae Ho's voice?)

1031
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:53,664
What? It's not them, is it?

1032
00:32:54,774 --> 00:32:56,203
Is that their boat?

1033
00:32:56,204 --> 00:32:58,204
(Is it a boat instead of a canoe?)

1034
00:32:58,804 --> 00:33:00,344
I see Moon Se Yoon over there.

1035
00:33:00,974 --> 00:33:02,174
- Really?
- Yes.

1036
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:03,843
They're over there.

1037
00:33:03,844 --> 00:33:05,884
Hey!

1038
00:33:08,014 --> 00:33:09,183
Hi!

1039
00:33:09,184 --> 00:33:11,453
(It's good to see you.)

1040
00:33:11,454 --> 00:33:12,554
Hello.

1041
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:16,353
(Unbelievable)

1042
00:33:16,354 --> 00:33:17,394
What are you doing?

1043
00:33:17,724 --> 00:33:19,094
- Hey, guys.
- What are you doing?

1044
00:33:19,724 --> 00:33:22,163
Everyone, D stands for deck.

1045
00:33:22,164 --> 00:33:24,304
- "Deck?"
- "Deck?"

1046
00:33:24,464 --> 00:33:25,563
They have to walk...

1047
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:27,304
on the path to the end.

1048
00:33:27,904 --> 00:33:29,133
They're practically on foot.

1049
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,494
- They're on foot.
- You're right.

1050
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,174
Did we lose?

1051
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:35,714
My morale went down all of a sudden.

1052
00:33:36,074 --> 00:33:37,613
This is so much fun.

1053
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:39,184
We're on a suspension bridge.

1054
00:33:39,314 --> 00:33:43,083
(Squeezing out their joy)

1055
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:45,384
If you jump from there, we'll let one of you on the boat.

1056
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:46,983
I wouldn't get on your boat.

1057
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,023
Dive.

1058
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:49,793
If you jump from there, we'll let one of you on the boat.

1059
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,593
Do you want to turn this into death?

1060
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:53,623
(Deck could turn into death.)

1061
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:54,793
- Turn around.
- Let's take a photo.

1062
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:56,134
They're in the frame.

1063
00:33:56,864 --> 00:33:58,263
My goodness.

1064
00:33:58,264 --> 00:33:59,303
(Upset)

1065
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:00,504
You'll get motion sickness.

1066
00:34:00,974 --> 00:34:02,494
I hope one of them falls in the water.

1067
00:34:02,904 --> 00:34:05,074
- Fall in the water.
- Someone should push them.

1068
00:34:06,904 --> 00:34:07,974
All right.

1069
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,843
(Everyone, including Team Deck, is in the photo.)

1070
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,353
- Bye.
- Enjoy yourselves.

1071
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:15,354
- See you later.
- Be careful.

1072
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:16,714
It's not as bad as you think.

1073
00:34:17,214 --> 00:34:18,983
(They say goodbye excitedly from the boat.)

1074
00:34:18,984 --> 00:34:21,254
Did you see the look on Dowoon's face?

1075
00:34:21,924 --> 00:34:23,893
It looks like he's given up on everything.

1076
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:24,894
Seriously.

1077
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,140
(1 percent upset, 2 percent irritated, 97 percent jealous)

1078
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,163
Since it's not sunny, it can't be so bad.

1079
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:29,494
- Right.
- That's piece of cake.

1080
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,104
- It should've been sunny.
- I know.

1081
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,333
(Laughing)

1082
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:35,434
It's no joke.

1083
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:36,833
(It's easy to say because it's not their problem.)

1084
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,174
When they look down...

1085
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:41,644
(The two teams separate again.)

1086
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:43,443
Please take a look to your right.

1087
00:34:43,444 --> 00:34:45,514
On your right, you'll see...

1088
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,553
a long rock. It's called Candlestick Rock.

1089
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:49,754
(Candlestick Rock)

1090
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:54,493
(A uniquely shaped rock sculpted by time and wind)

1091
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:56,823
The rock on your left is called Turtle Rock.

1092
00:34:56,824 --> 00:34:59,623
Turtle Rock gets its name from the shape at its peak.

1093
00:34:59,624 --> 00:35:02,234
It resembles a turtle raising its head toward the sky.

1094
00:35:02,494 --> 00:35:04,433
- Please take a look.
- Oh, my.

1095
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:06,364
(Impressed)

1096
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:08,003
Gosh, is this it?

1097
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:09,333
(Going to Candlestick Rock and Turtle Rock)

1098
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:10,373
We're almost there.

1099
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,094
(Going to Candlestick Rock and Turtle Rock)

1100
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:13,773
There's a bird.

1101
00:35:13,774 --> 00:35:15,074
There's a seagull.

1102
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:17,983
Is that where you're standing?

1103
00:35:17,984 --> 00:35:20,243
(A bird welcomes the boat.)

1104
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:22,754
The water is very transparent. You can see the bottom.

1105
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:24,153
It is the East Sea, indeed.

1106
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:26,424
(While Team Boat is enjoying some relaxing time)

1107
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,254
- How is this possible?
- By the way,

1108
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:29,994
they don't get to see the rock up close.

1109
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:31,123
That's true.

1110
00:35:31,124 --> 00:35:32,624
We're so close that we can touch it.

1111
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,934
It's good to be positive about everything.

1112
00:35:36,494 --> 00:35:37,763
This is endless.

1113
00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:39,904
I thought that we'd ride the canoe, but we didn't.

1114
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:41,634
Maybe we will when we get there.

1115
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,374
Canoe?

1116
00:35:44,104 --> 00:35:46,103
(Getting tired)

1117
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,303
- You know what?
- What?

1118
00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:49,613
- We've been sitting down...
- What's going on?

1119
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:50,914
Look at Joon. He's dancing.

1120
00:35:52,344 --> 00:35:53,814
- What?
- They're playing music.

1121
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:58,684
(Their 2nd plan to tease them has started.)

1122
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:04,094
Everyone, scream!

1123
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:06,624
(In a trance)

1124
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,093
Goodness.

1125
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:09,094
(Forcing a laugh)

1126
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:10,964
They're being so annoying.

1127
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,873
(A dance solely for Team Deck)

1128
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:17,304
We can enjoy ourselves too, can't we?

1129
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:21,813
We'll get going now.

1130
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:23,173
Okay, let's go!

1131
00:36:23,174 --> 00:36:24,344
(The perfect timing)

1132
00:36:25,214 --> 00:36:27,014
Goodbye.

1133
00:36:27,754 --> 00:36:29,283
Why are you leaving...

1134
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:30,284
(Unfair)

1135
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:31,685
as soon as we're about to have fun?

1136
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:35,524
(Take your time to get there by foot.)

1137
00:36:35,724 --> 00:36:37,024
Can we keep listening to music?

1138
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:39,724
Can you play a song like "Welcome to the Show?"

1139
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:44,133
(A melody echoing again over the sea)

1140
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:47,734
- Welcome to the show - Welcome to the show

1141
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:55,114
(It has the vibe of a music video.)

1142
00:36:56,344 --> 00:36:59,413
(Wonpil captures this moment with his eyes.)

1143
00:36:59,414 --> 00:37:02,384
(Wonpil and SungJin capture this moment with their eyes.)

1144
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:21,073
This feels strange.

1145
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,434
(Fascinated)

1146
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:23,904
It feels strange.

1147
00:37:24,104 --> 00:37:25,274
It feels strange.

1148
00:37:29,644 --> 00:37:31,784
(Flapping)

1149
00:37:32,214 --> 00:37:34,254
(This is exciting.)

1150
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:36,714
It looks beautiful.

1151
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,983
The color of the water is so pretty.

1152
00:37:38,984 --> 00:37:40,254
This is so relaxing.

1153
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:42,593
Let's take some photos.

1154
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,000
- Let's take a photo.
- Come on, everyone.

1155
00:37:44,024 --> 00:37:45,924
If we smile brightly, we will look happy.

1156
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:47,763
We're here.

1157
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:50,594
(Team Deck's concept is smiling.)

1158
00:37:51,464 --> 00:37:54,334
(We're also happy.)

1159
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:57,434
We'll shoot a closing segment here.

1160
00:37:58,204 --> 00:37:59,474
Are you ready?

1161
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:01,044
Here we go.

1162
00:38:01,314 --> 00:38:02,544
Ready. Action.

1163
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:05,214
Welcome to the real variety... No.

1164
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,084
Welcome to the real variety... No.

1165
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:13,754
(Without any warning, he suddenly spoke in a dialect.)

1166
00:38:13,984 --> 00:38:16,353
"Welcome to the real variety..."

1167
00:38:16,354 --> 00:38:17,394
(Goodness, Dowoon.)

1168
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:20,570
- "Welcome to the..."
- That's hilarious.

1169
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:21,763
That was a mix of Kim Jong Min...

1170
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:23,094
and a bit of Heo Kyeong Hwan.

1171
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,964
There was a bit of Heo Kyeong Hwan.

1172
00:38:25,104 --> 00:38:27,903
"Welcome to the variety show."

1173
00:38:27,904 --> 00:38:29,824
(A highly sought-after talent for variety shows)

1174
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,804
Here we go. Ready. Action.

1175
00:38:32,274 --> 00:38:34,613
- Welcome to the real variety show.
- Welcome to the real variety show.

1176
00:38:34,614 --> 00:38:35,943
- Who are we?
- Who are we?

1177
00:38:35,944 --> 00:38:37,883
- 2 Days...
- 2 Days...

1178
00:38:37,884 --> 00:38:40,984
- 1 Night.
- 1 Night.

1179
00:38:41,614 --> 00:38:42,983
It's not working out for me at all today.

1180
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:44,854
"Welcome to the variety show."

1181
00:38:45,024 --> 00:38:46,054
"1 Night."

1182
00:38:47,084 --> 00:38:49,023
(To the base camp)

1183
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:51,070
(Wonpil is the first person to get on from Team Boat.)

1184
00:38:51,094 --> 00:38:53,064
(Looking flawless despite the scorching heat)

1185
00:38:53,094 --> 00:38:54,234
Why are you sweating?

1186
00:38:54,694 --> 00:38:56,494
I'm hot. It's hot.

1187
00:38:57,194 --> 00:38:58,433
- Is it hot?
- Yes.

1188
00:38:58,434 --> 00:39:00,134
It was refreshing too.

1189
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:02,134
Really?

1190
00:39:02,135 --> 00:39:03,573
(Look at this.)

1191
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:04,574
Is it hot?

1192
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:09,314
I overlooked the luck you had.

1193
00:39:09,574 --> 00:39:10,643
(The lucky one who never disappoints)

1194
00:39:10,644 --> 00:39:12,084
I should've kept my original choice.

1195
00:39:12,514 --> 00:39:14,014
That was the feeling I had.

1196
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:16,714
I was having an amazing time.

1197
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:18,854
It was really great...

1198
00:39:20,054 --> 00:39:21,324
until we saw that boat.

1199
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,123
Gosh, well done.

1200
00:39:25,124 --> 00:39:26,294
Good job, guys.

1201
00:39:27,694 --> 00:39:29,664
- Did you have fun?
- It was really nice.

1202
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:31,833
(Sad Team Deck, happy Team Boat)

1203
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:33,554
Dowoon, go over there and mingle with them.

1204
00:39:34,404 --> 00:39:35,764
- Go and mingle with them.
- Okay.

1205
00:39:36,004 --> 00:39:37,943
That's the seat for the youth.

1206
00:39:37,944 --> 00:39:39,424
Young people are sitting in the back.

1207
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:40,914
The seat for the youth.

1208
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:42,344
Let's get going.

1209
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:44,713
Please feel free to speak to me casually.

1210
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:46,344
- Okay.
- Yes.

1211
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,954
Did you have a good time?

1212
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:49,664
You guys are much older than me.

1213
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:52,500
I usually have a hard time dropping the honorifics.

1214
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:54,453
- Really?
- Dropping the honorifics is hard.

1215
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:55,593
(Born in 2002 and 1995)

1216
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:57,693
I was the same, but being on variety shows...

1217
00:39:57,694 --> 00:39:58,763
made me drop the honorifics very easily.

1218
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:01,263
I'd be the same if I got to be on variety shows a lot.

1219
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:02,393
I completely understand you.

1220
00:40:02,394 --> 00:40:03,764
When you're on a variety show,

1221
00:40:03,964 --> 00:40:06,604
it's easier to get closer to others when you drop the honorifics.

1222
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:09,934
Was it nice on the boat?

1223
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:11,974
Walking would have been better.

1224
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,843
- Of course.
- There was a lot of sea breeze.

1225
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:15,943
- That's right.
- The sea breeze.

1226
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:18,544
Wonpil's arms seemed sticky.

1227
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:20,713
Yes, it was a little sticky.

1228
00:40:20,714 --> 00:40:21,953
Because of the seawater.

1229
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:24,823
There was something strange about the boat.

1230
00:40:24,824 --> 00:40:26,524
When you go down in the boat,

1231
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,053
there's an unbelievable space where it touches the water.

1232
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:31,363
It's not a good experience...

1233
00:40:31,364 --> 00:40:32,664
because it's hard to forget.

1234
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:34,064
- Because...
- Yes.

1235
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:35,564
It makes you want to go back.

1236
00:40:35,794 --> 00:40:37,293
It was so wonderful that it was upsetting.

1237
00:40:37,294 --> 00:40:39,063
Sae Ho, let's show them some photos.

1238
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:41,833
It felt like paradise.

1239
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,433
- It's okay.
- We don't need to see the photos.

1240
00:40:43,434 --> 00:40:44,543
We don't have to.

1241
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,103
I'm sending a text to someone personally.

1242
00:40:46,104 --> 00:40:47,914
You can't send texts when you're on camera.

1243
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,843
I'm sending a private message to SungJin.

1244
00:40:49,844 --> 00:40:50,873
- Really?
- Yes.

1245
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:52,883
You know what?

1246
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:54,014
I love it.

1247
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:55,683
Team D was happy.

1248
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:57,583
- Look at this.
- We were very satisfied.

1249
00:40:57,584 --> 00:40:59,123
- Of course.
- This is...

1250
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,323
The photos are nothing.

1251
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,894
(Glancing)

1252
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:03,723
- Let me see.
- What is that?

1253
00:41:03,724 --> 00:41:04,863
Don't lie.

1254
00:41:04,864 --> 00:41:07,094
- Aren't those special effects?
- Stop lying.

1255
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:09,893
You must have asked ChatGPT to do it.

1256
00:41:09,894 --> 00:41:11,103
(Feeling jealous, he says whatever.)

1257
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:12,233
You used the chroma key, didn't you?

1258
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:13,363
What is that?

1259
00:41:13,364 --> 00:41:14,833
- What's that?
- There was a transparent surface.

1260
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:16,033
There was an opening under the boat.

1261
00:41:16,034 --> 00:41:17,034
- Right.
- Seriously?

1262
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:18,873
- It was really beautiful.
- Oh, my.

1263
00:41:18,874 --> 00:41:21,673
I'd like to congratulate DAY6 on this.

1264
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:23,913
We've done 20 percent...

1265
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,014
- of what we have to do today.
- Twenty percent?

1266
00:41:26,544 --> 00:41:28,284
We finished 20 percent.

1267
00:41:28,514 --> 00:41:29,783
We still have 80 percent to go.

1268
00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:30,983
Isn't it exciting?

1269
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:33,083
I'd like to see how satisfied the DAY6 members are...

1270
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:34,454
until now.

1271
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:37,893
Do you regret coming on the show, or are you having a good time?

1272
00:41:37,894 --> 00:41:39,693
- But they're smiling so much.
- Of course.

1273
00:41:39,694 --> 00:41:40,793
Or how about this?

1274
00:41:40,794 --> 00:41:43,663
It's great to be on the show,

1275
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:46,233
but there have been some dizzying moments.

1276
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:47,503
- A little.
- A little?

1277
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:49,074
When were the dizzying moments?

1278
00:41:49,434 --> 00:41:51,074
- During that 1 percent.
- The 1 percent?

1279
00:41:51,544 --> 00:41:52,643
When we had only one percent left.

1280
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,273
Will you come back on the show if you get invited again?

1281
00:41:54,274 --> 00:41:55,973
(Are you willing to come back on the show?)

1282
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:57,373
- I will.
- Me too.

1283
00:41:57,374 --> 00:41:58,583
- Really?
- Yes.

1284
00:41:58,584 --> 00:42:00,390
- What about you, Wonpil?
- It's been memorable.

1285
00:42:00,414 --> 00:42:01,453
Really?

1286
00:42:01,454 --> 00:42:02,974
For you, it must be worth remembering.

1287
00:42:03,384 --> 00:42:04,524
(Laughing)

1288
00:42:04,884 --> 00:42:07,044
The two who were on the boat are willing to come back.

1289
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:08,823
Those who were on the boat?

1290
00:42:08,824 --> 00:42:10,493
Dowoon, what did you think about Jong Min?

1291
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:13,164
I've seen enough of him.

1292
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,933
That's better. That's more honest.

1293
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,834
Now I completely understand what he's like.

1294
00:42:18,164 --> 00:42:19,803
This is what they say.

1295
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:22,073
"When you have a role model,"

1296
00:42:22,074 --> 00:42:24,233
"sometimes, it's better not to meet them in person."

1297
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:25,243
- Right.
- I agree.

1298
00:42:25,244 --> 00:42:26,844
- It's better to stay as a fan.
- Right.

1299
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,244
He was very disappointed.

1300
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:29,943
Before getting on the boat,

1301
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:31,544
he said, "Is that how you talk?"

1302
00:42:32,214 --> 00:42:33,683
You like such people, right?

1303
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,753
I'm thankful to Wonpil for laughing a lot.

1304
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:37,254
Whatever we say, he always smiles.

1305
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,823
He's Mr. Smile.

1306
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:40,224
(Wonpil, the reaction king)

1307
00:42:40,984 --> 00:42:42,654
A small octopus has three hearts.

1308
00:42:42,954 --> 00:42:44,963
(He laughs when someone says something ridiculous.)

1309
00:42:44,964 --> 00:42:46,263
I think I've seen enough today.

1310
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:48,233
(Laughing more loudly at his member's joke)

1311
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:50,834
I didn't like that he was with me, so I choked on the food.

1312
00:42:51,134 --> 00:42:53,203
(He just laughs.)

1313
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:56,404
Was it very difficult to hit the pot?

1314
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:58,443
"Was it difficult?"

1315
00:42:58,444 --> 00:43:01,714
(He especially loves Se Yoon's sense of humor.)

1316
00:43:02,674 --> 00:43:05,843
It's very...

1317
00:43:05,844 --> 00:43:07,744
I shouldn't say this, but everyone is...

1318
00:43:08,054 --> 00:43:09,054
How shall I put it?

1319
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:10,513
Everyone seems so cute.

1320
00:43:10,514 --> 00:43:11,553
Yes, I can understand.

1321
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:12,554
That's understandable.

1322
00:43:12,654 --> 00:43:14,454
So it's driving me crazy.

1323
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:16,223
(You're cuter.)

1324
00:43:16,224 --> 00:43:19,093
I recognized it as soon as I heard Wonpil's lyrics.

1325
00:43:19,094 --> 00:43:20,594
That he must be a good person.

1326
00:43:21,594 --> 00:43:23,394
We've been together throughout the day.

1327
00:43:23,464 --> 00:43:25,333
- We've been on the same team.
- That's right.

1328
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:27,564
He laughs at whatever I say.

1329
00:43:28,174 --> 00:43:29,733
I thought that I should be kind like him.

1330
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:30,974
You should be kind, DinDin.

1331
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:32,574
But you're near me.

1332
00:43:33,404 --> 00:43:35,314
(Full of reaction)

1333
00:43:35,514 --> 00:43:36,843
What?

1334
00:43:36,844 --> 00:43:38,643
- What?
- What?

1335
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:41,984
(Welcome to the show)

1336
00:43:42,514 --> 00:43:44,483
(While laughing and chatting for a long time, )

1337
00:43:44,484 --> 00:43:46,553
(the bus keeps on moving.)

1338
00:43:46,554 --> 00:43:47,623
I love that song.

1339
00:43:47,624 --> 00:43:49,594
(I want to love)

1340
00:43:50,724 --> 00:43:52,063
You sound like a rocker when you sing.

1341
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:54,494
- Yes, I like rock music.
- That's great.

1342
00:43:55,164 --> 00:43:57,233
(Welcome to the base camp.)

1343
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,463
We're at the base camp.

1344
00:43:58,464 --> 00:43:59,704
What's this?

1345
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,874
This is nice.

1346
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:03,434
All right.

1347
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:04,434
(Let's take a break.)

1348
00:44:05,304 --> 00:44:06,373
Are we sleeping here tonight?

1349
00:44:06,374 --> 00:44:08,443
(Today's base camp is a school classroom.)

1350
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:09,614
It must be a school.

1351
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:10,774
This is nice.

1352
00:44:11,144 --> 00:44:12,144
It feels very cool.

1353
00:44:12,145 --> 00:44:13,213
It's nice and clean in here.

1354
00:44:13,214 --> 00:44:14,214
(The adults throw themselves on the comforter.)

1355
00:44:14,214 --> 00:44:15,214
Lie down.

1356
00:44:16,414 --> 00:44:17,754
They told us to rest.

1357
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:21,193
Put this on the floor and rest.

1358
00:44:21,194 --> 00:44:23,293
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1359
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:24,670
(DinDin takes care of DAY6 members.)

1360
00:44:24,694 --> 00:44:27,564
(Wonpil lies down next to Sae Ho.)

1361
00:44:28,694 --> 00:44:31,403
(Young K goes inside the pile of blankets.)

1362
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:33,234
(Falling right in)

1363
00:44:33,834 --> 00:44:36,503
Everyone must have been tired. They all passed out.

1364
00:44:36,504 --> 00:44:37,504
(Everyone is knocked down.)

1365
00:44:37,505 --> 00:44:38,673
It was tiring at the sea.

1366
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:39,674
He's crying.

1367
00:44:40,074 --> 00:44:41,913
- Do you miss home?
- Is Dowoon crying?

1368
00:44:41,914 --> 00:44:43,774
- Goodness.
- No, I just yawned.

1369
00:44:44,884 --> 00:44:46,043
(They can't stop yawning...)

1370
00:44:46,044 --> 00:44:48,784
(after experiencing their first real wild road variety show.)

1371
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:50,554
- Who is that?
- Who's over there?

1372
00:44:50,884 --> 00:44:51,954
Is it Young K?

1373
00:44:52,124 --> 00:44:53,224
(Nodding)

1374
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,864
Why is he sleeping over there so pathetically?

1375
00:44:57,894 --> 00:45:01,294
(Everyone is drifting off into a sweet nap.)

1376
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:03,034
Let's do some windmills.

1377
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,634
A windmill lesson? That's a good idea.

1378
00:45:05,964 --> 00:45:07,133
If you can teach us...

1379
00:45:07,134 --> 00:45:08,404
Please teach us.

1380
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:12,444
(When Jong Min was boasting about his windmill skills, )

1381
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:16,443
(Dowoon revealed his dream of doing the windmill.)

1382
00:45:16,444 --> 00:45:17,513
He wants to be a B-boy.

1383
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,643
Let's try it later.

1384
00:45:18,644 --> 00:45:19,644
- I'll show you.
- Okay.

1385
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,754
(He promised a windmill lesson.)

1386
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:23,153
Dowoon, try learning it.

1387
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:24,954
- I need to use the bathroom.
- Okay.

1388
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:27,123
- Reporter Joon.
- Yes?

1389
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,253
Follow him to the bathroom.

1390
00:45:28,254 --> 00:45:29,754
Dowoon, you can't go alone.

1391
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,564
I'll work hard.

1392
00:45:32,224 --> 00:45:33,994
Dowoon of DAY6 is...

1393
00:45:34,834 --> 00:45:36,163
going to the bathroom.

1394
00:45:36,164 --> 00:45:38,304
- I'll follow him.
- Nice.

1395
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:40,604
My goodness.

1396
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:42,903
- On 2 Days 1 Night, - This place is scary.

1397
00:45:42,904 --> 00:45:43,904
Cameras never go off.

1398
00:45:44,204 --> 00:45:46,404
It's because this is a real wild variety show.

1399
00:45:47,104 --> 00:45:49,913
I will present you the bathroom.

1400
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,783
(Joon's Camera)

1401
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:54,264
How long will you let your hair grow?

1402
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:56,183
Me?

1403
00:45:56,184 --> 00:45:59,153
I will keep growing it now that I'm at it.

1404
00:45:59,154 --> 00:46:00,284
- Really?
- Yes.

1405
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,393
He plans to let his hair grow.

1406
00:46:02,394 --> 00:46:03,854
(Joon is still reporting.)

1407
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:05,564
I'm waiting for the bathroom.

1408
00:46:06,994 --> 00:46:09,564
On 2 Days 1 Night, you can't even use the bathroom properly.

1409
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:10,764
Why not?

1410
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:12,564
During the two days,

1411
00:46:13,864 --> 00:46:16,433
we can't go anywhere.

1412
00:46:16,434 --> 00:46:17,973
(During the 2 days, we can't go anywhere.)

1413
00:46:17,974 --> 00:46:19,304
When you perform,

1414
00:46:19,704 --> 00:46:22,013
Wonpil and Young K get...

1415
00:46:22,014 --> 00:46:23,973
quite emotional, don't you?

1416
00:46:23,974 --> 00:46:25,583
Wonpil and I are...

1417
00:46:25,584 --> 00:46:27,090
- Do you cry a lot?
- the biggest crybabies.

1418
00:46:27,114 --> 00:46:29,153
I heard that Wonpil cried a lot recently.

1419
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:31,283
- Recently.
- Which song...

1420
00:46:31,284 --> 00:46:33,444
Each of you must have a song that makes you emotional.

1421
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:34,753
- "HAPPY."
- "HAPPY?"

1422
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:37,094
- "HAPPY?"
- I saw many videos of him crying.

1423
00:46:37,924 --> 00:46:40,993
(Wonpil was singing "HAPPY" during their concert.)

1424
00:46:40,994 --> 00:46:43,564
(Crying)

1425
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,834
(Crying)

1426
00:46:48,734 --> 00:46:50,073
(Wonpil cried so much that he couldn't sing.)

1427
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:52,603
When we're singing,

1428
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:54,674
we really hope to be happy.

1429
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:56,974
- When we're singing.
- That's moving.

1430
00:46:58,214 --> 00:46:59,244
It's fascinating.

1431
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:00,883
When we're on the show,

1432
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:01,953
we usually...

1433
00:47:01,954 --> 00:47:04,184
He's back from the bathroom.

1434
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:07,323
Based on the amount of time, he went to pee.

1435
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,324
(He went to pee.)

1436
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,045
- He's back from the bathroom.
- He did it.

1437
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:11,463
(Getting up)

1438
00:47:11,464 --> 00:47:13,704
(Dowoon's use of the bathroom also made Young K get up.)

1439
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,393
(Thank you for your interest.)

1440
00:47:16,394 --> 00:47:18,703
- He took 1 minute and 13 seconds.
- All right!

1441
00:47:18,704 --> 00:47:20,363
This is what 2 Days 1 Night is about.

1442
00:47:20,364 --> 00:47:22,133
- Thank you so much.
- He...

1443
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:24,073
Now that Dowoon is back, please show us, Jong Min.

1444
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,803
- Everyone is up.
- The windmill.

1445
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:27,044
Try to spin.

1446
00:47:27,474 --> 00:47:29,043
- Spin?
- Yes.

1447
00:47:29,044 --> 00:47:30,613
- How do I spin?
- Do you need more space?

1448
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:31,783
Let's back up.

1449
00:47:31,784 --> 00:47:33,444
You know the basics.

1450
00:47:33,944 --> 00:47:36,554
- What did I do?
- He just sat down.

1451
00:47:37,684 --> 00:47:38,984
He's sitting down comfortably.

1452
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:41,904
You really want to learn how to do the windmill?

1453
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:44,723
- At one of our fan meets, - You want to give it a try?

1454
00:47:44,724 --> 00:47:46,124
I did a freeze.

1455
00:47:47,124 --> 00:47:49,264
(At DAY6's fan meet for their 10th anniversary, )

1456
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:52,463
(Dowoon did a freeze.)

1457
00:47:52,464 --> 00:47:53,834
(He even surprised himself.)

1458
00:47:54,704 --> 00:47:56,433
- I thought...
- Was it well received?

1459
00:47:56,434 --> 00:47:58,344
That I should do a windmill next time.

1460
00:47:58,744 --> 00:48:00,103
- Who said...
- To improve yourself?

1461
00:48:00,104 --> 00:48:02,913
Are you trying to learn it for "My Day?"

1462
00:48:02,914 --> 00:48:03,943
That's right.

1463
00:48:03,944 --> 00:48:05,144
I'll teach you some basics.

1464
00:48:05,284 --> 00:48:07,014
- What is this?
- Raise the knee.

1465
00:48:07,244 --> 00:48:08,613
- How is it done?
- No.

1466
00:48:08,614 --> 00:48:10,313
(Dowoon has a hard time raising one leg.)

1467
00:48:10,314 --> 00:48:11,754
Put your hand down on one side.

1468
00:48:12,654 --> 00:48:14,683
- He got it.
- Put it near your abdomen.

1469
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,494
In this position, push yourself up.

1470
00:48:16,724 --> 00:48:17,724
Then you spin.

1471
00:48:18,864 --> 00:48:21,434
(Cool)

1472
00:48:22,094 --> 00:48:23,694
How did you do it? Like this?

1473
00:48:24,094 --> 00:48:26,564
(His eyes might pop out from watching the windmill.)

1474
00:48:27,234 --> 00:48:28,634
Imagine that you're doing a freeze.

1475
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:29,774
Spread your legs apart.

1476
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:32,843
- Oh, I get it now.
- You should spread your legs there.

1477
00:48:32,844 --> 00:48:34,543
- To both sides.
- Lift your right leg.

1478
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,573
I think he'll pull it off.

1479
00:48:35,574 --> 00:48:37,213
- Lift up your right leg.
- Spread your legs.

1480
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,943
- Hold on a second.
- Help him.

1481
00:48:38,944 --> 00:48:41,384
- We'll help you.
- Help him make it.

1482
00:48:41,914 --> 00:48:43,053
- Help him make it.
- Lie down again.

1483
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:44,414
Why did I say I wanted to do this?

1484
00:48:44,784 --> 00:48:46,453
- Hold out. That's good.
- Now is the time.

1485
00:48:46,454 --> 00:48:47,454
(Spreading his legs)

1486
00:48:47,455 --> 00:48:48,723
- There you go.
- Now move your hand...

1487
00:48:48,724 --> 00:48:50,670
(He finally spreads his legs with the older members' help.)

1488
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,563
(Giggling)

1489
00:48:52,564 --> 00:48:53,923
- Your elbow...
- That's good.

1490
00:48:53,924 --> 00:48:55,484
- That's good.
- Pull your shoulder in.

1491
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:57,093
- Pull your shoulder in.
- Oh, gosh.

1492
00:48:57,094 --> 00:48:58,733
Your elbow was too far out.

1493
00:48:58,734 --> 00:49:00,003
You should tuck it in toward your belly button.

1494
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:01,633
- Let me take a short break.
- Okay.

1495
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:03,073
(Let me take a short break.)

1496
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:04,503
Jong Min, show him how to do it one more time.

1497
00:49:04,504 --> 00:49:06,904
Start in this position. Then swing your shoulders like this.

1498
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:10,474
(Thudding)

1499
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:14,163
(Jong Min hit his head on the floor.)

1500
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:15,538
Jong Min, show him how to do it one more time.

1501
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:17,939
Start in this position. Then swing your shoulders like this.

1502
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:21,419
(Thudding)

1503
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:25,188
(Jong Min hit his head on the floor.)

1504
00:49:25,189 --> 00:49:26,658
I heard that thud.

1505
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:27,659
Are you okay?

1506
00:49:28,059 --> 00:49:29,059
(Dropping to the floor laughing)

1507
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,299
That must've hurt.

1508
00:49:30,629 --> 00:49:31,629
Are you okay?

1509
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,428
(Passed out as he's embarrassed)

1510
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:34,598
- Are you all right?
- That must've hurt.

1511
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:38,209
(Dowoon's camera)

1512
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,308
(Jong Min ends up being moved away.)

1513
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:43,679
Do you know where you are now?

1514
00:49:44,009 --> 00:49:46,009
This isn't "Running Man." This is 2 Days 1 Night.

1515
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,049
- Right?
- There was a noise.

1516
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,919
- Great job. Well done.
- It must've been painful.

1517
00:49:52,149 --> 00:49:53,718
- You look like a foal.
- You should relax the muscles.

1518
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:55,399
He managed to spread his legs more widely.

1519
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,518
- Is everyone here?
- Yes, we're all here.

1520
00:49:57,519 --> 00:49:59,488
It's time for the Dinner Game.

1521
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:01,799
What's for dinner today?

1522
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:03,358
Nice!

1523
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,328
(We're hungry.)

1524
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:09,168
- I'll tell you what's for dinner.
- Okay.

1525
00:50:09,169 --> 00:50:10,698
- They must've prepared a lot.
- We found out...

1526
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:12,768
that Young K could finish eight portions of beef by himself...

1527
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:14,778
- Beef?
- and six portions for pork.

1528
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:16,609
- That's how much he likes meat.
- Really?

1529
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:18,908
- I think we'll have meat.
- So for dinner, we prepared...

1530
00:50:18,909 --> 00:50:21,919
- Meat.
- a beef and pork barbecue...

1531
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,078
with meat we got from Gangwon Province.

1532
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,318
(Beef and pork barbecue with local meat)

1533
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:26,618
- They usually...
- We should have some meat.

1534
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:29,219
- I'm glad I came here.
- They usually give big portions.

1535
00:50:29,419 --> 00:50:31,428
- We'll probably get a large amount.
- They'll give us a lot of meat.

1536
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:32,928
You can look forward to it.

1537
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:33,959
We'll look forward to it.

1538
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:37,029
But not all of you will get to enjoy the food.

1539
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:40,898
Today's Dinner Game through which you can get...

1540
00:50:40,899 --> 00:50:42,815
- the beef and pork barbecue is...
- That's a shame.

1541
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,709
DAY6 Entertainment.

1542
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:46,169
What is it?

1543
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,238
DAY6 Entertainment?

1544
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:49,615
- It's been a long while.
- DAY6 Entertainment?

1545
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:51,685
- Just like "Family Entertainment."
- "Family Entertainment."

1546
00:50:51,709 --> 00:50:54,048
There will be three rounds, and it's a team match.

1547
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:55,178
(They will have a team match with 3 rounds.)

1548
00:50:55,179 --> 00:50:56,718
The 1st team to win 2 rounds...

1549
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:58,919
- will have dinner.
- Oh, gosh. Please.

1550
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:01,035
- Please. We need to win this.
- How would you like...

1551
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,358
to decide on the teams?

1552
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,758
- Shall we stick to the same team?
- We can change...

1553
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:05,358
- You can change the team members.
- Or shall we change the members?

1554
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,388
It's your choice, guys.

1555
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:07,749
Let's stick with the same members.

1556
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,775
- How were we divided earlier?
- Do you remember your team members?

1557
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:12,468
- We were on the same team. Yes.
- Are you sure?

1558
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,528
Well, we'll just...

1559
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,268
- We'll follow your decision.
- We'll do as you want.

1560
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:16,498
- What do you think, SungJin?
- Tell us what you think freely.

1561
00:51:16,499 --> 00:51:17,769
I wouldn't mind.

1562
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,139
- Okay. We'll follow their decision.
- Okay.

1563
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:22,578
- Then there will be no change.
- Okay.

1564
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,579
- Okay.
- All right.

1565
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,778
(Team Youngpil versus Team Dojin, Round 2)

1566
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:26,348
- We're confident!
- Of course.

1567
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,018
Since we hit the bottom, the only way to go is up.

1568
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:30,099
- Of course. We'll get back up.
- Now is the timing.

1569
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:34,088
Then we'll begin the game now.

1570
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:36,058
- Okay.
- Please set it up.

1571
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,088
- I really want to eat meat.
- We should have a barbecue.

1572
00:51:37,089 --> 00:51:38,158
- What is it?
- What game are we playing?

1573
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:39,888
- Is that a karaoke machine?
- I thought that was meat.

1574
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:41,335
(A karaoke machine? The mission for Round 1 will be revealed.)

1575
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:42,858
- Is it a high note singing contest?
- Is it a singing relay?

1576
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:44,728
- I think I know what game it is.
- It's not a singing relay.

1577
00:51:44,729 --> 00:51:46,268
Guessing the notes...

1578
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,245
- Something like that. Right.
- The perfect pitch game?

1579
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:49,798
- I'll explain to you right away.
- Okay.

1580
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:52,208
The first round of the Dinner Game is...

1581
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,309
Mission Karaoke.

1582
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:55,538
- I guess there's a mission.
- Mission Karaoke.

1583
00:51:55,539 --> 00:51:56,638
Do we just need to get a high score?

1584
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:58,639
There must be a mission to complete while singing.

1585
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:00,048
While singing, you have to change every syllable...

1586
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:03,248
that has "ng" in it, including the final consonants.

1587
00:52:03,249 --> 00:52:05,188
For example, into "ka."

1588
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:06,348
(The syllables with "ng" are replaced with "ka.")

1589
00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:08,709
- That's the mission? Okay.
- Change such syllables? I see.

1590
00:52:08,989 --> 00:52:10,388
- I'll give you an example.
- All right. I understand.

1591
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:11,988
The song goes, "You were pretty." Then you should sing...

1592
00:52:11,989 --> 00:52:13,289
(You were keu)

1593
00:52:14,189 --> 00:52:15,799
- You were keu.
- Keu were keu.

1594
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,999
- "Keu were keu?"
- Keu were keu

1595
00:52:18,229 --> 00:52:19,728
- Like this? Got it.
- I'm sure...

1596
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:20,729
- Whenever you see "ng."
- that Jong Min will do a bad job.

1597
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:21,868
- Do you all understand the rule?
- I...

1598
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:23,229
- Yes.
- While playing the game...

1599
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:25,138
Each team will choose a song...

1600
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:26,768
from the given list.

1601
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:27,908
The first team to finish...

1602
00:52:27,909 --> 00:52:30,208
- singing the first verse wins.
- Yes.

1603
00:52:30,209 --> 00:52:31,708
But you can sing...

1604
00:52:31,709 --> 00:52:34,109
only while the finger points at you.

1605
00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:37,448
You fail if you fail to change three times.

1606
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:38,449
(You fail if you make more than two mistakes.)

1607
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,810
- It's difficult.
- For example...

1608
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:42,459
From your second attempt, you will roll a die,

1609
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,958
which will change the conditions.

1610
00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:46,058
- My gosh.
- Okay.

1611
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:48,058
This can be a bit tricky.

1612
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:49,299
I think it'll be really tricky.

1613
00:52:49,529 --> 00:52:51,998
- I'll reveal the song list.
- The song list.

1614
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:53,168
We'll choose a song to sing.

1615
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,268
("Aloha" by Cool, "Trip To Myself" by Buzz, "Tears" by So Chan Whee, )

1616
00:52:54,269 --> 00:52:55,368
("Time of Our Life" by DAY6, "Airplane" by Turtles)

1617
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:57,238
- So this is the song list.
- Each team has to choose a song.

1618
00:52:57,239 --> 00:52:58,368
I want us to sing the song by Turtles.

1619
00:52:58,369 --> 00:52:59,908
Isn't the first song a slow song?

1620
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:01,909
- Yes, it's a slow song.
- Let's choose that song.

1621
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:03,508
- That should be the best choice.
- We all know that song.

1622
00:53:03,509 --> 00:53:05,425
The first syllable has "ng," so we have to change it.

1623
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:08,978
- Buzz's song is easier for me.
- That song is easy for me too.

1624
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:10,048
- All right. I'm in.
- So we'll sing that song, right?

1625
00:53:10,049 --> 00:53:11,688
- I think it's a good choice.
- To the end of the blue ocean

1626
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,769
- That's the song.
- Let's decide who will go first.

1627
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:15,258
- The losing team will go first.
- Go, SungJin.

1628
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:16,818
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- We'll let you go first.

1629
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:17,858
- Shall we?
- All right. Go on.

1630
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:19,389
- Wonpil and Dowoon.
- Okay.

1631
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,128
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1632
00:53:21,129 --> 00:53:23,158
(Dowoon won.)

1633
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:24,228
- We'll go last.
- I lost.

1634
00:53:24,229 --> 00:53:25,428
- Will you go first?
- I lost.

1635
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:26,445
- We'll go last.
- We'll go last.

1636
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,798
- We need to see how they do.
- Right, we need to see it.

1637
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:29,869
Let's see how they do it.

1638
00:53:29,939 --> 00:53:33,038
The first mission word is "ppu."

1639
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:34,938
We should change every syllable with "ng" to "ppu."

1640
00:53:34,939 --> 00:53:36,778
- "Ng" to "ppu."
- "Ng" to "ppu."

1641
00:53:36,779 --> 00:53:38,179
(They should change "ng" to "ppu.")

1642
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:40,148
"Ppu To Myself."

1643
00:53:40,149 --> 00:53:41,678
- I'm not sure if I can do this.
- You've got this.

1644
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:42,679
I should do my best.

1645
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,848
Point the finger accurately and say the name of the person to sing.

1646
00:53:44,849 --> 00:53:45,849
Do we start from this side?

1647
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:47,048
- Where?
- We'll start with him.

1648
00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:48,769
- Seon Ho?
- Yes. We'll start with Seon Ho.

1649
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:53,659
(The intro makes them dance.)

1650
00:53:56,329 --> 00:53:58,729
(They're like a rock band.)

1651
00:54:00,499 --> 00:54:03,768
(If I ride a horse to the end of the blue ocean)

1652
00:54:03,769 --> 00:54:04,769
That's good.

1653
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:07,038
(If I ride a horse to the end of the blue ocean)

1654
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:08,438
(The stars in the sky look like grains of salt)

1655
00:54:08,439 --> 00:54:09,538
Young K.

1656
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:10,778
(Caution)

1657
00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:15,448
(The path only for camels in the desert, countless love)

1658
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:18,148
(The path only for camels in the desert, countless love)

1659
00:54:18,149 --> 00:54:22,189
(Will become a road for me and open the door)

1660
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,119
(He's doing so well.)

1661
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,188
He's good at this.

1662
00:54:25,189 --> 00:54:26,658
(An old harmonica, the guitar I'm used to playing)

1663
00:54:26,659 --> 00:54:28,259
(Caution, Warning)

1664
00:54:28,729 --> 00:54:30,428
- It's difficult, right?
- Hey.

1665
00:54:30,429 --> 00:54:32,098
- Young K is so good at this game.
- You were amazing.

1666
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:33,428
(Team Youngpil failed.)

1667
00:54:33,429 --> 00:54:35,769
- It's difficult.
- I didn't get to sing at all.

1668
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:37,368
That's because the member before you got it all wrong.

1669
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:38,838
(Ppu)

1670
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:40,038
Young K, you're so good at this.

1671
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:41,408
- He did a really good job.
- It's really tricky, right?

1672
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:43,038
- It's so tricky.
- I forgot to change the lyrics.

1673
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:44,138
- At the end, yes.
- Yes.

1674
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:45,225
- You got confused, right?
- It's not easy.

1675
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:46,508
- Next team.
- We can pull this off.

1676
00:54:46,509 --> 00:54:47,878
- It's really difficult.
- It's so confusing.

1677
00:54:47,879 --> 00:54:49,425
- Please come.
- I think you should go last.

1678
00:54:49,449 --> 00:54:51,548
- Watch how we do and learn.
- Okay.

1679
00:54:51,549 --> 00:54:52,918
- It's not easy.
- You go last.

1680
00:54:52,919 --> 00:54:55,119
I could bet everything I have on one thing.

1681
00:54:55,189 --> 00:54:57,109
Jong Min will fail as soon as he starts singing.

1682
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:00,628
(You wait and see.)

1683
00:55:00,629 --> 00:55:02,758
The first mission word for you is also "ppu."

1684
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:04,969
- Got it.
- Play the music.

1685
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:07,868
Start with "ppu." Right, Joon?

1686
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:09,768
- Change "ng" to "ppu."
- "Ppuloha."

1687
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:11,199
- Change "ng" to "ppu."
- Yes.

1688
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,509
- Keep your eyes on the pointer.
- "Ppuloha."

1689
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:15,178
The syllables with "ng," right?

1690
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:20,008
(A candle under the dim light)

1691
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:21,048
That's good.

1692
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:25,688
(A promise in a glass of wine)

1693
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:31,458
(I will always keep you safe right by your side)

1694
00:55:31,459 --> 00:55:32,558
(You believed in me)

1695
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,898
(Caution)

1696
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:36,028
Wrong. Dowoon.

1697
00:55:36,029 --> 00:55:38,998
(I have only one wish)

1698
00:55:38,999 --> 00:55:40,168
(Laughing)

1699
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:41,968
(I dream of everlasting happiness)

1700
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:42,998
(Warning)

1701
00:55:42,999 --> 00:55:44,768
- We should hold out.
- It's difficult.

1702
00:55:44,769 --> 00:55:47,238
(Although it's not fancy or dreamy)

1703
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:48,278
- Okay.
- Okay.

1704
00:55:48,279 --> 00:55:50,008
- You failed.
- You failed.

1705
00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:52,549
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

1706
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,578
- Wait. Did we...
- I was counting on you.

1707
00:55:54,579 --> 00:55:55,678
We made three mistakes?

1708
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:57,448
- Yes, you did.
- This is nice.

1709
00:55:57,449 --> 00:55:59,048
- He made a mistake once.
- Oh, Joon made a mistake?

1710
00:55:59,049 --> 00:56:01,330
- You chose a better song.
- I don't think I can do this.

1711
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:02,918
- This is so difficult.
- This isn't easy.

1712
00:56:02,919 --> 00:56:04,188
- To be honest...
- Who made a mistake?

1713
00:56:04,189 --> 00:56:05,928
- It's really difficult.
- This is your second attempt.

1714
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,558
Roll the die.

1715
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:09,398
- We... Roll the die?
- Yes.

1716
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,028
- Okay. Young K.
- Yes?

1717
00:56:11,029 --> 00:56:13,298
Have a look at the sides of the die before rolling it.

1718
00:56:13,299 --> 00:56:14,598
Oh, "ppu" is replaced with "kkyu."

1719
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:15,759
There are "ppu" and "kkyu..."

1720
00:56:16,099 --> 00:56:17,838
We can also change the positions.

1721
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:18,908
It's better not to change the positions.

1722
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:20,908
- "Ppu" would be better. Yes.
- "Ppu" would be better?

1723
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:23,015
- "Kkyu" or "tta" would be okay.
- "Tta" would be okay.

1724
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,025
- They're all the same.
- Is there a rule for rolling it?

1725
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,008
- You can just throw it...
- Throw it this high.

1726
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,378
- I think...
- Over your head.

1727
00:56:28,379 --> 00:56:30,318
- Over my head?
- I think changing the positions...

1728
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,289
(We appreciate your creativity.)

1729
00:56:33,649 --> 00:56:35,218
- He's doing his best.
- He's a good entertainer.

1730
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:36,219
What's this?

1731
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,460
They're changing their mission.

1732
00:56:38,129 --> 00:56:39,258
No!

1733
00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:41,205
Don't be disappointed. It could be rather good for us.

1734
00:56:41,229 --> 00:56:42,335
They'll have to change the song.

1735
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:44,959
- They can't sing the same song.
- They should pick another song.

1736
00:56:45,229 --> 00:56:46,898
- Then...
- Let's sing "Time of Our Life."

1737
00:56:46,899 --> 00:56:48,298
Let's sing "Time of Our Life."

1738
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:50,838
- Do you think I can do this?
- In the beginning...

1739
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:52,368
The tempo is really fast at the beginning of the song.

1740
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:53,638
- They chose a difficult song.
- That's a difficult song.

1741
00:56:53,639 --> 00:56:55,338
I want to hear Young K sing it even if he fails.

1742
00:56:55,339 --> 00:56:56,509
- Right.
- Yes.

1743
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:57,708
Let's do this.

1744
00:56:57,709 --> 00:56:59,048
(Let's give it a try.)

1745
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:00,079
It's such a fast song.

1746
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:01,619
It's exciting. Whatever.

1747
00:57:01,979 --> 00:57:03,649
- Just do it!
- Yes.

1748
00:57:05,049 --> 00:57:08,018
(Let's make our youth a meaningful chapter in life.)

1749
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:09,958
- Ppu, ppu - Ppu, ppu

1750
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,399
- One, two, three, four!
- Let's go!

1751
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:13,228
(It's as if they are at a festival.)

1752
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:14,429
Come on. It's exciting.

1753
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:15,898
Come on.

1754
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:16,899
Just sing it properly.

1755
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:19,399
Say, "ppu!"

1756
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:23,538
(I'll be honest, I've been waiting for so long)

1757
00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:24,598
(Caution)

1758
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:26,008
(I'm sure you've waited too)

1759
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,009
(Warning)

1760
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,478
(I checked the calendar every day, waiting for this day)

1761
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:29,738
(Laughing)

1762
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:31,139
This is all so wrong.

1763
00:57:32,809 --> 00:57:33,809
We can sing together.

1764
00:57:34,479 --> 00:57:36,518
- This was difficult.
- I'm sorry.

1765
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,519
He was so bad at this.

1766
00:57:38,949 --> 00:57:40,348
- What were you doing?
- I'm so sorry.

1767
00:57:40,349 --> 00:57:41,518
Which part did I get wrong?

1768
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:44,418
- You got everything wrong.
- Everything was just wrong.

1769
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,529
Why are there so many ngs in the song?

1770
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:47,958
I know.

1771
00:57:47,959 --> 00:57:49,259
Who wrote the song?

1772
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,539
- Who wrote the lyrics?
- Who wrote this song?

1773
00:57:52,029 --> 00:57:54,268
- Who wrote the song?
- This isn't easy.

1774
00:57:54,269 --> 00:57:56,509
I was so happy because I thought I got everything right.

1775
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:58,708
- Hold on a second. It's heavy.
- Let's go.

1776
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:00,208
- Throw it above your head.
- You can do this.

1777
00:58:00,209 --> 00:58:02,008
- This is very heavy.
- Let's change the song.

1778
00:58:02,009 --> 00:58:03,039
Let's change the song.

1779
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:04,739
(Kicking)

1780
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:07,108
(Jong Min is born to be a cheater.)

1781
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,648
- Okay, we can change the song.
- We are changing the song.

1782
00:58:08,649 --> 00:58:09,978
(Changing songs)

1783
00:58:09,979 --> 00:58:11,219
There's no choice.

1784
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:14,719
- You kicked the die yourself.
- You kicked it.

1785
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,489
- I'm sorry.
- You cheated.

1786
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:19,158
- Which song do you want?
- Who wants to sing?

1787
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:20,458
- Let's go for Turtles.
- Honestly...

1788
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,228
- The Turtles song...
- We only have two songs.

1789
00:58:22,229 --> 00:58:23,229
- You will go for Turtles?
- Okay.

1790
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:25,369
- Okay, let's go for it.
- Let's get it.

1791
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:26,728
Ppu ppu?

1792
00:58:26,729 --> 00:58:29,769
("Airplane" by Turtles)

1793
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:32,608
(Get ready to get on the plane.)

1794
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:33,808
- Let's go.
- It's all about how you think.

1795
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:34,878
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1796
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:38,578
(In my childhood's memories, )

1797
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:41,209
(I'm on the airplane)

1798
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:46,588
(I'll be flying in the blue sky)

1799
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:50,018
(It's what I've dreamed of)

1800
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:51,488
(I can't say anything while waiting for this)

1801
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:53,328
(Caution, Warning)

1802
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,488
(Fail)

1803
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,658
Wrong! Fail.

1804
00:58:55,659 --> 00:58:56,659
This doesn't work.

1805
00:58:57,399 --> 00:58:58,769
We can't do this.

1806
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:01,289
- Gosh, I can't do this.
- When are we going to sing?

1807
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:03,538
My brain isn't working anymore.

1808
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:04,699
I want to sing.

1809
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:06,138
Gosh, this is so difficult.

1810
00:59:06,139 --> 00:59:08,338
(Is this even right?)

1811
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:09,638
This will never work.

1812
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:11,948
- You got it when you tried it?
- It'll never work.

1813
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,989
Is there anyone who got it right while trying this?

1814
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:17,848
(We did it.)

1815
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:19,388
We did simulations...

1816
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,188
on the songs you picked.

1817
00:59:21,189 --> 00:59:22,789
And these are the most difficult ones...

1818
00:59:23,319 --> 00:59:24,489
You have easier songs then.

1819
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:25,758
- We should change the song.
- We have to do this.

1820
00:59:25,759 --> 00:59:26,799
Should we change the song?

1821
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:29,329
Maybe it would be better if we changed the song.

1822
00:59:30,259 --> 00:59:31,328
- Changing the letter?
- This should be okay.

1823
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:32,329
This one is better.

1824
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,428
- But I'm used to "ppu."
- It should've rolled a bit more.

1825
00:59:34,429 --> 00:59:36,038
- It's "kkyu."
- "Kkyu."

1826
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,338
(Let's not get confused.)

1827
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:38,339
"Kkyu."

1828
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:41,839
- "Kkyu."
- "Kkyu."

1829
00:59:42,609 --> 00:59:43,609
Let's go!

1830
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,878
(I'll be honest, I've been waiting for so long)

1831
00:59:45,879 --> 00:59:48,418
(I'm sure you've waited too)

1832
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:50,348
(I checked the calendar every day)

1833
00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:52,518
(Waiting for this day)

1834
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:53,849
- Goodness, great.
- Young K.

1835
00:59:54,149 --> 00:59:57,688
(Honestly, this moment to me)

1836
00:59:57,689 --> 00:59:59,858
(It's like a dream being here with you)

1837
00:59:59,859 --> 01:00:03,028
(I've worked and prepared a lot)

1838
01:00:03,029 --> 01:00:04,428
(Just for today)

1839
01:00:04,429 --> 01:00:05,429
(Caution)

1840
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:09,838
(All about you and I, Let's leave everything behind)

1841
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:10,939
This is crazy.

1842
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:15,739
(That was great.)

1843
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,978
It's Wonpil's turn.

1844
01:00:17,979 --> 01:00:19,908
(It's Wonpil's turn again.)

1845
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:21,278
(A piece of beautiful youth)

1846
01:00:21,279 --> 01:00:24,548
(Warning)

1847
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:25,549
You failed!

1848
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,319
- That went well, but...
- He can't sing this. How can we?

1849
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:31,019
The original singer can't even sing the song.

1850
01:00:32,189 --> 01:00:34,529
(My goodness)

1851
01:00:34,729 --> 01:00:36,499
- I was about to...
- How do we...

1852
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:38,869
Kkyu

1853
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:40,698
- That's actually better.
- Okay.

1854
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:41,738
How many times...

1855
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:45,068
We can never sing "Airplane."

1856
01:00:45,069 --> 01:00:46,708
- I know.
- "Airplane" will never work.

1857
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:47,938
(He's not sure if he can sing.)

1858
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:49,608
Let's just sing all we want.

1859
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:50,708
Yes, let's do that.

1860
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:52,655
- We have to throw this now.
- Let's please change the song.

1861
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:54,048
We must change the song.

1862
01:00:54,049 --> 01:00:55,355
- Change the song?
- Kick the dice.

1863
01:00:55,379 --> 01:00:57,319
It's fine as long as you memorize your part.

1864
01:00:57,519 --> 01:00:58,549
Kick the die.

1865
01:00:59,419 --> 01:01:02,418
(They get to change the song.)

1866
01:01:02,419 --> 01:01:03,489
We got this.

1867
01:01:03,689 --> 01:01:04,859
"Aloha."

1868
01:01:06,259 --> 01:01:07,259
- "Aloha."
- How about "Tears?"

1869
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,528
- "Tears?"
- You want to go for "Tears?"

1870
01:01:09,529 --> 01:01:11,198
- A new song.
- Will you be okay?

1871
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:12,428
I think "Tears" is better.

1872
01:01:12,429 --> 01:01:13,568
- "Tears."
- Just go for it.

1873
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:14,649
Okay, we'll go for "Tears."

1874
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,169
(Team Dojin changed their song to "Tears.")

1875
01:01:18,369 --> 01:01:20,009
It's okay if we practice, right?

1876
01:01:20,269 --> 01:01:21,269
Sure.

1877
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:25,149
(Practicing their parts)

1878
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:28,008
Precisely look at the lyrics.

1879
01:01:28,009 --> 01:01:29,148
- Just look at the lyrics.
- Okay.

1880
01:01:29,149 --> 01:01:30,455
We don't need to hit the right tone.

1881
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:31,848
- Just the lyrics.
- Look at the lyrics.

1882
01:01:31,849 --> 01:01:33,518
- What do I replace it with?
- Just the numbers...

1883
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:34,548
Skip the intro...

1884
01:01:34,549 --> 01:01:36,158
(Team Youngpil is doing its best to memorize the lyrics.)

1885
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,488
- Just look at the numbers.
- It's "Ppu" this time, right?

1886
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:38,889
- Just the numbers.
- "Ppu," right?

1887
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:40,129
Yes, it's "ppu."

1888
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:43,029
(The letter is "ppu.")

1889
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,429
We can dance, right?

1890
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:48,838
- It's okay to dance.
- Of course.

1891
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:49,938
You can dance by yourself.

1892
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:50,969
Sure, we are young.

1893
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,569
(Getting excited)

1894
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:57,878
- Oh, no.
- All right.

1895
01:01:57,879 --> 01:01:59,319
(I'm taking over the stage tonight.)

1896
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,978
That's great.

1897
01:02:01,979 --> 01:02:03,419
(Let's see your dance skills.)

1898
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:06,419
What kind of dance is that?

1899
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:09,488
Sae Ho's dance time.

1900
01:02:09,489 --> 01:02:10,519
Let's go!

1901
01:02:10,759 --> 01:02:12,029
(Everyone, let's dance!)

1902
01:02:12,959 --> 01:02:15,598
Go, Sae Ho.

1903
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,298
(The best dancer)

1904
01:02:17,299 --> 01:02:19,028
This stage is taken by Sae Ho.

1905
01:02:19,029 --> 01:02:20,828
Sae Ho is the best dancer.

1906
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:22,638
- Let's get it.
- Let's go.

1907
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:23,669
(Team Dojin, get ready.)

1908
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:25,809
Let's go!

1909
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:29,338
(Nothing has happened to me)

1910
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:32,908
(We didn't know anything from the start)

1911
01:02:32,909 --> 01:02:37,278
(Can't you just let go of me)

1912
01:02:37,279 --> 01:02:38,788
- Next.
- That's nice.

1913
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:39,848
(It feels great this time.)

1914
01:02:39,849 --> 01:02:43,358
(You should forget about me now)

1915
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,158
(I know it's not easy)

1916
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:48,558
(You are just waiting for me)

1917
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,958
(It breaks my heart to look at you like that)

1918
01:02:50,959 --> 01:02:52,328
(Caution, Warning)

1919
01:02:52,329 --> 01:02:53,399
SungJin.

1920
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:58,709
(Just hate me instead)

1921
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:00,609
Let's go! You're doing great.

1922
01:03:00,769 --> 01:03:05,478
(Stop showing me regrets)

1923
01:03:05,479 --> 01:03:07,009
- There you go.
- But it is too high.

1924
01:03:07,779 --> 01:03:12,488
(Don't you look for me ever again)

1925
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:14,748
- That's great.
- I can see that we're getting it.

1926
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,188
(Through me)

1927
01:03:16,189 --> 01:03:19,428
(You will get hurt)

1928
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:20,758
Let's go, Se Yoon.

1929
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:24,398
(Don't call me)

1930
01:03:24,399 --> 01:03:28,128
(A cruel woman)

1931
01:03:28,129 --> 01:03:31,068
(I chose separation)

1932
01:03:31,069 --> 01:03:33,808
(Just for you)

1933
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:34,809
Jong Min!

1934
01:03:35,009 --> 01:03:36,739
(Finally, it's Jong Min's turn.)

1935
01:03:38,209 --> 01:03:41,549
(They will pass only if he gets everything correctly.)

1936
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:44,248
(Don't forget)

1937
01:03:44,249 --> 01:03:46,318
(My love)

1938
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:50,758
(You are still inside me)

1939
01:03:50,759 --> 01:03:53,228
- That's Jong Min.
- I had faith in you, Thank you.

1940
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,629
- Jong Min.
- I'm relieved now.

1941
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:57,898
Jong Min, come on.

1942
01:03:57,899 --> 01:04:00,229
He ruined everything when we all sang correctly.

1943
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,528
I'm so relieved.

1944
01:04:01,529 --> 01:04:03,398
- This is too much.
- What was that?

1945
01:04:03,399 --> 01:04:04,568
What is this?

1946
01:04:04,569 --> 01:04:05,938
What do you think you are doing?

1947
01:04:05,939 --> 01:04:09,279
(Everyone, please get out. I'd like a minute to myself.)

1948
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:10,959
Jong Min couldn't get anything right.

1949
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,848
He couldn't do anything.

1950
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:15,048
(I wanted to do well.)

1951
01:04:15,049 --> 01:04:16,118
My goodness.

1952
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:17,579
(Jong Min, it's okay.)

1953
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:20,448
(Dowoon is the only one who's on Jong Min's side.)

1954
01:04:20,449 --> 01:04:22,058
"Tears" is easier than I thought.

1955
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:23,788
- I know.
- It's easier than it sounds.

1956
01:04:23,789 --> 01:04:25,688
- Wonpil, throw the die.
- Again?

1957
01:04:25,689 --> 01:04:27,559
I don't want to change the song.

1958
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:28,928
We can't change the song now.

1959
01:04:28,929 --> 01:04:30,199
(Not our turns either)

1960
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:33,629
Is this how you play...

1961
01:04:33,929 --> 01:04:35,128
We are changing the song again?

1962
01:04:35,129 --> 01:04:36,539
(Again)

1963
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:38,338
I just memorized the song.

1964
01:04:38,339 --> 01:04:39,339
(He just memorized the song to replace the given words.)

1965
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:40,809
I just memorized the song!

1966
01:04:41,069 --> 01:04:42,579
You can't help it.

1967
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,279
I'm sorry.

1968
01:04:44,379 --> 01:04:45,619
- It's all right.
- No problem.

1969
01:04:45,779 --> 01:04:47,349
Shall we go for Buzz?

1970
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:48,648
- Shall we?
- Sure.

1971
01:04:48,649 --> 01:04:49,649
Let's go for Buzz.

1972
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:51,048
- "Trip To Myself" by Buzz.
- Okay.

1973
01:04:51,049 --> 01:04:52,448
Seon Ho, focus now. Let's go.

1974
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:53,865
(They changed the song to "Trip To Myself" by Buzz.)

1975
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,419
- Our letter is "kkyu."
- Let's go.

1976
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:57,488
Don't try to sing well.

1977
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:58,529
Just get the lyrics right.

1978
01:04:58,789 --> 01:04:59,789
Let's go!

1979
01:05:01,129 --> 01:05:02,528
Please dance for us.

1980
01:05:02,529 --> 01:05:03,875
(Trying to get the crowd to cheer for them)

1981
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:05,398
He wants us to dance for him.

1982
01:05:05,399 --> 01:05:06,799
How do we dance to this song?

1983
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:08,598
- You want us to dance?
- Yes.

1984
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:09,899
One, two, three, four.

1985
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:12,309
(Dancing Sae Ho's moves)

1986
01:05:12,709 --> 01:05:13,839
(Good.)

1987
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:15,709
(Shaking)

1988
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:16,709
Sae Ho's dance.

1989
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:18,278
(Everyone is dancing Sae Ho's dance.)

1990
01:05:18,279 --> 01:05:19,519
- This is difficult.
- Seon Ho.

1991
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:26,918
(If I ride a horse to the end of the blue ocean)

1992
01:05:26,919 --> 01:05:27,919
It's great.

1993
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,558
(The stars in the sky look like grains of salt)

1994
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:30,619
Young K.

1995
01:05:30,919 --> 01:05:32,358
(The path only for camels in the desert)

1996
01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:33,388
He's good.

1997
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:34,828
(The path only for camels in the desert)

1998
01:05:34,829 --> 01:05:35,898
Great.

1999
01:05:35,899 --> 01:05:38,398
(Countless love)

2000
01:05:38,399 --> 01:05:41,628
(Will become a road for me and open the door)

2001
01:05:41,629 --> 01:05:42,699
Wonpil.

2002
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,438
(He hasn't missed any of the lyrics so far.)

2003
01:05:45,439 --> 01:05:47,538
(An old harmonica, the guitar I'm used to playing)

2004
01:05:47,539 --> 01:05:48,638
(Caution)

2005
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:50,808
(Your melody, I'll be going)

2006
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:55,318
(Little Prince, your melody)

2007
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:56,918
(I want to set out to find)

2008
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:57,919
Let's go!

2009
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,289
- One, two, three, four.
- Go.

2010
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:03,918
(Caution)

2011
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:08,798
(I'll have better memories than love)

2012
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:09,799
Sae Ho!

2013
01:06:10,359 --> 01:06:12,828
(Taking a sip from the tumbler)

2014
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:14,729
(To forget about you)

2015
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:19,715
(They're only left with the last verse.)

2016
01:06:19,799 --> 01:06:21,661
(I'll have better memories than love)

2017
01:06:21,662 --> 01:06:24,231
(I'll get to know something better than love)

2018
01:06:24,232 --> 01:06:25,232
Sae Ho!

2019
01:06:25,832 --> 01:06:28,161
(Taking a sip from the tumbler)

2020
01:06:28,162 --> 01:06:30,172
(To forget about you)

2021
01:06:31,302 --> 01:06:35,172
(They're only left with the last verse.)

2022
01:06:36,142 --> 01:06:38,781
(Taking a sip from the tumbler)

2023
01:06:38,782 --> 01:06:40,811
(To forget about you)

2024
01:06:40,812 --> 01:06:46,552
(Now I'm going to love myself more)

2025
01:06:47,282 --> 01:06:49,422
(Team Youngpil succeeded.)

2026
01:06:50,752 --> 01:06:53,361
- Let's go!
- We did it!

2027
01:06:53,362 --> 01:06:55,632
(You all did so well.)

2028
01:06:56,062 --> 01:06:58,302
(Let's have meat.)

2029
01:06:59,202 --> 01:07:02,232
(If you had succeeded earlier...)

2030
01:07:03,472 --> 01:07:06,241
(He's the sinner.)

2031
01:07:06,242 --> 01:07:08,242
Thank you, Jong Min!

2032
01:07:08,972 --> 01:07:10,942
Thank you, Jong Min!

2033
01:07:11,542 --> 01:07:14,242
So, as a result of Round One, Mission Karaoke,

2034
01:07:14,912 --> 01:07:16,482
Team Youngpil won.

2035
01:07:17,152 --> 01:07:18,821
- Nice!
- We don't lose.

2036
01:07:18,822 --> 01:07:19,981
I thought it would never end.

2037
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:21,322
We don't lose.

2038
01:07:21,952 --> 01:07:23,691
We should have won this.

2039
01:07:23,692 --> 01:07:24,721
(He's disappointed.)

2040
01:07:24,722 --> 01:07:25,961
Okay. You have to win 2 out of 3 times.

2041
01:07:25,962 --> 01:07:27,761
(Let's win the 2nd round.)

2042
01:07:27,762 --> 01:07:29,131
The second round...

2043
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:30,961
is Dance Speed Quiz.

2044
01:07:30,962 --> 01:07:32,361
Dance Speed Quiz?

2045
01:07:32,362 --> 01:07:33,762
- Okay. I get what it is.
- Yes.

2046
01:07:34,062 --> 01:07:35,871
The team members will copy the dance in the video...

2047
01:07:35,872 --> 01:07:38,131
one after the other in a relay format...

2048
01:07:38,132 --> 01:07:39,971
and present the question.

2049
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:43,412
The rest of the members will guess the name of the artist and the song.

2050
01:07:44,512 --> 01:07:45,882
That's going to be hard.

2051
01:07:46,882 --> 01:07:48,181
The team that answers 12 questions right...

2052
01:07:48,182 --> 01:07:49,311
- Twelve questions?
- will win.

2053
01:07:49,312 --> 01:07:50,681
(The team that answers 12 questions within a shorter duration wins.)

2054
01:07:50,682 --> 01:07:52,852
You can pass the question twice.

2055
01:07:53,252 --> 01:07:54,851
Seon Ho and DinDin are on the other team.

2056
01:07:54,852 --> 01:07:56,691
They know idol songs well.

2057
01:07:56,692 --> 01:07:58,221
- That's right.
- Really?

2058
01:07:58,222 --> 01:07:59,291
He knows many songs.

2059
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:01,022
- I'm horrible.
- What's this?

2060
01:08:01,222 --> 01:08:02,702
- What's this?
- We'll try to answer.

2061
01:08:03,092 --> 01:08:04,172
- "S-Class."
- You know it.

2062
01:08:05,432 --> 01:08:06,532
- Don't you know?
- I know.

2063
01:08:06,632 --> 01:08:08,301
- We'll set up the area.
- I'm just bad at dancing.

2064
01:08:08,302 --> 01:08:10,301
- Let's start setting up.
- Okay.

2065
01:08:10,302 --> 01:08:11,641
- You have to go in a relay.
- We shouldn't speak.

2066
01:08:11,642 --> 01:08:14,302
- Just dance.
- I'm not so good.

2067
01:08:14,572 --> 01:08:16,711
- You might know idol songs.
- Right.

2068
01:08:16,712 --> 01:08:19,032
There would be key dance moves in JYP Entertainment songs.

2069
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:20,281
What's this?

2070
01:08:20,282 --> 01:08:21,411
(Guess this.)

2071
01:08:21,412 --> 01:08:23,512
(Pull it)

2072
01:08:24,482 --> 01:08:26,121
- Right?
- Yes.

2073
01:08:26,122 --> 01:08:27,552
A JYP song will be included.

2074
01:08:27,952 --> 01:08:31,692
Or should we just practice the Whitney Houston song?

2075
01:08:32,622 --> 01:08:33,691
That could be better.

2076
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:35,832
(The leader of DAY6 tends to give up easily.)

2077
01:08:36,062 --> 01:08:37,261
Do we go first?

2078
01:08:37,262 --> 01:08:39,862
You can go since you're sitting down. You're on a winning streak.

2079
01:08:39,962 --> 01:08:41,561
You have to copy the entire video.

2080
01:08:41,562 --> 01:08:43,801
You shouldn't just skip to the chorus because you know it.

2081
01:08:43,802 --> 01:08:44,901
- Okay.
- Okay.

2082
01:08:44,902 --> 01:08:47,302
We can't do it since we don't know it anyway.

2083
01:08:47,772 --> 01:08:49,841
- We can't do it in advance.
- Let's go, Youngpil!

2084
01:08:49,842 --> 01:08:50,942
- Everyone.
- Let's go!

2085
01:08:51,442 --> 01:08:53,312
You have to do your best now.

2086
01:08:53,382 --> 01:08:56,081
We prepared ramyeon today.

2087
01:08:56,082 --> 01:08:58,521
We'll give you lots of ramyeon and rice.

2088
01:08:58,522 --> 01:08:59,922
- Gosh!
- Thank you!

2089
01:09:00,282 --> 01:09:01,582
Will you give us eggs?

2090
01:09:02,352 --> 01:09:04,892
You don't need to be thankful. If we win,

2091
01:09:05,322 --> 01:09:06,522
you won't get to eat.

2092
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:08,322
It's not for everyone?

2093
01:09:08,762 --> 01:09:09,991
Right. It's just for the team that wins.

2094
01:09:09,992 --> 01:09:11,491
- All right.
- Just for the team that wins.

2095
01:09:11,492 --> 01:09:12,632
(2 Days 1 Night isn't easy.)

2096
01:09:13,332 --> 01:09:14,332
I'm hungry.

2097
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:15,872
(We're in trouble.)

2098
01:09:16,072 --> 01:09:17,702
Let's start. Ready,

2099
01:09:17,872 --> 01:09:20,042
start!

2100
01:09:20,242 --> 01:09:22,512
(The video plays.)

2101
01:09:22,812 --> 01:09:23,872
Does he know it?

2102
01:09:23,942 --> 01:09:25,282
Nice.

2103
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:28,752
(He quickly learns the choreography.)

2104
01:09:29,452 --> 01:09:32,722
(Flexible and sensual moves)

2105
01:09:33,482 --> 01:09:35,292
"Alcohol-Free" by TWICE.

2106
01:09:35,622 --> 01:09:36,622
Correct!

2107
01:09:37,452 --> 01:09:38,491
(How did he answer that?)

2108
01:09:38,492 --> 01:09:39,561
- He's really good.
- Go!

2109
01:09:39,562 --> 01:09:41,391
(That was the question?)

2110
01:09:41,392 --> 01:09:43,162
- You're amazing.
- Seriously.

2111
01:09:43,192 --> 01:09:44,291
You're the best.

2112
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:45,572
(Seon Ho's young and sharp eyes)

2113
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:51,502
(He neatly danced the key moves.)

2114
01:09:52,242 --> 01:09:54,402
(Wonpil is the second player.)

2115
01:09:55,572 --> 01:09:56,742
Just copy it.

2116
01:09:57,312 --> 01:09:58,312
What is it?

2117
01:09:59,082 --> 01:10:01,212
It's done. Wonpil!

2118
01:10:02,182 --> 01:10:05,281
(His moves are cute.)

2119
01:10:05,282 --> 01:10:06,781
- Isn't this a KOYOTE song?
- What is it?

2120
01:10:06,782 --> 01:10:07,982
"Meeting" by KOYOTE!

2121
01:10:08,622 --> 01:10:09,622
- Well done.
- Good.

2122
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:11,591
- This move.
- Right.

2123
01:10:11,592 --> 01:10:13,362
(It's a familiar move.)

2124
01:10:14,022 --> 01:10:16,262
(He just repeats the swaying dance with no other moves.)

2125
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:18,361
- What is this?
- "Don't Leave Me," Park Jin Young.

2126
01:10:18,362 --> 01:10:19,561
What was the title of this song?

2127
01:10:19,562 --> 01:10:21,242
(The dancer also doesn't know the answer.)

2128
01:10:21,502 --> 01:10:23,302
("Poison" by Uhm Jung Hwa)

2129
01:10:23,332 --> 01:10:28,471
(With Jong Min during his V-man days.)

2130
01:10:28,472 --> 01:10:29,671
- Pass it.
- "Don't Leave Me..."

2131
01:10:29,672 --> 01:10:30,672
by Park Jin Young.

2132
01:10:30,673 --> 01:10:32,111
- No don't do it.
- Don't pass it.

2133
01:10:32,112 --> 01:10:33,182
Go on.

2134
01:10:33,912 --> 01:10:36,012
- No.
- This is easy.

2135
01:10:36,582 --> 01:10:38,452
- It would be a waste.
- Keep dancing.

2136
01:10:38,622 --> 01:10:40,121
- Wonpil!
- It would be a waste.

2137
01:10:40,122 --> 01:10:41,682
Think of your days as a trainee!

2138
01:10:41,892 --> 01:10:43,921
(My trainee days?)

2139
01:10:43,922 --> 01:10:45,692
You were in a dance group!

2140
01:10:45,762 --> 01:10:46,792
Really?

2141
01:10:47,192 --> 01:10:49,692
(He dances harder while thinking of those days.)

2142
01:10:50,362 --> 01:10:52,262
(What is this dance?)

2143
01:10:53,002 --> 01:10:54,102
Uhm Jung Hwa!

2144
01:10:54,532 --> 01:10:55,602
Uhm Jung Hwa!

2145
01:10:56,102 --> 01:10:57,272
Uhm Jung Hwa! This one.

2146
01:10:57,902 --> 01:10:59,241
V-man! "Tell Me." No.

2147
01:10:59,242 --> 01:11:00,301
"Invitation." "Poison."

2148
01:11:00,302 --> 01:11:02,472
- "Poison!"
- Correct.

2149
01:11:02,642 --> 01:11:04,411
(That was awesome.)

2150
01:11:04,412 --> 01:11:06,012
- It's crazy.
- Nice.

2151
01:11:07,942 --> 01:11:09,782
- Warning!
- You get a warning.

2152
01:11:10,652 --> 01:11:12,822
(They quickly answered two questions.)

2153
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:14,821
(Smiling)

2154
01:11:14,822 --> 01:11:16,491
What is he doing?

2155
01:11:16,492 --> 01:11:18,092
- Right.
- That's scary.

2156
01:11:18,562 --> 01:11:19,961
- IVE.
- IVE.

2157
01:11:19,962 --> 01:11:21,421
- "LOVE DIVE."
- "LOVE DIVE."

2158
01:11:21,422 --> 01:11:22,991
- Correct!
- Okay!

2159
01:11:22,992 --> 01:11:24,162
We're so good.

2160
01:11:25,332 --> 01:11:29,532
(It's the key move that's hard to miss.)

2161
01:11:30,902 --> 01:11:31,942
"Drunken."

2162
01:11:32,072 --> 01:11:34,942
(Twisting)

2163
01:11:36,172 --> 01:11:38,581
- "MOVE" by TAEMIN.
- Correct!

2164
01:11:38,582 --> 01:11:41,022
(Seon Ho guesses it correctly after just seeing him wriggle.)

2165
01:11:41,382 --> 01:11:42,912
- What?
- What?

2166
01:11:43,112 --> 01:11:44,112
What was it?

2167
01:11:44,312 --> 01:11:46,052
- What was that?
- Why is he so good?

2168
01:11:46,252 --> 01:11:47,752
He's the ace.

2169
01:11:48,022 --> 01:11:49,022
TAEMIN.

2170
01:11:49,652 --> 01:11:54,062
(Seon Ho noticed the key move.)

2171
01:11:54,522 --> 01:11:56,732
(He became the ace at once.)

2172
01:11:58,602 --> 01:12:00,331
- What's that?
- I got it!

2173
01:12:00,332 --> 01:12:01,362
"GANG" by Rain.

2174
01:12:03,232 --> 01:12:05,031
I got it! "GANG" by Rain.

2175
01:12:05,032 --> 01:12:07,842
- I'm surprised.
- You're so good!

2176
01:12:08,642 --> 01:12:10,442
(It's rare to see Wonpil react so quickly.)

2177
01:12:10,912 --> 01:12:13,382
(Why are they so good?)

2178
01:12:13,842 --> 01:12:15,281
(They've already answered five questions within this time, )

2179
01:12:15,282 --> 01:12:16,612
(thanks to the perfect copying.)

2180
01:12:19,322 --> 01:12:21,182
- What was this?
- I think I know it.

2181
01:12:21,552 --> 01:12:23,392
- TAEMIN.
- "BODY."

2182
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:26,222
(What's this dance with constant wriggling?)

2183
01:12:26,662 --> 01:12:28,322
("On a Saturday Night" by Son Dam Bi)

2184
01:12:28,962 --> 01:12:31,561
(It was famous for its shoulder swaying...)

2185
01:12:31,562 --> 01:12:35,162
(and sky poking moves.)

2186
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:37,132
It's this one.

2187
01:12:37,832 --> 01:12:39,002
What are you doing?

2188
01:12:40,672 --> 01:12:44,772
(It's 100 percent in sync.)

2189
01:12:45,642 --> 01:12:46,841
- I got it.
- "On a Saturday Night..."

2190
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:48,082
by Son Dam Bi.

2191
01:12:48,212 --> 01:12:49,811
- Correct!
- Okay.

2192
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:51,152
Good. We're quick.

2193
01:12:51,412 --> 01:12:52,482
Well done.

2194
01:12:54,222 --> 01:12:56,121
(It's Wonpil, the swaying man's turn again.)

2195
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,491
Make big moves.

2196
01:12:57,492 --> 01:12:59,092
- Go on.
- Isn't it the same as earlier?

2197
01:12:59,392 --> 01:13:01,592
What is he doing? He's broken.

2198
01:13:02,362 --> 01:13:04,292
(He's trying his best.)

2199
01:13:04,892 --> 01:13:05,901
(They love their brother's dancing skills.)

2200
01:13:05,902 --> 01:13:07,302
- Well done.
- What's that?

2201
01:13:09,032 --> 01:13:10,402
(He's confident in this.)

2202
01:13:10,932 --> 01:13:13,802
(Wonpil's cute and cheerful cat dance)

2203
01:13:14,142 --> 01:13:15,871
- "Bo Peep Bo Peep."
- T-ara.

2204
01:13:15,872 --> 01:13:17,171
- "Bo Peep Bo Peep" by T-ara.
- Correct!

2205
01:13:17,172 --> 01:13:18,172
Okay.

2206
01:13:18,572 --> 01:13:20,412
(Smiling)

2207
01:13:20,612 --> 01:13:21,641
Why am I so good?

2208
01:13:21,642 --> 01:13:23,762
(The member with the sharpest eyes in 2 Days 1 Night)

2209
01:13:23,812 --> 01:13:25,322
(Okay, I got it.)

2210
01:13:25,952 --> 01:13:28,152
(The little boy wants to be sexy.)

2211
01:13:28,722 --> 01:13:30,952
(We're buying eyes that haven't seen this.)

2212
01:13:31,892 --> 01:13:34,422
(Charming)

2213
01:13:34,962 --> 01:13:36,531
EXO.

2214
01:13:36,532 --> 01:13:38,191
- "Love Shot."
- "Love Shot" by EXO.

2215
01:13:38,192 --> 01:13:39,801
- Correct.
- I'm so good!

2216
01:13:39,802 --> 01:13:40,802
So good.

2217
01:13:41,102 --> 01:13:43,632
(They answered 8 questions in a short time.)

2218
01:13:44,702 --> 01:13:46,471
(It's his 2nd time dancing stiffly.)

2219
01:13:46,472 --> 01:13:48,101
- G-DRAGON.
- "TOO BAD" by G-DRAGON.

2220
01:13:48,102 --> 01:13:49,342
- Okay!
- Okay.

2221
01:13:50,242 --> 01:13:52,082
(This is G-DRAGON's dance?)

2222
01:13:52,612 --> 01:13:54,582
(A G-DRAGON-style dance)

2223
01:13:54,842 --> 01:13:57,011
(The textbook example of same dance but different feelings)

2224
01:13:57,012 --> 01:13:58,821
Do they watch TV all day?

2225
01:13:58,822 --> 01:14:00,222
- What?
- What's going on?

2226
01:14:00,682 --> 01:14:02,451
(They answered nine questions so far.)

2227
01:14:02,452 --> 01:14:03,492
Wait.

2228
01:14:04,552 --> 01:14:06,221
- Wait. That's...
- That's...

2229
01:14:06,222 --> 01:14:07,761
- It's Jin Young's song.
- It really is Jin Young's song.

2230
01:14:07,762 --> 01:14:10,131
It's Jin Young's song. He danced with Shindong.

2231
01:14:10,132 --> 01:14:11,392
(It is Jin Young's song.)

2232
01:14:11,932 --> 01:14:14,631
- "Switch to Me."
- "Groove Back."

2233
01:14:14,632 --> 01:14:15,831
"Groove Back" by Park Jin Young.

2234
01:14:15,832 --> 01:14:17,332
- Correct.
- Okay.

2235
01:14:17,872 --> 01:14:19,372
How do they know so well?

2236
01:14:19,972 --> 01:14:21,492
(We answered it correctly, Jin Young.)

2237
01:14:21,972 --> 01:14:23,712
(They're my boys.)

2238
01:14:23,972 --> 01:14:26,382
(They don't seem to know it.)

2239
01:14:27,012 --> 01:14:29,252
(They're almost there.)

2240
01:14:31,112 --> 01:14:32,222
This is a famous one.

2241
01:14:33,622 --> 01:14:36,191
(Isolating the best he can)

2242
01:14:36,192 --> 01:14:37,322
What's that?

2243
01:14:37,652 --> 01:14:38,652
I got it!

2244
01:14:39,122 --> 01:14:40,861
"Mystery" by BEAST.

2245
01:14:40,862 --> 01:14:42,131
- That's right.
- Correct!

2246
01:14:42,132 --> 01:14:43,292
How did you know this?

2247
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:45,362
- You have one question left.
- You're good.

2248
01:14:45,432 --> 01:14:47,632
- You have one question left.
- What are they?

2249
01:14:48,202 --> 01:14:49,931
- It's here.
- It's here.

2250
01:14:49,932 --> 01:14:51,102
Be confident.

2251
01:14:51,732 --> 01:14:52,902
Wonpil!

2252
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,318
- That's...
- There are many dances like that.

2253
01:14:54,342 --> 01:14:55,812
- That's...
- SISTAR!

2254
01:14:56,142 --> 01:14:57,272
"My Boy."

2255
01:14:57,772 --> 01:14:58,982
- "Alone."
- "Touch My Body."

2256
01:14:59,182 --> 01:15:00,782
- "Touch My Body."
- Incorrect.

2257
01:15:01,982 --> 01:15:03,551
It's correct.

2258
01:15:03,552 --> 01:15:05,252
(It's not this dance?)

2259
01:15:05,582 --> 01:15:06,982
"Touch My Body" by SISTAR.

2260
01:15:07,322 --> 01:15:08,382
- It's wrong.
- Incorrect.

2261
01:15:09,022 --> 01:15:10,492
- "SHAKE IT."
- "SHAKE IT."

2262
01:15:10,522 --> 01:15:11,752
- Correct!
- Okay.

2263
01:15:12,462 --> 01:15:15,061
- We were really fast.
- It's over.

2264
01:15:15,062 --> 01:15:17,491
- We're good.
- Please take a picture of us.

2265
01:15:17,492 --> 01:15:18,691
- Okay.
- Why?

2266
01:15:18,692 --> 01:15:20,662
- We did really well.
- Take a picture of us.

2267
01:15:21,402 --> 01:15:23,932
(I think we're going to be eating meat.)

2268
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:26,871
- We have to be quicker than them.
- Why don't we pass 12 times...

2269
01:15:26,872 --> 01:15:28,672
and answer two correctly?

2270
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:33,841
You're easygoing.

2271
01:15:33,842 --> 01:15:35,011
It's like I've done...

2272
01:15:35,012 --> 01:15:36,492
- a year's worth of exercise.
- True.

2273
01:15:37,682 --> 01:15:39,381
It feels like I've done some cardio.

2274
01:15:39,382 --> 01:15:40,521
(Interim review of 2 Days 1 Night: Cardio)

2275
01:15:40,522 --> 01:15:42,322
Just do it comfortably.

2276
01:15:42,892 --> 01:15:44,991
- I'll do my best.
- We can do it.

2277
01:15:44,992 --> 01:15:46,161
- Okay.
- We can do it.

2278
01:15:46,162 --> 01:15:48,721
Relax. We'll do it first.

2279
01:15:48,722 --> 01:15:49,892
Of course.

2280
01:15:50,662 --> 01:15:51,992
We can all do it.

2281
01:15:52,562 --> 01:15:54,361
Start!

2282
01:15:54,362 --> 01:15:55,402
Let's go.

2283
01:15:56,172 --> 01:15:57,802
(This is easy.)

2284
01:15:58,632 --> 01:16:00,441
- Come closer - "Supernova" by aespa.

2285
01:16:00,442 --> 01:16:02,142
- Correct.
- Okay.

2286
01:16:02,342 --> 01:16:03,872
- Hurry.
- It's here.

2287
01:16:06,982 --> 01:16:08,042
What's that?

2288
01:16:08,382 --> 01:16:09,781
Is it a recent one?

2289
01:16:09,782 --> 01:16:11,952
- He dances well.
- He dances well.

2290
01:16:13,252 --> 01:16:14,322
Deux.

2291
01:16:14,722 --> 01:16:16,721
- I know this.
- "A Look at Myself" by Deux.

2292
01:16:16,722 --> 01:16:18,322
- Correct!
- "A Look at Myself" by Deux.

2293
01:16:19,962 --> 01:16:22,532
(Neat dancing)

2294
01:16:26,362 --> 01:16:27,661
(He's just excited.)

2295
01:16:27,662 --> 01:16:28,662
They're good at this.

2296
01:16:30,272 --> 01:16:31,501
(They get two questions right faster than Team Youngpil.)

2297
01:16:31,502 --> 01:16:33,102
- I don't know this one.
- What is this?

2298
01:16:33,272 --> 01:16:35,002
(Shaking the shoulders quickly)

2299
01:16:35,542 --> 01:16:37,222
(He's repetitively shaking his shoulders?)

2300
01:16:42,352 --> 01:16:45,112
(ITZY's hit song with the shoulder shake as the highlight)

2301
01:16:48,282 --> 01:16:50,152
(Se Yoon is hilarious.)

2302
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:51,651
(Shaking)

2303
01:16:51,652 --> 01:16:52,991
- It's ITZY!
- ITZY!

2304
01:16:52,992 --> 01:16:54,492
- ITZY!
- ITZY. "Not Shy."

2305
01:16:54,762 --> 01:16:55,961
- Incorrect!
- ITZY.

2306
01:16:55,962 --> 01:16:57,431
- It's not that one.
- It's that song.

2307
01:16:57,432 --> 01:16:59,602
- There's that song.
- "I'll take care of it."

2308
01:16:59,662 --> 01:17:00,962
ITZY! "DALLA DALLA!"

2309
01:17:01,032 --> 01:17:02,102
- Incorrect!
- Incorrect!

2310
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:04,802
- There's that song.
- "Forget it."

2311
01:17:04,902 --> 01:17:06,042
This is driving me crazy.

2312
01:17:07,572 --> 01:17:09,111
- Pass!
- Gosh!

2313
01:17:09,112 --> 01:17:10,971
- I don't know the title.
- It's a song that you know.

2314
01:17:10,972 --> 01:17:12,682
- It's "WANNABE."
- "WANNABE!"

2315
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:14,211
Run!

2316
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:15,812
(Main Dancer SungJin finally steps out.)

2317
01:17:16,552 --> 01:17:17,681
(I knew how to sing, )

2318
01:17:17,682 --> 01:17:19,582
(but I couldn't dance at all.)

2319
01:17:19,952 --> 01:17:21,232
(I just gave up on dancing now.)

2320
01:17:21,422 --> 01:17:22,792
(Genre pioneer, SungJin)

2321
01:17:23,392 --> 01:17:25,512
(What kind of genre of dancing will SungJin show us?)

2322
01:17:27,922 --> 01:17:30,562
(Stiff body wave)

2323
01:17:30,992 --> 01:17:33,162
(His stiff moves cannot be copied.)

2324
01:17:34,432 --> 01:17:35,432
What is that?

2325
01:17:36,472 --> 01:17:38,701
- Rain! "Love Song."
- Rain!

2326
01:17:38,702 --> 01:17:39,942
- Incorrect?
- What is it then?

2327
01:17:40,002 --> 01:17:42,041
(Try to guess the answer.)

2328
01:17:42,042 --> 01:17:45,211
- What is that?
- That's amazing.

2329
01:17:45,212 --> 01:17:46,912
- He's doing well.
- That's amazing.

2330
01:17:47,342 --> 01:17:49,951
(The boy fans have all gathered.)

2331
01:17:49,952 --> 01:17:51,052
Is it not Rain?

2332
01:17:52,222 --> 01:17:53,321
- What?
- What is that?

2333
01:17:53,322 --> 01:17:54,551
- What is that?
- What is that?

2334
01:17:54,552 --> 01:17:56,072
First of all, he looks really excited.

2335
01:17:56,752 --> 01:17:58,992
- What is this?
- This one.

2336
01:17:59,292 --> 01:18:00,621
- I know!
- SHINee!

2337
01:18:00,622 --> 01:18:02,592
- SHINEE!
- "Lucifer" by SHINee!

2338
01:18:02,932 --> 01:18:04,291
- SHINee!
- Isn't that it? No.

2339
01:18:04,292 --> 01:18:05,492
No.

2340
01:18:06,332 --> 01:18:09,831
("Sherlock" by SHINee)

2341
01:18:09,832 --> 01:18:11,602
- "Replay!"
- No!

2342
01:18:11,972 --> 01:18:14,602
It's the one that goes, "You walk out the photo."

2343
01:18:14,702 --> 01:18:15,711
"Lucifer!"

2344
01:18:15,712 --> 01:18:17,271
- No!
- It's not that one.

2345
01:18:17,272 --> 01:18:18,992
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
- SHINee.

2346
01:18:19,342 --> 01:18:20,541
"Conan" by SHINee.

2347
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:21,742
(I should interrupt them.)

2348
01:18:22,012 --> 01:18:23,581
Can't we just tell them?

2349
01:18:23,582 --> 01:18:24,828
(The opposing team feels frustrated too.)

2350
01:18:24,852 --> 01:18:26,651
- "Sherlock" by SHINee!
- Just pass.

2351
01:18:26,652 --> 01:18:28,481
- Yes!
- "Sherlock!"

2352
01:18:28,482 --> 01:18:30,191
- Gosh.
- You were so close.

2353
01:18:30,192 --> 01:18:32,762
- I thought of Arsene Lupin.
- It was "Sherlock."

2354
01:18:33,022 --> 01:18:34,361
- What's next?
- Gosh.

2355
01:18:34,362 --> 01:18:37,032
(They spent quite a lot of time on that one.)

2356
01:18:37,792 --> 01:18:40,132
(We must pick up the pace.)

2357
01:18:40,462 --> 01:18:42,302
(Doing the choreography right after scanning)

2358
01:18:43,902 --> 01:18:45,301
(Sexy)

2359
01:18:45,302 --> 01:18:46,701
(Or is he just placing his head on the ground?)

2360
01:18:46,702 --> 01:18:48,172
Are there bugs crawling up his head?

2361
01:18:48,742 --> 01:18:49,971
- It's all out for this one.
- This one is...

2362
01:18:49,972 --> 01:18:51,012
"24 Hours!"

2363
01:18:51,842 --> 01:18:53,842
("24 Hours" by SUNMI)

2364
01:18:54,612 --> 01:18:57,111
(The youngest one's sexiness was almost shown.)

2365
01:18:57,112 --> 01:18:58,882
- "24 Hours!"
- Right.

2366
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:00,522
- Is that right?
- SUNMI!

2367
01:19:00,582 --> 01:19:01,652
Correct!

2368
01:19:02,022 --> 01:19:03,252
Why am I good at this?

2369
01:19:03,522 --> 01:19:04,922
What? Who is this?

2370
01:19:05,762 --> 01:19:06,821
What is this?

2371
01:19:06,822 --> 01:19:08,362
- You don't know this?
- I don't.

2372
01:19:08,492 --> 01:19:10,992
- This is the only one I don't know.
- It's a boy group.

2373
01:19:12,502 --> 01:19:13,532
I know that one.

2374
01:19:14,702 --> 01:19:16,231
- I've seen that.
- Right. This move.

2375
01:19:16,232 --> 01:19:18,332
It's 2PM! "My House!"

2376
01:19:18,432 --> 01:19:19,641
- Correct.
- Nice.

2377
01:19:19,642 --> 01:19:20,742
You're good at this.

2378
01:19:20,972 --> 01:19:24,342
(He copies the key moves well even though he doesn't know it.)

2379
01:19:24,542 --> 01:19:27,181
- He has great lines.
- He's definitely a good dancer.

2380
01:19:27,182 --> 01:19:28,542
- He's a good dancer.
- He's good.

2381
01:19:29,152 --> 01:19:30,911
(Let's keep this up.)

2382
01:19:30,912 --> 01:19:32,481
It should've been that one instead.

2383
01:19:32,482 --> 01:19:34,482
(Completing the scan with hawk eyes)

2384
01:19:34,522 --> 01:19:35,522
(Laughing)

2385
01:19:35,523 --> 01:19:36,751
(What is this song that is making DinDin smile?)

2386
01:19:36,752 --> 01:19:38,452
- "Mona Lisa" by MBLAQ.
- Correct!

2387
01:19:38,892 --> 01:19:41,422
(It was his song?)

2388
01:19:41,922 --> 01:19:44,462
(One of MBLAQ's many hit songs)

2389
01:19:46,962 --> 01:19:48,832
(Young 24-year-old Joon)

2390
01:19:49,672 --> 01:19:52,642
(Jong Min copies the moves perfectly.)

2391
01:19:53,242 --> 01:19:55,102
He's different, indeed.

2392
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:57,641
(They currently got six questions right.)

2393
01:19:57,642 --> 01:19:59,342
Jumping!

2394
01:19:59,482 --> 01:20:01,942
- What is that?
- "Bar Bar Bar" by Crayon Pop.

2395
01:20:02,712 --> 01:20:04,081
(It's not that one.)

2396
01:20:04,082 --> 01:20:05,451
(There's another one like this.)

2397
01:20:05,452 --> 01:20:07,082
"Live or Die By Style."

2398
01:20:07,352 --> 01:20:08,922
- "The Way This Guy Lives."
- Correct!

2399
01:20:09,992 --> 01:20:12,092
(That's my role model.)

2400
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:17,092
(It's not "Bar Bar Bar." It's "Live or Die By Style.")

2401
01:20:17,692 --> 01:20:18,692
(It's SungJin's turn again.)

2402
01:20:18,693 --> 01:20:20,162
We're at a fast pace now.

2403
01:20:20,402 --> 01:20:21,632
- No.
- Okay.

2404
01:20:24,002 --> 01:20:25,742
- There it is.
- We can do it.

2405
01:20:26,942 --> 01:20:28,602
- There it is.
- What is that?

2406
01:20:29,572 --> 01:20:31,172
(Unable to react)

2407
01:20:31,612 --> 01:20:32,982
(He's at it again.)

2408
01:20:33,942 --> 01:20:35,641
(His dancing is quite flustering.)

2409
01:20:35,642 --> 01:20:37,112
- There it is.
- "Shock" by BEAST.

2410
01:20:37,252 --> 01:20:38,282
Incorrect!

2411
01:20:39,382 --> 01:20:42,081
But SungJin is amazing at this.

2412
01:20:42,082 --> 01:20:43,202
(This guy is the real deal.)

2413
01:20:43,622 --> 01:20:45,121
- Really?
- Gosh!

2414
01:20:45,122 --> 01:20:46,192
(Curious)

2415
01:20:46,762 --> 01:20:48,291
(Is he provoking them now?)

2416
01:20:48,292 --> 01:20:49,331
Are you starting a fight?

2417
01:20:49,332 --> 01:20:50,762
(Fancy)

2418
01:20:51,492 --> 01:20:53,001
- What is that?
- What is that?

2419
01:20:53,002 --> 01:20:54,332
- What is that?
- Epaksa!

2420
01:20:54,902 --> 01:20:56,731
- That's nice.
- He's doing it right though.

2421
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:58,131
- He's doing the moves.
- He's doing the moves.

2422
01:20:58,132 --> 01:20:59,342
He's doing all of the moves.

2423
01:21:00,302 --> 01:21:02,972
("That That" by PSY)

2424
01:21:11,212 --> 01:21:14,482
(Dance King)

2425
01:21:14,822 --> 01:21:17,122
It's PSY! Is it "New Face?" It's not that one.

2426
01:21:17,222 --> 01:21:18,752
- PSY!
- PSY!

2427
01:21:18,922 --> 01:21:20,321
- "That That" by PSY!
- Correct!

2428
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:22,162
- "That That."
- Nice.

2429
01:21:22,292 --> 01:21:24,132
- Okay.
- That was amazing.

2430
01:21:24,332 --> 01:21:25,332
What's that?

2431
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:27,332
(They succeed if they get four more right.)

2432
01:21:27,662 --> 01:21:29,972
(Swirling around)

2433
01:21:32,442 --> 01:21:34,672
(Singing automatically)

2434
01:21:34,872 --> 01:21:36,471
"Klaxon" by i-dle.

2435
01:21:36,472 --> 01:21:37,742
- Correct!
- Nice!

2436
01:21:37,942 --> 01:21:39,182
How did you know that?

2437
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:42,382
This is too hard.

2438
01:21:44,012 --> 01:21:45,052
What is that?

2439
01:21:46,452 --> 01:21:47,951
(Those moves are familiar!)

2440
01:21:47,952 --> 01:21:49,952
"Something, swing ma baby."

2441
01:21:51,322 --> 01:21:52,921
- What is this song?
- JYP!

2442
01:21:52,922 --> 01:21:55,022
- "Swing Ma Baby" by JYP!
- "Swing Baby."

2443
01:21:55,462 --> 01:21:57,292
- Correct!
- "Swing Baby."

2444
01:21:58,062 --> 01:22:01,462
(Covering those times perfectly)

2445
01:22:04,332 --> 01:22:06,341
(Copying the moves right away)

2446
01:22:06,342 --> 01:22:07,572
(A moth suddenly appears.)

2447
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:10,142
Gosh, there's a moth!

2448
01:22:10,412 --> 01:22:13,382
Gosh, what? Is he dancing or is that because of the moth?

2449
01:22:16,152 --> 01:22:17,781
- "Adult Ceremony" by Park Ji Yoon.
- "Adult Ceremony."

2450
01:22:17,782 --> 01:22:18,782
Correct!

2451
01:22:19,012 --> 01:22:21,352
(We look quite similar, don't we?)

2452
01:22:21,782 --> 01:22:23,091
- It's the last one.
- What is this?

2453
01:22:23,092 --> 01:22:24,252
(It's the last question now.)

2454
01:22:26,162 --> 01:22:27,162
What?

2455
01:22:28,162 --> 01:22:29,482
He keeps stepping on chewing gum?

2456
01:22:30,592 --> 01:22:31,892
(Sweeping his face)

2457
01:22:32,332 --> 01:22:33,602
(No!)

2458
01:22:36,502 --> 01:22:37,931
(Perfect angle)

2459
01:22:37,932 --> 01:22:40,342
- I know this one.
- I know this one.

2460
01:22:40,642 --> 01:22:41,642
We won.

2461
01:22:42,642 --> 01:22:44,271
- Thank you for the food.
- Pass!

2462
01:22:44,272 --> 01:22:45,612
(Thanking in advance)

2463
01:22:46,642 --> 01:22:50,512
(It also seems like a move for aerobics.)

2464
01:22:51,012 --> 01:22:53,952
(They fall into Se Yoon's charms more and more.)

2465
01:22:54,252 --> 01:22:55,921
They're world stars!

2466
01:22:55,922 --> 01:22:57,522
- World stars!
- I know!

2467
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,612
(The chewing gum stamping move in question)

2468
01:23:02,792 --> 01:23:06,032
(He's struggling to keep up with the beat.)

2469
01:23:08,332 --> 01:23:10,302
(He even copied the key move, )

2470
01:23:11,002 --> 01:23:13,772
(but no one can figure it out.)

2471
01:23:14,272 --> 01:23:15,341
Hurry up and guess it!

2472
01:23:15,342 --> 01:23:17,742
- Hurry up and guess it!
- "Hurry up and guess it!"

2473
01:23:18,072 --> 01:23:19,142
World stars!

2474
01:23:19,312 --> 01:23:21,712
- I know! "Butter" by BTS.
- BTS!

2475
01:23:21,812 --> 01:23:23,411
- Incorrect!
- "Dynamite" by BTS.

2476
01:23:23,412 --> 01:23:24,482
- Correct!
- BTS.

2477
01:23:26,052 --> 01:23:27,352
- Is it over?
- Yes.

2478
01:23:28,482 --> 01:23:30,591
(In despair)

2479
01:23:30,592 --> 01:23:32,821
I now understand why...

2480
01:23:32,822 --> 01:23:34,962
JYP put SungJin in a band.

2481
01:23:35,162 --> 01:23:36,861
- That was just amazing.
- What?

2482
01:23:36,862 --> 01:23:37,932
(Feeling guilty)

2483
01:23:38,232 --> 01:23:39,501
(Encore performance)

2484
01:23:39,502 --> 01:23:40,561
- What was that?
- What was that?

2485
01:23:40,562 --> 01:23:42,531
- That was amazing.
- "That That."

2486
01:23:42,532 --> 01:23:45,101
I will tell you the record of Team Dojin first.

2487
01:23:45,102 --> 01:23:46,302
Team Dojin...

2488
01:23:46,742 --> 01:23:49,442
- I think it's around 7 minutes.
- Around 7 to 8 minutes.

2489
01:23:50,472 --> 01:23:51,812
It was 6 minutes and 10 seconds.

2490
01:23:52,212 --> 01:23:53,212
- What?
- That was quick.

2491
01:23:53,912 --> 01:23:55,041
(That was quicker than expected.)

2492
01:23:55,042 --> 01:23:56,311
- That was quick.
- That was quick.

2493
01:23:56,312 --> 01:23:57,512
Team Youngpil.

2494
01:23:57,782 --> 01:23:58,812
Seven minutes?

2495
01:23:59,682 --> 01:24:01,322
It was 3 minutes and 42 seconds for them.

2496
01:24:02,022 --> 01:24:03,621
So for the Dinner Game,

2497
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:05,451
- That was insane.
- Team Youngpil...

2498
01:24:05,452 --> 01:24:06,661
- takes the win...
- That was great.

2499
01:24:06,662 --> 01:24:09,061
- That was great.
- with a score of 2 to 0.

2500
01:24:09,062 --> 01:24:10,892
It's fine even if we are to sleep outside.

2501
01:24:11,132 --> 01:24:12,732
Isn't there one last game?

2502
01:24:12,902 --> 01:24:15,362
- What should we do?
- What will they eat then?

2503
01:24:15,532 --> 01:24:16,872
That team...

2504
01:24:18,002 --> 01:24:20,602
- will eat something not so good.
- Okay! Let's go!

2505
01:24:20,772 --> 01:24:22,611
- Nice!
- Right.

2506
01:24:22,612 --> 01:24:23,871
Right. That was a great battle.

2507
01:24:23,872 --> 01:24:25,842
- Thank you. I'll enjoy the food.
- Right.

2508
01:24:25,912 --> 01:24:27,472
They will still be giving us something.

2509
01:24:28,242 --> 01:24:29,651
- Nice one.
- Nice one.

2510
01:24:29,652 --> 01:24:31,081
- That was so exciting.
- That was amazing.

2511
01:24:31,082 --> 01:24:33,152
- There's a sense of joy.
- Right?

2512
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:35,952
Gosh, that was exhausting.

2513
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:37,491
I do feel exhausted,

2514
01:24:37,492 --> 01:24:39,132
but it feels like my stress was relieved.

2515
01:24:40,462 --> 01:24:41,522
Welcome.

2516
01:24:42,732 --> 01:24:45,091
(It's time to charge up with food now.)

2517
01:24:45,092 --> 01:24:46,461
- I should face away from it.
- Gosh, that's amazing.

2518
01:24:46,462 --> 01:24:48,461
- That's such a big difference.
- That's insane.

2519
01:24:48,462 --> 01:24:49,571
(Mouth opening wide)

2520
01:24:49,572 --> 01:24:51,471
- That's insane!
- That's such a big difference.

2521
01:24:51,472 --> 01:24:53,542
That's insane! Tenderloin is given?

2522
01:24:54,142 --> 01:24:57,112
(Korean beef that melts in your mouth)

2523
01:24:58,172 --> 01:25:01,142
(Sirloin, tenderloin, short plate, chuck flap tail)

2524
01:25:01,742 --> 01:25:04,612
(Korean pork that tastes better with each chew)

2525
01:25:06,222 --> 01:25:09,751
(Pork belly, pork shoulder, pork neck, skin-on pork belly)

2526
01:25:09,752 --> 01:25:11,051
Gosh!

2527
01:25:11,052 --> 01:25:12,191
I shouldn't have looked.

2528
01:25:12,192 --> 01:25:13,661
Tenderloin is given?

2529
01:25:13,662 --> 01:25:15,121
Gosh, that's insane!

2530
01:25:15,122 --> 01:25:16,431
That much beef is given?

2531
01:25:16,432 --> 01:25:18,032
I'm going to unlock my stomach today.

2532
01:25:18,832 --> 01:25:21,132
There's a strange person here.

2533
01:25:21,302 --> 01:25:22,932
An outsider has come here.

2534
01:25:23,532 --> 01:25:24,701
I'm the third wheel.

2535
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:26,141
(What are you doing there?)

2536
01:25:26,142 --> 01:25:28,101
- Hey, there's tenderloin.
- Hold on.

2537
01:25:28,102 --> 01:25:30,511
- Hey, come on.
- Gosh, there's so much meat.

2538
01:25:30,512 --> 01:25:32,611
- Take your seats.
- Is this beef short plate?

2539
01:25:32,612 --> 01:25:34,042
There's no point.

2540
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:37,012
(I'm jealous.)

2541
01:25:37,282 --> 01:25:39,821
Gosh, I'm losing my appetite.

2542
01:25:39,822 --> 01:25:41,081
- Gosh.
- Right.

2543
01:25:41,082 --> 01:25:42,082
(They lose their appetite after seeing the meat.)

2544
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:45,922
Actually, we will smell it if it gets grilled.

2545
01:25:46,462 --> 01:25:47,791
The smell will kill us.

2546
01:25:47,792 --> 01:25:49,191
- There isn't even a ventilator.
- Right.

2547
01:25:49,192 --> 01:25:50,431
- It will be wild in here.
- There's ramyeon too.

2548
01:25:50,432 --> 01:25:51,691
- Right.
- My gosh.

2549
01:25:51,692 --> 01:25:52,902
That's the worst combination.

2550
01:25:55,562 --> 01:25:57,172
- Is this tenderloin, DinDin?
- Yes.

2551
01:25:59,302 --> 01:26:01,071
This is driving me crazy.

2552
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:02,872
Gosh, check out the sound.

2553
01:26:03,912 --> 01:26:04,942
It looks delicious.

2554
01:26:05,712 --> 01:26:07,312
We grill the meat similarly.

2555
01:26:07,582 --> 01:26:09,681
(I want to eat it quickly.)

2556
01:26:09,682 --> 01:26:12,151
We don't have to cut the meat, right?

2557
01:26:12,152 --> 01:26:14,021
- Let's not cut it.
- Just eat it as it is.

2558
01:26:14,022 --> 01:26:15,982
I like eating it in one big bite.

2559
01:26:16,752 --> 01:26:18,451
- It was always like that.
- This one is ready.

2560
01:26:18,452 --> 01:26:19,761
I ate it like that.

2561
01:26:19,762 --> 01:26:21,021
This can be eaten, Young K.

2562
01:26:21,022 --> 01:26:23,191
- Go ahead.
- You should eat first.

2563
01:26:23,192 --> 01:26:26,161
Gosh, it smells insane.

2564
01:26:26,162 --> 01:26:27,361
What did they start with?

2565
01:26:27,362 --> 01:26:28,401
It smells amazing.

2566
01:26:28,402 --> 01:26:29,572
Chuck flap tail!

2567
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:31,031
- Chuck flap tail.
- Goodness.

2568
01:26:31,032 --> 01:26:33,371
Young K, with the chuck flap tail...

2569
01:26:33,372 --> 01:26:35,801
- Cheers.
- Eat it with rice.

2570
01:26:35,802 --> 01:26:37,672
You should wrap rice with it.

2571
01:26:37,842 --> 01:26:40,041
- Eat it with rice.
- I'll eat it without salt.

2572
01:26:40,042 --> 01:26:41,341
I'll just eat it as it is first.

2573
01:26:41,342 --> 01:26:43,612
(I should eat the first piece as it is.)

2574
01:26:44,352 --> 01:26:46,351
(Taking a big bite)

2575
01:26:46,352 --> 01:26:47,481
Eat it with rice.

2576
01:26:47,482 --> 01:26:49,422
- With some salt.
- Just the meat.

2577
01:26:49,952 --> 01:26:52,791
(Savoring it with his eyes closed)

2578
01:26:52,792 --> 01:26:54,261
- This is so good.
- It's crazy.

2579
01:26:54,262 --> 01:26:56,761
(This is truly the happy "Days Gone By.")

2580
01:26:56,762 --> 01:26:58,632
This is crazy.

2581
01:26:58,762 --> 01:27:00,231
- It melts in my mouth.
- Right.

2582
01:27:00,232 --> 01:27:01,632
("Melt Down" in your mouth)

2583
01:27:03,372 --> 01:27:04,431
My goodness.

2584
01:27:04,432 --> 01:27:06,641
("I'm Serious" about the meat.)

2585
01:27:06,642 --> 01:27:07,701
My goodness.

2586
01:27:07,702 --> 01:27:11,472
(The most jealous)

2587
01:27:13,242 --> 01:27:14,742
The sirloin looks so delicious.

2588
01:27:15,442 --> 01:27:17,151
- You can eat it now.
- Okay.

2589
01:27:17,152 --> 01:27:18,912
- It's okay to eat.
- Eat it quickly.

2590
01:27:20,322 --> 01:27:22,722
(The meat lover's big appetite)

2591
01:27:23,852 --> 01:27:26,662
(Wonpil takes a big bite too.)

2592
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,621
- It's the best.
- Right.

2593
01:27:28,622 --> 01:27:30,991
(Cheol, your mouth is about to burst.)

2594
01:27:30,992 --> 01:27:33,231
- You should do that.
- Listen, Joon.

2595
01:27:33,232 --> 01:27:35,032
The color of the meat looks amazing.

2596
01:27:35,932 --> 01:27:37,001
What was that?

2597
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:38,431
(Eating)

2598
01:27:38,432 --> 01:27:39,701
Why did you ask?

2599
01:27:39,702 --> 01:27:40,972
I thought he'd give me some.

2600
01:27:41,142 --> 01:27:42,442
My dear colleague.

2601
01:27:43,042 --> 01:27:44,171
Are you hungry?

2602
01:27:44,172 --> 01:27:45,871
We should eat protein like them.

2603
01:27:45,872 --> 01:27:47,282
- It's our turn now.
- Okay.

2604
01:27:47,582 --> 01:27:49,111
- Is it protein?
- Seriously...

2605
01:27:49,112 --> 01:27:51,851
Please give us at least some rice and dried laver.

2606
01:27:51,852 --> 01:27:54,022
We will give you the food then.

2607
01:27:55,122 --> 01:27:58,022
- My gosh. I love it.
- What?

2608
01:27:59,122 --> 01:28:00,922
(What is the losing team eating?)

2609
01:28:01,422 --> 01:28:03,462
(Enjoy your food.)

2610
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:05,261
This is it.

2611
01:28:05,262 --> 01:28:06,332
Thank you.

2612
01:28:06,502 --> 01:28:07,762
It is nice.

2613
01:28:08,132 --> 01:28:10,472
I'm sorry, but can we at least fry the kimchi...

2614
01:28:10,632 --> 01:28:11,831
in the leftover grease?

2615
01:28:11,832 --> 01:28:13,672
Please let us fry the kimchi.

2616
01:28:13,802 --> 01:28:17,342
(It does taste good with rice.)

2617
01:28:17,972 --> 01:28:19,881
- Let's eat anyway.
- Let's eat.

2618
01:28:19,882 --> 01:28:22,212
- Kimchi is good.
- Okay. Thank you for the food.

2619
01:28:22,852 --> 01:28:24,451
(Kimchi is a good side dish.)

2620
01:28:24,452 --> 01:28:25,882
I can put the rice in water.

2621
01:28:26,852 --> 01:28:28,982
(Taking a big bite)

2622
01:28:31,352 --> 01:28:32,522
It's good, isn't it?

2623
01:28:36,192 --> 01:28:38,892
(They are happy only with kimchi.)

2624
01:28:39,532 --> 01:28:41,332
(Having a piece of kimchi)

2625
01:28:41,602 --> 01:28:43,602
(Eating some rice)

2626
01:28:46,302 --> 01:28:47,672
The kimchi is perfectly fermented.

2627
01:28:47,942 --> 01:28:49,042
The rice is sweet.

2628
01:28:50,572 --> 01:28:52,612
You don't usually eat like this, do you?

2629
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:54,912
- Right.
- When I lived in a small studio,

2630
01:28:55,482 --> 01:28:56,681
I would eat like this.

2631
01:28:56,682 --> 01:28:57,852
- You did?
- Yes.

2632
01:28:58,852 --> 01:29:01,282
Honestly, this is good enough.

2633
01:29:01,752 --> 01:29:03,321
But the problem is the smell.

2634
01:29:03,322 --> 01:29:04,491
That's true.

2635
01:29:04,492 --> 01:29:06,491
- I like it though.
- Really?

2636
01:29:06,492 --> 01:29:08,791
I'm eating kimchi while smelling the meat.

2637
01:29:08,792 --> 01:29:10,491
- It feels like eating meat.
- Really?

2638
01:29:10,492 --> 01:29:12,791
- This is so hard.
- I like your positive mindset.

2639
01:29:12,792 --> 01:29:14,401
I have no choice.

2640
01:29:14,402 --> 01:29:15,802
I should at least think that way.

2641
01:29:17,502 --> 01:29:18,971
We've finished three packs.

2642
01:29:18,972 --> 01:29:20,141
- Shall we eat?
- Let's eat.

2643
01:29:20,142 --> 01:29:22,418
- You guys are eating well.
- I think we can finish them.

2644
01:29:22,442 --> 01:29:24,071
- We can eat them all.
- Right.

2645
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:26,441
Judging by the way we are eating, I think we can finish them all.

2646
01:29:26,442 --> 01:29:28,981
It would be too much if we had ramyeon and rice.

2647
01:29:28,982 --> 01:29:30,081
- This can work.
- If we eat only the meat...

2648
01:29:30,082 --> 01:29:31,552
- We can eat them all.
- Right.

2649
01:29:31,612 --> 01:29:33,081
- And...
- Here. Eat this.

2650
01:29:33,082 --> 01:29:34,322
DinDin, open up.

2651
01:29:34,522 --> 01:29:35,522
Eat this.

2652
01:29:36,522 --> 01:29:38,391
Which part is this?

2653
01:29:38,392 --> 01:29:40,161
- Beef short plate.
- Beef short plate?

2654
01:29:40,162 --> 01:29:41,362
I think it's beef short plate.

2655
01:29:41,562 --> 01:29:42,991
I love the doneness.

2656
01:29:42,992 --> 01:29:44,692
It's perfectly cooked.

2657
01:29:45,562 --> 01:29:47,732
(Eating)

2658
01:29:48,862 --> 01:29:52,772
(While they continue their happy meal, )

2659
01:29:54,172 --> 01:29:56,742
(they are just chewing to survive.)

2660
01:29:57,272 --> 01:29:59,288
Don't you have a can of tuna or something in your hat?

2661
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:00,642
Here?

2662
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:01,881
(There's no way.)

2663
01:30:01,882 --> 01:30:03,112
At least a can of tuna...

2664
01:30:04,252 --> 01:30:06,352
(Next episode)

2665
01:30:06,982 --> 01:30:08,581
(The highlight of 2 Days 1 Night)

2666
01:30:08,582 --> 01:30:10,222
(Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors)

2667
01:30:10,752 --> 01:30:12,622
(It's finally happening.)

2668
01:30:13,462 --> 01:30:17,092
(Is there no way we can all sleep together indoors?)

2669
01:30:17,432 --> 01:30:21,102
(What caused those once friendly members...)

2670
01:30:21,502 --> 01:30:25,072
(to split up?)

2671
01:30:25,502 --> 01:30:28,102
(Their teamwork is falling apart.)

2672
01:30:29,002 --> 01:30:31,672
(Mockery)

2673
01:30:32,042 --> 01:30:34,542
(Eventually, they start to show strange symptoms.)

2674
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:38,912
(What on earth is happening to them?)

2675
01:30:39,282 --> 01:30:41,652
(And there's something you've never seen before.)

2676
01:30:42,152 --> 01:30:44,492
(The DAY6 members are half-asleep and half-awake.)

2677
01:30:44,992 --> 01:30:46,712
(You will be watching it next week, right?)

2678
01:30:47,122 --> 01:30:48,642
I'm supposed to be a testosterone boy.
