1
00:00:05,508 --> 00:00:08,108
(Yeouido, Seoul)

2
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:12,478
(The crew gathers at KBS earlier than usual.)

3
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:19,458
(Soon, they leave KBS...)

4
00:00:22,318 --> 00:00:25,357
(To Mangwon-dong)

5
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,927
(Dosandaero)

6
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:33,238
(They scatter all over Seoul.)

7
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:37,867
(The day before, the crew told the members...)

8
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:41,637
(filming would start at 7am outside KBS.)

9
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:43,977
(From 6 am, 1 hour before the deadline, )

10
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,618
(the crew begin tailing each member.)

11
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:50,648
(6:03am, Se Yoon arrives at a restaurant near KBS.)

12
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,258
(6:09am, Jong Min joins him at the restaurant.)

13
00:00:56,928 --> 00:00:59,758
(6:13am, Seon Ho takes the Gangbyeon Highway.)

14
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,228
(6:34am, DinDin takes the Olympic Highway.)

15
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,468
(6:36am, Sae Ho gets on the Hangang Bridge.)

16
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:10,708
(And Joon...)

17
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:13,237
(His drama shoot ended late last night, )

18
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:15,477
(so he stayed at a motel in Yeouido.)

19
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:17,847
(Se Yoon, Jong Min, Joon, Seon Ho, Sae Ho, DinDin)

20
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:23,418
(Why did the crew follow the members?)

21
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,118
Hello.

22
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,928
Can you pull over in a safe spot?

23
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:31,628
- Yes.
- Pull over.

24
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,598
Let DinDin out of the car.

25
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,667
Drop Sae Ho off.

26
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:40,068
Seon Ho, please get out of the car immediately.

27
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,837
(Director Joo makes an announcement in the group chat.)

28
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:44,367
(You cannot go anywhere.)

29
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:45,837
(If you're in a car, get out immediately!)

30
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:47,337
(Moon Se Yoon: ?)

31
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:49,037
(Cho Sae Ho: As soon as I arrive?)

32
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:50,877
(Kim Jong Min: ?)

33
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:53,048
(Get out immediately!)

34
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:57,847
(The members are ambushed on site.)

35
00:01:57,848 --> 00:01:58,948
What's this about?

36
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:00,818
I was heading to the set.

37
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:02,588
Let's get you mic-ed up.

38
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,157
Put on your mic.

39
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:05,158
Okay.

40
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,458
How did you find me?

41
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:07,828
I was so scared.

42
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:11,268
Get out of the car, DinDin.

43
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:12,768
What are you doing?

44
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:15,597
I'm eating.

45
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:16,878
You must get out of the car now.

46
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:18,907
I was excited last night...

47
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:21,108
at the thought of having a burger while falling asleep.

48
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,777
- Hold on. We started the shoot.
- No, we didn't.

49
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:25,207
I can have a bite of it.

50
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,418
Just one bite then.

51
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:28,218
Just one bite.

52
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:30,617
DinDin, put away your food now.

53
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:31,718
We started filming.

54
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:33,388
Gosh, I feel so bad for myself.

55
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,658
Must I come out quickly?

56
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:37,628
Yes, Joon. Come on out right now.

57
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,958
So is it beneficial if I come out quickly?

58
00:02:41,658 --> 00:02:42,828
Come on out now.

59
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:44,928
They sound scary.

60
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,468
Seriously. You guys are so mean.

61
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:53,608
How come no one told me anything?

62
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:55,777
I knew something was off.

63
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:57,578
They circled around the same spot four times.

64
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:00,308
I turned around for my bag and saw that you were tailing us.

65
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:02,378
What's going on? What is this?

66
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:03,988
It's a sudden mission.

67
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:06,858
From now on, two members will drive around to pick up...

68
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,728
the rest of the members.

69
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,458
The 1st team of 3 to make it...

70
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:14,998
to the opening spot will win.

71
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:17,528
I can just walk there.

72
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,767
- Do you know where it is?
- Isn't it at the KBS building?

73
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,097
No. That's not it.

74
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:23,468
- No?
- It's somewhere else.

75
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:25,207
From now on,

76
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,037
the only mode of transportation for you is walking.

77
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:29,478
You're not allowed to take a cab, the bus, or the subway.

78
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:30,907
(Blinking)

79
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:31,948
What?

80
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:34,278
- Did you understand the mission?
- No.

81
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,448
How will I know where they are?

82
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,748
The only mode of transportation for you is walking.

83
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:42,188
You're not allowed to take a cab, the bus, or the subway.

84
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:44,628
What...

85
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,498
Hold on. Who are you?

86
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:48,298
- He's a new director.
- Really?

87
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,397
Let's shake hands at least.

88
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:51,428
You gave me a mission even before saying hello.

89
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,497
A new director is giving me instructions.

90
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:54,498
Nice to meet you.

91
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:56,298
So what am I supposed to do?

92
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:58,067
I can just call them and meet up, right?

93
00:03:58,068 --> 00:03:59,337
Does it mean someone is driving now?

94
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:00,377
(3 of them must be in the same car and get to the opening spot 1st.)

95
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:01,437
(3 of them must be in the same car and get to the opening spot 1st.)

96
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:03,118
I guess the team captains must be driving.

97
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:04,608
Whom should I call then?

98
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,117
It can't be Se Yoon.

99
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:08,848
Se Yoon and I had a meal together just now.

100
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:12,128
He left saying he was going to use the toilet after the meal.

101
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,688
(Knocking)

102
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:18,558
- Se Yoon.
- What's going on?

103
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,397
Did you read the announcement?

104
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:21,497
I did.

105
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,779
He wrote I shouldn't move. How am I going to wipe myself?

106
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:26,998
Come on out after you finish your business.

107
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:31,208
Did you film that?

108
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,868
Please put on the microphone.

109
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:34,738
- Why must I?
- Please do it now.

110
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,748
Why?

111
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:40,048
From now on, you must pick up two members...

112
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,348
and arrive at the Yeouido Wharf.

113
00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:44,287
The faster you arrive there, the more advantageous it will be.

114
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:46,218
(He's getting a different instruction.)

115
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:48,158
Here's your instruction. DinDin.

116
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,457
From now on, you must pick up two members before the other team...

117
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,198
and arrive at the Yeouido Wharf.

118
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,274
The faster you arrive there, the more advantageous it will be.

119
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:58,397
(3 members must assemble quickly...)

120
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,998
Gather the members in the car?

121
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:04,268
(and arrive at the Yeouido Hangang Park first.)

122
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:05,608
I have to walk there?

123
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,437
We're providing you with a car.

124
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:08,608
Really? Why?

125
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:11,198
Does it mean someone else got a car just like me?

126
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:12,448
Where are you?

127
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,047
I think I'm around your house.

128
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,148
Where are you?

129
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:17,988
I'm in Banpo now.

130
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,818
Banpo? I'm in Mapo now.

131
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,287
Why are you in Mapo?

132
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,968
I don't know. What are you doing in Banpo?

133
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:25,828
- Okay. I'll call you later.
- Okay.

134
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:27,558
I don't know where I am.

135
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:28,957
Where are you?

136
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,827
Where are you? How come you're not coming to pick me up?

137
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:32,598
How come you're not coming to pick me up?

138
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:34,668
Where are you? Tell me.

139
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:37,868
I don't know where I am.

140
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:39,238
I'm in Korea.

141
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:40,977
I'll just go to the opening spot.

142
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:42,538
Come and pick me up there.

143
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:45,308
You don't know where the opening spot is.

144
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:47,878
Right.

145
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:50,078
Isn't it at the KBS building?

146
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:53,517
I thought it was too. But it might not be.

147
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:54,687
(Only the members with the cars know where it is.)

148
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,288
Right. It might not be the KBS building.

149
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:57,827
From here...

150
00:05:57,828 --> 00:05:59,288
Who has the car now?

151
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,598
Right. Who's driving?

152
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:03,228
Then bye.

153
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:05,898
No. You and I could be on the same team.

154
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:08,537
(Quickly ditching the ones without cars)

155
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:09,698
You're not it.

156
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:13,278
So two of the members are driving right now, right?

157
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:15,778
- Sae Ho.
- Joon, are you driving right now?

158
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,408
I'm in Yeouido right now.

159
00:06:18,648 --> 00:06:20,517
- Yes.
- I'm standing here alone.

160
00:06:20,518 --> 00:06:22,117
- Really? Where are you now?
- Yes.

161
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:23,687
Let's meet up. I think that will be the smart thing to do.

162
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:24,947
We need to get into a car.

163
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:26,887
I'm near the KBS annex.

164
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,788
Me too. I'm seeing...

165
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:30,287
Really?

166
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:32,428
Yes. We should meet up quickly.

167
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:35,297
There are a lot of barbecue restaurants here.

168
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:37,579
Yes. Do you know this restaurant called Eunseong Hoegwan?

169
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:38,967
Eunseong Hoegwan. Hold on.

170
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:40,238
I can see the sign.

171
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:41,938
Sae Ho. Hold on.

172
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:43,968
Eunseong Hoegwan.

173
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:46,337
- Hold on.
- Hey, Joon.

174
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:48,508
- Turn right.
- Turn right.

175
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:50,248
- Turn right.
- Turn right.

176
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,147
- Stop.
- Stop.

177
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:54,048
- Right here. I'm here.
- There.

178
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,887
- Right here. I'm here.
- There.

179
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:57,888
Okay.

180
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:58,888
(They spot each other.)

181
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:02,058
(They start running first.)

182
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,488
My colleague!

183
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,288
My colleague!

184
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:06,757
(Chuckling)

185
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:09,028
I can't believe we met up so quickly.

186
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:16,667
- My colleague.
- We already met up.

187
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:17,868
We met up so fast.

188
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,838
- Hold on.
- We have a shot at winning.

189
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:22,438
Okay. We need to figure out who's driving.

190
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:23,978
Will Seon Ho be driving?

191
00:07:24,248 --> 00:07:25,577
You changed your hairstyle.

192
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,617
- My hairstyle?
- Yes.

193
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:27,647
I gave it a different vibe.

194
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,978
- It looks nice.
- You like it?

195
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:30,658
I'm trying to grow out my hair.

196
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:31,888
- Sae Ho.
- I see.

197
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:33,387
Are you driving?

198
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:34,988
No. Where are you?

199
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:37,558
If you're not driving, please hang up.

200
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:39,157
Sae Ho. Hold on.

201
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,597
- I'll call you right back.
- Do you want to hear my story?

202
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:41,897
- I'm getting a call.
- Sae Ho.

203
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:43,267
- Sae Ho.
- Okay.

204
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:45,028
- Is it DinDin?
- DinDin. Lim Cheol.

205
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,998
- Ask him.
- Hey, Cheol. Go ahead.

206
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:48,597
- Joon.
- Yes?

207
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:49,998
- Are you driving?
- Where are you?

208
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:51,767
I'm with Sae Ho right now.

209
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:53,678
- Are you driving?
- You're with Sae Ho?

210
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,577
- Yes. Are you driving?
- Where are you?

211
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:57,008
We're near the KBS annex.

212
00:07:57,548 --> 00:07:59,047
If you're driving, the three of us can team up.

213
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:00,117
- That will be neat.
- It will be over then.

214
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:02,248
It is neat. Okay. I won't answer any more calls.

215
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,917
I won't answer any more calls and head over there now.

216
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:04,987
- Okay.
- Really?

217
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:06,017
Meet us here.

218
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,087
Okay. Wait there. I'm heading out now.

219
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,158
- Okay.
- Okay.

220
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:11,257
My gosh. Go over there.

221
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,958
- But we can't trust him.
- Hold on.

222
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:16,227
Hold on. We can't be too naive...

223
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:18,228
- and trust him like this.
- Wait. Of course, not.

224
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:20,998
- Hey, DinDin.
- Hello.

225
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:23,068
- Where are you?
- Where are you?

226
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:25,667
How are you getting here? Are you driving the car now?

227
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:26,677
(The veteran's hunch is activated.)

228
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:28,778
Yes. I'm driving right now.

229
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:30,248
- Really?
- Yes.

230
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:31,708
What about you?

231
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:33,948
I'm not driving. I'm walking now.

232
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:36,078
- You're not driving?
- No.

233
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,017
So I have to gather the guys.

234
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:41,088
Right!

235
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,788
(Acting arrogant right away)

236
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:43,788
Jong Min.

237
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,787
Yes. I'm close to the opening spot.

238
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:46,868
(Acting servile right away)

239
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:48,528
- Jong Min.
- Yes.

240
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:50,098
Who do you want on our team?

241
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:52,028
- From what I've gathered, - Yes.

242
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:55,238
- Seon Ho isn't driving either.
- Okay.

243
00:08:55,738 --> 00:08:58,208
Sae Ho and Joon aren't driving either.

244
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,238
Se Yoon either. He just had a meal with me.

245
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:02,977
- Right now?
- Yes. We had a meal.

246
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:04,218
Then he went to use the toilet.

247
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,778
- Se Yoon?
- Right.

248
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:07,718
- Really?
- Yes.

249
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,088
- Okay. I got it.
- Jong Min.

250
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:11,748
- Cross the street now.
- Jong Min.

251
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,288
- What?
- What's going on?

252
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,317
- Who's that?
- Cross the street.

253
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:16,858
Where in Yeouido are you?

254
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:18,327
What?

255
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:19,627
(Se Yoon parked the car...)

256
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:21,898
(around the restaurant to find Jong Min.)

257
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:23,497
(He spots Jong Min who's on the phone.)

258
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:24,568
Jong Min.

259
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,768
Cross the street now.

260
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:28,338
- What?
- Cross the street.

261
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:30,438
Where in Yeouido are you?

262
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:33,508
- I don't know. Bye.
- What?

263
00:09:35,138 --> 00:09:36,437
(Ditching DinDin right away)

264
00:09:36,438 --> 00:09:38,508
Who's that? Who is that in the car?

265
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:41,748
Se Yoon.

266
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:44,418
Once the light changes to green, hurry and get in the car.

267
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:45,887
(The man in the pink overalls is indeed lucky.)

268
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:47,158
Gosh, it's my lucky day today.

269
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,488
Hey.

270
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,158
Should I send you my address?

271
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:52,458
Yes. We're in Yeouido. Send it to Jong Min.

272
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:54,297
You can't lie to me. I'm being serious.

273
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:55,997
My gosh, come on. Hurry.

274
00:09:55,998 --> 00:09:57,497
- Hang up. Send it to Jong Min.
- What?

275
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:58,997
- We just met up. Send it to him.
- Okay.

276
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,167
- What's going on? Who's that?
- Text him the address now.

277
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,637
- Okay.
- Text me what?

278
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:03,707
Text what?

279
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,044
You went to use the toilet. How come you showed up with a car?

280
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:07,854
I don't know. They gave me a car after I took a dump.

281
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:09,538
Seon Ho is somewhere around Mapo Bridge.

282
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,908
- Gwangheungchang Station?
- Yes.

283
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,718
- Exit Six.
- Punch that in now.

284
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:15,148
I think he's lying.

285
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:17,418
No. He's telling the truth. He's a bad liar.

286
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:19,788
But what's he doing there?

287
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,418
I guess he was doing something there.

288
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:22,918
Do what there?

289
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:25,188
- It takes ten minutes.
- Right.

290
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:27,928
A round trip will be 20 minutes. Then we'll lose.

291
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:29,627
We must hurry. You know that, right?

292
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,297
- How come he's not coming here?
- Call him.

293
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,868
Then interrogate him on our way there.

294
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:34,637
Yes. Tell him we won't go there...

295
00:10:34,638 --> 00:10:35,868
- if he sounds fishy.
- Okay.

296
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:39,238
Tell him not to get smart.

297
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:41,108
- Tell him we know all his tricks.
- Yes.

298
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:44,078
The person you called isn't available.

299
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:45,777
Please call another time.

300
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,817
- He fooled us.
- No. Maybe, it was a mistake.

301
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:49,347
(Why couldn't Seon Ho answer his phone?)

302
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,348
- You know?
- No way.

303
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,418
Let's wait for him.

304
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,588
- But he didn't tell us...
- We have to trust him.

305
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:57,528
But he didn't tell us how many minutes it'd take.

306
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,387
- Hey, Cheol.
- Hello.

307
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:00,427
- Hey.
- Hey.

308
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:01,528
- Sae Ho.
- Yes.

309
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:02,857
I'm on my way now.

310
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,698
How long will it take?

311
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:05,897
I will be there soon.

312
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,167
- Okay.
- "Soon" is...

313
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,367
an abstract concept.

314
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,937
- Give us your ETA.
- We're going to trust you only.

315
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:11,338
Put it in your GPS.

316
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:12,637
Tell us the number of minutes left.

317
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,607
That way, we can trust you.

318
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,378
- There's no reason to trust you.
- Joon.

319
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,878
- Joon.
- Yes?

320
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,177
I wouldn't ditch you.

321
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:21,877
It's today of all days.

322
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:23,488
Okay.

323
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,217
- DinDin.
- Okay. We'll stay here.

324
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,417
- DinDin went viral...
- All right.

325
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:27,858
After starring on "Workman."

326
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:29,518
He promised to be nice to me.

327
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:31,627
- Today, - So...

328
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:34,597
I'll be taking care of you from start to finish.

329
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:35,828
Come on. You know better.

330
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,197
- Wait for me there.
- Okay.

331
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,038
(They will trust DinDin and wait for him.)

332
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:43,567
Joon, weren't you going to eat breakfast?

333
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:44,637
Oh, right. Food.

334
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,337
- Gosh, what are you thinking?
- But the problem is...

335
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,037
You can't be thinking about breakfast right now.

336
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:49,607
I must have some food...

337
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,407
before I start filming the show. I can't have it any other way.

338
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,648
I must have breakfast and then film the opening segment.

339
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:56,378
That way, I can stay sane until 2pm before I starve to death.

340
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:57,918
- Hurry.
- Your breakfast is coming.

341
00:11:58,388 --> 00:11:59,388
Okay.

342
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:02,218
My breakfast is coming. It's here?

343
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,757
Well, this isn't the official opening segment.

344
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:05,927
He can eat now, right?

345
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:07,798
- Hold on. Thank you.
- Here you go.

346
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,504
- Seriously.
- Where will you eat that?

347
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,827
Sae Ho. Have some food.

348
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:11,828
(Eating on the street)

349
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:14,268
I'll tell Se Yoon to come to us.

350
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:16,168
- Sae Ho.
- Se Yoon.

351
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:18,808
- Where are you?
- I'm... Where are you?

352
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,378
- Call Jong Min.
- Okay.

353
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:25,307
- Sae Ho.
- Hey.

354
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:26,868
I'll get into a car while you eat here.

355
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:29,148
You should have some food too.

356
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:31,218
Hello?

357
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:32,788
- Joon.
- Yes?

358
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:35,387
Let me tell you about my goal today.

359
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,418
Okay.

360
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:39,027
It's making you stand out in this episode.

361
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:41,027
(It's making you stand out in this episode.)

362
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:44,128
So I'll be focusing on making you the star today.

363
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:45,268
Okay.

364
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:47,568
- Am I on speaker?
- Yes.

365
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:50,307
Just take me off speaker.

366
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:51,607
This is a personal conversation.

367
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:53,137
Hold on. You're off speaker.

368
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,507
(He suddenly wants to discuss a personal matter?)

369
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:55,978
Do you want to team up with Sae Ho?

370
00:12:56,178 --> 00:12:57,477
- Where are you right now?
- What?

371
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:58,908
Do you want to team up with Sae Ho?

372
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:01,748
- You're home? Come on.
- We're together right now.

373
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:04,287
Exactly. When I open the door,

374
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:06,448
run to my car and get in like James Bond.

375
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,788
(Is DinDin giving him a signal to betray Sae Ho?)

376
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:11,558
Is someone else in the car now?

377
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:15,298
- Where are you?
- Where are you now?

378
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,998
Where are you? I'm home right now.

379
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:18,527
You're home? Come on.

380
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:20,297
If you do that, we can't get anything done.

381
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:21,397
(Habitually lying)

382
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:22,837
Hey, what do you mean?

383
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,837
If you're with Se Yoon, take me with you.

384
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,168
Joon is eating next to me.

385
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,807
What? Where are you?

386
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,177
You know the chicken soup restaurant?

387
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:30,348
Around Eunseong Hoegwan?

388
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,448
- Oh, yes.
- I'm there.

389
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:35,648
Okay. Then don't get into someone else's car.

390
00:13:36,218 --> 00:13:38,647
You must get here first. Hurry up then.

391
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:40,888
- Okay. Eunseong Hoegwan?
- Yes, Eunseong Hoegwan.

392
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:42,558
- Okay. Wait there.
- Okay.

393
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:47,628
My gosh. You're so good at lying.

394
00:13:48,558 --> 00:13:51,328
Now that I saw you lie firsthand, you're such a good liar.

395
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,638
My gosh. Seriously.

396
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:56,467
I actually sensed sincerity in your tone right now.

397
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,607
(What a thrill that was!)

398
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,637
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

399
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,378
(Team Se Yoon is on their way to rescue Seon Ho.)

400
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:03,747
Gosh, this is exhausting.

401
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:04,777
(Meanwhile, Seon Ho is...)

402
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:07,418
(running for 20 minutes in tears.)

403
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,517
Over there. Exit Six.

404
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,687
(He's running to Exit 6 where he'll meet the guys.)

405
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:14,187
All right. I'll pick you up.

406
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,317
(DinDin keeps trying to persuade Joon.)

407
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:17,787
If you want to team up with someone else,

408
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:19,328
we'll pick him up. Then we'll win.

409
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:20,897
- Okay. Wait there.
- Okay.

410
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:22,657
(Sae Ho is done with his phone call.)

411
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:23,668
Hey.

412
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:25,128
(That personal call is taking a long time.)

413
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:27,898
(Studying Sae Ho)

414
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:31,637
(Yeouido is a hotbed of betrayals right now.)

415
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,037
- Well...
- What do you think?

416
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,307
We'll be a team for the whole day.

417
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,408
He's great.

418
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:37,178
Sae Ho is great.

419
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:39,928
What are you two doing right now?

420
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,408
Have you gone mad? Give that to me.

421
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:43,378
- Joon.
- What are you two talking about?

422
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:44,988
Joon. Listen.

423
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:47,358
- You're trying to ditch me, right?
- No.

424
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:48,557
What is it then?

425
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:49,558
Okay.

426
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,557
I'm 700m away right now.

427
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,587
Okay.

428
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:54,157
I'll turn on the emergency light...

429
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:56,028
- and open the door on the right.
- Okay.

430
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:57,897
- It's a van.
- What is it? Tell me.

431
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,027
I'll turn on the emergency light and open the door on the right.

432
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:00,127
Run and then get in.

433
00:15:00,128 --> 00:15:01,337
Let's think about...

434
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:03,137
whether to take Sae Ho or not while making a lap.

435
00:15:03,138 --> 00:15:04,168
Okay.

436
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:07,077
(Okay what?)

437
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:08,738
Darn it. Give it to me.

438
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:10,038
- Hold on.
- You two...

439
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,347
Hey. Why are you two plotting?

440
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:13,718
- No.
- Wait there.

441
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:15,347
Why are you two plotting?

442
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,317
We didn't plot anything, Sae Ho. That's not it.

443
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:18,687
Why are you making a personal call?

444
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:19,947
I'm right here too.

445
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:22,717
No. That's not it. I felt bad for Joon about something.

446
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:24,557
Talk about that later. We're waiting for you.

447
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:26,528
Where are you? You're coming alone, right?

448
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:27,927
No.

449
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:28,928
(Don't tell me you've got company.)

450
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,767
Gosh, don't doubt me.

451
00:15:30,768 --> 00:15:32,627
You're making me doubt. You wanted to talk to Joon...

452
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:33,997
about something personal when I'm right here.

453
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:35,268
- Sae Ho.
- He's...

454
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:37,338
He's right there.

455
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,868
Could you put Joon on the phone?

456
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:41,777
- I need to talk to him...
- I'll put you on speaker.

457
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:43,108
About something personal.

458
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:44,478
Hello?

459
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,878
- Joon.
- What?

460
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,377
- Where's your phone?
- I have it.

461
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:50,278
Hey, Sae Ho ditched me.

462
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:52,317
- Joon, get ready.
- Hey.

463
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,018
- Hey.
- Where's your phone?

464
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,357
Hey, Sae Ho ditched me.

465
00:15:57,358 --> 00:16:00,527
(At last, )

466
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:02,398
(DinDin's car has arrived.)

467
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,767
Hello.

468
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:05,298
- Hello.
- Hey.

469
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:08,197
- Where are you?
- Eunseong Hoegwan.

470
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:09,237
- Okay.
- Can you see me?

471
00:16:09,238 --> 00:16:10,568
We're making a turn.

472
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:12,837
- Where?
- We're making a turn.

473
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:13,838
Where?

474
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,107
(He mistakes DinDin's car for Jong Min's car.)

475
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,078
Okay. I should ditch Joon.

476
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:19,878
- Who?
- Where are you right now?

477
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:21,777
- What?
- Roll down the window.

478
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:22,878
What's the plate number?

479
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:24,848
What are you talking about?

480
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:26,288
Let me get in.

481
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:29,458
- You want me to hit you?
- No, let me get in.

482
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:31,558
Okay. We're making a turn now.

483
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,457
Joon, do you see the car...

484
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,198
Sae Ho is waving at?

485
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:37,628
- Yes.
- That's my car.

486
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:41,068
- I'll make a turn now.
- Hold on.

487
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,197
(5 seconds before the unexpected battle for the car)

488
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:44,608
(Sensing an ominous hunch)

489
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:49,907
Come now.

490
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,748
You're making a turn? Who else is in your car?

491
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:53,748
In my car?

492
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:55,518
It's DinDin and me.

493
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,218
It's DinDin and me.

494
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:58,748
- DinDin?
- Yes.

495
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:03,588
- It's DinDin and me.
- DinDin?

496
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,107
(Joon charges toward the car.)

497
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:07,568
- DinDin?
- Yes.

498
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,128
- It's DinDin and me.
- Come now.

499
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:12,268
- DinDin?
- Yes.

500
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,539
(Joon charges toward the car.)

501
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,909
You... What a piece of trash you are.

502
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,578
You're a piece of trash.

503
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,279
(That was close.)

504
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,919
- Why was it locked?
- You're a piece of trash.

505
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,378
(Laughing)

506
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:30,089
- Why was it locked?
- Gosh. Hey.

507
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,388
- Let's go.
- Wait.

508
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:32,389
Joon. Darn you.

509
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,388
(Sae Ho almost got ditched.)

510
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:35,618
- You know what? Wait.
- What?

511
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,028
- Why couldn't I open it?
- Hey.

512
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:38,288
Why was it locked?

513
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:39,459
- You...
- The door...

514
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:42,228
- Why...
- Sae Ho. Listen.

515
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:43,298
- You...
- Hear me out.

516
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,269
- What were you two plotting?
- Hear me out.

517
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:46,998
It didn't look like you knew it was me.

518
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,239
You were waving at me while thinking I was someone else.

519
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:50,938
- I...
- You thought I was someone else.

520
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:52,268
No. That's not it.

521
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:54,538
- Jong Min said he was with you.
- Really?

522
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,578
- Why did you try to ditch me?
- It's not that.

523
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:57,748
Okay. Go ahead.

524
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:59,778
Right now, I'm grateful to Joon...

525
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,579
- and feel like I owe him.
- Okay.

526
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,318
I told him that I would make him the star of the show today.

527
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,559
- Yes.
- I said I'd work for him today.

528
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,828
- Gosh. This isn't my car.
- You...

529
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,359
I didn't know how to open the door.

530
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:12,798
You hurt my feelings.

531
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,799
Did you see my posture and gestures earlier?

532
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:18,999
- He was super fast.
- My gosh.

533
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,869
It looked like our car.

534
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:23,115
But it didn't look like it was Jong Min's car.

535
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:24,909
Sae Ho was super fast.

536
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:28,179
- It was such a funny scene.
- Yes.

537
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:30,308
- You're lucky I got in the car.
- Why?

538
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,108
Jong Min was two minutes away.

539
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:34,519
- Two minutes?
- He was two minutes away.

540
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:36,188
- Is he driving?
- Yes.

541
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:38,229
Actually, he might not be. He avoided answering me.

542
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:39,588
That would've been awful.

543
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:41,289
We almost got fooled.

544
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,489
We'll be there after we make a left turn.

545
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:45,999
- There he is.
- Where? Is he there?

546
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,259
He's over there.

547
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:49,269
- Where?
- He's waving at us.

548
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,798
Sae Ho is calling me.

549
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,068
(What crazy timing!)

550
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:53,299
Tell him we'll be there soon.

551
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,945
- Hello?
- Why aren't you here already?

552
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,239
I'll be there soon.

553
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,338
How much longer must I wait here?

554
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,309
Just a bit longer. I'm making a U-turn now.

555
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:04,708
Really? My gosh. I'm waiting too long.

556
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:07,119
A cop caught me while making a U-turn.

557
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,488
He's giving me a ticket. I'll be there soon.

558
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:11,419
- A ticket?
- That's a total lie.

559
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,288
Have fun folding the ticket then.

560
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,809
(Did you fall for that again, Sae Ho?)

561
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,799
It would've been really bad if you didn't let me get in.

562
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,529
(Team Se Yoon will set out right after picking up Seon Ho.)

563
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:25,629
You're getting a ticket. A ticket? My gosh.

564
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,169
- You were telling the truth.
- I told you.

565
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,739
- Get in fast.
- Okay.

566
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,308
We're late because of you.

567
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:34,208
- Why is it my fault?
- Because we were picking you up.

568
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:35,639
Why were you so far away?

569
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,408
- Let's go. Where should we go?
- Let's go.

570
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,878
I'm grateful to you.

571
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,618
- You believed me.
- Yes, we did.

572
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:42,789
- We're off to a great start.
- Nice.

573
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:44,619
Let's play as a team today.

574
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,918
Yes. This is a good team.

575
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,688
We should've taken that path. It's this one.

576
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:48,689
Wait, no.

577
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:49,689
(The teams were formed 3 minutes apart.)

578
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,758
(Which team will come out victorious of the sudden mission?)

579
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,559
- Let's get out. I bet we won.
- Okay.

580
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,699
- There's no way we lost.
- There's no way.

581
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:57,699
Hello, everyone.

582
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,239
- Hello.
- Hello.

583
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,345
When I look at the bridge, I feel like a monster might emerge.

584
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,089
- Yes.
- A monster might be dangling there.

585
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:08,038
Hey, we won.

586
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,108
There's no way we lost. We met up super fast.

587
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,548
(Checking that there's no one around the flag)

588
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:12,679
No one is there.

589
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:15,078
We won.

590
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,248
(Team Se Yoon runs while being sure of their victory)

591
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,769
The flag is still there. Let's get it.

592
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,519
First of all, the other members aren't here.

593
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,929
Only 1 of the 3 will win.

594
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,998
(Running at full speed)

595
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,029
Come on.

596
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,298
Hello.

597
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,268
(2 Days 1 Night)

598
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,269
Hello.

599
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,498
(Jong Min, Se Yoon, and Seon Ho arrive.)

600
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,669
I drove them here.

601
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:36,669
I drove them here.

602
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,109
I drove fast, but safely.

603
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:43,448
(Jong Min spots someone.)

604
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:44,479
What?

605
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,879
- I drove them here.
- They're clueless.

606
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:48,648
I drove fast, but safely.

607
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,149
You gave us away.

608
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:51,518
- They spotted the cameraman.
- What?

609
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,658
- What?
- Come on.

610
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:53,989
Hyun Jin gave you away.

611
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:56,189
- It's over?
- Come on.

612
00:20:57,259 --> 00:20:58,288
Come on.

613
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:03,399
(Team DinDin arrived before them?)

614
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:06,099
They're not here. I think we got here before them.

615
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:07,938
Sae Ho, we got here so fast.

616
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:10,508
As soon as I got the car, I drove straight to Joon.

617
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:11,639
- Really?
- Yes.

618
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:13,938
It's impossible for us to lose.

619
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,009
Wait.

620
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,048
- Sir.
- Where's the wharf?

621
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,049
It's this way.

622
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:19,918
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

623
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,639
(After checking the location one more time)

624
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:22,918
- All right.
- Hello.

625
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,518
(They arrive at the Yeouido Wharf.)

626
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,619
Welcome.

627
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:28,319
- That was easy.
- Hello.

628
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:29,989
- Hello.
- It was easy.

629
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,429
This is excellent.

630
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:34,159
No one is here.

631
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:36,098
- Should we hide?
- Go ahead.

632
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,369
- Let's hide.
- Okay.

633
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,338
We can stay behind there.

634
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,369
Okay.

635
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:41,638
(Calmly hiding and watching Team Se Yoon run towards them)

636
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:43,569
They're running. They're coming, aren't they?

637
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:44,709
They keep running.

638
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,779
What?

639
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:50,349
(Team Se Yoon's 3-minute reign ended in vain)

640
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,548
Jong Min.

641
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,619
- His outfit...
- Why are you dressed like that?

642
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,019
Why are you dressed like that?

643
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:57,088
- Your outfit...
- Was it a penalty?

644
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,348
- That's nice.
- Was it a penalty?

645
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:00,189
- What's this, Sae Ho?
- It wasn't a penalty.

646
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:01,458
Did you get a hair penalty?

647
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,335
- Are you wearing a wig?
- No, I got a new hairstyle.

648
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,959
Sae Ho, did you go to a hair salon?

649
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,698
- I don't go to hair salons.
- Of course he didn't.

650
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:09,258
- Why don't you go there?
- Even if I grow my hair,

651
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,328
that's none of your business.

652
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,329
- But your hair...
- I'm sorry.

653
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,999
When someone gets a haircut, you should say something nice.

654
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,338
What did you say? Am I wearing a wig?

655
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:19,638
- Give me a lighter to burn this.
- Why would you need a lighter?

656
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,808
- It's popping out.
- It's part of my outfit.

657
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:24,009
- No, it's not.
- This is my fashion style.

658
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,248
Ladies will be frustrated by it throughout the show.

659
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:28,178
They'll think, "Gosh, that needs to be burned."

660
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:29,348
Whether I burn it or cut it,

661
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,888
- leave it to me.
- Goodness.

662
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:32,858
Go away. Why do you keep touching me?

663
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,288
Sae Ho, is there something in your backpack?

664
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:36,059
What's that got to do with you?

665
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:38,388
- Why do you want to know?
- What's in your backpack?

666
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:40,058
There's nothing special in it.

667
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,259
Then why are you wearing it?

668
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,099
Whether I have a backpack or not...

669
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,098
Are you carrying Hong Man in your backpack?

670
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,899
Hong Man can't fit in this.

671
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:49,868
Stop touching me. Why do you keep touching me?

672
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,038
- It's just...
- By the way,

673
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,368
why are you so upset?

674
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:54,338
Let me live my life.

675
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,348
- Okay.
- He seems very angry today.

676
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:58,178
I'm worried about elder ladies being frustrated.

677
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,349
Can you put it properly on my arm?

678
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,518
(He takes out his anger on Joon.)

679
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,948
- So what happened?
- All right.

680
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:05,988
Why did Se Yoon...

681
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:07,458
drive? I thought that he was eating.

682
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:08,988
- Didn't Seon Ho drive?
- Let me explain.

683
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:10,588
- No.
- We bumped into each other...

684
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,958
at a kimchi stew restaurant that we go often.

685
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,129
After eating,

686
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,479
Jong Min went to the restroom at the restaurant to brush his teeth.

687
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,028
I went to the restroom at KBS...

688
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:20,538
- to poop.
- Okay.

689
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:21,669
While I was pooping,

690
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:23,838
they said, "You must stop what you're doing."

691
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,008
(While pooping, he received a text from Director Joo...)

692
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,138
(telling him not to move.)

693
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:27,208
They told me to stay still.

694
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:28,339
I said, "Come and wipe me."

695
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,148
I need to be wiped before moving.

696
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:31,209
Suddenly,

697
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,649
someone called me at the door.

698
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,319
"You can't do anything now. Please come out."

699
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:37,648
- I said, "I need to be wiped."
- At the restroom door?

700
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,949
Yes, at the restroom.

701
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:41,118
He came into the restroom to tell me to come out.

702
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,635
I insisted, "I can only come out if you wipe me."

703
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,429
He said, "Come out after wiping yourself."

704
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:46,705
When I wiped myself and came out, he put a microphone on me.

705
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:48,528
He said, "Take two people with you."

706
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,568
When I asked if I should walk, he told me that there was a car.

707
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:53,339
- So I took the car with me.
- I have a question.

708
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:56,038
Why was Seon Ho in Mapo?

709
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,708
- Right.
- Why were you at Gwangheungchang?

710
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:00,179
My shoot ended late last night.

711
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,478
My manager suddenly said, "Since we worked late yesterday,"

712
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:04,849
"let's eat something simple instead of kimchi stew."

713
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:06,048
- But...
- Why were you...

714
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,348
- in Gwangheungchang?
- Why were you in Gwangheungchang?

715
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:09,248
Gwangheungchang isn't on your way here.

716
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:10,888
- Right.
- I found it strange.

717
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:12,809
- Why were you there?
- I also found it strange.

718
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,059
His manager is going out with one of our writers.

719
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:18,489
It's easy to recognize.

720
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:19,928
If not, it doesn't make sense.

721
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:21,828
- Something is fishy, isn't it?
- That's scary.

722
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:25,098
"Honey, can you come over to Gwangheungchang?"

723
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,298
I'm sure that's what happened.

724
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,338
Who is it?

725
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:28,938
- Is it you?
- Who's the one?

726
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:29,968
Who is it?

727
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,338
- Who is it?
- Who could it be?

728
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,508
Someone is definitely going out with him. Why would he stop...

729
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:34,079
- at Gwangheungchang?
- That's funny.

730
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,108
- What I did was...
- Why did you lie so much?

731
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,178
I didn't lie.

732
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:38,708
- Who lied first?
- You said that you were shooting...

733
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:39,818
- in Saipan.
- When you called me,

734
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:40,918
I told you that I was at home.

735
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,488
- You said that you just got home.
- Oh, come on.

736
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:44,818
- How did you two meet...
- Do you know what he told me?

737
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,118
For making a U-turn,

738
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,689
he was getting a ticket from the police.

739
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:52,528
Seriously?

740
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,529
No one would give him a ticket in that outfit.

741
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,368
You look so cute in your outfit today.

742
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,638
- Of course.
- When he was lying,

743
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:02,038
he was more sincere than usual. I was very surprised.

744
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,869
As soon as I got the car in Banpo...

745
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:06,508
Were you really in Banpo?

746
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:08,708
Yes, so I called Joon.

747
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:10,978
He said that he was with Sae Ho. When I went there,

748
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:13,019
Sae Ho got in the car. That's how we came together.

749
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:15,148
I almost didn't make it here.

750
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:16,919
- How?
- Suddenly, DinDin told me...

751
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,288
that he wanted to talk to Joon in private.

752
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:22,559
When a car arrived, Joon ran up to it and opened the door.

753
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,828
- But he couldn't open it.
- I couldn't get...

754
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:26,558
- the car door to open.
- He couldn't open the door.

755
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,558
Sae Ho opened it by force.

756
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,299
I yelled at him to come out and got in.

757
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,099
That's impressive.

758
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,669
- What's going on today?
- All right, everyone.

759
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,998
You were given a sudden mission after a long time.

760
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:37,369
Didn't it make your heart race?

761
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:38,568
- It was insane.
- I was flustered.

762
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:40,455
- It was really sudden.
- As they arrived first,

763
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:42,439
Sae Ho, Joon, and DinDin...

764
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:43,909
What's the benefit?

765
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,649
(What will be the benefit?)

766
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,748
We'll give you a big round of applause and cheers.

767
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:51,749
- Yes.
- All right.

768
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:53,118
(The difference in two team's reaction is clear.)

769
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,189
Please clap.

770
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:55,959
- Yes.
- All right.

771
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,989
(A round of applause and cheers for Team DinDin)

772
00:25:58,689 --> 00:25:59,729
Clap for them.

773
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,528
What? That's all?

774
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:03,299
(We'll also play background music for you.)

775
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:04,629
(Dance for now.)

776
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,769
Give me back my hamburger.

777
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:08,238
(Burning with anger)

778
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,939
Give me back my hamburger.

779
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,638
What about my hamburger that I couldn't finish?

780
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:13,639
(Cheering more loudly)

781
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,439
Smile, DinDin.

782
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,748
- And jubilations - Goodness.

783
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:18,778
Here you go.

784
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,549
(He forces himself to show his front teeth.)

785
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:23,149
Awesome.

786
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:25,418
Yes, nice.

787
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,988
- This is...
- Is this all?

788
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:28,258
- But this is...
- I'd be happy to clap anytime.

789
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,388
Obviously, applause and cheers keep us going...

790
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:31,889
- in our line of work.
- Yes.

791
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:34,158
Thank you for your generosity.

792
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,228
(This is a bit upsetting.)

793
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:38,168
The previous mission was to determine the teams.

794
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:41,299
For the first time in a while, we made it dramatic from the start.

795
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,169
You were in the same car earlier.

796
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:45,508
DinDin, Sae Ho, and Joon are...

797
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:46,638
- one team.
- Okay.

798
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,738
- That's good.
- Seon Ho, Jong Min, and Se Yoon...

799
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:50,708
make another team. You'll be traveling together.

800
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,909
- Today?
- Yes.

801
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:54,319
Today's travel destination is...

802
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,648
History and culture.

803
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,348
(History and culture)

804
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:00,758
Shopping, entertainment, and transportation.

805
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,459
(Shopping, entertainment, transportation)

806
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,058
And gastronomy.

807
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,958
(And gastronomy that can't be excluded)

808
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,598
It's the perfect...

809
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,298
domestic travel destination.

810
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:11,968
(The perfect domestic travel destination)

811
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:13,138
It's Seoul Metropolitan City.

812
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:14,468
(Today's travel destination, Seoul Metropolitan City)

813
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:15,798
- I can't believe it.
- Seoul?

814
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,238
- I can't believe it.
- Are we traveling in Seoul?

815
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:19,538
- Seoul Metropolitan City?
- It's unbelievable.

816
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,078
Was everyone born in Seoul?

817
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,508
- Isn't everyone from Seoul?
- Was everyone born in Seoul?

818
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:24,579
- Joon, were you born in Seoul?
- In Jongno 3-ga.

819
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:26,108
- Jongno 3-ga?
- Jongno 3-ga?

820
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:27,849
- You're from downtown Seoul.
- Exactly.

821
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,418
DinDin is from Dongbu Ichon-dong.

822
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,088
Dongbu Ichon-dong is over there.

823
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:32,719
- He was born there.
- Really?

824
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:34,569
Sae Ho, where were you born? In Guatemala?

825
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:37,529
Guatemala? What is he saying?

826
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,759
I'm from Gangseo-gu.

827
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:43,869
I lived in Japan for a while and came back to Korea.

828
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:45,575
Then I lived in Hwagok-dong for a long time.

829
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,899
Hwagok-dong in Gangseo-gu.

830
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,999
Are you Japanese?

831
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:51,509
No, I'm not.

832
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:54,008
- I'm not Japanese.
- He could be Japanese.

833
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:57,349
I went to live in Japan when I was five.

834
00:27:57,949 --> 00:27:59,879
- I came back when I was eight.
- Is that so?

835
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:01,219
- Thank you.
- Yes.

836
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,778
To which country does Dok Island belong?

837
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:04,419
It belongs to Korea.

838
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,349
What is he saying? Is he out of his mind?

839
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:09,789
(Singing "Dok Island Is Our Land" automatically)

840
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:11,628
(A lonely island)

841
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:13,259
(Home to the birds)

842
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,298
You're moving back.

843
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,905
(No matter who insists, that it's their land)

844
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,628
(It's confirmed that he's Korean.)

845
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:19,629
(It's our land)

846
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,199
Anyway, what are we doing today?

847
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,699
- All right.
- Why are we here?

848
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:25,539
- And so...
- Hurry up.

849
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:28,008
(This time, he takes out his anger on Director Joo.)

850
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,478
It's where you were born and raised.

851
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,848
You will introduce familiar yet special places...

852
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,418
in Seoul to the viewers.

853
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,348
- Really?
- That's what you'll do today.

854
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:36,518
I'm so curious about Seoul.

855
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,519
The theme for our trip today is...

856
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:41,418
One Night Ribbon Trip in Seoul.

857
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,758
- "One Night Ribbon?"
- "One Night Ribbon."

858
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,359
- Like the Blue Ribbon?
- Yes.

859
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:45,928
One Night Ribbon Trip in Seoul.

860
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:47,028
Yes.

861
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:48,199
What's that?

862
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:50,228
Doesn't it mean that we'll visit popular restaurants?

863
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,675
- Are we giving them ribbons?
- We're going to tasty restaurants?

864
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:53,868
You'll visit...

865
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,868
not only popular restaurants but also special spots.

866
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:56,939
We will?

867
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,368
They're recommended by our members.

868
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:00,878
(Visiting popular restaurants and tourist attractions in Seoul)

869
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:03,209
They're carefully selected from Seoul's top attractions...

870
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,278
for the One Night Ribbon Trip in Seoul.

871
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,779
(1 Night Ribbon Trip in Seoul)

872
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:09,678
The first destination is...

873
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,188
Seongsu-dong, a popular place among the MZers.

874
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:13,658
- Okay.
- Seongsu-dong.

875
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,058
We'll go there right away.

876
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,529
- Okay.
- Which way should we go?

877
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:18,259
It's this way.

(It seems familiar to everyone, )

884
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:38,409
(but the city always reveals different charms.)

885
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:41,749
(We came to bring tension to laid-back Seoul.)

886
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:45,599
(One surprise after another throughout the day)

887
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:50,089
(Hasn't it been a long time since you took a trip like this?)

888
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,199

Sir, this place is called Seongsu-dong.

00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,759
- You don't know it, do you?
- I do.

900
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:21,458
Gosh, I smell bread.

901
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:22,888
- Hey.
- The bread smells nice.

902
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:24,988
This is the cafe street in Seongsu-dong.

903
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,288
- I...
- Really?

904
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:27,558
Can you explain to us adults?

905
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,098
I lived in Seongsu-dong...

906
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:31,598
from 2016 to 2024.

907
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,029
- Really?
- Why did you live here?

908
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:34,468
My company was over here.

909
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:35,668
What do you mean by your question?

910
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,568
What was your purpose of living here?

911
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,169
Things have changed a lot here.

912

913
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,208
the whole street on the left is...

914
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:44,848
- Should we turn right?
- Seongsu-dong is very popular.

915
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:47,319
- This place is insane.
- Goodness.

916
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,178
- There's a pizza restaurant.
- Where are we going?

917
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:50,548
- Where are we going?
- It's a pizza restaurant.

918
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:51,589
What's this?

919
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,389
The street has a nice vibe.

920
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,889
- It's beautiful.
- It looks amazing.

921

Hello.

(They exclaim as soon as they enter.)

929

- I love egg tarts.
- Thank you.

930
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,908
Let me see them.

931
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:13,779

Can we pick what we want?

937
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:28,258
- Yes.
- My goodness.

938
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:31,059
- Each team may pick what they want.
- Seriously?

939
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,598
- What's this place?
- It's crazy. This one is good.

940
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,498
- Can we really pick what we want?
- Up to a certain amount.

941
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:37,698
Can I have one of these?

942
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:39,269
Pick one. It looks good.

943
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:41,538
Let's pick a few and share them.

944
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:43,039
Do we get to eat what we pick?

945
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,468
(His hand moves automatically despite his concern.)

946
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:47,679
- It looks so delicious.
- The fig looks good.

947
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,539
I want the chocolate bread.

948
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,178
How do I...

949
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,248
There's cake.

950
00:31:52,249 --> 00:31:53,678
- What about this one, DinDin?
- Joon, you have to put...

951
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,518
- everything in one tray.
- What about this one?

952
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,648
- Only on 1 tray?
- Put everything on 1 tray.

953
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,249
- One per team.
- I see.

954
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,988
Look at the strawberries.

955
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:04,088
Let's get this one.

956
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,388
You want that? Okay.

957
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:06,628
(They can't resist being greedy in front of desserts.)

958
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:07,799
Can we eat them all?

959
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:09,529
Of course. How about this?

960
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:11,868
- Which one do you want?
- Shall we get this and go light?

961
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:13,798
- I'm happy with anything.
- Okay.

962
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:17,708
At this bakery, when you scan your bread over there,

963
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:19,038
- the price comes up.
- Really?

964
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,608
- You can scan them over there.
- Over here?

965
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,008
What? When I show the bread, does the price come up?

966
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,878
- Seriously?
- The price comes up when you put...

967
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:26,578
- the bread to the machine?
- Does this work too?

968
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:27,579
How is that possible?

969
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,978
Can I put this much bread all at once?

970
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:30,418
- Yes.
- No way.

971
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:31,488
- Really?
- That's perfect.

972
00:32:31,489 --> 00:32:33,688
Come on, I've been to Seongsu-dong.

973
00:32:33,689 --> 00:32:34,689
That's crazy. Really?

974
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,488
Is Seon Ho the only one who's been to Seongsu-dong?

975
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:37,529
I've been here too.

976
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,729
(Everything is scanned.)

977
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:46,769
(Unbelievable)

978
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,419
(When you press the scan button after choosing the type, )

979
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,569
(the total is calculated automatically.)

980
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,478
- Does it really work?
- Oh, my.

981
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:55,039
- Sae Ho.
- This is amazing.

982
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:57,378
- It doesn't recognize the type.
- This is incredible.

983
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:59,048
I got goosebumps. This is insane.

984
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:01,419
The work of bread is called Kim Jong Min's Greed.

985
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,118
Did you choose the name of your team?

986
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,888
- We didn't choose...
- We...

987
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:07,458
our team name carelessly.

988
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:10,188
- We took a long time to think.
- We came up with a name...

989
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,028
- that mingles with the world.
- What?

990
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:14,328
It's a name that you'd find in Seongsu-dong.

991
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:17,868
- Exactly.
- We chose a trendy name.

992
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:20,538
- "Lim" from Lim Cheol.
- "Joon" from Lee Joon.

993
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:22,598
"Ho" from Sae Ho.

994
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:25,269
- So our team name is...
- Hello, we're Lim Joon Ho.

995
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:28,308
You'd find the name on the cafe street in Seongsu-dong.

996
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:30,078
- Hello, we're Lim Joon Ho.
- That brings down the mood.

997
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,849
- Go ahead. What's yours?
- What's yours?

998
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:33,748
(Giving a sign to Jong Min)

999
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:35,618
I'm the old generation on 2 Days 1 Night.

1000
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:37,018
I'm the new generation on 2 Days 1 Night.

1001
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,388
You would make a great team.

1002
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:40,158
- I like new and old.
- I like new and old.

1003
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,789
I like it

1004
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,558
(Do you know how desserts taste?)

1005
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,028
- I like it - I like it

1006
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:47,398
(Frigid)

1007
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,159
That's why people don't watch TV these days.

1008
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,968
They're saying, "I like new and old."

1009
00:33:51,969 --> 00:33:54,098
It's okay even if only old people watch it.

1010
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:58,438
They're Team New and Old Love. We're Team Lim Joon Ho.

1011
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:02,078
Okay, I told you that this is One Night Ribbon Trip in Seoul.

1012
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,138
- Yes.
- Yes.

1013
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:06,749
The mission at a dessert attraction in Seongsu-dong is...

1014
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:09,149
Quiz Show, Seoul, Seoul, Seoul.

1015
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,549
(Seoul)

1016
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:16,519
(The beautiful street in Seoul)

1017
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,858
- Seoul, Seoul, Seoul.
- Yes.

1018
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:19,959
(I like Seoul.)

1019
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,758
We'll give you ten questions related to Seoul.

1020
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:23,828
Oh, come on.

1021
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:26,328
The team to answer more questions will be given...

1022
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:29,068
desserts and beverages that you ordered.

1023
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:31,838
If we lose, we can't eat anything?

1024
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,268
Don't you want to taste it?

1025
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:34,809
- Yes.
- In that case...

1026
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:36,138
Shall we eat one?

1027
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,778
(Anticipating)

1028
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:40,149
One winner of rock-paper-scissors from each team.

1029
00:34:40,249 --> 00:34:42,018
You get to taste the dessert...

1030
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,539
- from a popular place in Seongsu.
- One person from each team?

1031
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:47,019
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1032
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:50,158
(Quickly getting ready to taste)

1033
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,605
I'm bad at playing rock-paper-scissors today.

1034
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:53,899
The salt bread is its signature bread. I want to try it.

1035
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,498
Take a big bite.

1036
00:34:56,499 --> 00:34:58,169
I really want some.

1037
00:34:58,769 --> 00:34:59,829
You only get one bite.

1038
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,638
The round bread looks good. Is it made with milk?

1039
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,959
(I'll definitely taste some too.)

1040
00:35:04,209 --> 00:35:06,768
It has to fit in your mouth. If not,

1041
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:07,839
you'll pay for it.

1042
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:11,779
That's none of your business, mister.

1043
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:13,818
It has to fit in your mouth.

1044
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:15,739
- It looks delicious.
- Or I'll be disappointed.

1045
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:18,218
- Eat the middle.
- Look what's inside.

1046
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,619
DinDin, eat the middle.

1047
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:21,389
Hurry up and eat it.

1048
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,058
Eat the center.

1049
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,929
He's eating the main part.

1050
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,688
Look at the big grains of salt.

1051
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:27,798
It'll get stuck in his front teeth.

1052
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:28,998
(Stuffing into his small mouth)

1053
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:30,059
He has a small mouth.

1054
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,228
- It's really good.
- Is it good?

1055
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:34,539
(A taste that everyone knows)

1056
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:35,838
- Okay.
- All right.

1057
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:36,868
(I can't resist it.)

1058
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:39,229
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1059
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:40,908
(Se Yoon fails.)

1060
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:41,979
What happened?

1061
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:43,908
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1062
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,009
(Jong Min gets to taste it.)

1063
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:47,379
I'll try this.

1064
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,448
Goodness, the strawberry looks good.

1065
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:52,289
- I picked the strawberry one.
- Leave me alone.

1066
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:53,619
(His strawberry gets taken away in front of his eyes.)

1067
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,689
Oh, my.

1068
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,719
There are three layers.

1069
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,788
What is he doing? It's mine.

1070
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,428
(He gets greedy and takes a big bite.)

1071
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:02,559
He took two bites.

1072
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,169
(One bite)

1073
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:07,098
He took two bites.

1074
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:08,198
He took two bites.

1075
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,279
(Two bites aren't allowed.)

1076
00:36:09,669 --> 00:36:12,368
(Punishing him immediately)

1077
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:13,438
You ate twice.

1078
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:16,278
He picked eight of them but ate what I picked.

1079
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:17,309
(Upset)

1080
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,308
- It's really good.
- Didn't I make a good choice?

1081
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:22,479
Everyone, this is Quiz Show, Seoul, Seoul, Seoul.

1082
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:25,249
- Seoul - Seoul

1083
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,619
(Seoul)

1084
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:29,195
(A shoot in Seoul is exciting just by hearing its name.)

1085
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:30,428
This is good.

1086
00:36:30,429 --> 00:36:32,189
Here's your first question.

1087
00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:34,999
It's a question about mountains in Seoul.

1088
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:36,658
I know a lot of them.

1089
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:38,168
It's a question about mountains.

1090
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:40,598
In Seoul, you can see mountains everywhere.

1091
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,568
It's one of the cities with many mountains.

1092
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:45,909
(About 26 mountains are located in the districts of downtown Seoul.)

1093
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:48,778
(Including mountains frequently visited by residents, )

1094
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:51,949
(the total exceeds 40 to 50.)

1095
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:53,739
Which mountain is the highest in Seoul?

1096
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,119
- Mount Bukhan.
- It's Mount Bukhan.

1097
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,788
- Then which mountain is...
- The lowest?

1098
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:00,148
The second highest?

1099
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:01,159
- DinDin.
- Me.

1100
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,188
- Lim Seon Ho.
- Lim Joon Ho.

1101
00:37:03,189 --> 00:37:05,059
- "Lim Seon Ho?"
- Mount Gwanak.

1102
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:06,999
That's wrong.

1103
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:08,358
- Wrong.
- New and Old Love.

1104
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,159
- It's Mount Yongma.
- One.

1105
00:37:10,669 --> 00:37:12,198
- Wrong.
- It can't be Mount Yongma.

1106
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,199
Lim Joon Ho.

1107
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,139
- Three, two...
- Mount Eungbong.

1108
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:18,409
Wrong.

1109
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:20,508
- Isn't it Mount Bukhan?
- Jong Min.

1110
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:21,708
He already said that.

1111
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,008
- It's the highest mountain.
- Yes.

1112
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:24,278
(Mount Bukhan is the highest mountain.)

1113
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:26,448
(The second highest mountain?)

1114
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:27,825
- New and Old Love.
- New and Old Love.

1115
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:28,948
- New and Old Love.
- Just give it a shot.

1116
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:29,949
Mount Dobong.

1117
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,988
- Mount Dobong?
- It must be correct.

1118
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:33,827
(His eyes are quivering.)

1119
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:35,554
- Mount Dobong?
- It must be correct.

1120
00:37:36,402 --> 00:37:37,472
- Correct.
- It's right.

1121
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:40,072
Is it Mount Dobong?

1122
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:41,741
Jong Min lives in Banghak-dong.

1123
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:43,481
It's in Dobong-gu. Isn't that right?

1124
00:37:43,482 --> 00:37:45,911
- You live in Banghak-dong.
- You can see Mount Dobong.

1125
00:37:45,912 --> 00:37:47,212
- Mount Dobong.
- All right.

1126
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,822
- What happened?
- Did you see that?

1127
00:37:49,182 --> 00:37:50,702
- I knew it.
- I'm an expert of Seoul.

1128
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:52,991
- The highest mountain is...
- Mount Bukhan.

1129
00:37:52,992 --> 00:37:54,321
Mount Bukhan? I see.

1130
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:57,222
As a reference, Mount Bukhan is 837m.

1131
00:37:57,622 --> 00:38:00,231
Mount Dobong is 740m.

1132
00:38:00,232 --> 00:38:01,361
Gosh, I see.

1133
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,931
Do you know which is the third highest?

1134
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:04,001
- The third highest.
- Mount Yongma?

1135
00:38:04,002 --> 00:38:05,002
- Mount Gwanak?
- Mount Acha.

1136
00:38:05,003 --> 00:38:07,332
- Mount Surak.
- The third highest is Mount Surak.

1137
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:09,401
(He's also surprised.)

1138
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:11,942
- You know well.
- You know a lot about mountains.

1139
00:38:12,272 --> 00:38:13,911
- You know a lot about mountains.
- Mount Dobong...

1140
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:15,681
Mount Bukhan and Mount Dobong are close to each other.

1141
00:38:15,682 --> 00:38:18,012
There's Mount Surak next to them.

1142
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,511
- They're connected in a range.
- Yes, exactly.

1143
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:22,628
- You know because you live there.
- Yes, I know about them.

1144
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:24,281
- All right, everyone.
- The question wasn't easy.

1145
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:25,352
Here's the next question.

1146
00:38:25,552 --> 00:38:27,721
It's a question about King Sejong.

1147
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,592
- "As it's different from Chinese."
- Oh, no.

1148
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:32,731
Among the choices,

1149
00:38:32,732 --> 00:38:36,032
which is not the statue of King Sejong in Seoul?

1150
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,662
One, two, three.

1151
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:42,541
- Lim Joon Ho.
- New and Old Love.

1152
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:46,042
(Which is not the statue of King Sejong in Seoul?)

1153
00:38:46,112 --> 00:38:47,841
- Lim Joon Ho was quicker.
- Okay.

1154
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:48,882
Number four.

1155
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:50,811
We visited number four last time.

1156
00:38:50,812 --> 00:38:51,982
It's the Tomb of King Sejong.

1157
00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:55,282
(They visited Tomb of King Sejong during their trip in Yeoju.)

1158
00:38:55,522 --> 00:38:57,681
(Is number 4 the statue of King Sejong that they saw?)

1159
00:38:57,682 --> 00:39:00,322
- Number four.
- If it's wrong, we'll win for sure.

1160
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:01,722
Number four.

1161
00:39:01,892 --> 00:39:03,292
It must be it.

1162
00:39:03,962 --> 00:39:06,332
- Wrong.
- What's wrong with your face?

1163
00:39:07,232 --> 00:39:09,201
New and Old Love.

1164
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:10,401
- New and Old Love.
- What's the answer?

1165
00:39:10,402 --> 00:39:11,601
- Let's go with number 2.
- I think it's number 1.

1166
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:13,531
- No?
- They changed the color on purpose.

1167
00:39:13,532 --> 00:39:15,892
It must be fake. I think it's number two. Let's go with it.

1168
00:39:16,002 --> 00:39:17,141
One, two, three.

1169
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:18,201
- Number 2.
- Number 2.

1170
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:19,511
- Number two?
- Lim Joon Ho.

1171
00:39:19,512 --> 00:39:20,911
The statue of King Sejong number two.

1172
00:39:20,912 --> 00:39:23,581
My goodness. Kim Jong Min is on a roll today.

1173
00:39:23,582 --> 00:39:25,681
No, that's wrong. Lim Joon Ho.

1174
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:26,782
Lim Joon Ho. Number three.

1175
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:27,981
Correct.

1176
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:28,982
(Jong Min is correct.)

1177
00:39:29,652 --> 00:39:30,722
Goodness.

1178
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:33,292
He's the old generation of Seoul. He's a local.

1179
00:39:34,922 --> 00:39:37,362
- Did you see that?
- Where is number two located?

1180
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:40,362
Number two is at the intersection at Yeoju Terminal.

1181
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:42,061
Yeoju Terminal intersection?

1182
00:39:42,062 --> 00:39:43,361
(1. Gwanghwamun, 2. Yeoju Terminal intersection...)

1183
00:39:43,362 --> 00:39:45,131
They lost their momentum.

1184
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,412
Now is the moment to crush them.

1185
00:39:46,502 --> 00:39:48,232
They live in Seoul without knowing it.

1186
00:39:48,632 --> 00:39:52,041
Team Lim Joon Ho might have an advantage for the next question.

1187
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:53,042
- Okay.
- Okay.

1188
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:55,242
- We're the best.
- All right.

1189
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:57,911
There are songs inspired...

1190
00:39:57,912 --> 00:40:00,911
by places, streets, and spaces in Seoul.

1191
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:03,922
There are about 2,000 of them.

1192
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:06,791
Name five song titles...

1193
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:08,321
that include places in Seoul.

1194
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,762
Oh, no.

1195
00:40:10,462 --> 00:40:11,462
There's "Myeong-dong Calling" and...

1196
00:40:11,463 --> 00:40:13,791
The name of a place, a street, or anything in Seoul counts.

1197
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:15,368
(Meanwhile, Team Lim Joon Ho starts discussing right away.)

1198
00:40:15,392 --> 00:40:17,361
- Let us answer.
- Let us answer! Team Lim Joon Ho!

1199
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:18,401
(They finished the discussion quickly.)

1200
00:40:18,402 --> 00:40:20,731
"Gwanghwamun Love Song," "At Gwanghwamun,"

1201
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:22,701
"I Can't Go to Sinchon," "Myeong-dong Calling,"

1202
00:40:22,702 --> 00:40:24,002
and "Wangsimni in 1959."

1203
00:40:25,472 --> 00:40:26,741
- What was after "Myeong-dong?"
- "Myeong-dong Calling."

1204
00:40:26,742 --> 00:40:28,342
"Myeong-dong Calling" by Car the garden.

1205
00:40:28,612 --> 00:40:30,781
(Oh, darling, don't leave me)

1206
00:40:30,782 --> 00:40:32,142
It's originally Crying Nut's song.

1207
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,551
- Correct.
- Okay!

1208
00:40:35,552 --> 00:40:36,581
- Nice, Sae Ho!
- Okay.

1209
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:37,582
(Let's catch up with them.)

1210
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:39,651
If we catch up with them, it'll discourage them.

1211
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:40,751
(Push forward, Team Lim Joon Ho.)

1212
00:40:40,752 --> 00:40:42,352
Hey, why didn't you answer the question?

1213
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:43,591
It was easy for me.

1214
00:40:43,592 --> 00:40:45,361
- I couldn't think of any songs.
- I applaud you.

1215
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:47,091
But Jong Min will tell you five more answers.

1216
00:40:47,092 --> 00:40:48,132
All right. Jong Min, go.

1217
00:40:48,732 --> 00:40:50,302
I only know a few of such songs.

1218
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:52,901
(I'll let you two answer song questions.)

1219
00:40:52,902 --> 00:40:54,808
For your information, there are more of such songs.

1220
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:56,671
- "Gwanghwamun Love Song."
- "Yanghwa BRDG," "Gangnam Style,"

1221
00:40:56,672 --> 00:40:58,571
- "Apgujeong Delinquent,"
- There are many of such songs.

1222
00:40:58,572 --> 00:41:00,511
- "To Hongdae," "Hangang,"
- There are so many of them.

1223
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:02,581
- and many more.
- All right. Let's go!

1224
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:04,511
Just shout our team name. I'll answer the question.

1225
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,812
(Laughing)

1226
00:41:06,312 --> 00:41:07,312
What did he say?

1227
00:41:07,313 --> 00:41:09,122
- Just shout and leave it to me.
- Moving on.

1228
00:41:09,822 --> 00:41:11,222
- Okay. We'll do that.
- Listen up.

1229
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:13,391
One of the five types of punishment...

1230
00:41:13,392 --> 00:41:15,121
- in the Joseon Dynasty...
- Here it comes.

1231
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:17,491
- is exile.
- This is for Historian Kim.

1232
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:20,631
Exile involves sending a criminal to a certain location...

1233
00:41:20,632 --> 00:41:22,732
and forcing him or her to live there.

1234
00:41:23,162 --> 00:41:26,271
There was an animal that was exiled for the serial murder...

1235
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,471
that occurred in Gyeongbokgung.

1236
00:41:28,472 --> 00:41:29,541
- What animal is it?
- Let me... Jong Min...

1237
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:31,572
- Team New and Old Love.
- Team Lim Joon Ho.

1238
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:32,941
- What animal is it?
- Let me... Jong Min...

1239
00:41:32,942 --> 00:41:34,512
(Team New and Old Love!)

1240
00:41:34,772 --> 00:41:36,052
- What?
- Team New and Old Love.

1241
00:41:36,182 --> 00:41:38,541
What animal is it? If he gets this one right, it'll be amazing.

1242
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:39,681
- Three...
- Wait.

1243
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:40,682
An elephant.

1244
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:42,421
- I think it's correct.
- He's incredible.

1245
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:44,681
- That's correct. I'm sure of it.
- Historian Kim.

1246
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:45,722
Is it, really?

1247
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:48,752
(Could it be the correct answer?)

1248
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:51,861
(Did Jong Min get another one right?)

1249
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:52,931
Is it, really?

1250
00:41:52,932 --> 00:41:54,238
- That must be the correct answer.
- Correct.

1251
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,662
I knew that was the correct answer.

1252
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:56,901
- That must be the correct answer.
- Correct.

1253
00:41:56,902 --> 00:41:59,302
(Historian Kim made it.)

1254
00:41:59,872 --> 00:42:02,131
(You all saw that, right?)

1255
00:42:02,132 --> 00:42:03,601
- Can you lift him up?
- Yes, I can.

1256
00:42:03,602 --> 00:42:05,272
(How dare you look down on me?)

1257
00:42:05,342 --> 00:42:06,342
(What is wrong with him?)

1258
00:42:06,343 --> 00:42:08,511
You're our king, Historian Kim.

1259
00:42:08,512 --> 00:42:09,712
Historian Kim made it. Oh, no.

1260
00:42:09,842 --> 00:42:10,842
Jong Min, how did you know that?

1261
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:12,141
(Today, Historian Kim shows his true abilities.)

1262
00:42:12,142 --> 00:42:13,251
How did you know that?

1263
00:42:13,252 --> 00:42:15,428
- It's an elephant. I heard that.
- It's an elephant? Oh, gosh.

1264
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:17,121
- They received it as a gift.
- How did you know that?

1265
00:42:17,122 --> 00:42:18,821
And they kept it in the palace.

1266
00:42:18,822 --> 00:42:21,852
- But it hurt people and got exiled.
- It was a gift?

1267
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,122
For the first time, Jong Min seems reliable.

1268
00:42:24,462 --> 00:42:25,732
He's incredible.

1269
00:42:25,932 --> 00:42:29,161
I think the elephant was sent to Ulleung Island.

1270
00:42:29,162 --> 00:42:30,201
It was sent to an island.

1271
00:42:30,202 --> 00:42:31,202
(He's sure that it was sent to an island.)

1272
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:32,371
- Jong Hyun.
- Yes?

1273
00:42:32,372 --> 00:42:33,908
Was the elephant sent to Ulleung Island?

1274
00:42:33,932 --> 00:42:36,171
It was sent to an island in Jeolla Province.

1275
00:42:36,172 --> 00:42:38,218
- In Jeolla Province?
- He was right about an island.

1276
00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:39,911
("The Annals of King Taejong," Book 24)

1277
00:42:39,912 --> 00:42:40,971
(Lee Woo, the former minister of construction, has passed.)

1278
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:42,041
(He went to see the elephant and mocked it for its ugliness.)

1279
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,358
(The elephant became furious and trampled him to death.)

1280
00:42:43,382 --> 00:42:45,141
("The Annals of King Taejong," Book 26)

1281
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:46,551
(It must be executed for murder, but as Duke of Zhou drove out...)

1282
00:42:46,552 --> 00:42:48,328
(rhinos and elephants, send it to Hae Island in Jeolla Province.)

1283
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:50,222
(I warned you.)

1284
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:53,292
- He's great.
- Historian Kim, that was great.

1285
00:42:54,092 --> 00:42:56,662
- He has so much knowledge...
- The other two have done nothing.

1286
00:42:56,892 --> 00:42:58,961
- That's right.
- We shout our team name.

1287
00:42:58,962 --> 00:43:00,032
Se Yoon is right.

1288
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,261
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

1289
00:43:03,262 --> 00:43:04,262
(I really want to eat this.)

1290
00:43:04,263 --> 00:43:05,663
My gosh. You won't get to eat that?

1291
00:43:05,872 --> 00:43:07,172
All right, everyone.

1292
00:43:07,232 --> 00:43:10,102
The next question is about the skyscrapers in Seoul.

1293
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:13,312
- There are many of them in Seoul.
- That's right.

1294
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:15,442
Is it about the height of the buildings?

1295
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:16,742
Like the second tallest one?

1296
00:43:17,182 --> 00:43:20,211
List the buildings from the tallest to the shortest.

1297
00:43:20,212 --> 00:43:21,712
One, two...

1298
00:43:23,422 --> 00:43:25,891
(Question 5: List the buildings from the tallest to the shortest.)

1299
00:43:25,892 --> 00:43:28,532
(1. Tower Palace 3, 2. Parc 1 Complex, 3. L Tower, 4.63 Building)

1300
00:43:28,592 --> 00:43:29,862
Team Lim Joon Ho.

1301
00:43:30,322 --> 00:43:31,322
- Go ahead.
- What?

1302
00:43:32,532 --> 00:43:33,962
Three, four, one, two.

1303
00:43:34,032 --> 00:43:35,391
- Numbers 3 and 4 are wrong.
- They're wrong.

1304
00:43:35,392 --> 00:43:36,431
Three, four, two, one.

1305
00:43:36,432 --> 00:43:37,631
- Three, four, one, two.
- Three, four, two, one.

1306
00:43:37,632 --> 00:43:38,831
You have to pick one answer.

1307
00:43:38,832 --> 00:43:39,901
- Three, four, two, one.
- Three, four, two, one.

1308
00:43:39,902 --> 00:43:41,231
- Three, four, two, one.
- Three, four, two, one?

1309
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:42,752
(Okay. Your answer has been accepted.)

1310
00:43:43,342 --> 00:43:45,201
- Incorrect.
- Team New and Old Love.

1311
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:47,812
- Go ahead.
- Jong Min, it's time to be a hero.

1312
00:43:48,412 --> 00:43:50,741
- We know numbers 3 and 4, right?
- Yes.

1313
00:43:50,742 --> 00:43:52,582
- Three, two, one, four?
- I have no clue.

1314
00:43:53,052 --> 00:43:55,158
- They don't seem approving.
- Three, two, one, four?

1315
00:43:55,182 --> 00:43:57,351
Three, one, two, four? No. Could it be...

1316
00:43:57,352 --> 00:43:58,621
(I got a hunch.)

1317
00:43:58,622 --> 00:44:00,991
- Is there one left? One, four.
- Three, two, one, four.

1318
00:44:00,992 --> 00:44:02,492
Okay. That must be correct.

1319
00:44:03,222 --> 00:44:04,361
I'm sure we got it right.

1320
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:05,722
- Three, two, one, four?
- Yes.

1321
00:44:05,992 --> 00:44:07,161
- It must be correct.
- This is crazy.

1322
00:44:07,162 --> 00:44:09,562
- Jong Min is unbelievable.
- Is the 63 Building that short?

1323
00:44:09,702 --> 00:44:10,801
- It must be correct.
- This is crazy.

1324
00:44:10,802 --> 00:44:13,202
- Jong Min is unbelievable.
- Is the 63 Building that short?

1325
00:44:13,272 --> 00:44:14,332
Correct.

1326
00:44:15,172 --> 00:44:16,671
How dare you? You brat.

1327
00:44:16,672 --> 00:44:18,118
(Keeping the momentum, he celebrates by swinging his soft fists.)

1328
00:44:18,142 --> 00:44:20,111
Hey, it's been a long time since the 63 Building was built.

1329
00:44:20,112 --> 00:44:22,171
- It's been pushed back. Okay.
- It's not the tallest anymore.

1330
00:44:22,172 --> 00:44:23,741
- Let's move on.
- It just has a symbolic meaning.

1331
00:44:23,742 --> 00:44:26,062
We're competing against ones who know nothing about Seoul.

1332
00:44:26,412 --> 00:44:28,111
(1. Tower Palace 3: 264m, 2. Parc 1 Complex: 333m, )

1333
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:29,822
(3. L Tower: 555m, 4.63 Building: 249m)

1334
00:44:29,882 --> 00:44:33,591
Number three, L Tower, is 555m tall.

1335
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:34,992
(L Tower: 555m)

1336
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:36,592
We slept there.

1337
00:44:37,122 --> 00:44:40,862
(They slept at the highest place in the country.)

1338
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:42,801
(Jong Min and I watched the night view of Seoul as we fell asleep.)

1339
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:44,282
(He seems sorrowful for some reason.)

1340
00:44:44,402 --> 00:44:48,672
And the building in Parc 1 Complex is 333m tall.

1341
00:44:50,342 --> 00:44:51,971
It's been a long time since the 63 Building handed over the throne.

1342
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:54,541
And the 63 Building is 249m tall.

1343
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:56,242
- Right.
- It's so short.

1344
00:44:56,512 --> 00:44:59,551
Tower Palace 3 is 264m tall.

1345
00:44:59,552 --> 00:45:01,412
(Tower Palace 3: 264m)

1346
00:45:01,452 --> 00:45:02,681
We'll definitely win this.

1347
00:45:02,682 --> 00:45:04,521
Which would be harder? Us getting two more questions right?

1348
00:45:04,522 --> 00:45:06,722
- Or them getting five in a row?
- You're right.

1349
00:45:06,952 --> 00:45:10,891
We could get 4 in a row after you get 1 question right.

1350
00:45:10,892 --> 00:45:11,892
We'll see how it goes.

1351
00:45:11,893 --> 00:45:14,461
Here goes the next question.

1352
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:17,661
Among the people on South Korea's bills,

1353
00:45:17,662 --> 00:45:21,131
which one was born in Seoul?

1354
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:23,572
(Which of the ones on South Korea's bills was born in Seoul?)

1355
00:45:23,702 --> 00:45:25,041
(This question must be easier for those who know the history well.)

1356
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:26,841
- In Seoul?
- Which one...

1357
00:45:26,842 --> 00:45:28,241
- Do you know? Shall I shout?
- was born in Seoul?

1358
00:45:28,242 --> 00:45:30,141
- One, two, three.
- Yes, shout our team name.

1359
00:45:30,142 --> 00:45:31,281
- Team New and Old Love.
- Team New and Old Love.

1360
00:45:31,282 --> 00:45:33,042
- Team Lim Joon Ho.
- Team New and Old Love.

1361
00:45:33,282 --> 00:45:35,282
- Team Lim Joon Ho.
- Team Lim Joon Ho can answer.

1362
00:45:36,252 --> 00:45:38,421
- I know the answer.
- Then you should answer.

1363
00:45:38,422 --> 00:45:40,551
The answer is number three. I know this...

1364
00:45:40,552 --> 00:45:42,352
because I visited the place for a shoot.

1365
00:45:42,692 --> 00:45:45,321
It's not Seoul. His birthplace is very far from Seoul.

1366
00:45:45,322 --> 00:45:46,891
- Really?
- He was born in Jeolla Province.

1367
00:45:46,892 --> 00:45:48,768
- Toegye Yi Hwang?
- Historian Kim is incredible.

1368
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:51,431
- It's correct.
- If not, Historian Kim is amazing.

1369
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:52,731
- It's not Seoul.
- Toegye Yi Hwang?

1370
00:45:52,732 --> 00:45:54,371
(3. Toegye Yi Hwang)

1371
00:45:54,372 --> 00:45:55,401
- Incorrect.
- Oh, I was wrong.

1372
00:45:55,402 --> 00:45:56,871
- Team New and Old Love.
- Go ahead.

1373
00:45:56,872 --> 00:45:58,042
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

1374
00:45:58,072 --> 00:45:59,541
- Number two.
- Is it correct?

1375
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:00,841
Right. He was a king, so he must've been born in Seoul.

1376
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:04,381
Exactly. The rest of them were born in the southern areas.

1377
00:46:04,382 --> 00:46:05,741
- Yulgok Yi I and Shin Saimdang...
- Right.

1378
00:46:05,742 --> 00:46:07,151
Were probably born in the same area.

1379
00:46:07,152 --> 00:46:08,711
- I mean, he was a king.
- Exactly.

1380
00:46:08,712 --> 00:46:09,981
- He lived in the palace.
- He was a king.

1381
00:46:09,982 --> 00:46:11,981
Yes, he was a king, but he wasn't born in Seoul, as far as I know.

1382
00:46:11,982 --> 00:46:13,791
- I bet he was born in the palace.
- Right.

1383
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:15,491
There's no way his mother went outside of Seoul to give birth.

1384
00:46:15,492 --> 00:46:17,591
Team Lim Joon Ho.

1385
00:46:17,592 --> 00:46:19,261
- King Sejong?
- Team Lim Joon Ho.

1386
00:46:19,262 --> 00:46:20,391
(2. King Sejong)

1387
00:46:20,392 --> 00:46:21,731
- Let's hear the result first.
- Correct.

1388
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:23,202
- Oh, really?
- Of course.

1389
00:46:23,562 --> 00:46:24,732
Was he born in Hanyang?

1390
00:46:24,932 --> 00:46:26,501
Jong Min, don't be surprised. Let's sit down.

1391
00:46:26,502 --> 00:46:28,008
- That was...
- We're in such different leagues.

1392
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:30,971
Shin Saimdang and Yulgok Yi I were born in Gangneung.

1393
00:46:30,972 --> 00:46:32,041
- He was right. Right?
- Oh, I see.

1394
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:35,442
- Toegye Yi Hwang was from Andong.
- Oh, Andong. Right.

1395
00:46:35,842 --> 00:46:37,541
It was too obvious...

1396
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:39,911
Number two was an obvious answer, so we picked another one.

1397
00:46:39,912 --> 00:46:40,912
- Right.
- Hey.

1398
00:46:40,913 --> 00:46:42,981
Jong Min, the game itself is...

1399
00:46:42,982 --> 00:46:45,522
- It's too easy for us.
- We're at a great advantage.

1400
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,951
- We're at an advantage, indeed.
- Come to think of it,

1401
00:46:47,952 --> 00:46:50,762
it's unfair to us. We came first, but we only received applause.

1402
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:53,861
We didn't receive any practical benefit.

1403
00:46:53,862 --> 00:46:56,801
They finished kimchi stew before leaving.

1404
00:46:56,802 --> 00:46:58,231
- I ate food on the street.
- They took my burger.

1405
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,672
They took my burger.

1406
00:47:00,002 --> 00:47:01,682
- The early bird catches the worm.
- Guys.

1407
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:04,041
- You still have a chance to win.
- As if.

1408
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:05,501
- Are you teasing us or what?
- How could we win?

1409
00:47:05,502 --> 00:47:07,072
- How?
- What nonsense is that?

1410
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:08,511
This is so discouraging.

1411
00:47:08,512 --> 00:47:09,581
(He tried to cheer them up, but it only discouraged them.)

1412
00:47:09,582 --> 00:47:12,712
- The score is 5 to 1.
- Yes, the magical number.

1413
00:47:13,012 --> 00:47:14,411
We just have to get one more question right.

1414
00:47:14,412 --> 00:47:16,751
It'll be a tie even if we lose in all the remaining rounds.

1415
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:18,251
- Historian Kim is invincible.
- We've got this.

1416
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,091
Jong Min, we'll call you Seoul Kim from now on.

1417
00:47:20,092 --> 00:47:21,652
- Okay. Seoul Kim.
- Seoul Kim.

1418
00:47:21,992 --> 00:47:24,222
- He's Seoul Kim.
- He deserves the nickname.

1419
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:27,462
- You should be the PR ambassador.
- I'm happy that I'm helpful.

1420
00:47:27,592 --> 00:47:28,662
Guys.

1421
00:47:29,432 --> 00:47:31,432
(Team Lim Joon Ho seems so depressed.)

1422
00:47:32,902 --> 00:47:34,002
Cheer up.

1423
00:47:35,402 --> 00:47:38,072
This is how they look when they lose confidence.

1424
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:39,612
They seem so discouraged.

1425
00:47:40,172 --> 00:47:41,241
They lost their confidence.

1426
00:47:41,242 --> 00:47:44,081
- The score is 5 to 1 now.
- Yes.

1427
00:47:44,082 --> 00:47:46,081
How about we let this team answer first...

1428
00:47:46,082 --> 00:47:47,981
- in this round?
- Let them answer first.

1429
00:47:47,982 --> 00:47:49,582
- Give them a chance first.
- Of course.

1430
00:47:50,222 --> 00:47:51,851
Give them the easiest question.

1431
00:47:51,852 --> 00:47:52,951
Listen up.

1432
00:47:52,952 --> 00:47:54,432
Like how to spell "Seoul" in English.

1433
00:47:54,722 --> 00:47:55,842
Here goes the next question.

1434
00:47:56,862 --> 00:48:00,691
There are many bridges over the Han River that connect...

1435
00:48:00,692 --> 00:48:02,332
the southern and northern areas of Seoul.

1436
00:48:02,832 --> 00:48:04,101
I'm sure they'll get this one right.

1437
00:48:04,102 --> 00:48:05,132
Here's the question.

1438
00:48:05,502 --> 00:48:09,972
What was the first road bridge built in Seoul?

1439
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:12,022
Isn't it the Hangang Railroad Bridge?

1440
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:13,318
- The Hangang Railroad Bridge?
- Or the Hangang Bridge?

1441
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:16,081
- Let us answer. The Hangang Bridge.
- The Hangang Bridge.

1442
00:48:16,082 --> 00:48:17,211
Wait, no.

1443
00:48:17,212 --> 00:48:18,758
One of you mentioned the Hangang Railroad Bridge.

1444
00:48:18,782 --> 00:48:20,758
But a railroad bridge is different from a road bridge.

1445
00:48:20,782 --> 00:48:22,781
(Question: What's the first road bridge built in Seoul?)

1446
00:48:22,782 --> 00:48:25,652
(Road bridge)

1447
00:48:26,492 --> 00:48:28,521
(The Hangang Railroad Bridge was the first railroad bridge...)

1448
00:48:28,522 --> 00:48:30,562
(built over the Han River.)

1449
00:48:31,092 --> 00:48:33,061
(The Hangang Bridge was the first road bridge...)

1450
00:48:33,062 --> 00:48:35,031
(built over the Han River.)

1451
00:48:35,032 --> 00:48:38,032
(The answer is the Hangang Bridge.)

1452
00:48:39,502 --> 00:48:42,071
(Jong Min sabotages them slyly.)

1453
00:48:42,072 --> 00:48:44,972
- Maybe it's not the Hangang Bridge.
- Wait. Let me think.

1454
00:48:45,572 --> 00:48:47,872
(They're totally confused.)

1455
00:48:48,412 --> 00:48:50,742
(I hope they'll say the wrong answer.)

1456
00:48:50,912 --> 00:48:55,181
(Confused)

1457
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,381
- You have five seconds.
- That's too short.

1458
00:48:57,382 --> 00:48:58,681
- Take your time.
- I saw it on the news.

1459
00:48:58,682 --> 00:48:59,721
Can you give us some more time?

1460
00:48:59,722 --> 00:49:00,821
- Okay.
- How many seconds?

1461
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:02,502
- Give us just ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

1462
00:49:02,622 --> 00:49:03,861
Ten minutes is too long.

1463
00:49:03,862 --> 00:49:04,991
I know it, but I can't recall.

1464
00:49:04,992 --> 00:49:06,331
In ten minutes, you could build a bridge.

1465
00:49:06,332 --> 00:49:08,531
Are the Hangang Railroad Bridge and the Hangang Bridge different?

1466
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:12,131
He said it was a road bridge. A railroad bridge is for a train.

1467
00:49:12,132 --> 00:49:15,071
- Then it's the Hangang Bridge.
- A road bridge is for cars.

1468
00:49:15,072 --> 00:49:16,941
- The Hangang Bridge.
- The Hangang Bridge.

1469
00:49:16,942 --> 00:49:18,318
- The Hangang Bridge.
- The Hangang Bridge.

1470
00:49:18,342 --> 00:49:20,341
- Have you made your decision?
- The Hangang Bridge.

1471
00:49:20,342 --> 00:49:21,671
- The Hangang Bridge.
- It must be the Hangang Bridge.

1472
00:49:21,672 --> 00:49:22,841
- The Hangang Bridge?
- The Hangang Railroad Bridge...

1473
00:49:22,842 --> 00:49:24,012
and the Hangang Bridge.

1474
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:25,781
Choose one of them. Is it "railroad bridge" or "bridge?"

1475
00:49:25,782 --> 00:49:26,851
- The Hangang Bridge.
- The Hangang Bridge.

1476
00:49:26,852 --> 00:49:28,452
- Correct.
- Okay.

1477
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,351
Right. I knew it was the Hangang Bridge.

1478
00:49:30,352 --> 00:49:33,092
Why did you say that answer when I told you another one?

1479
00:49:33,122 --> 00:49:34,791
Is "The Third Han River Bridge" about the Hangang Bridge?

1480
00:49:34,792 --> 00:49:36,291
(The Hangang Bridge was built in 1917...)

1481
00:49:36,292 --> 00:49:39,732
(during the Japanese occupation. It was called Gyeongseong Bridge.)

1482
00:49:39,792 --> 00:49:41,831
- The score is 5 to 2, right?
- Is it 5 to 2?

1483
00:49:41,832 --> 00:49:42,902
Yes, it's 5 to 2.

1484
00:49:43,332 --> 00:49:45,801
(There's still a large gap.)

1485
00:49:45,802 --> 00:49:47,631
- Moving on...
- Can you do it only in this round?

1486
00:49:47,632 --> 00:49:48,632
No, we can't. What is it?

1487
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:50,801
Only Se Yoon and Seon Ho play in this round.

1488
00:49:50,802 --> 00:49:51,941
- No way.
- I don't like the idea.

1489
00:49:51,942 --> 00:49:53,811
Without Jong Min, the brain of the team.

1490
00:49:53,812 --> 00:49:54,941
- The two of us?
- The brain of the team?

1491
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:56,541
- He's looking down on us.
- He became the brain of the team.

1492
00:49:56,542 --> 00:49:57,841
Without the brain,

1493
00:49:57,842 --> 00:49:59,111
- only the two of you will play.
- He's the brain?

1494
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:01,251
- Discuss it with them first.
- Okay, I'll accept it.

1495
00:50:01,252 --> 00:50:03,281
- Don't even give them a hint.
- Okay.

1496
00:50:03,282 --> 00:50:05,298
- Okay. That's great.
- Let's try that in this round.

1497
00:50:05,322 --> 00:50:06,551
- The brain will sit this one out.
- Okay.

1498
00:50:06,552 --> 00:50:07,921
- Hurry up and start.
- We'll play without Jong Min.

1499
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,291
Now the two teams are on the same level.

1500
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:12,761
This question is regarding a figure in Seoul.

1501
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:15,961
- Okay.
- Born in Yongsan-gu, Seoul.

1502
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:17,401
- In Yongsan?
- This year marks...

1503
00:50:17,402 --> 00:50:18,938
the 30th anniversary of his or her debut.

1504
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:21,271
Selected as Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia...

1505
00:50:21,272 --> 00:50:24,301
Leader Entertainer in 2016.

1506
00:50:24,302 --> 00:50:25,772
- Who is this figure?
- Sae Ho.

1507
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:27,941
- Under 30?
- Team Lim Joon Ho.

1508
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,741
Lee Mal Nyeon.

1509
00:50:29,742 --> 00:50:30,881
Recently...

1510
00:50:30,882 --> 00:50:32,111
(He said 2016.)

1511
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,752
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- He's not under 30.

1512
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:36,721
I'll try again. I'm sorry. I'm having a headache.

1513
00:50:36,722 --> 00:50:38,722
(I'll try again. I'm sorry.)

1514
00:50:39,252 --> 00:50:41,321
I'm sorry, but can you discuss with us before you go?

1515
00:50:41,322 --> 00:50:42,651
- I heard it wrong.
- It's the 30th anniversary...

1516
00:50:42,652 --> 00:50:43,991
of his or her debut.

1517
00:50:43,992 --> 00:50:46,631
Selected as Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia in 2016.

1518
00:50:46,632 --> 00:50:48,562
Awarded as Asia Leader Entertainer.

1519
00:50:49,602 --> 00:50:51,461
Under 30 in 2016...

1520
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:53,771
Which year did he or she make a debut if it's the 30th year?

1521
00:50:53,772 --> 00:50:56,672
- That was in 2016.
- The debut happened in 1995.

1522
00:50:57,102 --> 00:51:00,371
- Made a debut in 1995?
- Is the figure a singer?

1523
00:51:00,372 --> 00:51:01,511
If it was in 2016...

1524
00:51:01,512 --> 00:51:02,911
The figure is a singer. That's correct.

1525
00:51:02,912 --> 00:51:04,941
It must be a singer who made a debut in either 1995 or 1996.

1526
00:51:04,942 --> 00:51:06,082
Hey, you should know.

1527
00:51:06,182 --> 00:51:07,482
Is the person very young?

1528
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,821
The figure can't be too old.

1529
00:51:09,822 --> 00:51:11,551
Did the figure win the award as soon as he was born or what?

1530
00:51:11,552 --> 00:51:14,021
So the debut happened in 1995. The figure was...

1531
00:51:14,022 --> 00:51:15,551
under 30 in 2016.

1532
00:51:15,552 --> 00:51:16,761
(A singer whose debut was in 1995 and was under 30 in 2016)

1533
00:51:16,762 --> 00:51:17,922
Team New and Old Love.

1534
00:51:19,562 --> 00:51:20,631
Who are you going for?

1535
00:51:20,632 --> 00:51:22,032
(It must be them.)

1536
00:51:22,362 --> 00:51:24,231
- Team New and Old Love.
- It must be the answer.

1537
00:51:24,232 --> 00:51:26,372
Why aren't you answering? Team New and Old Love.

1538
00:51:26,472 --> 00:51:28,172
It's the last one. It's done.

1539
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:29,901
- Team New and Old Love.
- It must be the answer.

1540
00:51:29,902 --> 00:51:32,702
- It's done.
- It must be the answer.

1541
00:51:32,942 --> 00:51:36,782
- It must be the year 1996.
- Let's go, Se Yoon.

1542
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:39,282
Seo Tai Ji.

1543
00:51:40,152 --> 00:51:41,351
- The figure must be 39.
- No, it's not him.

1544
00:51:41,352 --> 00:51:43,582
He couldn't be under 30 in 2016.

1545
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:46,921
(Seo Tai Ji)

1546
00:51:46,922 --> 00:51:49,492
- Incorrect.
- He made his debut in 1992.

1547
00:51:50,192 --> 00:51:54,631
(Seo Tai Ji and Boys made their debut in 1992.)

1548
00:51:54,632 --> 00:51:58,832
(The answer is a singer who made a debut after Seo Tai Ji.)

1549
00:51:58,962 --> 00:52:00,032
Team Lim Joon Ho.

1550
00:52:00,672 --> 00:52:01,772
Team Lim Joon Ho.

1551
00:52:04,842 --> 00:52:07,141
G-DRAGON lives in Yongsan.

1552
00:52:07,142 --> 00:52:09,271
He does live in Yongsan.

1553
00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:10,441
(He is from Yongsan. But his debut...)

1554
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:12,642
- His debut could have happened.
- Kid Roo'Ra.

1555
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:14,852
- He's right.
- The answer is G-DRAGON.

1556
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:16,851
- That must be the answer.
- G-DRAGON.

1557
00:52:16,852 --> 00:52:18,721
- That must be the answer.
- He's from Yongsan.

1558
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:20,152
He went to Lila Elementary School.

1559
00:52:20,752 --> 00:52:21,821
That is correct.

1560
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:25,022
(G-DRAGON)

1561
00:52:25,192 --> 00:52:26,492
We turned the tables.

1562
00:52:27,062 --> 00:52:31,101
He made a debut as Kid Roo'Ra on September 1, 1995.

1563
00:52:31,102 --> 00:52:32,542
I didn't expect you to think of him.

1564
00:52:33,432 --> 00:52:35,032
He made a debut then.

1565
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:39,201
(Selected as Forbes' Asia Leader Entertainer in 2016 at the age...)

1566
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:41,942
(of 28 as he swept all over Korea)

1567
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,582
(Team Lim Joon Ho: 3, Team New and Old Love: 5)

1568
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:47,151
- Hey, Jong Min.
- In the end

1569
00:52:47,152 --> 00:52:48,681
- We need your help.
- All right.

1570
00:52:48,682 --> 00:52:49,682
You're the smartest here.

1571
00:52:49,683 --> 00:52:51,851
Jong Min, are you not joining again?

1572
00:52:51,852 --> 00:52:54,921
I'm sorry. I have to join the team now.

1573
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:55,951
You're a big threat to us.

1574
00:52:55,952 --> 00:52:56,992
No...

1575
00:52:57,322 --> 00:52:59,021
He will be a big threat to us if he joins the game.

1576
00:52:59,022 --> 00:53:01,091
They're catching up now. It's 5 to 3.

1577
00:53:01,092 --> 00:53:03,562
- Okay.
- Here's the next question.

1578
00:53:04,362 --> 00:53:06,572
Which is the largest district...

1579
00:53:07,502 --> 00:53:10,771
- among the 25 districts of Seoul?
- Team New and Old Love.

1580
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:12,401
(Which is the largest district among the 25 districts of Seoul?)

1581
00:53:12,402 --> 00:53:13,471
- Jong Min.
- Team New and Old Love.

1582
00:53:13,472 --> 00:53:14,571
- Team New and Old Love.
- Team New and Old Love.

1583
00:53:14,572 --> 00:53:15,572
Let's end this game.

1584
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:17,111
- All right.
- I'll have a go now.

1585
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:19,911
- Go for it, the largest district.
- Which is the largest one?

1586
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:22,151
The largest district of Seoul.

1587
00:53:22,152 --> 00:53:23,252
Okay, we'll go for it now.

1588
00:53:23,482 --> 00:53:25,482
- Should I go?
- All right.

1589
00:53:27,022 --> 00:53:28,251
One...

1590
00:53:28,252 --> 00:53:29,292
Jongno-gu.

1591
00:53:30,192 --> 00:53:31,691
- That must be it.
- Jongno-gu?

1592
00:53:31,692 --> 00:53:34,031
"Hey, Du-Han. It's me Ma Juk."

1593
00:53:34,032 --> 00:53:35,132
- Incorrect.
- Goodness.

1594
00:53:35,162 --> 00:53:36,331
Team Lim Joon Ho.

1595
00:53:36,332 --> 00:53:38,161
- Which district is it?
- I have no idea.

1596
00:53:38,162 --> 00:53:40,101
- Yeongdeungpo-gu.
- Let's go for it.

1597
00:53:40,102 --> 00:53:41,932
- One, two, three.
- Yeongdeungpo-gu.

1598
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:43,901
Yeongdeungpo-gu is incorrect.

1599
00:53:43,902 --> 00:53:45,101
- Team New and Old Love.
- Team New and Old Love.

1600
00:53:45,102 --> 00:53:47,671
There must be a reason why we are here today.

1601
00:53:47,672 --> 00:53:49,542
- This district is very big.
- Right.

1602
00:53:49,682 --> 00:53:50,918
- Seongdong-gu.
- Seongdong-gu.

1603
00:53:50,942 --> 00:53:54,211
- Incorrect.
- Gangdong-gu. Here's why.

1604
00:53:54,212 --> 00:53:57,581
- It's very large.
- It got expanded towards the east.

1605
00:53:57,582 --> 00:54:00,021
- It got expanded.
- Right.

1606
00:54:00,022 --> 00:54:03,021
It is very big towards the right.

1607
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:04,092
That's right.

1608
00:54:04,692 --> 00:54:05,722
Incorrect.

1609
00:54:06,292 --> 00:54:08,061
- Do you want a hint?
- Yes, please.

1610
00:54:08,062 --> 00:54:09,092
Here it is.

1611
00:54:09,762 --> 00:54:11,831
It's below the Han River.

1612
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,171
- Below the Han River?
- Yes.

1613
00:54:13,172 --> 00:54:14,772
(It's a district below the Han River.)

1614
00:54:14,902 --> 00:54:16,901
- It's towards Gangnam.
- Gangnam-gu.

1615
00:54:16,902 --> 00:54:18,042
Team Lim Joon Ho.

1616
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:19,341
(Shouting the team's slogan)

1617
00:54:19,342 --> 00:54:20,771
(Quickly discussing)

1618
00:54:20,772 --> 00:54:22,511
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

1619
00:54:22,512 --> 00:54:23,582
- Seocho-gu.
- Seocho-gu.

1620
00:54:24,182 --> 00:54:25,212
Seocho-gu.

1621
00:54:25,312 --> 00:54:26,512
It must be the second largest.

1622
00:54:27,982 --> 00:54:28,982
That is correct.

1623
00:54:29,082 --> 00:54:32,251
- Yes, it's Seocho-gu.
- There, it's big.

1624
00:54:32,252 --> 00:54:34,691
Right, it's connected to the highway.

1625
00:54:34,692 --> 00:54:37,521
Now that I think of it,

1626
00:54:37,522 --> 00:54:40,531
- Seocho-gu is quite large.
- Great.

1627
00:54:40,532 --> 00:54:42,391
- Nice.
- Is this for real?

1628
00:54:42,392 --> 00:54:43,701
I should have been faster.

1629
00:54:43,702 --> 00:54:45,401
- All right.
- That was too easy.

1630
00:54:45,402 --> 00:54:46,732
We only have one question left.

1631
00:54:47,372 --> 00:54:49,272
You're joining us...

1632
00:54:49,902 --> 00:54:51,871
- with this round, yes?
- I messed it up.

1633
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:52,872
Goodness.

1634
00:54:53,042 --> 00:54:54,171
(Being sarcastic)

1635
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:56,142
He's growing too fast.

1636
00:54:56,782 --> 00:54:58,041
I should stop him now.

1637
00:54:58,042 --> 00:55:00,081
Seoul Kim, if you let them turn the tables,

1638
00:55:00,082 --> 00:55:01,082
I won't let it slip.

1639
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,422
You're pressuring me.

1640
00:55:06,122 --> 00:55:08,152
- Last question, please.
- Everyone.

1641
00:55:08,692 --> 00:55:10,822
This could be the last question.

1642
00:55:11,162 --> 00:55:14,091
"Castaway on the Moon," the movie that comes to your mind...

1643
00:55:14,092 --> 00:55:16,602
when you think of Seoul, was shot on...

1644
00:55:16,862 --> 00:55:18,601
- Bam Island.
- Right, I know.

1645
00:55:18,602 --> 00:55:20,031
("Castaway on the Moon" was shot on Bam Island.)

1646
00:55:20,032 --> 00:55:22,601
Which bridge is Bam Island located below?

1647
00:55:22,602 --> 00:55:23,702
Team New and Old Love.

1648
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:25,741
(Team New and Old Love shouted their name first.)

1649
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:27,171
Isn't it Yanghwa Bridge?

1650
00:55:27,172 --> 00:55:29,471
That's right below that bridge.

1651
00:55:29,472 --> 00:55:31,082
It's that bridge to Yeouido.

1652
00:55:33,482 --> 00:55:35,881
(It's right below the bridge.)

1653
00:55:35,882 --> 00:55:37,752
(That bridge links to Yeouido.)

1654
00:55:38,122 --> 00:55:41,692
(He knows the exact location.)

1655
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:43,362
Go for it.

1656
00:55:43,822 --> 00:55:45,261
We shouted our name first.

1657
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:46,761
Jong Min will finish the game.

1658
00:55:46,762 --> 00:55:48,691
- It's okay, just go for it.
- One, two, three.

1659
00:55:48,692 --> 00:55:49,732
Wonhyo Bridge.

1660
00:55:50,762 --> 00:55:53,472
He randomly picked one. It's either Wonhyo or Yanghwa.

1661
00:55:53,511 --> 00:55:55,481
One, two, three, Wonhyo Bridge.

1662
00:55:56,018 --> 00:55:58,147
He randomly picked one. It's either Wonhyo or Yanghwa.

1663
00:55:58,148 --> 00:55:59,187
Wonhyo Bridge is correct.

1664
00:55:59,188 --> 00:56:00,917
"Castaway on the Moon" directed by Lee Hae Joon.

1665
00:56:00,918 --> 00:56:02,827
"Like a Virgin." I took part in it.

1666
00:56:02,828 --> 00:56:04,357
Let me comment on them.

1667
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:09,298
You said it was Wonhyo Bridge. I used to live next to Bam Island.

1668
00:56:09,468 --> 00:56:11,827
So I passed Wonhyo Bridge on my way back home.

1669
00:56:11,828 --> 00:56:15,467
It leads to Hyeonseok-dong and Yonggang-dong.

1670
00:56:15,468 --> 00:56:16,837
Then you see Bam Island after that.

1671
00:56:16,838 --> 00:56:19,077
So Wonhyo Bridge isn't the answer.

1672
00:56:19,078 --> 00:56:20,807
(It's located below that bridge.)

1673
00:56:20,808 --> 00:56:22,677
So Wonhyo Bridge isn't the answer.

1674
00:56:22,678 --> 00:56:25,248
- Incorrect.
- All right.

1675
00:56:25,478 --> 00:56:27,577
- That's why...
- Can you discuss it with us?

1676
00:56:27,578 --> 00:56:30,387
- Tell us, please.
- Okay, listen.

1677
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:34,017
- I used to live...
- Team New and Old Love.

1678
00:56:34,018 --> 00:56:36,527
- I lived in Hyeonseok-dong.
- Right.

1679
00:56:36,528 --> 00:56:39,897
So I passed Wonhyo Bridge.

1680
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:44,198
Does Seogang Bridge link to Yeouido?

1681
00:56:44,528 --> 00:56:46,737
- How can it lead to Yeouido?
- He's right.

1682
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:48,098
Okay, the next bridge...

1683
00:56:48,198 --> 00:56:50,968
- Mapo Bridge.
- Yanghwa Bridge is the next one.

1684
00:56:51,268 --> 00:56:54,277
Mapo Bridge links to Yeouido.

1685
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:57,207
- Let's go for Yanghwa Bridge.
- Okay, Yanghwa Bridge.

1686
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:58,647
- Yanghwa Bridge.
- Yanghwa.

1687
00:56:58,648 --> 00:56:59,847
- Yanghwa Bridge?
- Yes.

1688
00:56:59,848 --> 00:57:00,978
(Yanghwa Bridge)

1689
00:57:01,178 --> 00:57:02,847
(It will be a tie if we get this.)

1690
00:57:02,848 --> 00:57:04,018
We are in big trouble.

1691
00:57:04,448 --> 00:57:06,057
- Incorrect.
- Team New and Old Love.

1692
00:57:06,058 --> 00:57:08,687
- We got this.
- It must be Seogang Bridge.

1693
00:57:08,688 --> 00:57:10,357
- Okay, we got this. Let's go.
- One, two, three.

1694
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:11,358
- Seogang Bridge.
- Seogang Bridge.

1695
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,827
- Jong Min!
- Go, Jong Min.

1696
00:57:12,828 --> 00:57:14,127
- It must be the answer.
- It's correct.

1697
00:57:14,128 --> 00:57:16,097
- Seogang Bridge.
- It links to Yeouido.

1698
00:57:16,098 --> 00:57:17,327
- That must be it.
- That's the only bridge.

1699
00:57:17,328 --> 00:57:18,397
No.

1700
00:57:18,398 --> 00:57:20,798
- That is correct.
- My goodness.

1701
00:57:20,868 --> 00:57:23,438
(Seogang Bridge is the answer.)

1702
00:57:23,538 --> 00:57:26,378
(Team New and Old Love gets the dessert.)

1703
00:57:27,108 --> 00:57:28,507
- It's over.
- It was a good game.

1704
00:57:28,508 --> 00:57:29,907
It was a good game.

1705
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:31,677
We gave them some hope.

1706
00:57:31,678 --> 00:57:35,048
- We gave them frustration too.
- I did think of Seogang Bridge.

1707
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,647
- You lived near Bam Island.
- When you said that,

1708
00:57:37,648 --> 00:57:39,618
I thought the game was over.

1709
00:57:40,418 --> 00:57:42,827
(While Sae Ho was doing his briefing)

1710
00:57:42,828 --> 00:57:45,057
- Seogang Bridge?
- Yes.

1711
00:57:45,058 --> 00:57:47,428
Seogang Bridge connects to Yeouido, yes?

1712
00:57:47,658 --> 00:57:50,428
(Quickly lying)

1713
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:52,898
(That's how Se Yoon overcame his crisis.)

1714
00:57:53,238 --> 00:57:54,837
We did make him fail.

1715
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,567
We were like, "Wonhyo or Yanghwa?"

1716
00:57:56,568 --> 00:57:57,837
- It confused him.
- Right.

1717
00:57:57,838 --> 00:57:58,977
I was confused with Seogang Bridge.

1718
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:00,778
(Sae Ho feels bad about missing the answer.)

1719
00:58:00,938 --> 00:58:01,938
(These two are upset for not being able to eat bread.)

1720
00:58:01,939 --> 00:58:04,107
You actually said Seogang Bridge at first.

1721
00:58:04,108 --> 00:58:05,608
(We'll take your bread back.)

1722
00:58:05,878 --> 00:58:08,817
(No)

1723
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,887
They are giving us drinks too.

1724
00:58:09,888 --> 00:58:11,517
- Drinks?
- I want the one with tangerine.

1725
00:58:11,518 --> 00:58:13,417
- All right.
- We don't get drinks either?

1726
00:58:13,418 --> 00:58:14,687
- We'll have it.
- No.

1727
00:58:14,688 --> 00:58:16,587
Give us back our breakfast.

1728
00:58:16,588 --> 00:58:19,357
- Give me back my food.
- I'm starved to death.

1729
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:22,058
- Come on.
- Give me back 7.8 dollars.

1730
00:58:22,228 --> 00:58:23,967
- I mean...
- We can't let this go.

1731
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:27,468
Give me back my bread! You took it away from us.

1732
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:30,337
I can feel him.

1733
00:58:30,338 --> 00:58:31,637
Take a photo, yes.

1734
00:58:31,638 --> 00:58:34,107
(Taking a photo of the bread whether they're angry or not)

1735
00:58:34,108 --> 00:58:35,507
My wife loves this.

1736
00:58:35,508 --> 00:58:38,478
(Taking photos for his wife)

1737
00:58:38,608 --> 00:58:40,617
This looks so nice. Look at the cream!

1738
00:58:40,618 --> 00:58:42,847
I don't usually eat sweet stuff. But I really crave it right now.

1739
00:58:42,848 --> 00:58:44,217
How should I eat it? Shall I use a spoon or drink it?

1740
00:58:44,218 --> 00:58:45,448
Do we eat this grass?

1741
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:47,318
Do you want this grass?

1742
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:49,388
(Giving the grass to DinDin)

1743
00:58:49,658 --> 00:58:52,158
(What on earth is that?)

1744
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:55,298
(Cutting the bread after sharing his grass)

1745
00:58:55,428 --> 00:58:57,928
Gosh, look at the cream inside.

1746
00:58:58,098 --> 00:58:59,637
- Gosh, what's that?
- Let's share it.

1747
00:58:59,638 --> 00:59:00,758
- Look at this.
- Let's eat.

1748
00:59:01,098 --> 00:59:02,468
I'll just smell it.

1749
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:04,267
- Goodness.
- Let me smell it.

1750
00:59:04,268 --> 00:59:05,408
Put your hand away.

1751
00:59:05,568 --> 00:59:07,778
(Sniffing)

1752
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:10,908
(It smells amazing.)

1753
00:59:11,678 --> 00:59:15,848
(The sweet taste fills his mouth.)

1754
00:59:15,948 --> 00:59:17,487
- Is this edible?
- This is like cheese.

1755
00:59:17,488 --> 00:59:21,558
(Se Yoon drinks the signature coffee first.)

1756
00:59:24,588 --> 00:59:25,758
It's savory.

1757
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:28,458
It's good.

1758
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:32,938
(Seon Ho tries the strawberry scone he picked!)

1759
00:59:32,998 --> 00:59:34,968
(It's sweet and refreshing.)

1760
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,107
Scones taste really amazing.

1761
00:59:37,108 --> 00:59:38,184
(He discovers the taste of scones.)

1762
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:39,707
- It's really good.
- It's sweet.

1763
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:41,308
(The sweet taste makes them feel great.)

1764
00:59:41,408 --> 00:59:44,407
I guess they used a real lemon here.

1765
00:59:44,408 --> 00:59:45,917
Of course it's a real lemon. They wouldn't use a fake one.

1766
00:59:45,918 --> 00:59:47,818
(He's sensitive.)

1767
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:49,617
He's angry.

1768
00:59:49,618 --> 00:59:50,748
Where did the spoon go?

1769
00:59:51,118 --> 00:59:52,217
Anyway, they...

1770
00:59:52,218 --> 00:59:54,088
Why do you keep giving us grass?

1771
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,487
They eat lots of snacks.

1772
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:57,027
The snacks.

1773
00:59:57,028 --> 00:59:58,757
- It's really good.
- He's eating four at a time.

1774
00:59:58,758 --> 01:00:00,358
He's not eating with one hand.

1775
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:03,828
(They're watching them eat.)

1776
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:05,667
It's from Apgujeong?

1777
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,168
- Yes. Apgujeong.
- Really?

1778
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,908
What do you think about this?

1779
01:00:11,538 --> 01:00:12,637
- Yes?
- Good.

1780
01:00:12,638 --> 01:00:13,737
The question you would have given us...

1781
01:00:13,738 --> 01:00:15,237
- when we were tied.
- Yes.

1782
01:00:15,238 --> 01:00:17,747
To one person who gets that right,

1783
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:18,847
- One piece of bread.
- One!

1784
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,954
- Shall we do that?
- One piece of bread to one person.

1785
01:00:20,978 --> 01:00:23,048
Then, this question...

1786
01:00:23,448 --> 01:00:24,687
This is an O-X quiz.

1787
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:25,717
Okay.

1788
01:00:25,718 --> 01:00:26,887
The person who gets it correct...

1789
01:00:26,888 --> 01:00:28,517
- will get it.
- Okay! One person?

1790
01:00:28,518 --> 01:00:29,957
If two people answer it correctly, they'll both get it.

1791
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:32,287
- Okay.
- If we answer O, X, and O?

1792
01:00:32,288 --> 01:00:33,627
You just need to pick the opposite of what Joon picks.

1793
01:00:33,628 --> 01:00:35,997
Hey. I had forgotten about that.

1794
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:37,428
- That's a painful memory.
- Okay.

1795
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:40,698
(In the last Jeju trip)

1796
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:44,968
(Joon kept getting wrong answers and got zero points.)

1797
01:00:45,168 --> 01:00:46,907
- I'll get it correct.
- Shall we do this individually?

1798
01:00:46,908 --> 01:00:48,537
- Get it correct.
- I should get it correct.

1799
01:00:48,538 --> 01:00:52,678
South Korea's first driverless autonomous shuttle bus...

1800
01:00:53,218 --> 01:00:55,887
will start operating in Seoul...

1801
01:00:55,888 --> 01:00:57,447
from the end of October 2025.

1802
01:00:57,448 --> 01:00:59,458
Okay. This is an X.

1803
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:02,757
Since Joon said X,

1804
01:01:02,758 --> 01:01:04,087
- I suddenly want to go with O.
- But...

1805
01:01:04,088 --> 01:01:06,157
- This is crazy.
- Why?

1806
01:01:06,158 --> 01:01:07,227
(I understand that.)

1807
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:08,957
It's definitely X.

1808
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:10,027
Trust me.

1809
01:01:10,028 --> 01:01:11,028
Okay.

1810
01:01:11,029 --> 01:01:12,427
- I'll go with X.
- It's definitely X.

1811
01:01:12,428 --> 01:01:14,297
Even autonomous driving...

1812
01:01:14,298 --> 01:01:15,967
- isn't that...
- Let's all go with it.

1813
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:18,867
We don't even have self-driving taxis yet.

1814
01:01:18,868 --> 01:01:21,007
They have it in the US, but not in Korea.

1815
01:01:21,008 --> 01:01:23,407
Unless this is a trial run...

1816
01:01:23,408 --> 01:01:26,347
I think I read it in the newspaper.

1817
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:29,148
But the period. I'm confused about that.

1818
01:01:29,848 --> 01:01:30,947
O.

1819
01:01:30,948 --> 01:01:32,487
It's X because...

1820
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:34,517
- This is X.
- Are you sure it's X?

1821
01:01:34,518 --> 01:01:35,857
- It's X.
- O.

1822
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:36,988
(DinDin answers O.)

1823
01:01:37,688 --> 01:01:38,787
- Let's do this.
- I said O...

1824
01:01:38,788 --> 01:01:41,697
because if he's sure, it's O.

1825
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,644
(If the Zero Point Man is sure, I should go with the other choice.)

1826
01:01:43,668 --> 01:01:45,127
- Make your final decisions.
- X!

1827
01:01:45,128 --> 01:01:46,238
- O!
- O!

1828
01:01:47,068 --> 01:01:49,168
- O, X, O.
- O.

1829
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:51,137
It would be crazy if Joon gets it correct.

1830
01:01:51,138 --> 01:01:53,218
- Right. I should turn it around.
- The answer is...

1831
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:55,578
The answer is...

1832
01:01:56,648 --> 01:01:57,648
X.

1833
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,018
X.

1834
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:03,417
(The Zero Point Man answered correctly alone.)

1835
01:02:03,418 --> 01:02:05,148
This is about IT.

1836
01:02:06,188 --> 01:02:07,987
It doesn't make sense.

1837
01:02:07,988 --> 01:02:11,087
Our country's first driverless...

1838
01:02:11,088 --> 01:02:14,598
autonomous shuttle bus...

1839
01:02:14,828 --> 01:02:17,267
is scheduled to start operating from the end of September this year.

1840
01:02:17,268 --> 01:02:18,298
When?

1841
01:02:18,428 --> 01:02:19,537
It started earlier.

1842
01:02:19,538 --> 01:02:21,037
- From the end of September.
- Really?

1843
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:22,907
(His reasoning was wrong, but he got it correct anyway.)

1844
01:02:22,908 --> 01:02:24,638
- Really?
- Who will do that?

1845
01:02:25,338 --> 01:02:28,138
(Seoul)

1846
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:29,677
It's sad.

1847
01:02:29,678 --> 01:02:32,647
I wanted to try the honeycomb.

1848
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:34,617
This is funny. He keeps saying it's too early.

1849
01:02:34,618 --> 01:02:37,848
My childhood dream was to have dessert in Seongsu-dong.

1850
01:02:41,288 --> 01:02:43,357
(I'm just saying.)

1851
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:45,087
- When you were young, - It's true.

1852
01:02:45,088 --> 01:02:46,527
Wasn't Seongsu-dong an industrial area?

1853
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:48,658
It was. So ever since I was young...

1854
01:02:48,758 --> 01:02:51,098
I'm 44 years old.

1855
01:02:51,398 --> 01:02:53,397
My dream was to have dessert in Seongsu-dong.

1856
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:54,938
- This...
- It can't be helped.

1857
01:02:54,998 --> 01:02:56,307
You had to win this game.

1858
01:02:56,308 --> 01:02:57,867
This doesn't make sense.

1859
01:02:57,868 --> 01:02:58,868
It's really good.

1860
01:02:58,869 --> 01:03:01,437
Even if you break up, you'd feel better when you eat this.

1861
01:03:01,438 --> 01:03:02,507
(It's a sweet taste that would even take away the pain of a breakup.)

1862
01:03:02,508 --> 01:03:04,407
- So good.
- It would be better...

1863
01:03:04,408 --> 01:03:06,147
- to break up here.
- You'd only be laughing.

1864
01:03:06,148 --> 01:03:07,578
"Okay, let's break up."

1865
01:03:08,778 --> 01:03:10,247
You all enjoyed the desserts, right?

1866
01:03:10,248 --> 01:03:12,118
- Yes.
- All right. Then,

1867
01:03:12,248 --> 01:03:15,257
let's move to the next One Night Ribbon spot.

1868
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:16,557
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1869
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:18,958
- The scones were really good.
- The scone was really soft.

1870
01:03:19,728 --> 01:03:22,528
My mom told me to have dessert when I go to Seongsu-dong.

1871
01:03:22,898 --> 01:03:23,898
Seriously.

1872
01:03:24,628 --> 01:03:28,298
(Make sure to have them when you come next time.)

1873
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:29,737
- It works.
- Are they all here...

1874
01:03:29,738 --> 01:03:31,067
to see Yuk Seong Jae?

1875
01:03:31,068 --> 01:03:33,407
- RIIZE is coming.
- RIIZE?

1876
01:03:33,408 --> 01:03:35,477
Seong Jae will be here, and RIIZE will also be here.

1877
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,008
- RIIZE?
- The fans...

1878
01:03:37,308 --> 01:03:39,517
There are so many celebrities in Seongsu-dong.

1879
01:03:39,518 --> 01:03:40,518
Really?

1880
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:41,977
There are many pop-up stores.

1881
01:03:41,978 --> 01:03:42,987
Where?

1882
01:03:42,988 --> 01:03:46,218
Seoul is very interesting.

1883
01:03:46,388 --> 01:03:49,428
The popular places keep shifting.

1884
01:03:49,988 --> 01:03:51,627
That's true. The streets...

1885
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:54,297
Right? It moved from Garosu-gil...

1886
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:56,827
to Yeonnam-dong and so on.

1887
01:03:56,828 --> 01:03:58,627
The hotel here has changed.

1888
01:03:58,628 --> 01:04:00,037
I used to live...

1889
01:04:00,038 --> 01:04:01,597
- in that apartment.
- Really?

1890
01:04:01,598 --> 01:04:04,198
Was there anything that shocked you when you first came to Seoul?

1891
01:04:04,338 --> 01:04:06,608
When I first came here to audition,

1892
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:09,307
I went to Gangnam, and the buildings were so tall.

1893
01:04:09,308 --> 01:04:10,777
I had never seen that before.

1894
01:04:10,778 --> 01:04:12,248
- Even in those years?
- Right.

1895
01:04:12,848 --> 01:04:14,517
In my neighborhood,

1896
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,687
the tallest building was 15 floors high.

1897
01:04:16,688 --> 01:04:17,717
In those years.

1898
01:04:17,718 --> 01:04:19,918
I was really shocked by the skyscrapers.

1899
01:04:20,088 --> 01:04:21,217
"Is this Seoul?"

1900
01:04:21,218 --> 01:04:23,258
- I was also shocked.
- Right.

1901
01:04:23,428 --> 01:04:25,387
I was shocked by people's fashion styles.

1902
01:04:25,388 --> 01:04:26,627
The fashion shocked you?

1903
01:04:26,628 --> 01:04:28,927
I always hung out in Apgujeong after my debut.

1904
01:04:28,928 --> 01:04:29,997
It was the buildings for me.

1905
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:31,027
(The fashion of Gen X was unique.)

1906
01:04:31,028 --> 01:04:33,467
I was intimidated by the fashion of the people in Apgujeong.

1907
01:04:33,468 --> 01:04:35,268
I still get intimidated when I go to Gangnam.

1908
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,708
Places like Apgujeong Station or Gangnam Station.

1909
01:04:37,768 --> 01:04:39,288
- Places like Cheongdam-dong.
- Right.

1910
01:04:39,578 --> 01:04:41,238
I don't have many memories of Seoul.

1911
01:04:41,908 --> 01:04:43,047
I worked here.

1912
01:04:43,048 --> 01:04:45,207
Since I work here,

1913
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:47,178
the image I have of Seoul...

1914
01:04:47,378 --> 01:04:50,747
is a really busy place where I have to work.

1915
01:04:50,748 --> 01:04:52,147
- Right.
- I would just hang out...

1916
01:04:52,148 --> 01:04:54,417
in Hongdae, and if I see people like Sae Ho,

1917
01:04:54,418 --> 01:04:56,527
I would say, "I saw Sae Ho today."

1918
01:04:56,528 --> 01:04:57,628
Right.

1919
01:04:57,888 --> 01:05:01,398
(To some, it's a dream city.)

1920
01:05:01,858 --> 01:05:04,568
(To some, it's an ordinary town.)

1921
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:06,938
(The past and the present coexist.)

1922
01:05:07,998 --> 01:05:13,008
(Seoul has a variety of charms.)

1923
01:05:14,438 --> 01:05:15,478
Right.

1924
01:05:15,638 --> 01:05:17,647
Instead. Cheongnyangni?

1925
01:05:17,648 --> 01:05:20,778
(Let's excitedly drive through the streets of Seoul.)

1926
01:05:21,348 --> 01:05:23,648
Joon isn't from Seoul, right?

1927
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:26,157
- I lived in Seoul for many years.
- Really?

1928
01:05:26,158 --> 01:05:28,088
I went to high school in Seoul.

1929
01:05:28,188 --> 01:05:29,428
- High school?
- Yes.

1930
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:32,088
I lived in Bundang until I was in middle school.

1931
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,697
In my high school days,

1932
01:05:34,698 --> 01:05:35,757
I lived near Gwanghwamun.

1933
01:05:35,758 --> 01:05:37,804
- Seoul Girls' High School?
- Behind the Blue House. Yes.

1934
01:05:37,828 --> 01:05:39,538
We have something to tell you.

1935
01:05:40,168 --> 01:05:43,937
Could you check the glove box in front of the passenger seat?

1936
01:05:43,938 --> 01:05:45,384
(The production crew tells them to open the glove box.)

1937
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,837
- There's something.
- All right.

1938
01:05:46,838 --> 01:05:48,438
What is it?

1939
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:52,977
(There's something in the glove box.)

1940
01:05:52,978 --> 01:05:54,148
Is it a gift?

1941
01:05:54,978 --> 01:05:56,688
What? There's a mission.

1942
01:05:56,848 --> 01:05:57,918
What?

1943
01:05:58,848 --> 01:06:01,388
(There's a mission card in the glove box.)

1944
01:06:01,518 --> 01:06:03,487
Why is there a mission out of the blue?

1945
01:06:03,488 --> 01:06:04,558
(What mission?)

1946
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:06,128
What is it?

1947
01:06:06,998 --> 01:06:08,627
"Use the 100-dollar shopping budget..."

1948
01:06:08,628 --> 01:06:10,798
"to complete the outfits for all members..."

1949
01:06:10,898 --> 01:06:12,467
"and have them walk as models..."

1950
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,037
"in the SEOUL 2079 FW Fashion Show!"

1951
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:16,207
- What? We'll be models in a show?
- The 2079 show?

1952
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:17,838
What? We'll be models in a show?

1953
01:06:18,038 --> 01:06:19,977
(He freezes.)

1954
01:06:19,978 --> 01:06:23,778
The SEOUL 2079 Fashion Show will take place today.

1955
01:06:23,848 --> 01:06:25,578
- Your...
- Of 2079?

1956
01:06:25,878 --> 01:06:26,878
Yes.

1957
01:06:26,879 --> 01:06:29,518
We're on our way to prepare for the fashion show.

1958
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:31,647
Both teams should prepare...

1959
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:33,288
your outfits and accessories...

1960
01:06:33,418 --> 01:06:35,457
with that money.

1961
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,128
(Each team is given 100 dollars!)

1962
01:06:37,188 --> 01:06:38,457
This is nice. I love things like this.

1963
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:40,527
If we have Sae Ho...

1964
01:06:40,528 --> 01:06:42,797
- Let's do it.
- You're the CEO.

1965
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:44,167
That's right. Hold on.

1966
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,667
They have no interest in fashion.

1967
01:06:46,668 --> 01:06:49,337
- A bit futuristic.
- They're horrible at fashion.

1968
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,738
- That's right.
- Futuristic.

1969
01:06:50,768 --> 01:06:52,938
They know nothing about fashion.

1970
01:06:53,138 --> 01:06:54,308
It's a relief.

1971
01:06:54,638 --> 01:06:55,677
Nice.

1972
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:56,807
Then...

1973
01:06:56,808 --> 01:06:58,608
- Okay.
- You can do that.

1974
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:00,347
Let's just use 30 dollars and use 70 dollars...

1975
01:07:00,348 --> 01:07:01,948
- to eat something.
- Can we do that?

1976
01:07:02,778 --> 01:07:04,147
(We don't know fashion, but we know food.)

1977
01:07:04,148 --> 01:07:07,517
Also, it's 2079 FW.

1978
01:07:07,518 --> 01:07:09,158
FW?

1979
01:07:09,828 --> 01:07:11,928
- Fall and winter.
- Fall and winter?

1980
01:07:12,058 --> 01:07:14,697
I just realized what it stands for.

1981
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:15,857
- Really?
- Really?

1982
01:07:15,858 --> 01:07:17,167
You're amazing. Please step out.

1983
01:07:17,168 --> 01:07:18,328
I'll hang up.

1984
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:20,837
- That means fall and winter?
- Right.

1985
01:07:20,838 --> 01:07:22,797
Right. FW.

1986
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:24,067
Fall and winter.

1987
01:07:24,068 --> 01:07:26,349
- I thought it meant fashion.
- What's spring and summer?

1988
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:28,837
Year 2079 is pretty far ahead in the future.

1989
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:29,847
How old are we?

1990
01:07:29,848 --> 01:07:31,177
If it's 2079...

1991
01:07:31,178 --> 01:07:32,578
Jong Min is 101 years old.

1992
01:07:32,808 --> 01:07:33,847
- You...
- If it's 2079...

1993
01:07:33,848 --> 01:07:34,918
You're already dead.

1994
01:07:35,248 --> 01:07:37,218
- If it's 2079...
- You're already dead.

1995
01:07:37,688 --> 01:07:38,718
Goodness.

1996
01:07:39,758 --> 01:07:41,388
Would I be alive?

1997
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:42,817
No.

1998
01:07:42,818 --> 01:07:44,188
(Hitting him with the fact)

1999
01:07:44,558 --> 01:07:46,227
You can't be so sure either.

2000
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,158
- How old am I?
- If it's after 54 years.

2001
01:07:48,628 --> 01:07:50,268
You'd be almost 80. Around 75.

2002
01:07:50,528 --> 01:07:53,097
I would also be around 78.

2003
01:07:53,098 --> 01:07:54,237
(They each give words of blessing before the show.)

2004
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:56,067
- If it's 2079, - Yes.

2005
01:07:56,068 --> 01:07:58,638
That's 54 years later, since it's 2025 now.

2006
01:07:59,238 --> 01:08:01,837
What style do you think would be popular then?

2007
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:03,177
- In 2079?
- Yes.

2008
01:08:03,178 --> 01:08:04,977
Fashion is something...

2009
01:08:04,978 --> 01:08:07,078
- It comes back.
- that repeats itself.

2010
01:08:07,518 --> 01:08:08,818
Actually,

2011
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,947
I think classic cars look cool.

2012
01:08:11,948 --> 01:08:14,187
I think old-style items look cooler...

2013
01:08:14,188 --> 01:08:16,887
for furniture and other things.

2014
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:19,897
Y2K of the 90s is trending now.

2015
01:08:19,898 --> 01:08:21,197
- Right.
- These days.

2016
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,198
If Y2K is trending now...

2017
01:08:23,898 --> 01:08:27,097
That trended 25 years ago.

2018
01:08:27,098 --> 01:08:28,967
- Twenty years?
- Yes.

2019
01:08:28,968 --> 01:08:30,867
- It's exactly 20 years ago.
- Yes.

2020
01:08:30,868 --> 01:08:32,837
By that time, the AI...

2021
01:08:32,838 --> 01:08:34,737
- and machines...
- Right.

2022
01:08:34,738 --> 01:08:37,747
Would move like people.

2023
01:08:37,748 --> 01:08:39,347
- Right.
- So I think...

2024
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,878
we could wear sunglasses and look futuristic.

2025
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:43,648
- Yes.
- Like that.

2026
01:08:44,018 --> 01:08:46,287
- We could go with silver.
- Nice.

2027
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,687
- A bit...
- A metallic vibe.

2028
01:08:47,688 --> 01:08:49,658
- Like cyber people?
- Yes.

2029
01:08:50,658 --> 01:08:52,787
I definitely think the classic style is right.

2030
01:08:52,788 --> 01:08:53,997
I don't know much about fashion...

2031
01:08:53,998 --> 01:08:55,998
- Let's go and see first.
- Okay.

2032
01:08:56,058 --> 01:08:58,497
What should we wear in 2079?

2033
01:08:58,498 --> 01:09:02,938
(Where are they heading to prepare the 2079 FW?)

2034
01:09:03,368 --> 01:09:07,877
(The second famous spot)

2035
01:09:07,878 --> 01:09:09,337
(Dongmyo)

2036
01:09:09,338 --> 01:09:10,778
It's my first time ever in Dongmyo.

2037
01:09:12,108 --> 01:09:18,148
(The market where you can travel back to Seoul in the past)

2038
01:09:19,918 --> 01:09:25,028
(Behind the traditional market, )

2039
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:32,528
(there is a fashion spot where you can find everything.)

2040
01:09:34,568 --> 01:09:38,268
(Dazzling)

2041
01:09:39,438 --> 01:09:45,148
(It's the best spot for fashion people.)

2042
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:49,988
(You are invited to the time machine in the middle of the city.)

2043
01:09:52,118 --> 01:09:53,457
This is the start.

2044
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:54,957
- This is it?
- All right.

2045
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,257
Do you know this place well?

2046
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:58,028
I came here a while back.

2047
01:09:58,488 --> 01:10:01,298
Let's take a look at this, for example.

2048
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:04,268
These gloves can be used.

2049
01:10:04,498 --> 01:10:05,997
We have to watch these things carefully.

2050
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:07,938
Let's keep a close eye on them.

2051
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:10,737
It'll be important to match the items.

2052
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:11,907
(They will miss the fashion items if they don't pay attention.)

2053
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:13,608
- If that time comes, - Yes?

2054
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:17,107
Won't the genderless theme be a big thing?

2055
01:10:17,108 --> 01:10:19,347
- Right.
- Joon might... Come here.

2056
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:20,348
That could be true.

2057
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,448
Wouldn't Joon wear something like this?

2058
01:10:22,578 --> 01:10:25,447
- Oh, come on.
- Joon would look amazing in this.

2059
01:10:25,448 --> 01:10:27,357
- That would be nice.
- He would look nice in this.

2060
01:10:27,358 --> 01:10:29,058
You're going that far?

2061
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:30,857
And for the pants...

2062
01:10:30,858 --> 01:10:33,697
The owner here has organized everything well.

2063
01:10:33,698 --> 01:10:35,057
This means the clothes are more expensive.

2064
01:10:35,058 --> 01:10:36,127
- We should dig through a pile.
- We should find a place...

2065
01:10:36,128 --> 01:10:37,167
where we have to dig through a pile.

2066
01:10:37,168 --> 01:10:39,168
You have to have hawk eyes...

2067
01:10:39,428 --> 01:10:41,398
when you look through this place.

2068
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:44,608
This place has everything.

2069
01:10:45,138 --> 01:10:46,338
Let's move further in.

2070
01:10:47,078 --> 01:10:48,208
This is amazing.

2071
01:10:49,338 --> 01:10:51,877
- What do we get?
- We should set a theme.

2072
01:10:51,878 --> 01:10:53,417
- Right. What should we do?
- What should we do?

2073
01:10:53,418 --> 01:10:55,538
You should set a theme for us. You know fashion well.

2074
01:10:55,648 --> 01:10:57,547
- I'm not sure.
- All right. From now on,

2075
01:10:57,548 --> 01:10:59,317
- That startled me!
- you will get 15 minutes...

2076
01:10:59,318 --> 01:11:00,717
- to go shopping.
- We get 15 minutes?

2077
01:11:00,718 --> 01:11:03,427
- We get 15 minutes?
- Yes. Shop for 15 minutes.

2078
01:11:03,428 --> 01:11:05,558
We get 15 minutes? Hold on.

2079
01:11:05,858 --> 01:11:08,528
It'll be hard if there's a time limit.

2080
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:10,768
We have to run then.

2081
01:11:10,898 --> 01:11:12,297
- Where's Sae Ho?
- I'm here.

2082
01:11:12,298 --> 01:11:13,938
- We get 15 minutes.
- We get 15 minutes?

2083
01:11:14,638 --> 01:11:15,667
Just 15 minutes? Gosh.

2084
01:11:15,668 --> 01:11:16,707
- Hold on.
- The pants are three dollars?

2085
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:17,738
Three dollars.

2086
01:11:17,768 --> 01:11:19,338
What sizes do you have?

2087
01:11:19,638 --> 01:11:21,737
Gosh, I don't have a clue.

2088
01:11:21,738 --> 01:11:23,807
(Team Lim Joon Ho starts shopping right away!)

2089
01:11:23,808 --> 01:11:25,547
Great.

2090
01:11:25,548 --> 01:11:26,918
They look nice.

2091
01:11:27,378 --> 01:11:28,848
You get 15 minutes to shop.

2092
01:11:28,978 --> 01:11:30,348
- From now on?
- Go!

2093
01:11:31,188 --> 01:11:35,688
(Seoul 2079 FW in Dongmyo)

2094
01:11:35,818 --> 01:11:38,527
This isn't easy. I can't even choose my own outfit.

2095
01:11:38,528 --> 01:11:39,528
Same here.

2096
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:41,874
(What kind of look will be created in Dongmyo Flea Market?)

2097
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:43,868
- I have no idea.
- What do we do?

2098
01:11:44,198 --> 01:11:45,828
- I've never done this.
- Same here.

2099
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:47,268
What do we do?

2100
01:11:48,838 --> 01:11:51,507
(Sae Ho goes into a vintage shop on his own.)

2101
01:11:51,508 --> 01:11:53,038
- Hello.
- Hello.

2102
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,178
Do you happen to have any swimming caps?

2103
01:11:55,408 --> 01:11:56,647
- Swimming caps?
- Any sort of caps.

2104
01:11:56,648 --> 01:11:58,148
These are nice.

2105
01:11:59,978 --> 01:12:01,677
- How much is that?
- It's 20 dollars.

2106
01:12:01,678 --> 01:12:02,818
It's 20 dollars?

2107
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:04,647
Is there anything that's cheaper?

2108
01:12:04,648 --> 01:12:07,257
(It's more expensive than what he thought.)

2109
01:12:07,258 --> 01:12:09,687
How is this? Doesn't it have a cyber feel?

2110
01:12:09,688 --> 01:12:10,787
This one has that feel.

2111
01:12:10,788 --> 01:12:13,127
This has a cyber feel.

2112
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:14,128
(Joon finds a bulletproof vest with a cyber feel.)

2113
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,428
- It's expensive.
- It's expensive? It's ten dollars?

2114
01:12:16,528 --> 01:12:17,867
It's not bad.

2115
01:12:17,868 --> 01:12:19,297
This one has a cyber feel.

2116
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:22,037
I think this one looks nice as it doesn't feel normal.

2117
01:12:22,038 --> 01:12:24,137
You never know if there will be a war at that time.

2118
01:12:24,138 --> 01:12:27,277
One person should be dressed to prepare for war.

2119
01:12:27,278 --> 01:12:28,877
- What?
- What?

2120
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:30,524
The guy who doesn't know anything about fashion is here.

2121
01:12:30,548 --> 01:12:32,647
All three of us know nothing.

2122
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:34,717
They are people who don't know fashion at all.

2123
01:12:34,718 --> 01:12:36,787
Don't show them our ideas. They don't know fashion at all.

2124
01:12:36,788 --> 01:12:38,147
- The kids are here to shop.
- These look like overalls...

2125
01:12:38,148 --> 01:12:39,518
chosen by one's mother.

2126
01:12:39,548 --> 01:12:40,818
Hey, how is this one?

2127
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:42,917
(Hanbok in 2079?)

2128
01:12:42,918 --> 01:12:45,888
It will be a mixture of the Eastern and Western style.

2129
01:12:46,188 --> 01:12:47,998
How does it sound?

2130
01:12:48,358 --> 01:12:50,627
Sounds good. You should take the lead for us.

2131
01:12:50,628 --> 01:12:52,127
Seon Ho and I don't know how to choose clothes.

2132
01:12:52,128 --> 01:12:53,128
- Right.
- Right?

2133
01:12:53,129 --> 01:12:54,797
I can't call my stylist, right?

2134
01:12:54,798 --> 01:12:56,338
You can't do that.

2135
01:12:56,938 --> 01:12:59,108
These places are nice.

2136
01:12:59,538 --> 01:13:00,808
These places are nice.

2137
01:13:00,878 --> 01:13:01,878
(A pile of used clothes)

2138
01:13:01,879 --> 01:13:02,977
- Sae Ho.
- Yes?

2139
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,577
You have to come up with the theme for us.

2140
01:13:04,578 --> 01:13:07,048
(There are used shoes as well.)

2141
01:13:07,078 --> 01:13:09,847
Sae Ho, don't these look futuristic?

2142
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:11,047
They're great.

2143
01:13:11,048 --> 01:13:12,624
(Joon finds rain boots after finding the vest.)

2144
01:13:12,648 --> 01:13:13,857
Sae Ho!

2145
01:13:13,858 --> 01:13:15,898
- It looks very nice.
- How do they match together?

2146
01:13:16,218 --> 01:13:17,587
It looks nice.

2147
01:13:17,588 --> 01:13:19,927
This is worn with nothing inside. Like this.

2148
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:21,557
- Personally...
- Like the K-Demon.

2149
01:13:21,558 --> 01:13:23,367
- It's not bad. I like the colors.
- This is what I personally think.

2150
01:13:23,368 --> 01:13:25,197
With this, you should wear shoes.

2151
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:26,697
(Sae Ho chooses DinDin's shoes.)

2152
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:28,297
It's 250mm.

2153
01:13:28,298 --> 01:13:29,767
- Right.
- Jong Min!

2154
01:13:29,768 --> 01:13:31,837
- Will you buy it?
- I already bought it.

2155
01:13:31,838 --> 01:13:32,968
- Really?
- Yes.

2156
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:35,438
(He almost lost his futuristic boots.)

2157
01:13:36,508 --> 01:13:37,947
Shoes are five dollars.

2158
01:13:37,948 --> 01:13:40,028
(How much will the clothes DinDin have chosen cost?)

2159
01:13:40,118 --> 01:13:42,347
The dress is five dollars.

2160
01:13:42,348 --> 01:13:43,417
- It's five dollars?
- Yes.

2161
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:45,287
The robe is 30 dollars.

2162
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:46,788
Gosh, it's quite expensive.

2163
01:13:47,218 --> 01:13:48,258
Can it not be cheaper?

2164
01:13:48,418 --> 01:13:49,717
This one? Then I'll take 20 dollars.

2165
01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:51,027
It'll be 20 dollars?

2166
01:13:51,028 --> 01:13:52,028
- Okay.
- Okay.

2167
01:13:52,029 --> 01:13:54,028
We're planning to use 100 dollars here.

2168
01:13:54,228 --> 01:13:55,858
I talked it out!

2169
01:13:56,228 --> 01:13:57,298
This is amazing.

2170
01:13:57,598 --> 01:13:59,027
It wasn't from this place.

2171
01:13:59,028 --> 01:14:00,997
There was the bulletproof vest earlier.

2172
01:14:00,998 --> 01:14:02,274
Wear that without wearing anything underneath.

2173
01:14:02,298 --> 01:14:04,138
Wear that without wearing anything underneath?

2174
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:08,007
(I have to get undressed again?)

2175
01:14:08,008 --> 01:14:09,078
How much is it?

2176
01:14:09,308 --> 01:14:10,807
You should be able to wear it without anything underneath.

2177
01:14:10,808 --> 01:14:13,348
(Joon heads back to the vest store.)

2178
01:14:13,478 --> 01:14:15,078
- It's five dollars.
- Right.

2179
01:14:15,378 --> 01:14:17,318
Won't it look nice with the hat?

2180
01:14:17,918 --> 01:14:19,447
The rain boots can be worn with this.

2181
01:14:19,448 --> 01:14:20,757
- The rain boots.
- Right.

2182
01:14:20,758 --> 01:14:22,464
You'll put on rain boots and wear nothing underneath.

2183
01:14:22,488 --> 01:14:23,557
- Wear nothing underneath.
- Wear nothing underneath.

2184
01:14:23,558 --> 01:14:26,127
But won't it... It should be fine.

2185
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,288
How much? Was it ten dollars?

2186
01:14:27,998 --> 01:14:29,258
We have to get that too.

2187
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,268
- Sae Ho.
- Excuse me?

2188
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:33,738
Thank you.

2189
01:14:34,298 --> 01:14:36,297
(He even directs how the outfit should be worn.)

2190
01:14:36,298 --> 01:14:38,837
My eye is... Must I give up seeing with one eye?

2191
01:14:38,838 --> 01:14:41,208
Yes. You're missing pants.

2192
01:14:41,608 --> 01:14:43,008
You need some pants.

2193
01:14:43,238 --> 01:14:44,707
Hold on.

2194
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:46,178
We need to get more.

2195
01:14:47,078 --> 01:14:48,477
- Gosh.
- Right.

2196
01:14:48,478 --> 01:14:50,148
You should just be wearing this.

2197
01:14:50,288 --> 01:14:51,747
Wear this.

2198
01:14:51,748 --> 01:14:53,387
- But...
- Wear this under the vest.

2199
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:54,457
- Right.
- Don't wear any pants.

2200
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:56,417
- Don't wear any pants?
- Don't wear any pants.

2201
01:14:56,418 --> 01:14:57,487
- Don't wear any pants?
- Right.

2202
01:14:57,488 --> 01:14:58,957
- This will be the pants.
- Hold this.

2203
01:14:58,958 --> 01:14:59,958
But I should wear pants.

2204
01:14:59,959 --> 01:15:01,657
- Like this.
- I'm still an adult.

2205
01:15:01,658 --> 01:15:03,627
- It's fine. Wait right here.
- But...

2206
01:15:03,628 --> 01:15:04,697
I'm turning 40 soon.

2207
01:15:04,698 --> 01:15:06,997
- It has this part down here.
- But...

2208
01:15:06,998 --> 01:15:08,337
You'll have a better chance to get married.

2209
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:09,967
That's not the problem.

2210
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:11,328
You will show more of your charms.

2211
01:15:11,568 --> 01:15:13,507
I don't think people will be wearing this in the future.

2212
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:15,254
(His outfit is complete as the revealing look.)

2213
01:15:15,278 --> 01:15:16,637
Hey, we're done.

2214
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:18,308
But I don't think it will fit.

2215
01:15:18,508 --> 01:15:19,788
- It's a bit small.
- Let's see.

2216
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:21,448
Will it fit him? He's 120kg.

2217
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:23,447
(They have to find XXXL-sized clothes.)

2218
01:15:23,448 --> 01:15:25,164
Will it be okay for the one that weighs 120kg?

2219
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:26,757
I weigh 120kg.

2220
01:15:26,758 --> 01:15:28,594
(I've never seen anyone who weighs 120kg before.)

2221
01:15:28,618 --> 01:15:31,557
We'll look around more.

2222
01:15:31,558 --> 01:15:33,957
- Let's look around.
- This place is paradise.

2223
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:35,358
Let's walk through the place.

2224
01:15:36,128 --> 01:15:37,267
- Seon Ho.
- Yes?

2225
01:15:37,268 --> 01:15:38,268
How is this one?

2226
01:15:38,428 --> 01:15:39,868
- Try it on.
- Right.

2227
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:41,597
(They find similar cycling tights that Joon had.)

2228
01:15:41,598 --> 01:15:42,767
This is definitely your style.

2229
01:15:42,768 --> 01:15:44,607
Gosh! You're the only one who can wear this.

2230
01:15:44,608 --> 01:15:45,767
- This will be hilarious.
- I can't wear this.

2231
01:15:45,768 --> 01:15:47,708
Shouldn't this be worn the other way around?

2232
01:15:47,878 --> 01:15:50,447
Gosh! Should I wear it then?

2233
01:15:50,448 --> 01:15:51,708
Take a look. This can be worn.

2234
01:15:51,778 --> 01:15:52,847
Can it not be worn from the top?

2235
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:54,417
- We saw that jacket earlier.
- Right.

2236
01:15:54,418 --> 01:15:55,917
The jacket can be worn without wearing anything inside.

2237
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,687
- It will be worn with that.
- Can you pull it off?

2238
01:15:57,688 --> 01:15:58,787
This is five dollars.

2239
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:00,058
- It's five dollars?
- Yes.

2240
01:16:00,258 --> 01:16:01,258
We have to buy a top.

2241
01:16:01,259 --> 01:16:02,779
Let's come back after getting the top.

2242
01:16:02,818 --> 01:16:05,127
- We have to hurry.
- We have to hurry.

2243
01:16:05,128 --> 01:16:06,327
Hurry up. Bring the money.

2244
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:07,497
(Let's get the jacket that looks good with the tights.)

2245
01:16:07,498 --> 01:16:08,528
- Hurry.
- Right.

2246
01:16:08,858 --> 01:16:10,267
What are these? They're suit jackets!

2247
01:16:10,268 --> 01:16:12,297
Right. We can use these.

2248
01:16:12,298 --> 01:16:13,637
- This one.
- This one?

2249
01:16:13,638 --> 01:16:15,297
It should be a class suit jacket.

2250
01:16:15,298 --> 01:16:16,597
Will you put on a tie?

2251
01:16:16,598 --> 01:16:17,967
- This one looks nice, right?
- It's nice.

2252
01:16:17,968 --> 01:16:19,368
Try it on.

2253
01:16:21,108 --> 01:16:22,777
- You look nice.
- It's perfect.

2254
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,007
I like the feel of it.

2255
01:16:24,008 --> 01:16:25,277
- These will be the pants.
- Right.

2256
01:16:25,278 --> 01:16:26,278
Okay.

2257
01:16:27,118 --> 01:16:29,848
(Jong Min continued to shop like crazy after that.)

2258
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,417
What's this? There's a necktie.

2259
01:16:31,418 --> 01:16:32,594
(He bought a necktie that went well with the jacket.)

2260
01:16:32,618 --> 01:16:34,488
This necktie is amazing.

2261
01:16:34,558 --> 01:16:36,318
Something that might suit the pants.

2262
01:16:36,518 --> 01:16:37,727
It has a Spartan look.

2263
01:16:37,728 --> 01:16:39,248
- Will it fit?
- It should fit though.

2264
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:40,398
It's 240mm.

2265
01:16:41,558 --> 01:16:42,558
Smaller shoes will be worn in the future.

2266
01:16:42,559 --> 01:16:43,597
Okay.

2267
01:16:43,598 --> 01:16:45,127
We need sunglasses.

2268
01:16:45,128 --> 01:16:46,598
(He shops for just his items.)

2269
01:16:46,728 --> 01:16:48,638
I'll be wearing sports pants.

2270
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:51,708
They look nice. Won't you need them for your album?

2271
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,008
How much are these?

2272
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:56,308
They're 30 dollars.

2273
01:16:56,508 --> 01:16:58,307
- They're expensive.
- They're expensive.

2274
01:16:58,308 --> 01:17:00,277
- These are 10 dollars.
- They're 10 dollars?

2275
01:17:00,278 --> 01:17:01,747
- They're ten dollars?
- Let's go for those.

2276
01:17:01,748 --> 01:17:02,877
(Jong Min)

2277
01:17:02,878 --> 01:17:03,987
Let's get a decent one.

2278
01:17:03,988 --> 01:17:05,317
(The eldest gets the most excited in Dongmyo Flea Market.)

2279
01:17:05,318 --> 01:17:07,358
- Can't you try these on, Se Yoon?
- These?

2280
01:17:08,088 --> 01:17:09,358
They're reading glasses?

2281
01:17:11,488 --> 01:17:13,798
Gosh, I feel dizzy!

2282
01:17:14,028 --> 01:17:16,097
- Gosh, I feel dizzy.
- These aren't bad.

2283
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,428
These look nice.

2284
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,737
How much should we bring it down?

2285
01:17:20,738 --> 01:17:22,418
- What?
- Should we try to get a discount?

2286
01:17:23,908 --> 01:17:25,967
(They now look for Se Yoon's clothes.)

2287
01:17:25,968 --> 01:17:27,038
Gosh.

2288
01:17:27,578 --> 01:17:29,107
- Hey.
- What do I do?

2289
01:17:29,108 --> 01:17:31,278
Do you want to put on a blanket over you?

2290
01:17:32,078 --> 01:17:33,178
(Laughing)

2291
01:17:34,348 --> 01:17:35,717
You can sleep anywhere.

2292
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:37,287
Right. That's not a bad idea.

2293
01:17:37,288 --> 01:17:38,347
Let's go with this.

2294
01:17:38,348 --> 01:17:40,688
I'll wear this below.

2295
01:17:40,818 --> 01:17:43,318
I'll cover myself up and put the blanket over me.

2296
01:17:43,728 --> 01:17:45,327
Let's go with that.

2297
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:48,758
(A strategy of going with a blanket as it's hard to find his size)

2298
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,367
Jong Min is really enjoying it.

2299
01:17:50,368 --> 01:17:51,397
(He laughs genuinely at the thought of making fun of Se Yoon.)

2300
01:17:51,398 --> 01:17:53,767
- He's laughing for real.
- You'll go with that?

2301
01:17:53,768 --> 01:17:55,797
This will be the pants. This will...

2302
01:17:55,798 --> 01:17:57,707
- be the top.
- This will be the top.

2303
01:17:57,708 --> 01:17:59,237
(Strategy for the one who weighs 120kg)

2304
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:00,778
(Hang things over him.)

2305
01:18:00,978 --> 01:18:02,307
- I like that idea.
- Right.

2306
01:18:02,308 --> 01:18:04,347
Find me something special like that for me as well.

2307
01:18:04,348 --> 01:18:05,977
Let's see. Come here.

2308
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:07,954
(What kind of outfit will he recommend this time?)

2309
01:18:07,978 --> 01:18:10,588
You should carry one of these.

2310
01:18:10,748 --> 01:18:12,648
- It's a genderless generation.
- Okay.

2311
01:18:12,748 --> 01:18:14,258
Carry this.

2312
01:18:14,858 --> 01:18:16,417
This place has a lot of nice ones.

2313
01:18:16,418 --> 01:18:17,628
Something like this.

2314
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:20,497
It will come down like this.

2315
01:18:20,498 --> 01:18:21,927
It will be too short for me. My underwear will be seen.

2316
01:18:21,928 --> 01:18:22,957
No way!

2317
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:24,697
- My underwear will be seen.
- Try it on.

2318
01:18:24,698 --> 01:18:26,398
- My underwear will be seen.
- Try it on!

2319
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:29,137
Wear it like a dress with just your underwear on.

2320
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:31,468
- My underwear will be seen.
- It won't!

2321
01:18:31,938 --> 01:18:32,967
Look at this! My underwear is here!

2322
01:18:32,968 --> 01:18:34,008
Hold on.

2323
01:18:34,508 --> 01:18:36,077
Let's see. I like it like this.

2324
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:38,177
(He even fixes his outfit for him.)

2325
01:18:38,178 --> 01:18:39,618
It might be like this in the future.

2326
01:18:40,418 --> 01:18:41,518
Genderless?

2327
01:18:42,148 --> 01:18:43,647
Let's go with that feel.

2328
01:18:43,648 --> 01:18:44,648
(The 3 who don't know fashion feel very worrying.)

2329
01:18:44,649 --> 01:18:46,087
- Could we get these?
- Okay.

2330
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:47,617
Please give us a good price.

2331
01:18:47,618 --> 01:18:48,818
We're getting a lot of things.

2332
01:18:49,088 --> 01:18:50,557
How much are they each?

2333
01:18:50,558 --> 01:18:52,357
(How much will it cost them?)

2334
01:18:52,358 --> 01:18:53,558
Two of these.

2335
01:18:53,728 --> 01:18:55,257
- These 2 will be 2 dollars.
- They will be 2 dollars.

2336
01:18:55,258 --> 01:18:56,357
The blanket.

2337
01:18:56,358 --> 01:18:58,398
- This will be 3 dollars.
- Will it be 1 dollar?

2338
01:18:58,528 --> 01:18:59,927
- Three dollars.
- Yes.

2339
01:18:59,928 --> 01:19:01,398
- As it's a blanket?
- Right.

2340
01:19:01,768 --> 01:19:02,867
Are you serious?

2341
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:04,984
(Se Yoon's look was put together with just 5 dollars.)

2342
01:19:05,008 --> 01:19:06,008
Did we do well?

2343
01:19:06,009 --> 01:19:07,254
(We did get things, but did we do well?)

2344
01:19:07,278 --> 01:19:09,207
- We should go.
- I'll give you five minutes.

2345
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,678
We should go to buy accessories.

2346
01:19:11,508 --> 01:19:12,547
I should go.

2347
01:19:12,548 --> 01:19:15,447
(With 5 minutes left, Joon goes to buy accessories.)

2348
01:19:15,448 --> 01:19:17,548
I'll go over there.

2349
01:19:17,818 --> 01:19:19,487
(Joon arrives at the accessory store alone.)

2350
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:20,788
Hello.

2351
01:19:21,688 --> 01:19:23,758
Good. This is it.

2352
01:19:23,828 --> 01:19:25,057
This is strong.

2353
01:19:25,058 --> 01:19:26,858
These look great. How much is this one?

2354
01:19:27,498 --> 01:19:29,797
It's 35 dollars.

2355
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:32,097
Gosh, that's quite expensive.

2356
01:19:32,098 --> 01:19:33,227
(It's a whopping 35 dollars.)

2357
01:19:33,228 --> 01:19:35,938
I don't have enough money.

2358
01:19:36,498 --> 01:19:38,237
- Which one?
- This one.

2359
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:40,238
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

2360
01:19:40,938 --> 01:19:42,108
I'll make it 30 dollars.

2361
01:19:43,338 --> 01:19:44,347
To be cheaper...

2362
01:19:44,348 --> 01:19:45,508
No.

2363
01:19:45,678 --> 01:19:47,718
Can you make it a little cheaper than that?

2364
01:19:48,878 --> 01:19:49,878
(Shaking her head)

2365
01:19:49,879 --> 01:19:51,617
I really don't have money.

2366
01:19:51,618 --> 01:19:53,048
No.

2367
01:19:53,318 --> 01:19:55,518
Buy an accessory. We have some money left.

2368
01:19:55,858 --> 01:19:56,957
(Thanks to DinDin, he got a necklace for 30 dollars.)

2369
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,158
I should put this in here.

2370
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:02,558
Thank you, ma'am.

2371
01:20:03,128 --> 01:20:04,968
Have a nice day. Thank you.

2372
01:20:05,068 --> 01:20:06,767
(Current Status)

2373
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:10,638
(Jong Min, Se Yoon, Seon Ho, Joon, DinDin, Sae Ho)

2374
01:20:10,808 --> 01:20:12,537
What is this? Is it a tie?

2375
01:20:12,538 --> 01:20:14,537
(Time passes by as they're absorbed in shopping.)

2376
01:20:14,538 --> 01:20:15,837
You have one minute left.

2377
01:20:15,838 --> 01:20:17,077
- What?
- We have one minute left.

2378
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:18,278
Find something.

2379
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:20,547
How much is this one?

2380
01:20:20,548 --> 01:20:24,348
(After picking things for others, he finally gets stuff for himself.)

2381
01:20:26,148 --> 01:20:27,517
How much is this jacket?

2382
01:20:27,518 --> 01:20:30,528
(He's busy shopping alone.)

2383
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:33,087
This isn't so bad. Hang on.

2384
01:20:33,088 --> 01:20:34,097
(Will Sae Ho be able to finish shopping on time?)

2385
01:20:34,098 --> 01:20:35,197
Something like sunglasses.

2386
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:36,497
How much is this?

2387
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,467
(He has to find hidden treasures.)

2388
01:20:38,468 --> 01:20:39,628
How much is this?

2389
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:40,797
You have 30 seconds.

2390
01:20:40,798 --> 01:20:42,167
(Time is running out.)

2391
01:20:42,168 --> 01:20:43,238
Okay.

2392
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:45,207
Let's finish it here.

2393
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,637
- I'm done.
- Time's up.

2394
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:48,337
- The end.
- It's over.

2395
01:20:48,338 --> 01:20:49,578
Let's finish it.

2396
01:20:50,138 --> 01:20:53,678
(Fashionista Sae Ho's Dongmyo look is coming soon.)

2397
01:20:54,448 --> 01:20:55,677
(He gave it his all.)

2398
01:20:55,678 --> 01:20:56,778
I'm tired.

2399
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,787
Did you use all your money?

2400
01:20:58,788 --> 01:21:00,048
I used most of my money.

2401
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,758
- Let's go.
- I'm not sure if this is good.

2402
01:21:03,518 --> 01:21:04,657
Is this right?

2403
01:21:04,658 --> 01:21:05,758
- I don't know.
- This...

2404
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:08,758
It looks like I should sit here and make a fire.

2405
01:21:08,928 --> 01:21:10,828
I bought this because of you.

2406
01:21:11,028 --> 01:21:12,268
Did I buy the right thing?

2407
01:21:12,728 --> 01:21:16,168
(Let's go to the next place.)

2408
01:21:17,268 --> 01:21:21,077
(After shopping, the members head to the next spot.)

2409
01:21:21,078 --> 01:21:22,778
How much did you spend on the blanket?

2410
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:25,078
It was ten dollars in total.

2411
01:21:25,148 --> 01:21:26,778
Right. I heard it was three dollars.

2412
01:21:27,378 --> 01:21:29,047
(You can buy everything you need with 100 dollars.)

2413
01:21:29,048 --> 01:21:31,248
(Dongmyo Flea Market with miraculous prices)

2414
01:21:31,548 --> 01:21:33,918
- There are a lot of people here.
- Right.

2415
01:21:34,358 --> 01:21:36,788
Even if G-DRAGON came here, I wouldn't recognize him.

2416
01:21:37,428 --> 01:21:39,387
- Right.
- If he's here...

2417
01:21:39,388 --> 01:21:43,658
(Even Superstar G-DRAGON becomes an ordinary person here.)

2418
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:47,938
Things went well for us.

2419
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:49,478
- We bought good stuff.
- Right.

2420
01:21:49,998 --> 01:21:52,168
I'm excited about Joon's outfit.

2421
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:55,437
(Just thinking about the fashion makes him laugh.)

2422
01:21:55,438 --> 01:21:58,307
I'll make sure you won't look weird.

2423
01:21:58,308 --> 01:22:00,048
- Because...
- Even with my pants off?

2424
01:22:00,478 --> 01:22:02,878
You'll wear the robe after taking off the pants.

2425
01:22:03,448 --> 01:22:04,948
- Really?
- Yes, the robe.

2426
01:22:05,688 --> 01:22:08,287
Joon will look amazing if he wears the necklace...

2427
01:22:08,288 --> 01:22:10,118
on the shirt with a low neckline.

2428
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:12,427
It's like we're going on vacation...

2429
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,258
in the fall or winter of 2079.

2430
01:22:14,528 --> 01:22:17,197
We are going on a trip to Mars.

2431
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:19,467
It's the outfit for a trip to Mars.

2432
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:21,797
- Go to Mars.
- There's a story behind it.

2433
01:22:21,798 --> 01:22:23,198
From Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province...

2434
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:26,167
- Right.
- to Mars.

2435
01:22:26,168 --> 01:22:27,607
- That sounds great.
- I like that.

2436
01:22:27,608 --> 01:22:28,907
From Hwaseong to Mars.

2437
01:22:28,908 --> 01:22:30,507
- I like that. You're so good.
- Hwaseong to Mars.

2438
01:22:30,508 --> 01:22:32,578
That's right. It sounds good.

2439
01:22:32,848 --> 01:22:34,248
Hwaseong to Mars.

2440
01:22:34,878 --> 01:22:37,087
I'm sure we will be a lot better...

2441
01:22:37,088 --> 01:22:39,387
- than Team New and Old Love.
- Yes.

2442
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:41,388
This is how they look.

2443
01:22:41,888 --> 01:22:43,457
It looks like they're shopping for the first time in their lives.

2444
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,027
Exactly. They're worse than I am.

2445
01:22:45,028 --> 01:22:47,428
They were about to cry earlier. When they saw the clothes.

2446
01:22:48,058 --> 01:22:50,327
They didn't know what to do.

2447
01:22:50,328 --> 01:22:51,498
I feel bad for them.

2448
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:54,037
(What is the theme of Team New and Old Love's fashion?)

2449
01:22:54,038 --> 01:22:55,667
It is cool at night.

2450
01:22:55,668 --> 01:22:56,837
(What is the theme of Team New and Old Love's fashion?)

2451
01:22:56,838 --> 01:22:58,137
Let's think about our outfits.

2452
01:22:58,138 --> 01:22:59,908
- You have a formal suit.
- What?

2453
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:01,508
And...

2454
01:23:01,838 --> 01:23:03,908
- the see-through vest.
- Yes.

2455
01:23:04,248 --> 01:23:05,848
You should wear a tie too.

2456
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:07,877
- That's right.
- And...

2457
01:23:07,878 --> 01:23:09,117
- sunglasses.
- Yes.

2458
01:23:09,118 --> 01:23:10,317
- Okay. It's complete.
- It's perfect.

2459
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,818
I'll wrap the blanket around my waist.

2460
01:23:12,918 --> 01:23:16,718
Then I'll wear a tank top here.

2461
01:23:18,358 --> 01:23:20,357
(This is the dignity of the leader.)

2462
01:23:20,358 --> 01:23:22,158
I'll wear a towel around my head.

2463
01:23:22,398 --> 01:23:24,568
I'll also have a pillow with me.

2464
01:23:24,868 --> 01:23:27,068
I'll walk, take off the blanket,

2465
01:23:27,128 --> 01:23:29,367
shake it off, place the pillow, and sleep on it.

2466
01:23:29,368 --> 01:23:30,637
(He even cares about his performance.)

2467
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:31,638
Isn't that good?

2468
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:33,639
Then I'll put on the blanket and the pillow again.

2469
01:23:34,008 --> 01:23:35,338
This is what I'm going to do.

2470
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:36,408
And about you.

2471
01:23:36,409 --> 01:23:37,877
Still, you will look...

2472
01:23:37,878 --> 01:23:39,907
- quite fashionable.
- What do I do?

2473
01:23:39,908 --> 01:23:41,617
- It's all about individuality now.
- You should look cool.

2474
01:23:41,618 --> 01:23:43,647
You're like the headliner of a fashion show.

2475
01:23:43,648 --> 01:23:45,288
- Okay, I'll be the headliner.
- Yes.

2476
01:23:45,388 --> 01:23:46,628
- You're the headliner.
- Okay.

2477
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:49,058
- Nothing is impossible.
- We're done.

2478
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:50,558
We can do anything.

2479
01:23:51,858 --> 01:23:55,557
(While talking about fashion, )

2480
01:23:55,558 --> 01:23:58,968
(they've already arrived at the next spot.)

2481
01:24:00,768 --> 01:24:01,838
It's DDP.

2482
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:04,637
I used to come here a lot.

2483
01:24:04,638 --> 01:24:06,108
Places like this.

2484
01:24:07,608 --> 01:24:12,507
(The third tourist attraction)

2485
01:24:12,508 --> 01:24:14,948
(DDP)

2486
01:24:15,478 --> 01:24:21,218
(The center of Korean fashion)

2487
01:24:21,918 --> 01:24:27,658
(The mecca for fashionistas that leads global trends)

2488
01:24:28,558 --> 01:24:33,667
(The center of fashion)

2489
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:38,408
(2 Days 1 Night is at DDP!)

2490
01:24:38,538 --> 01:24:39,667
We're going to the DDP.

2491
01:24:39,668 --> 01:24:41,878
We're at the DDP. That's what I was thinking.

2492
01:24:42,138 --> 01:24:43,138
What?

2493
01:24:43,948 --> 01:24:45,948
We're not standing before the crowd, are we?

2494
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,448
It can't be a real fashion show.

2495
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,287
I'm afraid it might be a real fashion show.

2496
01:24:52,288 --> 01:24:53,847
- That can't be it.
- No way.

2497
01:24:53,848 --> 01:24:54,918
That's impossible.

2498
01:24:55,088 --> 01:24:57,008
(They also wonder if it is a real fashion show.)

2499
01:24:57,528 --> 01:24:59,988
(At that moment, at the DDP)

2500
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:04,768
(Something is drawing people's attention.)

2501
01:25:05,298 --> 01:25:09,298
(And people are gathered around it?)

2502
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:22,047
(A long catwalk...)

2503
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,348
(and a huge photo wall)

2504
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:32,788
(This catwalk has been graced by countless stars.)

2505
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,457
(The audience is waiting for stars.)

2506
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:38,668
(10 minutes left before the 2079 FW Fashion Show)

2507
01:25:39,568 --> 01:25:43,838
(Entering the DDP without knowing what will happen)

2508
01:25:43,898 --> 01:25:44,967
(Time to get changed)

2509
01:25:44,968 --> 01:25:47,938
Please go to the restroom and get changed right away.

2510
01:25:49,638 --> 01:25:52,347
(Traveling to the year 2079)

2511
01:25:52,348 --> 01:25:53,547
Take off your pants.

2512
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:55,517
Jong Min, my underpants are showing.

2513
01:25:55,518 --> 01:25:57,118
I don't care. They're not my underpants.

2514
01:25:57,788 --> 01:25:59,347
Put this belt on the dress.

2515
01:25:59,348 --> 01:26:01,557
- But this...
- It's all right.

2516
01:26:01,558 --> 01:26:02,957
Do you have nipple patches?

2517
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:04,628
- We have.
- I need eight patches.

2518
01:26:04,788 --> 01:26:07,228
- Because you're Zhu Bajie.
- I'm Zhu Bajie, so I need eight.

2519
01:26:08,558 --> 01:26:11,498
(What will they look like?)

2520
01:26:11,998 --> 01:26:14,998
(1 minute left before the 2079 FW Fashion Show)

2521
01:26:15,298 --> 01:26:17,238
(They will come out of here.)

2522
01:26:17,908 --> 01:26:19,938
(Expectant)

2523
01:26:21,038 --> 01:26:23,808
(The first model to take the catwalk)

2524
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:28,517
Has it begun already?

2525
01:26:28,518 --> 01:26:30,438
(Even his silhouette alone looks extraordinary.)

2526
01:26:34,888 --> 01:26:37,358
(He spots a large crowd.)

2527
01:26:38,228 --> 01:26:39,788
(The people spot Se Yoon too.)

2528
01:26:41,058 --> 01:26:44,028
(A somewhat shocking first encounter)

2529
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:47,698
(Bowing)

2530
01:26:47,938 --> 01:26:51,338
(The 2079 FW Fashion Show begins.)

2531
01:26:53,068 --> 01:26:55,428
(The avant-garde fashion that will lead the trend in 2079.)

2532
01:26:56,338 --> 01:26:58,898
(The convenience of being able to lie down whenever is a bonus.)

2533
01:26:59,008 --> 01:27:00,718
Joo Jong Hyun, I won't let it slide.

2534
01:27:01,718 --> 01:27:03,517
(Even though he says things like that, )

2535
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:06,388
(he dominates the stage.)

2536
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:10,358
(The audience is impressed.)

2537
01:27:11,028 --> 01:27:12,957
(The fall of the year 2079)

2538
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:14,828
(Why don't you try this outfit?)

2539
01:27:15,598 --> 01:27:18,368
(The pajama core boom will hit the year 2079.)

2540
01:27:18,998 --> 01:27:22,038
(People are gathering after hearing the news.)

2541
01:27:22,698 --> 01:27:24,898
(He enters the photo wall, drawing people's attention.)

2542
01:27:28,808 --> 01:27:31,248
(3 dollars, 2 dollars, 5 dollars)

2543
01:27:35,148 --> 01:27:38,048
(The comfort you can enjoy with just 10 dollars)

2544
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,858
(An outfit that combines style and practicality)

2545
01:27:44,088 --> 01:27:46,788
(It could be a little sensational even in 2079.)

2546
01:27:47,358 --> 01:27:49,328
(Sighing)

2547
01:27:49,758 --> 01:27:51,328
Is there any place to hide?

2548
01:27:51,668 --> 01:27:53,198
Let's move on to the next model.

2549
01:28:05,108 --> 01:28:08,278
(DinDin of Team Lim Joon Ho shows up.)

2550
01:28:08,878 --> 01:28:11,318
(Shouting)

2551
01:28:11,618 --> 01:28:13,348
You're so handsome.

2552
01:28:15,418 --> 01:28:19,728
(The harmony of a Western-style dress and a durumagi)

2553
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:24,598
(It looks more sophisticated with black and gold.)

2554
01:28:24,828 --> 01:28:26,268
Is he the Grim Reaper or what?

2555
01:28:27,698 --> 01:28:29,337
It's okay to boo.

2556
01:28:29,338 --> 01:28:31,237
(Despite the opposing team's aggressive remark, )

2557
01:28:31,238 --> 01:28:33,138
(he's relaxed enough to use the objet d'art.)

2558
01:28:37,848 --> 01:28:39,177
(The kitsch look is complete with his fancy sneakers.)

2559
01:28:39,178 --> 01:28:40,408
His legs look nice.

2560
01:28:40,478 --> 01:28:42,078
(Chuckling)

2561
01:28:46,188 --> 01:28:47,188
Front teeth.

2562
01:28:47,988 --> 01:28:50,058
(8 dollars, 5 dollars, 5 dollars, 20 dollars)

2563
01:28:50,618 --> 01:28:53,958
(The 2079 look completed with only 40 dollars)

2564
01:28:54,328 --> 01:28:55,358
(Screaming)

2565
01:28:57,058 --> 01:28:58,927
Go ahead and heckle him.

2566
01:28:58,928 --> 01:29:01,368
(The best response so far)

2567
01:29:01,938 --> 01:29:03,867
- What is this?
- I'm sorry.

2568
01:29:03,868 --> 01:29:06,108
Let me borrow this. I'm really embarrassed.

2569
01:29:08,178 --> 01:29:10,738
(Team New and Old Love's Seon Ho enters.)

2570
01:29:11,478 --> 01:29:12,947
(You be cool!)

2571
01:29:12,948 --> 01:29:14,378
(The headliner of the show!)

2572
01:29:14,548 --> 01:29:16,648
(Okay, I'll be the headliner.)

2573
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:18,917
He really looks cool.

2574
01:29:18,918 --> 01:29:20,988
(Here comes the headliner.)

2575
01:29:21,818 --> 01:29:26,157
(The skirt shows off the hair on his legs.)

2576
01:29:26,158 --> 01:29:29,958
(Key point: He gave up his sight for the sake of fashion.)

2577
01:29:30,358 --> 01:29:33,798
(Center of attention)

2578
01:29:35,998 --> 01:29:38,538
(An iconic genderless one-piece dress)

2579
01:29:39,368 --> 01:29:43,338
(The white handbag contrasting with the green dress)

2580
01:29:45,148 --> 01:29:47,307
He knows nothing about fashion.

2581
01:29:47,308 --> 01:29:48,747
You're handsome!

2582
01:29:48,748 --> 01:29:50,648
(Giggling)

2583
01:29:51,248 --> 01:29:53,348
(He found his way to the photo wall.)

2584
01:29:54,988 --> 01:29:56,388
(Half-folded fingers)

2585
01:29:57,018 --> 01:29:58,558
Straighten your fingers.

2586
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:03,558
(A star doesn't straighten his fingers.)

2587
01:30:04,868 --> 01:30:08,638
(Freebie, 5 dollars, 10 dollars, 25 dollars)

2588
01:30:09,138 --> 01:30:11,368
(The crowd is much thicker.)

2589
01:30:11,568 --> 01:30:13,738
I was told to wear just this.

2590
01:30:14,168 --> 01:30:15,938
But I had a bad feeling... What's that?

2591
01:30:22,248 --> 01:30:25,748
(The next model of the 2079 FW fashion show)

2592
01:30:25,988 --> 01:30:27,518
He looks good.

2593
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:40,098
(A man whose presence makes people smile)

2594
01:30:42,298 --> 01:30:44,637
(Team Lim Joon Ho's Lee Joon)

2595
01:30:44,638 --> 01:30:45,868
He's a weirdo.

2596
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:51,248
(The rain boots and leggings complete the gorpcore look.)

2597
01:30:52,148 --> 01:30:56,248
(Dressed for the 2079 War of Money)

2598
01:30:56,278 --> 01:30:58,887
Gosh. He's ripped.

2599
01:30:58,888 --> 01:31:02,118
(The women are captivated!)

2600
01:31:04,988 --> 01:31:08,828
(A slide performance?)

2601
01:31:09,428 --> 01:31:10,598
That hurt.

2602
01:31:11,628 --> 01:31:13,198
It looks like his bottom's hurting.

2603
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:17,198
He bought goggles too?

2604
01:31:19,968 --> 01:31:23,838
(The performance isn't over yet!)

2605
01:31:23,908 --> 01:31:25,608
(Tottering)

2606
01:31:25,948 --> 01:31:27,377
What if he hadn't learned to dance?

2607
01:31:27,378 --> 01:31:28,478
(He's jealous.)

2608
01:31:28,818 --> 01:31:30,718
What's this smell? What did you put on?

2609
01:31:31,088 --> 01:31:33,117
My arms looked bare, so I slathered on some oil.

2610
01:31:33,118 --> 01:31:34,518
(The oil accentuates his muscles.)

2611
01:31:35,388 --> 01:31:36,757
(5 dollars, 5 dollars, 30 dollars, 5 dollars, 5 dollars)

2612
01:31:36,758 --> 01:31:39,558
(Not including the body oil)

2613
01:31:41,828 --> 01:31:43,157
Jog over there and back.

2614
01:31:43,158 --> 01:31:45,398
(He sets off to greet the crowd.)

2615
01:31:49,898 --> 01:31:53,108
(The gallery's explosive response!)

2616
01:31:53,968 --> 01:31:57,578
(Will they fall for Joon?)

2617
01:32:00,378 --> 01:32:02,478
What's that? Jong Min's coming.

2618
01:32:02,818 --> 01:32:04,718
(Next episode)

2619
01:32:05,318 --> 01:32:08,688
(The 2079 FW fashion show isn't over yet.)

2620
01:32:10,688 --> 01:32:13,228
(Heart pounding)

2621
01:32:13,888 --> 01:32:16,598
(Dishes that make your mouth water)

2622
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:20,728
(I will do anything for food.)

2623
01:32:20,898 --> 01:32:22,098
(Laughing)

2624
01:32:22,698 --> 01:32:24,838
(What's wrong with you?)

2625
01:32:26,268 --> 01:32:28,308
(One bleak, rainy day)

2626
01:32:29,508 --> 01:32:32,148
(Cameras go on one by one)

2627
01:32:32,478 --> 01:32:33,747
It's raining, so lightning?

2628
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:37,118
(The members suddenly act strangely?)

2629
01:32:38,518 --> 01:32:41,558
(What is happening to them?)

2630
01:32:41,888 --> 01:32:43,858
(If you want to know the reason...)

2631
01:32:44,188 --> 01:32:47,257
- 2 Days 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

2632
01:32:47,258 --> 01:32:48,697
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

2633
01:32:48,698 --> 01:32:50,828
(See you on Sunday night at 6:10pm.)
