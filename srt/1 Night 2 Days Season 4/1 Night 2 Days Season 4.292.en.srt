1
00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:03,401
(A grand sight of mountain greenery...)

2
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:05,102
(and a clear blue river.)

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,542
(Today's destination where you can feel nature)

4
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:12,311
Uiryeong, the center of South Gyeongsang Province.

5
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:13,411
Yes, Uiryeong.

00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:15,652
(Uiryeong-gun, the center of South Gyeongsang Province.)

7
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,211
(The birthplace of Baeksan An Hui Je...)

8
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:20,282
(who fought to recover our sovereignty.)

9
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:24,621
(The Righteous Army are honored with the Righteous Army Pagoda.)

10
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:26,462
(The Chungik Temple is also here.)

11
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,892
Gosh. It's beautiful here.

12
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:32,701
- The pavilion's so pretty.
- It's amazing.

13
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:34,902
- The scenery's incredible.
- Yes.

14
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,302
There's a bridge.

15
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:38,571
There is.

16
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,601
(The Jeongam Pavilion celebrates...)

17
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:41,402
(General Gwak Jae U's Jeongam Battle victory)

18
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:44,612
- It's picturesque.
- We can see all around.

19
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:47,041
Was Uiryeong this beautiful?

20
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:48,281
Uiryeong is amazing.

21
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:50,051
(The view from Jeongam Pavilion...)

22
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,211
This is great.

23
00:00:51,212 --> 00:00:52,781
(The view from Jeongam Pavilion...)

24
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:54,352
(is picturesque.)

25
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:56,521
Hello.

26
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:57,891
- Welcome.
- Hello.

27
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:58,992
- Hi.
- Hello.

28
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,562
- Hello.
- It's beautiful here.

29
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:02,792
- What is this place?
- Hello.

30
00:01:02,992 --> 00:01:04,312
- Goodness.
- This is a disaster.

31
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:05,902
It's boiling hot today.

32
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:09,301
- Summer's coming to an end.
- Today,

33
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,632
the temperature will go up to 34°C today.

34
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:15,141
Did you three come here early and eat dinner together?

35
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,241
- Yesterday?
- Yesterday?

36
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,011
- We got here yesterday, - Yes.

37
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:19,581
And we ate something nice.

38
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:20,641
- Se Yoon...
- It was great.

39
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:22,982
Told the whole story of his past experiences,

40
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:25,211
as well as what songs he listened to then.

41
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:26,321
- Yes.
- He played them for us.

42
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:27,581
- He was a DJ.
- Yes.

43
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:29,051
Jong Min got here yesterday too.

44
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:30,792
- Why didn't you join them?
- What?

45
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,662
I didn't know you guys were here.

46
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:33,991
Yesterday, we all...

47
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:35,562
I posted about it on social media.

48
00:01:35,892 --> 00:01:37,772
- How could you not know?
- He posted about it.

49
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,932
(Everyone but Jong Min knew.)

50
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:43,372
Are we going to the buckwheat noodle place?

51
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:44,831
- What?
- What?

52
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:46,201
- What's that?
- It's possible.

53
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:47,548
- How do you know that?
- How do you know?

54
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:48,902
- What?
- How do you know that?

55
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:51,342
- Se Yoon mentioned it earlier.
- Come on...

56
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:54,142
It can't be helped if you come the day before.

57
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:56,181
We meet the locals.

58
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:57,451
It happens.

59
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:59,151
- Like before, when I knew...
- The amusement park.

60
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,152
- I knew about that.
- Yes.

61
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:04,122
We were eating meat, and a lady came up to us.

62
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:06,462
"Oh, you come to my restaurant tomorrow."

63
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:07,662
(Laughing)

64
00:02:07,663 --> 00:02:08,762
Oh, really?

65
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,932
She even told us what time we'll be there.

66
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:12,701
Shall I tell you the time?

67
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:14,301
- No.
- For the viewers...

68
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,362
Why not?

69
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:17,831
- And also, - It's hilarious.

70
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:19,202
We have a new director.

71
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:21,601
- He's not new.
- We all know him.

72
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:22,711
You don't know him?

73
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:24,011
- I don't.
- And you too?

74
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:25,541
- Seon Ho too.
- We haven't met.

75
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:26,512
You haven't?

76
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,081
Oh, really? You know him?

77
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,351
He was around for the beginning of Season Four.

78
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:30,481
- Yes.
- I see.

79
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:32,651
You could play the clip of him as the Little General.

80
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,051
The episode we filmed in Suwon.

81
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:35,992
- Yes, that would be nice.
- Edit that in.

82
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:38,551
(He was the Little General.)

83
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:39,561
(It's Hee Sung.)

84
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:43,262
(He was the Little General.)

85
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:46,862
(He suffered alongside the members.)

86
00:02:47,462 --> 00:02:49,061
(The hardship expert, )

87
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:50,771
(Director Lee Hee Sung, is back.)

88
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:52,301
- Hee Sung is back.
- Yes.

89
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,271
Let's kick-start the trip.

90
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:55,541
- Yes!
- Sounds good.

91
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,671
Today's destination is the birthplace of the rich,

92
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:00,382
Uiryeong, South Gyeongsang Province.

93
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:02,081
- Birthplace of the rich?
- Birthplace of the rich?

94
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,252
Are there many rich people?

95
00:03:03,512 --> 00:03:06,651
Right behind you is Sotbawi Rock.

96
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,582
It looks like a cast iron cauldron.

97
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:10,891
It's shaped like one, isn't it?

98
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:11,921
Yes.

99
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:13,968
(Not only does it look like a large pot from above...)

100
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:16,231
It is shaped like a large pot.

101
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:17,261
- Yes.
- Yes.

102
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:18,791
(The part underwater...)

103
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,602
(looks like it has three legs.)

104
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:25,171
Legend has it that there's a constant stream...

105
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,501
of fame and wealth within 20 ri of this rock.

106
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:28,701
- Twenty ri?
- Yes.

107
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:29,941
(Never-ending wealth within 7.8km of the rock)

108
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:31,341
- In fact, - That's eight kilometers.

109
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:32,471
Within 20 ri of this rock...

110
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:34,481
are the birthplaces of people who founded large companies.

111
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:35,482
- Oh, really?
- I see.

112
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:36,882
Can you give us an example?

113
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:38,651
Samsung, LG,

114
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,781
- LG?
- Hyosung.

115
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:40,851
Those companies.

116
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,451
- For real?
- The chairmen were born here.

117
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:43,491
It is a place of the wealthy.

118
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:45,152
This place must have some kind of energy.

119
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,891
- Also, right here, - Yes?

120
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,691
To share the positive energy and wealth,

121
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:52,961
they host the Rich Rich Festival every year in the fall.

122
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:54,432
- "Rich Rich Festival?"
- Yes.

123
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,101
You can take home the rich energy.

124
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:58,871
(The Rich Rich Festival is held...)

125
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,601
(to share the rich energy.)

126
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:03,742
There's a lot to see and do here around that time.

127
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:05,411
- I see.
- It would be fun...

128
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,012
- for us and the viewers.
- Right.

129
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:09,281
I've never heard of a festival about being rich.

130
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,951
- Rich Rich Festival?
- Yes.

131
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,452
Do people come to get rich?

132
00:04:12,612 --> 00:04:14,281
It would make you feel good.

133
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:15,722
To gain some wealthy energy.

134
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:18,151
Do you see a bronze plate in the ground over there?

135
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:20,791
- The bronze plate in the ground.
- Yes.

136
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,221
If you stand there...

137
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:24,391
and make a wish to Sotbawi Rock, it comes true.

138
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:25,592
- Oh, really?
- Oh, really?

139
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:28,062
(Zooming)

140
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:29,571
(DinDin dashes off to make a wish.)

141
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:31,001
Does he have that many wishes?

142
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:32,842
- "I want to grow taller."
- Let's take turns.

143
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:34,102
(Laughing)

144
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:35,901
"Please make me taller!"

145
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,982
(He ignores their mockery and makes a serious wish.)

146
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:39,482
Grant me good health.

147
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:42,442
Make me even healthier than I am now.

148
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:46,621
(What will Se Yoon wish for?)

149
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:48,251
Grant me good health, and also...

150
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:49,591
(Also...)

151
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:51,751
Ignore all the wishes of those who went before me.

152
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:53,891
(ignore the wishes of those who went first.)

153
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:56,461
Se Yoon wished for all our wishes to be ignored.

154
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,361
- Why would he do that?
- That was his wish?

155
00:04:58,362 --> 00:04:59,402
That's my wish.

156
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:01,531
Don't become rich. Stay as you are.

157
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:02,532
Goodness.

158
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,101
This trip takes place in Uiryeong,

159
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:07,062
- the village of the wealthy.
- What's the theme?

160
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,511
(War of Money)

161
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:10,572
War of Money.

162
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:14,011
(Today's trip: War of Money)

163
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:15,111
- War of Money - Can you...

164
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:16,451
dance to that track too?

165
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:18,351
- Of course I can.
- War of Money

166
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,581
- I'll sing it again.
- Okay.

167
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:20,881
One, two, three.

168
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:21,981
(War of Money)

169
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,451
I can't do it.

170
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:25,091
- Why not?
- Why not?

171
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,562
The beat's too fast.

172
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:28,462
He can't follow the beat at all.

173
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:30,531
War of Money.

174
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:32,172
- Yes. It's War of Money.
- War of Money.

175
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:34,001
You'll go around Uiryeong...

176
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:36,471
and obtain yeopjeon through various missions.

177
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,031
- Yeopjeon.
- Yeopjeon.

178
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:40,271
You must buy dinner with these yeopjeons.

179
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:41,301
Not that again.

180
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:42,871
We prepared something shocking for you.

181
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:44,371
- Why?
- As for dinner tonight,

182
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:45,811
since we're in the village of the wealthy,

183
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,252
we've prepared a luxurious dinner...

184
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:49,211
with special ingredients from Uiryeong.

185
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:50,812
I'd encourage everyone to do their best.

186
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:52,651
- Will it be an excessive meal?
- The village of the wealthy...

187
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,952
The chef of the show has returned after two months.

188
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:56,621
- Really?
- I see.

189
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,151
So your teams will be important today.

190
00:05:58,152 --> 00:05:59,251
- Right.
- Okay.

191
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:00,421
You'll divide into teams in a fair way.

192
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:01,422
- Heads or tails?
- Heads or tails?

193
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:02,991
- That's a good idea.
- You'll throw the yeopjeon...

194
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:04,291
- to decide your team.
- That's great.

195
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:05,832
- You'll throw the yeopjeon.
- Okay.

196
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:07,631
The three members who get the Korean-letter side...

197
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:08,861
- of the coin will form a team.
- Okay.

198
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:09,901
And the rest of them...

199
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,908
- will form another team.
- The Korean-letter side.

200
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:13,071
- Why doesn't Jong Min go first?
- Sure.

201
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,102
Okay.

202
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:17,412
Will you flip it?

203
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:18,942
(Like this?)

204
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:20,981
- Whichever hand it is.
- It's this one.

205
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:21,982
- Okay. Show us.
- Show us.

206
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:23,682
One, two, three. Ta-da.

207
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,628
- My gosh.
- I got the Korean-letter side.

208
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,351
- "Luck."
- That's heads?

209
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:29,252
- Heads. The youngest will go now.
- Here I go.

210
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:30,452
I'll throw it right away.

211
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:31,791
Get the Chinese-letter side!

212
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,591
- Gosh, leave it.
- My gosh.

213
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:34,622
What is it?

214
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:36,291
- Jong Min.
- What?

215
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:37,761
Why did you wish that I'd get the Chinese-letter side?

216
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:39,122
I didn't want to team up with you.

217
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:42,261
- That's understandable.
- He was always the last one.

218
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:43,302
Right.

219
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:45,831
- It's the Chinese-letter side.
- This is iffy for me too.

220
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:47,201
- He got it.
- Gosh.

221
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:48,301
- Do well.
- The Korean-letter side.

222
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:50,088
- Wait. It's the Korean-letter side.
- I got the Chinese-letter side.

223
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:52,571
All right. DinDin, Jong Min, and Se Yoon...

224
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:53,611
- will make a team.
- Okay.

225
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:55,011
- This is great.
- Seon Ho, Joon, and Sae Ho...

226
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:56,382
- will make a team.
- Okay.

227
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:59,621
(Which team will obtain more yeopjeons?)

228
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:02,381
All right. As I requested in advance,

229
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:04,821
- did you bring a useless item each?
- Right.

230
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:05,822
- Yes.
- Yes!

231
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:07,161
To see what kind of item you brought,

232
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:09,443
you'll have a chance to introduce the item one at a time.

233
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,232
The mission was to bring a useless item.

234
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,231
I thought about what to bring.

235
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:16,372
Then I realized I had to sort out my books.

236
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,302
While trying to sort out my books, something caught my eyes.

237
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:22,442
So I'm planning to bring this.

238
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:27,712
(What kind of item did the other members bring?)

239
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:30,212
- Here's mine.
- Do you have a story behind it?

240
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:32,592
If I knew for sure that I'd be giving it to the members,

241
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:34,952
I would've brought an old pair of underwear.

242
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:36,892
Jong Hyun called me and said,

243
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:39,861
"You shouldn't bring an old pair of underwear."

244
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:40,921
After hearing the feedback,

245
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:42,291
- I guessed it wouldn't be for you.
- Okay.

246
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,261
I thought we might give this away to a random citizen.

247
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:45,391
- Really?
- So...

248
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:46,531
- I brought...
- What's that?

249
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,632
Body cream.

250
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:49,401
- You're not going to use it?
- That's new.

251
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,431
- This is from a good brand.
- You brought a nice one.

252
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:51,731
- This is brand-new.
- Give this to me.

253
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,241
- You didn't open it.
- It's new. I didn't open it.

254
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:55,442
Why did you ask him to give it to you? That was random.

255
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,242
I have a lot of stuff like this at home.

256
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,472
If you have a lot of it, spread it on some bread.

257
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:01,711
(How can I spread body cream on bread?)

258
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:03,682
- Why waste it on your body?
- It's also cream.

259
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,611
(Why waste it on your body?)

260
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:07,951
You know what? I think yours might be similar to mine.

261
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:09,121
Right. Actually,

262
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,052
whenever I was insecure about my future,

263
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:12,622
- I always looked at this...
- Okay.

264
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:14,021
And tried to stay calm.

265
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:15,761
- "How will today go?"
- Okay.

266
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,122
- "What about tomorrow?"
- Really?

267
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:19,832
- "What will happen to my future?"
- That's...

268
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:21,501
(What on earth is it?)

269
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,901
"Why did I dream about that?"

270
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:24,931
A book about dream interpretations.

271
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:26,341
(It's a book about dream interpretations.)

272
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:27,372
This is pretty nice.

273
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:30,111
(What is this?)

274
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:31,711
Hey, this book looks like a fun read.

275
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,912
- So...
- This is a detailed dream.

276
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,141
It's a dream about a flood...

277
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:37,211
- with muddy water.
- That's the thing.

278
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,281
"A dream where a flood rushes over you..."

279
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:40,882
"or sweeps through grains."

280
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:42,681
It will be a fun read when you can't fall asleep.

281
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:43,891
- Right. This is...
- It's a nice book.

282
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:45,751
If you dreamed last night, check out this book.

283
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:46,862
- It's almost...
- Right.

284
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:48,491
- I rarely read this.
- It's not a bad book.

285
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:49,631
- This looks fun.
- Yes.

286
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:51,492
- Well, mine...
- Great. Okay.

287
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,092
- It's too good to give away.
- It's so hot.

288
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,002
I'll show you what it is first.

289
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,501
(A roll of wrapping paper)

290
00:08:58,502 --> 00:08:59,801
- What's that?
- I can't believe him.

291
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:01,178
- This isn't right.
- What is this?

292
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:02,371
That's just...

293
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:04,312
- That's basically trash.
- You brought trash.

294
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:07,011
- What is this?
- I have a heartbreaking story.

295
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,312
- This is...
- You see,

296
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:10,851
I wrapped Christmas presents from Santa for my children.

297
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:12,551
- But your kids...
- Then my son came to me and said,

298
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,912
"You've been giving us Christmas presents this whole time."

299
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:16,651
I said, "What are you talking about?"

300
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:18,468
"Santa gave you presents because you have been a good boy."

301
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,621
He said, "No. It all makes sense now. My birthday presents..."

302
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:22,502
"and Christmas presents had the same wrapping."

303
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:25,132
He figured out everything.

304
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,862
So I couldn't finish using the rest of the wrapping paper.

305
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:30,631
It's about time that I retire the wrapping paper.

306
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:31,801
- This is a good one.
- My gosh.

307
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:33,071
- There's a heartwarming story...
- You have a story behind it.

308
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,141
Of a dad.

309
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:35,871
But still. This isn't right.

310
00:09:35,872 --> 00:09:37,011
What do you mean? Look.

311
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:39,188
If you just give the book, it won't look like a present.

312
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,112
But what happens if you wrap it up?

313
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,081
- I see.
- It looks like a Christmas gift.

314
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,311
- You can wrap your present.
- You can wrap anything with it.

315
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:45,551
You can wrap anything with it.

316
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,552
- Okay.
- Hey.

317
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,921
- The wrapping paper.
- Okay.

318
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,851
It's not bad. It feels quite good on the presents.

319
00:09:49,852 --> 00:09:50,922
- Seon Ho.
- Okay.

320
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:52,521
- I was torn between two items.
- What's that?

321
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:54,161
- Then I settled on this one.
- What's that?

322
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:55,992
- I have 2 of this at home.
- You have 2?

323
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:57,461
- This is...
- So this is yours?

324
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:58,661
- Yes. It's mine.
- This case is yours?

325
00:09:58,662 --> 00:10:00,222
- What's that?
- Is it a camping chair?

326
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:01,861
- I see.
- A yoga mat.

327
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,602
- This...
- My gosh.

328
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:05,771
(Disappointed reaction)

329
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:06,841
What's up with the reaction?

330
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:08,771
- This is natural. It's a yoga mat.
- But...

331
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:10,572
- Did you expect us to be dazzled?
- "Yes!"

332
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:12,341
I mean, this makes sense, right?

333
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:13,511
- Hey.
- If we...

334
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,741
We'll show you how weird it would look.

335
00:10:14,742 --> 00:10:15,841
- We'll show it to you. Go ahead.
- Okay.

336
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:17,051
- What is it?
- What is it?

337
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:19,082
- It's a yoga mat.
- Yes!

338
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:20,851
- A yoga mat!
- A yoga mat!

339
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,081
- Make some noise!
- Yoga

340
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:23,892
- Are you sure about this?
- Yoga mat

341
00:10:24,152 --> 00:10:25,251
- This would look weird.
- Well...

342
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:27,161
- Yoga mat - Who would get excited at this?

343
00:10:27,162 --> 00:10:28,361
- "Oh, my!"
- Seriously.

344
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:30,061
- Be reasonable with expectations.
- "A yoga mat?"

345
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,731
It's picking up our mood.

346
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,061
We can use this as a blanket when we go to sleep at night.

347
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:35,601
- Right?
- We can sleep on top of it.

348
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:38,471
By the way, everyone has at least one yoga mat at home.

349
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,241
- I have two.
- But we rarely use it.

350
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:42,172
- Right.
- I don't need two at home.

351
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,541
- By the way, everyone...
- Okay.

352
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,911
Brought a meaningful item.

353
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:45,912
- Right.
- Yes.

354
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,341
I was told bringing a truly useless item...

355
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:49,822
- would be good for the show.
- Okay.

356
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:51,111
It's a waste...

357
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:52,351
- to keep this guy at my house...
- Okay.

358
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,982
Because I'm so busy with work.

359
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,691
I wasn't able to pay attention to this guy.

360
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:57,692
What is it?

361
00:10:57,693 --> 00:11:00,061
- Is it a living thing?
- I'd rather see this guy...

362
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:02,561
- with someone who can spare...
- You want someone else to take it?

363
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,961
- a lot of time for him.
- I see.

364
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:05,031
That's what I want.

365
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,261
- What is it?
- It's really useless to me.

366
00:11:07,262 --> 00:11:08,431
- What's that?
- Seriously.

367
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:09,432
- Is that for a swallow?
- What?

368
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:10,631
- A nest for swallows?
- You know what?

369
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:11,972
This is...

370
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,272
(Disappointed)

371
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,841
This is really useless.

372
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,071
- Let me tell you why I have it.
- What's that?

373
00:11:16,072 --> 00:11:17,712
- What is it?
- Is that an interior prop?

374
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:19,412
This is...

375
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,381
Gosh, it's moving!

376
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,022
- Why don't you sound excited?
- My gosh.

377
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:25,181
- But seriously.
- Is that a pigeon?

378
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:26,311
- But...
- Gosh, this...

379
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:28,622
I'll show you what you can do with it. You hook it up.

380
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,882
- What? You can carry it with you?
- That's a detailed toy.

381
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:34,561
(It's a versatile pigeon he can take out on a walk.)

382
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:35,661
That's amazing.

383
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,391
- That's so funny.
- Once I'm home after walking it...

384
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:39,208
- What is this?
- Once I bring it home after a walk,

385
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,801
- it must sleep in its nest.
- How fascinating.

386
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:41,961
It's Cho Bird.

387
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,232
- Cho Bird?
- It's Cho Bird.

388
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:45,201
I hope this serves as a dove of peace...

389
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:46,601
- and brings peace to someone.
- Okay.

390
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:48,372
- We got it.
- Okay.

391
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:51,511
Let's check Joon's item. Okay.

392
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:53,381
- Joon brought a globe or something.
- Okay.

393
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:55,311
- That's the biggest. What is it?
- Is it a lamp or what?

394
00:11:55,312 --> 00:11:56,441
- It looks like a lamp.
- That's huge.

395
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:57,962
What is it? I'm looking forward to it.

396
00:11:58,512 --> 00:11:59,582
Here it goes.

397
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:01,821
(Falling)

398
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:02,851
- Gosh. What's wrong with him?
- My gosh.

399
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:04,422
He came up with a nice skit.

400
00:12:04,492 --> 00:12:07,092
- I saw him practice that earlier.
- That was nicely thought out.

401
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:08,421
- Did you practice that?
- Gosh.

402
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:10,792
- No. All right.
- Hey.

403
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:12,862
- One, two, three.
- What's that?

404
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,431
- It's a fan.
- What?

405
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:15,461
- That looks pretty good.
- That's nice.

406
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:16,771
- You brought a good one.
- Why won't you use that?

407
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:18,778
- You brought a good one.
- Why not? Does it not work?

408
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:20,442
It works well.

409
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:23,101
I'm a sensitive sleeper.

410
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:24,141
I can't fall asleep...

411
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:25,171
- even with the slightest noise.
- It's a bit noisy.

412
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:26,371
- So it's useless to you.
- That's a good one.

413
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:28,342
Yes. I'm very sensitive.

414
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:29,781
But this is perfectly fine...

415
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,752
for people who aren't sensitive sleepers.

416
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:34,281
- I like that.
- I want that. It's tiny and cute.

417
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:35,352
You brought a good one.

418
00:12:35,582 --> 00:12:38,391
(Why did they bring these items?)

419
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:40,821
All right. These items may be useless to you.

420
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:43,191
But to others, they might be useful.

421
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,261
- Right.
- Of course.

422
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:46,132
You will now auction off...

423
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,662
the item you brought to the staff...

424
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,972
to raise your starting funds.

425
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,641
- This was it?
- Hold on.

426
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:54,771
Then we have the upper hand.

427
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:56,241
- All right.
- We have to sell this?

428
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,341
- Yes.
- Yours is expensive.

429
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,172
- Get a good price for yours.
- Okay.

430
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,882
One person from each team will take turns to sell the item.

431
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,311
Yeopjeons will be given according to...

432
00:13:05,312 --> 00:13:06,751
- the amounts of winning bids.
- So this was it?

433
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:07,781
(Yeopjeons will be given according to winning bids.)

434
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:09,992
The highest number of yeopjeons you can obtain is 20.

435
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:12,921
Sae Ho, could you be the auctioneer for today?

436
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,261
- Really? Sure.
- All right.

437
00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:16,261
- Great.
- Everyone, bring it in.

438
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,061
(Which team will gain more yeopjeons?)

439
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:19,462
Who would like to go first?

440
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,231
- I would...
- You know what? I can go first.

441
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:22,232
The father with a rebellious teenager will go.

442
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,501
Besides, mine is used.

443
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:25,971
- Let me sell this off first.
- Great.

- Okay.

(The wrapping paper with a sad story)

447
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:33,941
I used this very paper to wrap up presents for my kids.

448
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:35,311
All right, everyone. Great.

449
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:36,651
It's crumpled up and so on.

450
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:38,781
But I still have plenty of wrapping paper left.

451
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,121
- There's a lot left.
- There's plenty remaining.

452
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:41,521
- Se Yoon.
- Gosh.

453
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,351
Is there another fun activity we can do with the wrapping paper?

454
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:45,751
Other than using it to wrap presents?

455
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:46,791
- Other than using it to wrap gifts?
- Right.

456
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,538
Actually, you can change facial expressions.

457
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,032
One, two. Okay. There's one.

- Four. This is totally possible.
- People seem to like it.

- People seem to like it.
- You can do anything.

468
00:14:08,742 --> 00:14:11,282
And you can do this when your kids come back from kindergarten.

469
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,321

00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:33,732
It looks like I can't sell my item unless I do that.

517
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:34,961
- There's nothing I can do.
- What are you talking about?

518
00:15:34,962 --> 00:15:36,401
- It's a hot day too.
- All right. We'll lower it to two.

519
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,531
- No takers at two dollars?
- One...

520
00:15:37,532 --> 00:15:39,331
I might think about buying it if it goes below a dollar.

521
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:40,401
- That little...
- Gosh.

522
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:41,771
Okay. For now, it's at two dollars.

523
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:42,772
One, two, three.

524
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:43,941
It's at two dollars.

525
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,311
- No takers.
- Really?

526
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,312
Okay. Fine.

527
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,411
- How about 1.5 dollars?
- This is pretty bad.

528
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:48,511
- But still...
- One, two, three.

529
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:49,681
- It's used.
- No takers.

530
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,411
- Director Kwon.
- All right. It's a dollar.

531
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:53,132
- One, two, three.
- How old is your child?

532
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:54,316
(Surprised)

533
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:55,412
- How about 1.5 dollars?
- This is pretty bad.

534
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,712
- But still...
- One, two, three.

535
00:15:56,713 --> 00:15:57,942
- It's used.
- No takers.

536
00:15:57,943 --> 00:15:59,642
- Director Kwon.
- All right. It's a dollar.

537
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:01,359
- One, two, three.
- How old is your child?

538
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:02,483
(Surprised)

539
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,182
(Here's the first bidder.)

540
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:05,252
- How much?
- How much?

541
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:06,452
- A dollar.
- A dollar?

542
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:07,853
- Why do you want it?
- All right.

543
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:09,592
Could you tell us why you want it?

544
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,492
- I might use it someday.
- Okay.

545
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:12,692
- All right.
- He's an SNU graduate.

546
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:14,069
- He's a smart guy.
- It's a dollar.

547
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:15,592
Anyone for 1.1 dollars? I have to raise the price now.

548
00:16:15,593 --> 00:16:17,262
- I have no choice.
- We have to raise the price.

549
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:18,362
- A dollar.
- If you missed your chance,

550
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:19,979
- raise it to 1.1 dollars.
- Don't you want it?

551
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:21,902
- Anyone for 1.1 dollars?
- I'll sign the paper.

552
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:22,903
- You'll sign it?
- A dollar?

553
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:24,032
- I will.
- Wait.

554
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:26,073
- I'll raise it to 1.2 dollars.
- To 1.2 dollars.

555
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:27,772
- It's at 1.2 dollars now.
- Gosh.

556
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:29,742
- It's at 1.2 dollars.
- His autograph costs 20 cents.

557
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,983
I'll wrap it up after I call it three times.

558
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:33,412
- A dollar and twenty cents.
- What are you doing? Keep bidding.

559
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:34,782
- A dollar and twenty cents.
- Come on. Hurry up.

560
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:36,783
- A dollar and twenty cents.
- My gosh. Look!

561
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:38,312
My gosh. Look!

562
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:39,653
(Who is that?)

563
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:41,322
- Will you sign it?
- Yes, I will.

564
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:42,552
- Two dollars.
- Okay.

565
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:44,122
- It's going up.
- It went up 80 cents...

566
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:45,262
with my autograph.

567
00:16:45,263 --> 00:16:46,392
It's at two dollars now.

568
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:47,492
Once I call it out three times...

569
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:48,692
- I want to ask one thing.
- Okay.

570
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:50,862
Sir, your children are all grown up. Why do you want this?

571
00:16:50,863 --> 00:16:52,562
- Why do you want it?
- I want his autograph.

572
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:53,602
(He wants it as a pure-hearted fan.)

573
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:55,432
- It's not for his kids.
- The wrapping paper...

574
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:57,149
with Se Yoon's autograph is at two dollars.

575
00:16:57,173 --> 00:16:58,602
- Two dollars.
- They started to bid...

576
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:00,003
- with my autograph.
- Two dollars.

577
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,273
Two dollars.

578
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:03,113
Sold!

579
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:04,813
It's sold for two dollars.

580
00:17:05,383 --> 00:17:07,542
Se Yoon, please sign the wrapping paper.

581
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:09,383
I'll sign it beautifully on this.

582
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:11,922
- Should I sign it in 5m intervals?
- No.

583
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:13,282
Okay. Thank you.

584
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,492
- Just sign at the top of the roll.
- At the top of the roll.

585
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,493
Okay. I got it.

586
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,454
Gi Jong. You really have to wire the money to me.

587
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:19,562
- Now?
- Yes.

588
00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:20,793
- Now?
- Okay.

589
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:22,693
- He means business.
- Gosh.

590
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,073
Jong Hyun, here are two dollars.

591
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:25,763
- Okay.
- Thank you.

592
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,002
- He paid in cash.
- He paid for it.

593
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:29,072
Seon Ho.

594
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:31,433
- All right. I'll go next.
- Let's give him a warm welcome.

595
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:34,742
I think this yoga mat is great for ladies.

596
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:35,912
Check out the size. It's not too big.

597
00:17:35,913 --> 00:17:37,542
So it's a suitable size for women.

598
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:38,543
But it's too small.

599
00:17:38,544 --> 00:17:39,642
- It's too small.
- Show us what to do on it.

600
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:40,643
How I use the mat?

601
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,152
I do this a lot at home.

602
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:43,383
He stepped on the yoga mat.

603
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:44,912
- That's so dirty.
- He stepped on it.

604
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:47,282
- I see a lot of creases here.
- Yes, there are many creases.

605
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,822
Don't think you can only use it for yoga.

606
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:50,729
Let's explain to our staff why they might need this.

607
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:54,223
Will the cameramen be able to use it during breaks?

608
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,232
- Wait. That's right.
- Can they put cameras on it?

609
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:57,292
They can buy a regular mat then.

610
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:58,679
- Why would they need that?
- A regular mat?

611
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,762
A regular mat at the Han River costs 20 dollars these days.

612
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:01,833
- Really?
- Yes.

613
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:03,503
- It's that expensive?
- So...

614
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,602
let me check the market price.

615
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:07,202
Keep going. Let me check the market.

616
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:09,163
I must tell them how much it costs on the market.

617
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:10,813
(Chuckling)

618
00:18:11,643 --> 00:18:13,042
- Look.
- I'll also sign the yoga mat.

619
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:14,342
- I'll even leave a kiss stain.
- Wait.

620
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,013
That's not important.

621
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:19,322
When he was looking it up online, he didn't type, "yoga mat."

622
00:18:19,323 --> 00:18:21,053
He typed, "cheap yoga mat."

623
00:18:21,623 --> 00:18:23,822
- Se Yoon. That's cheating.
- Why "cheap yoga mat?"

624
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:25,152
- Se Yoon, that's cheating.
- Why?

625
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:26,292
- It's about 5.4 dollars.
- It's...

626
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:28,322
- It's 5.49 dollars online.
- Yes.

627
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:29,592
Don't look up the cheapest price.

628
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:31,492
- That's a cheap yoga mat.
- All right.

629
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:33,602
Seon Ho will also sign the yoga mat.

630
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:35,923
- What's your opening bid?
- You must be smart about this.

631
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:38,249
- I'll go for 4 dollars.
- You'll go for 4 dollars.

632
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:40,502
It's Seon Ho's yoga mat.

633
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:42,213
It will be signed by Seon Ho too.

634
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:43,942
You can use it to lie down...

635
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:45,743
and be more comfortable while shooting.

636
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:47,343
We'll start at four dollars.

637
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,652
Four dollars.

638
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:49,683
(Anxious)

639
00:18:50,283 --> 00:18:51,353
Four dollars.

640
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:53,052
- Four dollars.
- What?

641
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:54,383
- He's from Security.
- What?

642
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:56,723
- He's from Security.
- Oh, my.

643
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:58,293
- Why?
- Four dollars.

644
00:18:58,593 --> 00:18:59,922
- Could you tell us why you want it?
- Why?

645
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,322
- I need to work out.
- He needs to work out.

646
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:02,792
Stretching is very important.

647
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:04,233
- I never got injured.
- Great.

648
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:05,602
Four dollars and ten cents!

649
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,683
Four dollars and ten cents.

650
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:08,603
- Everyone.
- All right.

651
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,779
- Four dollars and fifty cents.
- Four dollars and fifty cents.

652
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:11,832
- What?
- Four dollars and fifty cents.

653
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:12,842
This is crazy.

654
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:13,872
- I can't believe this.
- They're fighting.

655
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:15,512
- Four dollars and fifty cents.
- They can't fight for this.

656
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:16,872
- Four dollars and fifty cents.
- Five dollars!

657
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:18,783
- Five dollars.
- I don't want them to compete!

658
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:22,112
(The audio engineer bids 5 dollars.)

659
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:23,113
This is amazing.

660
00:19:23,114 --> 00:19:24,282
- Everyone.
- All right.

661
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:25,722
Listen up. You can buy this...

662
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:27,082
- for 5.4 dollars online.
- No.

663
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,622
- Why are you getting competitive?
- It's at five dollars now.

664
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:29,623
- All right.
- Okay.

665
00:19:29,624 --> 00:19:30,723
Five dollars.

666
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:32,713
He shook his head at five dollars.

667
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:33,993
Sold!

668
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:35,632
It's sold for five dollars to the audio engineer.

669
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,232
Seon Ho's yoga mat was sold for five dollars.

670
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:39,809
What was yours sold for, Se Yoon? Two dollars?

671
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,833
Yes.

672
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:44,003

- Do you know...
- Let's begin now.

681
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,983
How I got to where I am today?

682
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:04,622
I studied my dreams.

683
00:20:04,623 --> 00:20:06,022
I had many dreams.

684
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:08,793
This book has the highest number of dream interpretations.

685
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:10,862
One time, I read it in the book that it'd be dangerous...

686
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:12,103
for me to go out that day...

687
00:20:12,563 --> 00:20:13,732
because I could get into an accident.

688
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:15,702
After reading that, I didn't go out that day.

689
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:16,902
Have you ever been in an accident?

690
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:18,002
- No.
- No.

691
00:20:18,003 --> 00:20:19,402
What's the opening bid?

692
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:22,173
My opening bid? In 2005,

693
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:24,772
- What was the listed price?
- the listed price was 18 dollars.

694
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:25,782
- That's expensive.
- That's expensive.

695
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:27,312
Since it was 18 dollars 20 years ago,

696
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:29,282
- I'll factor in inflation.
- You'll factor that in.

697
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:30,712
(I'll factor in inflation.)

698
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,923
How about 50 dollars?

699
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:34,783
- Have you gone mad?
- Really?

700
00:20:35,383 --> 00:20:36,393
Great.

701
00:20:36,723 --> 00:20:38,353
We'll start at 50 dollars.

702
00:20:38,523 --> 00:20:39,622
- Fifty dollars.
- That's a neat number.

703
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:40,623
- You just need to pay 1 bill.
- Anyone for 50 dollars?

704
00:20:40,624 --> 00:20:41,892
No takers for 50 dollars.

705
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:43,333
- No?
- Forty dollars?

706
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:45,613
- Forty dollars?
- Is he trying to extort them?

707
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:46,733
No takers.

708
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:48,663
- Thirty dollars?
- My gosh.

709
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,373
No takers.

710
00:20:50,703 --> 00:20:52,402
- Ten dollars. No takers.
- What? Ten dollars?

711
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:53,803
- Not even ten dollars.
- How much?

712
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:55,372
- How about 8 dollars?
- You won't pay 10 dollars for it?

713
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:56,412
Eight dollars.

714
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:57,512
Six dollars.

715
00:20:57,513 --> 00:20:58,793
- This is awful.
- Four dollars.

716
00:20:59,783 --> 00:21:01,313
- No takers.
- My gosh.

717
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:03,912
- My gosh.
- No one wants it for four dollars.

718
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:04,952
- Two dollars?
- Hey.

719
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:06,583
This is cheaper than the yoga mat.

720
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:09,692
- I'll make you a promise.
- He'll make you a promise.

721
00:21:09,693 --> 00:21:11,453
- All right.
- Jong Min will make a promise.

722
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:12,823
If you pay 50 dollars for it,

723
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:14,693
I'll put 60 dollars in the book.

724
00:21:15,263 --> 00:21:16,393
(Laughing)

725
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,402
So you want them to buy it at 50 dollars?

726
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,602
Yes. Buy it now.

727
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:22,802
- Then they'll get 60 dollars.
- Right.

728
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:25,273
- That's a great offer.
- All right.

729
00:21:26,543 --> 00:21:28,172
- You can't do that.
- No.

730
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:30,243
- Why not? We want to do that.
- Right.

731
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:32,313
It's at two dollars now.

732
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:34,013
- Two dollars?
- Two dollars.

733
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,682
Two dollars? Could you tell us why?

734
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:38,352
- I dream often. Yes.
- Really?

735
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:40,483
It's at two dollars now.

736
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:42,822
- How about 2.1 dollars?
- This is crazy.

737
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:44,329
- Anyone for 2.1 dollars?
- You don't want the book?

738
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:46,233
- No one wants it.
- Two dollars and ten cents?

739
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:48,893
- Sold for two dollars!
- Gosh.

740
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,769
Both Jong Min and I only got two dollars.

741
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:52,462
- Yours was sold for 2 dollars too?
- Yes, it was sold for 2 dollars.

742
00:21:52,463 --> 00:21:53,962
But we can count on his body cream.

743
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:55,933
- It's okay. I got you.
- Yes. That's expensive.

744
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:58,103
- Okay. What a bummer, though.
- It is.

745
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,472
All right. Next up...

746
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:02,772
is Joon's item. Let's start the auction.

747
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:05,542
Due to global warming, the weather has been very hot.

748
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:07,542
- It's hot today too. I heard...
- I'm dripping in sweat.

749
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:09,683
The heatwave would continue until November.

750
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,182
Winter will be brief.

751
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:12,952
Having one of these will be great.

752
00:22:12,953 --> 00:22:14,382
You all know that you can save a lot of energy...

753
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:15,592
by turning on the fan...

754
00:22:15,593 --> 00:22:17,052
while keeping the AC on low.

755
00:22:17,053 --> 00:22:18,122
Great.

756
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:19,192
Shouldn't we check...

757
00:22:19,193 --> 00:22:20,222
- if the fan is working or not?
- This can move.

758
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:21,462
- We can't check, can we?
- It works.

759
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:23,632
If it doesn't work, I will...

760
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,462
- That's what all con artists say.
- That's right.

761
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:27,302
- I'll pay you back double...
- "Call me if it doesn't work."

762
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:28,362
if it doesn't work.

763
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:29,832
We can't plug it in to check. How can they buy this?

764
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,402
You can only use it at home.

765
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:33,073
- It should be portable.
- Right.

766
00:22:33,173 --> 00:22:35,042
They can't use it right away.

767
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:37,343
- Summer is almost over.
- They can't use it outdoors.

768
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:40,043
(It looks like no one will want it.)

769
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:42,552
From what I heard from Joon,

770
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:45,583
this is some kind of lucky fan. That's what Joon told me.

771
00:22:45,853 --> 00:22:47,452
On the day he used this fan,

772
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:48,622
he passed an audition.

773
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:49,822
- Right!
- Yes.

774
00:22:49,823 --> 00:22:52,222
- I told him about this earlier.
- Right.

775
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:53,669
What movie was it from three years ago?

776
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:54,933
- Which one was it?
- It was...

777
00:22:55,063 --> 00:22:56,432
- "The Silent Sea."
- "The Silent Sea."

778
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:57,892
I really enjoyed watching that.

779
00:22:57,893 --> 00:23:00,132
I passed the audition thanks to this fan.

780
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,262
- All right.
- I'll start at ten dollars.

781
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:02,332
At ten dollars? Great.

782
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,372
If it's only ten dollars,

783
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:04,373
- some people might want it.
- Right.

784
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:06,542
- I'll be realistic.
- This is the lucky-charm fan...

785
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:07,573
Joon has kept.

786
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:09,312
We'll start the bidding at ten dollars!

787
00:23:09,313 --> 00:23:10,742
- You can only use it at home.
- Ten dollars.

788
00:23:10,743 --> 00:23:12,012
- Ji Woong.
- What?

789
00:23:12,013 --> 00:23:13,289
- What are you doing, Ji Woong?
- Why?

790
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:14,682
(What are you doing, Ji Woong?)

791
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:16,052
- Why didn't you buy mine?
- Why?

792
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:17,252
(You're my cameraman.)

793
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:18,922
- What is this?
- When I go to sleep,

794
00:23:18,923 --> 00:23:20,682
I always turn on the fan next to me.

795
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:22,022
- What about now?
- That's great.

796
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:23,122
You must have one at home.

797
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:24,493
- But it's too small.
- What?

798
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,492
- It's the perfect size, right?
- This is the perfect size...

799
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:27,662
- as a nighttime fan.
- The size is great.

800
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:28,692
- It's perfect.
- The size is perfect.

801
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:30,469
This is the perfect size for it. A smaller one wouldn't do.

802
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,762
I heard the noise of the fan could shake up a house.

803
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:33,862
(Starting a rumor)

804
00:23:33,863 --> 00:23:35,362
- Eleven dollars.
- Eleven dollars.

805
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:37,603
(But another bidder joins.)

806
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,333
- Twelve dollars.
- Twelve dollars.

807
00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:41,742
As you can see, it's clear that...

808
00:23:41,743 --> 00:23:43,519
- they both have a lot of body heat.
- Right.

809
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:44,543
Two men with a lot of body heat...

810
00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:45,989
- are competing. This isn't good.
- Twelve dollars.

811
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:47,412
Twelve dollars.

812
00:23:47,413 --> 00:23:48,973
- Thirteen dollars.
- Thirteen dollars.

813
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:50,853
- Great.
- Thirteen dollars.

814
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:53,053
Let's continue. It's at 13 dollars now.

815
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:55,422
- Fifteen dollars.
- Fifteen dollars.

816
00:23:55,423 --> 00:23:56,823
(This is indeed a lucky fan!)

817
00:23:57,193 --> 00:23:58,392
(Ji Woong, how could you?)

818
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,523
- Fifteen dollars.
- Great, Ji Woong.

819
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:02,163
Fifteen dollars.

820
00:24:02,663 --> 00:24:04,063
- Twenty dollars.
- Twenty dollars.

821
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:06,733
Buy a new one with 20 dollars.

822
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:09,233
- We'll give you 30 dollars.
- You called 20 dollars.

823
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:10,973
- We'll buy you one.
- Yes.

824
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,742
- Twenty-one dollars.
- Twenty-one dollars.

825
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,019
(Cameraman Ji Woong bids 21 dollars.)

826
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:15,772
Twenty-one dollars.

827
00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:17,572
(Thinking)

828
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:18,893
Twenty-one dollars and ten cents.

829
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:20,342
- Great.
- You can't do that.

830
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:22,159
- You must bid 22 dollars.
- I'll bid 22 dollars.

831
00:24:22,183 --> 00:24:23,952
Wait. We looked it up.

832
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:25,752
You can buy a good one for 20 dollars.

833
00:24:25,753 --> 00:24:26,782
- You can order it today.
- All right.

834
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:27,882
Then it'll arrive by tomorrow.

835
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,953
No.

836
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:30,452
- No.
- Why would you buy that?

837
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:32,093
- You'll carry this around all day?
- No.

838
00:24:32,193 --> 00:24:33,692
Order it now, and you can get it by tomorrow.

839
00:24:33,693 --> 00:24:34,722
- Why would you buy that?
- No.

840
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,392
- It's very dusty.
- But...

841
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:39,102
he already placed the bid. He can't go back on it.

842
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,103
All right. It's at 22 dollars.

843
00:24:42,403 --> 00:24:44,473
- Twenty-three dollars.
- Twenty-three dollars.

844
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:46,242
- That's incredible.
- All right, Ji Woong.

845
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:47,703
- Okay.
- Raise it more.

846
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,943
- That's incredible.
- It's at 23 dollars.

847
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:51,373
Great.

848
00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:53,012
It's at 23 dollars.

849
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,242
(What will be his choice?)

850
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,253
It's at 23 dollars.

851
00:24:57,213 --> 00:24:58,252
(Striking)

852
00:24:58,253 --> 00:24:59,823
It's sold for 23 dollars.

853
00:25:00,523 --> 00:25:02,243
He'll need to carry it around all day long.

854
00:25:02,553 --> 00:25:04,852
Give it to him now.

855
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:06,563
Why did he buy it for 23 dollars?

856
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,523
- My goodness.
- I can't believe it.

857
00:25:08,663 --> 00:25:10,332
- How much was Seon Ho's item?
- Why did he buy it?

858
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,432
- Four dollars.
- Good.

859
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:14,032
Judging by the next item's price and condition,

860
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:16,132
- people will be interested in it.
- It's a new item.

861
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:17,202
It's a new item.

862
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:18,473
(It grabs people's attention.)

863
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,442
(It's an item that arouses women's interest.)

864
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:21,842
- It's an unopened item.
- How is the fragrance?

865
00:25:21,843 --> 00:25:23,672
- It's hinoki.
- Hinoki.

866
00:25:23,673 --> 00:25:25,642
- I know what it is.
- It's good until September 2027.

867
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:27,042
It was manufactured in California.

868
00:25:27,043 --> 00:25:28,812
- Yes.
- For the viewers,

869
00:25:28,813 --> 00:25:30,012
please tell us how much it actually costs.

870
00:25:30,013 --> 00:25:32,252
If you purchase it as a gift on the messenger,

871
00:25:32,253 --> 00:25:33,382
- it's 70 dollars.
- It's 70 dollars.

872
00:25:33,383 --> 00:25:34,852
On other websites, it's 100 dollars.

873
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:36,752
- If you include shipping...
- Listen.

874
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:38,222
- It's 70 dollars.
- I'll tell you this much.

875
00:25:38,223 --> 00:25:39,522
You could buy it for 70 dollars,

876
00:25:39,523 --> 00:25:40,822
but the process would go like this.

877
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:43,293
You'll need to go a supermarket in California,

878
00:25:43,493 --> 00:25:45,662
purchase the item, book a plane ticket,

879
00:25:45,663 --> 00:25:47,062
and fly back home.

880
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:48,743
- That costs 10,000 dollars, right?
- Yes.

881
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:51,232
That costs 10,070 dollars.

882
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,743
However, you can buy it today for 20 dollars.

883
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,243
How generous is that?

884
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:56,412
- It normally costs 10,070 dollars.
- So, 2 dollars.

885
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:58,213
- Twenty-five dollars.
- Twenty-five dollars.

886
00:25:58,543 --> 00:25:59,682
Since two people placed a bid at once,

887
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,812
one must raise the bid.

888
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:02,182
Who wants to raise the bid from 25 dollars?

889
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:03,482
- Twenty-eight dollars.
- Twenty-eight dollars.

890
00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:04,512
That's good.

891
00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:06,122
- Twenty-eight dollars.
- All right.

892
00:26:06,123 --> 00:26:07,152
- Let's go.
- Thirty dollars.

893
00:26:07,153 --> 00:26:08,882
Thirty dollars. Geun Hee placed a bid.

894
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:10,392
- Let's stop here.
- Really?

895
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:11,522
You shouldn't raise the bid further.

896
00:26:11,523 --> 00:26:12,562
Thirty dollars.

897
00:26:12,563 --> 00:26:14,362
- Thirty-one dollars.
- Thirty-one dollars.

898
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:16,132
I'll send it to you.

899
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:18,033
- Thirty-one dollars.
- All right.

900
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:19,532
- Thirty...
- Thirty-two dollars.

901
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:20,862
- How much?
- Thirty-two dollars.

902
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:23,173
- See? It's a popular item.
- Thirty-two dollars.

903
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,733
People should consider this.

904
00:26:25,073 --> 00:26:28,442
If Yong Han brings it to his wife, she'll be so happy.

905
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:29,612
- That's insane.
- Isn't that right?

906
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:30,943
Imagine him whipping it out.

907
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:32,613
"Did the shoot go well?" "Yes."

908
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:34,443
"Honey, what's this?"

909
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,312
"It's cream. Use it."

910
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:38,082
"Did you pick it up somewhere? Gosh, it's new."

911
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,423
- Yes. She'll go, "Le Labo?"
- Le Labo.

912
00:26:40,753 --> 00:26:41,982
"Honey, it's better than California."

913
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:43,053
Sixty dollars.

914
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:44,352
- Thirty-three dollars.
- Okay.

915
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,392
Thirty-three dollars.

916
00:26:45,393 --> 00:26:46,662
- Thirty-five dollars.
- Thirty-five dollars.

917
00:26:46,663 --> 00:26:47,663
Okay.

918
00:26:47,664 --> 00:26:49,092
(Affectionate men come forward.)

919
00:26:49,093 --> 00:26:50,862
Thirty-five dollars.

920
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:53,262
- Forty dollars.
- My goodness!

921
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:55,562
- He's getting married soon.
- That's right.

922
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:57,232
He'll get married in January.

923
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:58,302
It's a wedding gift.

924
00:26:58,303 --> 00:26:59,342
It's a wedding gift.

925
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:00,943
- The timing is perfect.
- You're right.

926
00:27:01,773 --> 00:27:03,172
- Forty dollars.
- Your wife...

927
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:04,713
will absolutely love it.

928
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,113
Forty dollars.

929
00:27:06,843 --> 00:27:07,912
- Forty-two dollars.
- Okay.

930
00:27:07,913 --> 00:27:09,283
Forty-two dollars.

931
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:11,083
That's how you use money.

932
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,283
Forty-five dollars.

933
00:27:12,783 --> 00:27:14,483
Jae Hoon.

934
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,422
- Forty-five dollars.
- There you go.

935
00:27:16,423 --> 00:27:17,822
(The two affectionate men don't give up easily.)

936
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:18,893
Forty...

937
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:20,962
- Forty-seven dollars.
- Forty-seven dollars.

938
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:21,963
All right!

939
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:23,262
- Now... Let's go.
- Fifty dollars.

940
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:24,563
Let's wrap it up at 50 dollars.

941
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:26,603
- So, 40...
- Let's wrap it up at 50 dollars.

942
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:28,563
Writers, give it more effort.

943
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:30,772
Fifty dollars.

944
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:34,502
(Writer Jang Geun Hee, 50 dollars)

945
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:35,503
Fifty dollars.

946
00:27:35,504 --> 00:27:38,142
(The affectionate men are taken aback.)

947
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:39,712
We're at 50 dollars in the end.

948
00:27:39,713 --> 00:27:41,659
- We're at that price in the end.
- This is incredible.

949
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:43,613
It'll end once I repeat the price three times.

950
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,083
Fifty dollars.

951
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:47,322
- Fifty dollars.
- Fifty dollars.

952
00:27:47,323 --> 00:27:49,123
- Come on.
- Raise it by one dollar.

953
00:27:50,193 --> 00:27:51,252
- Okay.
- Sold!

954
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,722
- Okay.
- It's sold for 50 dollars.

955
00:27:52,723 --> 00:27:54,762
- It was what we wanted.
- Will it go to Geun Hee?

956
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:56,609
- Give it to her after she pays.
- Do you want me to sign it?

957
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,633
- No.
- Really?

958
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,832
She doesn't want it.

959
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,332
(I don't want your autograph.)

960
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,132
- This is nice.
- All right.

961
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:03,872
- DinDin did it.
- DinDin didn't disappoint.

962
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:05,033
Being earnest helped.

963
00:28:05,203 --> 00:28:06,872
We only have a useless item left.

964
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:08,473
- What should I do?
- I'll sell it well.

965
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,642
- Will you sell Sae Ho's item?
- Will you sell it?

966
00:28:10,643 --> 00:28:12,272
(Your pet pigeon, Cho Bird)

967
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,412
The last seller is Cho Sae Ho.

968
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:16,929
(It's really nice to meet you. Thank you very much.)

969
00:28:16,953 --> 00:28:18,993
- Please introduce the item.
- He really is polite.

970
00:28:19,183 --> 00:28:20,883
You must be very lonely.

971
00:28:20,983 --> 00:28:22,823
Why don't you purchase a pigeon for your home?

972
00:28:24,423 --> 00:28:26,662
When you're lonely and exhausted in this society,

973
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,503
not having anyone at home might wear you down.

974
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,132
Until you come home,

975
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:32,763
this pigeon will wait for you.

976
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,632
It won't cry at all.

977
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:37,902
It'll simply sit in this nest.

978
00:28:37,903 --> 00:28:38,932
Nice.

979
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:42,042
If you touch this nest, you'll see that it's very soft.

980
00:28:42,043 --> 00:28:43,843
You can use it for taking a nap.

981
00:28:44,613 --> 00:28:48,612
It'll help you when you take a light nap.

982
00:28:48,613 --> 00:28:51,012
Although this nest is the pigeon's home,

983
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:53,453
it won't scream at you for taking it away.

984
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:55,882
It'll simply wait quietly.

985
00:28:55,883 --> 00:28:57,693
It's the symbol of peace.

986
00:28:57,923 --> 00:29:00,123
- The starting bid is...
- Here comes the starting bid.

987
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,392
It costs less than ten dollars.

988
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:02,933
- It's 20 dollars.
- What?

989
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,632
That's too much.

990
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:05,633
The starting bid for Cho Bird is...

991
00:29:05,634 --> 00:29:07,132
- twenty dollars.
- I think Ji Woong looked it up.

992
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:08,332
- How much is it?
- It's 4.5 dollars.

993
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,409
(Internet price, 4.5 dollars)

994
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:11,773
That's too much. He jacked up the price five times.

995
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:15,172
On the market, they sell a different set.

996
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:17,613
What I have here is the nest set.

997
00:29:18,213 --> 00:29:19,853
It's the nest set. It's the nest edition.

998
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:21,889
The starting bid is 20 dollars. Do we have 20 dollars?

999
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:23,912
Twenty dollars. One, two, three.

1000
00:29:23,913 --> 00:29:25,833
All right. The starting bid is now five dollars.

1001
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,783
Five dollars.

1002
00:29:28,453 --> 00:29:29,729
- Do we have five dollars?
- No.

1003
00:29:29,753 --> 00:29:31,652
- One, two, three.
- You can't get it anywhere.

1004
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:32,693
People don't want it.

1005
00:29:32,923 --> 00:29:34,322
Now, the price is 1 dollar. It's the 1-dollar happiness.

1006
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:36,032
You can get a pigeon for one dollar.

1007
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,192
- It's like a giveaway.
- One dollar.

1008
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:39,362
(Is there...)

1009
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:40,762
(a bidder?)

1010
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:41,862
- One dollar.
- One dollar.

1011
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,149
- One dollar and fifty cents.
- One dollar and fifty cents.

1012
00:29:43,173 --> 00:29:44,332
- Pigeon.
- Let's go.

1013
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:45,903
- Two dollars.
- Two dollars?

1014
00:29:46,073 --> 00:29:48,072
- Do you want it for two dollars?
- It's cute.

1015
00:29:48,073 --> 00:29:49,073
(Unbelievable)

1016
00:29:49,074 --> 00:29:50,872
- Watching the birds fly away - Watching the birds fly away

1017
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:52,212
The lowest price has been met.

1018
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:53,989
Currently, the highest bid is 2 dollars. I'll count to 3.

1019
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:55,683
- Two dollars.
- Four dollars?

1020
00:29:56,513 --> 00:29:57,613
Four dollars.

1021
00:29:58,183 --> 00:29:59,552
- Four dollars.
- Okay.

1022
00:29:59,553 --> 00:30:00,922
(Okay!)

1023
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:01,952
- What's up with you?
- Seriously.

1024
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:03,852
- Do you want to waste money?
- Is it your hobby?

1025
00:30:03,853 --> 00:30:04,992
- Seriously.
- If you carry that around,

1026
00:30:04,993 --> 00:30:06,292
people will be shocked.

1027
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:07,293
Will you walk it like this?

1028
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:08,392
- Hey.
- How will you use it?

1029
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:10,132
- Hold it for a second.
- What are you doing?

1030
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,493
- Hold on.
- What are you doing?

1031
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:14,402
- I mean...
- I'll let you touch it.

1032
00:30:14,403 --> 00:30:15,702
Hold it for a second.

1033
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:17,072
- Why do you want it?
- It's really nice.

1034
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:18,553
- It'll look so strange.
- It's cute.

1035
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,402
- It's cute.
- It's cute.

1036
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,373
- It looks so strange.
- Jung Hyun is cute.

1037
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,142
It looks so strange.

1038
00:30:24,143 --> 00:30:25,642
- How cute.
- It's cute.

1039
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:27,182
It's so scary.

1040
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:28,543
All right. Four dollars.

1041
00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:30,163
I'll say it three times. Four dollars.

1042
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,412
Four dollars. It's sold.

1043
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,682
(Cho Bird is sold for 4 dollars.)

1044
00:30:33,683 --> 00:30:35,043
- I can't believe it.
- Jung Hyun.

1045
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:37,152
(The results of the bids)

1046
00:30:37,153 --> 00:30:38,722
(The winning bid amount: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th)

1047
00:30:38,723 --> 00:30:40,262
(1st: 20, 2nd: 15, 3rd: 10)

1048
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:41,792
(4th: 5, 5th: 3)

1049
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:43,462
- Do we have 26 yeopjeons?
- Yes.

1050
00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:44,592
We have 30 yeopjeons.

1051
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,733
This is ridiculous.

1052
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:47,402
(We won this round.)

1053
00:30:47,403 --> 00:30:48,862
- We won.
- Good.

1054
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:50,873
This is ridiculous. My teammates are useless.

1055
00:30:52,373 --> 00:30:54,602
You should complain to them, not us.

1056
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,972
You can accumulate more yeopjeons...

1057
00:30:56,973 --> 00:30:59,113
- throughout the trip.
- We won.

1058
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:02,143
- Let's begin the trip cheerfully.
- Let's go!

1059
00:31:02,183 --> 00:31:04,013
- All right.
- Let's go to the shade.

1060
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:06,422
If you've won a bid, please transfer the money.

1061
00:31:06,423 --> 00:31:07,483
How much was it?

1062
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:10,423
(They signed the items with care and delivered them.)

1063
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:13,223
"I'll be your servant, Kwon Gi Jong."

1064
00:31:14,393 --> 00:31:17,193
(Thank you for purchasing the item.)

1065
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:18,632
Now, it's time...

1066
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:20,162
for the War of Money!

1067
00:31:20,163 --> 00:31:22,033
The war of yeopjeon at Uiryeong...

1068
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:23,272
begins now.

1069
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:24,503
Who are we?

1070
00:31:24,803 --> 00:31:25,832
2 Days...

1071
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,873
- 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

1072
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:30,312
(Number 1 village of the wealthy)

1073
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:32,413
(What kind of trip will unfold at Uiryeong?)

1074
00:31:33,343 --> 00:31:34,882
- What was the team name?
- Was it OG?

1075
00:31:34,883 --> 00:31:36,582
- Team Originals?
- Shall we come up with one?

1076
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,113
Team... How about this?

1077
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:39,923
Interpretations Over Dreams.

1078
00:31:40,223 --> 00:31:41,943
- Gosh.
- Team Interpretations Over Dreams.

1079
00:31:42,123 --> 00:31:43,593
- Come on.
- What?

1080
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,123
It's worth two dollars.

1081
00:31:45,993 --> 00:31:47,662
(Pondering)

1082
00:31:47,663 --> 00:31:48,893
Let's go with this name.

1083
00:31:49,563 --> 00:31:50,563
- Kim.
- Kim.

1084
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:51,563
- Kim from Kim Jong Min.
- Kim.

1085
00:31:51,564 --> 00:31:53,232
Moon from Moon Se Yoon. Cheol from Lim Cheol.

1086
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:54,402
Team Kim Moon Cheol.

1087
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:56,303
- Okay.
- Team Kim Moon Cheol.

1088
00:31:56,473 --> 00:31:58,603
Team Kim Moon Cheol! That's a good name.

1089
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:00,103
Let's practice.

1090
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:01,872
- Kim from Kim Jong Min.
- Moon from Moon Se Yoon.

1091
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:02,873
Cheol from DinDin.

1092
00:32:02,873 --> 00:32:03,873
(Acting cute)

1093
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:05,012
- We're Team Kim Moon Cheol.
- We're Team Kim Moon Cheol.

1094
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:06,382
(We're Team Kim Moon Cheol.)

1095
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,713
- Okay.
- Okay.

1096
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:09,242
- We won't lose.
- Right?

1097
00:32:09,243 --> 00:32:10,983
It's impossible to lose against them.

1098
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:12,212
We took all the wins...

1099
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:13,399
- on Jeju Island.
- That's right.

1100
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:16,822
Our strategy of the day is not thinking that we'll lose.

1101
00:32:16,823 --> 00:32:17,893
That's right.

1102
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:19,392
The dinner will be grand.

1103
00:32:19,393 --> 00:32:21,862
The dinner will be grand. We have to win no matter what.

1104
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:23,503
This place is famous for Korean beef too.

1105
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:25,963
Five minutes remain.

1106
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,693
- Gosh, this is...
- The road is rough.

1107
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,332
Hold on tight. The uphill road is no joke.

1108
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,402
What's this?

1109
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:33,449
- Are we going into the mountains?
- Where are we going?

1110
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:34,643
Is this the right way?

1111
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:38,242
(An uphill road suddenly appears.)

1112
00:32:38,243 --> 00:32:40,112
We're going into the mountains.

1113
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:41,313
It's slippery.

1114
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:42,812
I think we took a wrong turn.

1115
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:44,253
- We're on the right path.
- No way.

1116
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:46,883
- It's so steep.
- The angle is like 90°.

1117
00:32:47,323 --> 00:32:48,723
No one is following us.

1118
00:32:49,323 --> 00:32:50,992
My goodness. Hey.

1119
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:52,722
- What's this?
- We're on the right path.

1120
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:53,763
Are we?

1121
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:56,562
We might become a bit nervous if we don't eat.

1122
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:57,563
But think about it.

1123
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,702
We should be very happy that we came together for the shoot.

1124
00:33:00,703 --> 00:33:01,703
- I know.
- That's right.

1125
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:03,773
- It's nothing.
- Let's do well today.

1126
00:33:03,873 --> 00:33:06,143
- Okay.
- When were we a team?

1127
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,802
- On Jeju Island.
- On Jeju Island.

1128
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:09,603
- Was it Jeju Island?
- Team Along with Joon.

1129
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:11,672
(Unfortunately, they had a complete defeat.)

1130
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:12,913
We had a complete defeat.

1131
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:17,082
These days, our winning rates are...

1132
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,382
- They're high.
- They're very high.

1133
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:20,152
We just need to do it.

1134
00:33:20,153 --> 00:33:22,052
I was too determined back then. I used to think,

1135
00:33:22,053 --> 00:33:24,453
"My life will be over if I don't do this right."

1136
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:26,522
- "Let's do it haphazardly..."
- Really?

1137
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:27,969
- "without any expectations."
- That's right.

1138
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:29,532
If you have that mindset, things work out well.

1139
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:30,763
Let's enjoy the trip.

1140
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,862
- We shouldn't work too hard.
- Let's enjoy the trip and have fun.

1141
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:34,183
- Let's have fun.
- That's right.

1142
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:35,932
Relaxing at first...

1143
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,172
is the most important step.

1144
00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:38,233
That's right.

1145
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:40,402
How about Team Ho Joon Ho?

1146
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:41,943
Team Ho Joon Ho? That sounds good.

1147
00:33:42,443 --> 00:33:44,472
This is the place that birthed many rich people,

1148
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:45,943
Uiryeong's village of the wealthy.

1149
00:33:46,743 --> 00:33:49,283
(There's a golden toad at the entrance.)

1150
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,383
(The energy is nice.)

1151
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:54,153
Let's check this out. This is incredible.

1152
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:55,782
(It's a place with an affluent energy.)

1153
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,922
This is the start and end points...

1154
00:33:57,923 --> 00:34:00,362
of Uiryeong's Bujat-gil, a famous trekking trail.

1155
00:34:00,363 --> 00:34:02,693
- Many famous people were born here.
- Yes.

1156
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:05,263
(Buja Square is the starting point.)

1157
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:07,432
(Uiryeong's Bujat-gil is a trail with a rich energy.)

1158
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:09,202
(It takes you through Hoam Lee Byung Chul's house, )

1159
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:11,732
(Tower Rock, and the pine tree of Seonghwang-ri.)

1160
00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:14,903
Let's take a stroll around the village.

1161
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:17,242
This village is very pretty.

1162
00:34:17,243 --> 00:34:18,473
I like such places.

1163
00:34:18,613 --> 00:34:20,543
It's therapeutic, right?

1164
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:23,012
What kind of a tree is it?

1165
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:24,282
- A pine tree?
- A happy tree.

1166
00:34:24,283 --> 00:34:25,689
(Bujat-gil is a charming trail with nice details.)

1167
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:27,883
It's the birthplace of Lee Byung Chul.

1168
00:34:29,423 --> 00:34:30,993
(Birthplace of Lee Byung Chul)

1169
00:34:31,993 --> 00:34:33,662
- Did he live here?
- What's this?

1170
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:35,523
This house is no joke.

1171
00:34:37,663 --> 00:34:38,833
Look there.

1172
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:42,002
This place is amazing.

1173
00:34:42,003 --> 00:34:43,602
(The birthplace of Hoam Lee Byung Chul)

1174
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:46,202
(Hoam lived here since his childhood until he moved out.)

1175
00:34:46,203 --> 00:34:48,172
This is a must-visit tourist spot in Uiryeong...

1176
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:51,113
where many tourists visit to receive good energy.

1177
00:34:51,243 --> 00:34:52,612
What's this? Is this a well?

1178
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:53,973
- It's a well.
- Yes, it's a well.

1179
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:57,253
(There's a large well as well.)

1180
00:34:57,683 --> 00:34:59,883
(If you go toward the main building...)

1181
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:02,252
(Buja Gibawi Rock: The rock symbolizes good health, )

1182
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:04,422
(longevity, wealth, and prosperity for the family living in the house.)

1183
00:35:04,423 --> 00:35:05,922
Raise your hands to receive the energy.

1184
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:07,063
(Let's get the good energy.)

1185
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:11,033
Get the energy. One, two, three.

1186
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:15,803
(Dear viewers, here's rich energy for you.)

1187
00:35:16,803 --> 00:35:18,602
There are two wells here, which symbolize wealth.

1188
00:35:18,603 --> 00:35:19,603
- Exactly.
- I've never seen a house...

1189
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:20,603
with two wells.

1190
00:35:20,604 --> 00:35:22,404
It's like having two water purifiers at home.

1191
00:35:22,673 --> 00:35:24,213
- What's this?
- This place is...

1192
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:26,542
- They stored rice over there.
- Oh, my.

1193
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:27,682
(The storage is unbelievably large.)

1194
00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:29,753
(Abundant)

1195
00:35:30,053 --> 00:35:31,553
I almost ran out of instant rice.

1196
00:35:32,283 --> 00:35:33,622
It's very neat and tidy.

1197
00:35:33,623 --> 00:35:34,782
(You can guess how wealthy they were based on the size of it.)

1198
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:36,593
- It's like a museum.
- Exactly.

1199
00:35:37,853 --> 00:35:40,323
I would've worked here if I had been born in those days.

1200
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:43,462
- Right. Let's enjoy our lives.
- All you need to do is...

1201
00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:45,832
- Yes.
- to find happiness in your heart.

1202
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:46,913
Let's just enjoy our lives.

1203
00:35:47,263 --> 00:35:50,003
Let's get out of the car. One, two, three.

1204
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:51,603
Gosh, it's hot.

1205
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:55,843
We came to a mountain?

1206
00:35:56,473 --> 00:35:58,842
Cicadas, be quiet. They're so loud.

1207
00:35:58,843 --> 00:35:59,882
(They're somewhere in a mountain valley.)

1208
00:35:59,883 --> 00:36:01,519
Where are we? We're on top of a mountain.

1209
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:03,312
- You're right.
- We're on a mountain.

1210
00:36:03,313 --> 00:36:04,633
(They came into the leafy woods.)

1211
00:36:06,353 --> 00:36:08,223
It's a bit better walking under the shade.

1212
00:36:10,223 --> 00:36:11,223
What is that?

1213
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,413
I see a rock over there. Is it the one we heard about?

1214
00:36:14,823 --> 00:36:15,993
Could that be Mr. Rock?

1215
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:17,592
- "Mr. Rock?"
- Mr. Rock.

1216
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,662
Mr. Rock.

1217
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:20,202
It says it's called "Tower Rock."

1218
00:36:20,203 --> 00:36:22,302
That's right. The rock you're looking at is...

1219
00:36:22,303 --> 00:36:25,832
called "Tower Rock" as it looks like a tower built with stone plates.

1220
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,002
"Tower Rock?"

1221
00:36:27,003 --> 00:36:30,013
It's 1 of the 3 rocks in Uiryeong that make your wish come true.

1222
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:31,972
If you have a wish that you really want to make come true,

1223
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:33,512
- you can make a wish here.
- Okay.

1224
00:36:33,513 --> 00:36:35,412
- We make a wish and leave? Okay.
- Got it.

1225
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:37,733
(The place is believed to make people's wishes come true.)

1226
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,822
(They approach the place for their first mission.)

1227
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,923
Dear me.

1228
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,192
- What's this?
- What? Why is there...

1229
00:36:45,193 --> 00:36:46,193
Hey, there are yeopjeons here.

1230
00:36:46,194 --> 00:36:47,663
Where did the losers go?

1231
00:36:48,223 --> 00:36:49,832
Se Yoon, please lie down.

1232
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,633
- What?
- What do you mean?

1233
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,353
- Can you please lie down?
- Why?

1234
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,562
You want me to lie down? That's random.

1235
00:36:54,563 --> 00:36:56,039
- Just do as he says.
- Why should I...

1236
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:57,709
- Can you please lie down?
- In this direction?

1237
00:36:57,733 --> 00:36:59,602
- Yes, horizontally.
- On my back?

1238
00:36:59,603 --> 00:37:01,042
- Yes, please.
- But why?

1239
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:02,403
- There you go.
- What's going on?

1240
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:03,612
What is going on?

1241
00:37:03,613 --> 00:37:04,613
(Lying down)

1242
00:37:04,614 --> 00:37:06,312
You'll begin your mission in this position.

1243
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:07,543
- What?
- What?

1244
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:08,657
What is going on?

1245
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,941
You'll begin your mission in this position.

1246
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:12,142
- What?
- What?

1247
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:14,512
The mission you'll carry out near Tower Rock is...

1248
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:16,941
(On your shaking belly)

1249
00:37:16,942 --> 00:37:17,942
What?

1250
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:19,911
(The yeopjeon tower is built)

1251
00:37:19,912 --> 00:37:22,252
- He's basically mocking Se Yoon.
- There's no way.

1252
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:24,952
How could you say, "On your shaking belly?"

1253
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:26,782
So will they build a tower on my belly?

1254
00:37:27,152 --> 00:37:28,321
That's correct.

1255
00:37:28,322 --> 00:37:29,361
There's a lot of space on his belly.

1256
00:37:29,362 --> 00:37:32,461
The 2 of you have 1 minute...

1257
00:37:32,462 --> 00:37:34,791
to stack yeopjeons on Se Yoon's belly.

1258
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,001
You will gain the yeopjeons you have stacked...

1259
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:39,002
when time is up.

1260
00:37:40,332 --> 00:37:41,652
But his belly is shaking so much.

1261
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:43,971
We need a solid foundation.

1262
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,672
Why is his belly sticking out when he's lying down?

1263
00:37:47,112 --> 00:37:49,842
- It's flat when you're lying down.
- It's usually flat.

1264
00:37:50,282 --> 00:37:51,681
We need you to roll it up up to here...

1265
00:37:51,682 --> 00:37:52,811
so that we can put yeopjeons here... Gosh.

1266
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,481
- My gosh!
- Don't do that. Stop it.

1267
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,822
What did I just see?

1268
00:37:57,522 --> 00:38:01,551
(Belly roll)

1269
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:03,061
- My gosh.
- Oh, my. What is this?

1270
00:38:03,062 --> 00:38:04,662
He's doing a belly roll. That's no joke.

1271
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:06,532
- Why?
- What did I just see?

1272
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:09,201
He must have strong abs. Or else, he can't do that.

1273
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:11,362
Yes, he has strong abs, but they're covered with fat.

1274
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:13,671
(Peaceful)

1275
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:14,731
This is a hard thing to do.

1276
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:15,971
- Of course.
- His belly is so big.

1277
00:38:15,972 --> 00:38:17,871
I used to do body rolls and breakdance, you know.

1278
00:38:17,872 --> 00:38:19,671
- It's really hard to do.
- Gosh, the sun hurts my eyes.

1279
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,641
Can we put yeopjeons anywhere we want?

1280
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:23,242
But his belly is too soft.

1281
00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:25,111
It's better than stacking them up on a hard surface.

1282
00:38:25,112 --> 00:38:27,181
If you have a hard belly, it'd move abruptly...

1283
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,412
when you laugh.

1284
00:38:28,982 --> 00:38:32,551
(Jong Min thinks it's too soft to stack yeopjeons on it.)

1285
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:34,191
Also, since I can do a belly roll, my belly would jiggle.

1286
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:35,622
So it would only curve. Trust me.

1287
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:37,491
Is it better if I leave it be?

1288
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:39,331
Or is it better if I stick it out? I'm not good at holding my breath.

1289
00:38:39,332 --> 00:38:40,908
- No. Don't stick it out.
- It's better if you don't.

1290
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:42,201
Make it flat.

1291
00:38:42,202 --> 00:38:43,531
- There you go.
- That's perfect.

1292
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:44,702
- Good.
- That's good.

1293
00:38:45,002 --> 00:38:46,431
Don't breathe. You know what I mean, right?

1294
00:38:46,432 --> 00:38:48,152
Try not to move your belly while breathing.

1295
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:51,042
- Shall we give it a try?
- You have only one chance.

1296
00:38:51,302 --> 00:38:53,872
In 1 minute, each of you builds 1 tower.

1297
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:55,441
One tower each?

1298
00:38:55,442 --> 00:38:57,942
It'll be easier than we think. Ten yeopjeons are this thick.

1299
00:38:58,182 --> 00:38:59,558
Can we put them in your belly button?

1300
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:01,081
- Of course.
- Really?

1301
00:39:01,082 --> 00:39:03,382
- Oh, gosh. Hold on.
- Good. It fits perfectly.

1302
00:39:03,922 --> 00:39:06,162
I often put coins in my belly button in my comedy skits.

1303
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:09,152
I wonder it'll come out if I do a belly roll.

1304
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:12,292
(Shaking)

1305
00:39:13,662 --> 00:39:15,091
- We stack one each?
- You have a special skill.

1306
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:16,452
(It's as elastic as a trampoline.)

1307
00:39:16,662 --> 00:39:18,261
- Okay, I got it.
- Don't breathe, okay?

1308
00:39:18,262 --> 00:39:19,631
You'll gain the yeopjeons you stack up in one minute.

1309
00:39:19,632 --> 00:39:21,601
- Okay. Let's start.
- Okay. We'll begin now.

1310
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:22,602
- One minute?
- Hey.

1311
00:39:23,642 --> 00:39:24,672
Okay.

1312
00:39:26,512 --> 00:39:29,042
(He stops breathing.)

1313
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:32,612
(They start with a lot of yeopjeons.)

1314
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:35,682
It's hard to make them stand.

1315
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:37,552
Flex your belly. Come on!

1316
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:41,252
(It's as soft as pudding.)

1317
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:43,832
I can stack up about 20 of them on his belly button.

1318
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:47,091
(DinDin successfully stacked up a lot of yeopjeons.)

1319
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:48,902
Put them on my belly button.

1320
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:51,301
Put them on my belly button.

1321
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:53,902
(The tower collapses as he speaks.)

1322
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:55,401
(This isn't easy.)

1323
00:39:55,402 --> 00:39:56,962
- On my belly button.
- Thirty seconds.

1324
00:39:57,072 --> 00:39:58,242
Gosh. Hold on a second.

1325
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:01,071
(His belly is getting softer.)

1326
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:02,192
Put them on my belly button.

1327
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:03,541
Look. I can't stack them.

1328
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:04,662
Put them on my belly button.

1329
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:06,851
- Don't speak.
- On my belly button.

1330
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:08,012
I said don't talk!

1331
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:11,162
- I told you...
- It's standing on the belly button.

1332
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:14,522
- On my belly button...
- Don't move or speak. Doing good.

1333
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:16,991
(I should not move?)

1334
00:40:16,992 --> 00:40:17,992
Doing good.

1335
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:19,961
(Impatient)

1336
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:20,991
You're doing good now.

1337
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,202
(Collapsing)

1338
00:40:23,562 --> 00:40:25,872
(He looks so serious.)

1339
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,401
- Put them on my belly button.
- Thirty seconds.

1340
00:40:27,402 --> 00:40:28,432
Gosh. Hold on a second.

1341
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,301
(They move their hands hastily.)

1342
00:40:31,302 --> 00:40:32,742
Hey, don't move your belly. Come on.

1343
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,971
Don't speak. Don't even breathe.

1344
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:36,441
- Why are you breathing?
- Forty seconds.

1345
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:37,512
Stop it. Stay still.

1346
00:40:39,012 --> 00:40:41,981
(Precarious)

1347
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,921
We need this stack to stay standing. We need these yeopjeons.

1348
00:40:43,922 --> 00:40:45,391
- You shouldn't make it collapse.
- I said don't do that!

1349
00:40:45,392 --> 00:40:46,451
(Collapsing)

1350
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:47,452
- Okay.
- We need this stack...

1351
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:50,221
(They keep telling him to stay still, )

1352
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:53,262
(but he can't help but laugh.)

1353
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,661
(Not much time is left.)

1354
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:57,531
- Stop breathing now.
- Let's not add any more of them.

1355
00:40:57,532 --> 00:40:58,931
Stop breathing now.

1356
00:40:58,932 --> 00:41:01,471
(They successfully stacked a bunch of yeopjeons.)

1357
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:02,841
- Let's leave them as they are now.
- Eight,

1358
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:04,972
- Don't add another yeopjeon.
- seven, six...

1359
00:41:05,142 --> 00:41:08,341
(If they hold out, they'll gain quite a lot of yeopjeons.)

1360
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:10,481
(But...)

1361
00:41:10,482 --> 00:41:13,552
(Se Yoon's belly shakes hard.)

1362
00:41:13,782 --> 00:41:16,382
Each of us can make one tower, you fool.

1363
00:41:17,052 --> 00:41:19,852
Five, four, three,

1364
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:21,851
two, one.

1365
00:41:21,852 --> 00:41:22,921
- I think I can add a few.
- Time's up.

1366
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:24,891
- I could've added a few.
- No. This is enough.

1367
00:41:24,892 --> 00:41:26,061
- Time's up.
- Okay.

1368
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:27,062
(Even at a glance, you can see there are tens of yeopjeons.)

1369
00:41:27,063 --> 00:41:28,261
Okay. You've obtained those yeopjeons.

1370
00:41:28,262 --> 00:41:30,731
- We did quite well.
- Did you stack a lot of them?

1371
00:41:30,732 --> 00:41:32,071
- Shall we put one at a time?
- Yes.

1372
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,031
- But it's a lot.
- Put them on his belly.

1373
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:36,202
- One, two...
- One, two...

1374
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:38,341
- Four.
- Four.

1375
00:41:38,342 --> 00:41:39,412
Five.

1376
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:44,042
(His belly is spacious enough to put all the yeopjeons on it.)

1377
00:41:44,242 --> 00:41:45,881
- We stacked a lot of them.
- You got 59 yeopjeons.

1378
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:47,251
We got 59 yeopjeons. That's a lot.

1379
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:48,998
Right. We did better than we thought, right?

1380
00:41:49,022 --> 00:41:50,122
It's not bad.

1381
00:41:50,222 --> 00:41:51,952
We got more yeopjeons than we got earlier.

1382
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:56,161
Next time, let's do something like crushing garlic on my belly.

1383
00:41:56,162 --> 00:41:57,221
Crush garlic on my belly.

1384
00:41:57,222 --> 00:41:58,661
Right on my belly!

1385
00:41:58,662 --> 00:42:00,382
You can just put a metal plate on my belly.

1386
00:42:00,532 --> 00:42:02,508
Jong Min, can I try it just once since we're here?

1387
00:42:02,532 --> 00:42:04,012
I want to try to stack yeopjeons too.

1388
00:42:04,232 --> 00:42:05,901
I don't know how it feels.

1389
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:06,932
(Okay.)

1390
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:09,171
He has a potbelly.

1391
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:11,402
(Bulging)

1392
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:13,871
It's cute. His belly is cute.

1393
00:42:13,872 --> 00:42:15,311
(His skin is milky and soft like a newborn baby's belly.)

1394
00:42:15,312 --> 00:42:16,382
Oh, it works.

1395
00:42:16,442 --> 00:42:18,682
Can't I just push the yeopjeons into his intestine?

1396
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,681
With force. I'll take them out afterward.

1397
00:42:23,682 --> 00:42:24,721
(It must be helpful for digestion.)

1398
00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:25,951
Let's move to the next location.

1399
00:42:25,952 --> 00:42:28,122
(Team Kim Moon Cheol is winning with a light heart.)

1400
00:42:28,322 --> 00:42:30,122
Can you tell us what the other team is doing?

1401
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:32,231
- Ho.
- Joon.

1402
00:42:32,232 --> 00:42:34,138
- You stand in the middle.
- Right. You're Joon.

1403
00:42:34,162 --> 00:42:35,461
- All right. Ho.
- Joon.

1404
00:42:35,462 --> 00:42:36,801
- Ho.
- Team Ho Joon Ho.

1405
00:42:36,802 --> 00:42:37,901
- We've got this.
- We've got this.

1406
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:40,502
- Okay. All right.
- That was so awkward.

1407
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:43,601
The first yeopjeon mission you'll do here is...

1408
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,841
the famous quote from a founder of a company...

1409
00:42:45,842 --> 00:42:48,241
and the popular line from "Reborn Rich."

1410
00:42:48,242 --> 00:42:49,762
"How many grains of rice are in here?"

1411
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,558
- Correct. That's the name.
- Is that it?

1412
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:52,751
How Many Grains of Rice Are in Here?

1413
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:54,011
(The yeopjeon mission: How Many Grains of Rice Are in Here?)

1414
00:42:54,012 --> 00:42:56,821
You have to put grains of rice on your face...

1415
00:42:56,822 --> 00:42:59,052
and throw them into the bowl in front of you.

1416
00:42:59,492 --> 00:43:00,992
You will take turns.

1417
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:04,222
And you'll get as many yeopjeons as the average of your results.

1418
00:43:04,962 --> 00:43:05,991
- Like this?
- Yes.

1419
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:07,361
- Okay.
- That looks hard.

1420
00:43:07,362 --> 00:43:08,691
A sweaty face will be a disadvantage.

1421
00:43:08,692 --> 00:43:11,732
It's okay. I can shake them off like this.

1422
00:43:12,032 --> 00:43:13,101
We'll begin now.

1423
00:43:13,102 --> 00:43:14,271
(Joon will try.)

1424
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:16,242
Let's go. I can do this.

1425
00:43:16,772 --> 00:43:17,772
Ready.

1426
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:18,941
(The time limit, 30 seconds)

1427
00:43:18,942 --> 00:43:20,742
- Set. Go.
- Set.

1428
00:43:23,512 --> 00:43:25,311
- Good.
- You're doing well.

1429
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:26,552
You're getting a lot of grains.

1430
00:43:26,882 --> 00:43:29,652
(It's as if he were coating a donut with sugar.)

1431
00:43:30,382 --> 00:43:32,262
(Shaking the rice off to make them fly forward)

1432
00:43:32,422 --> 00:43:35,222
(A lot of grains of rice are going into the bowl.)

1433
00:43:36,192 --> 00:43:37,192
Good.

1434
00:43:38,022 --> 00:43:39,391
Do you think you can make them fly a little bit farther?

1435
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:41,161
It'd be great if they could fly a bit farther.

1436
00:43:41,162 --> 00:43:43,561
Good. But you're losing a lot of them.

1437
00:43:43,562 --> 00:43:45,502
It's okay. Try to make them fly farther.

1438
00:43:46,532 --> 00:43:48,071
- There you go. You're doing great.
- Just a little bit more.

1439
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:49,841
- You're doing great now.
- That's good.

1440
00:43:49,842 --> 00:43:52,001
- Just a little bit more.
- Keep doing it as you do now.

1441
00:43:52,002 --> 00:43:53,511
- You're doing great now.
- Just a little bit more.

1442
00:43:53,512 --> 00:43:54,832
You should get a little bit more.

1443
00:43:54,872 --> 00:43:56,512
- That's good.
- A bit farther than that.

1444
00:43:56,712 --> 00:43:58,672
- You have ten seconds left.
- Farther than that.

1445
00:44:00,382 --> 00:44:01,382
Farther than that.

1446
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:02,622
- Like that.
- Good.

1447
00:44:03,122 --> 00:44:04,382
Try harder!

1448
00:44:04,682 --> 00:44:07,951
- Three, two, one.
- Put them all on your face.

1449
00:44:07,952 --> 00:44:08,991
- Time's up.
- Okay. Good job.

1450
00:44:08,992 --> 00:44:10,662
- He got a lot of grains.
- But...

1451
00:44:11,092 --> 00:44:12,991
My face hurts so much.

1452
00:44:12,992 --> 00:44:15,091
- Wait. Will you be accurate?
- My face...

1453
00:44:15,092 --> 00:44:16,461
- Of course.
- It really hurts.

1454
00:44:16,462 --> 00:44:17,661
- My face...
- You'll count them accurately?

1455
00:44:17,662 --> 00:44:19,272
- Really?
- My face really hurts.

1456
00:44:19,432 --> 00:44:21,271
- It hurts more than expected.
- Really?

1457
00:44:21,272 --> 00:44:23,912
As I pressed my face hard on them to make them stick to my face...

1458
00:44:24,172 --> 00:44:25,342
I'm dizzy. Gosh.

1459
00:44:25,772 --> 00:44:26,772
(Groaning)

1460
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:28,512
I think Joon got about 40 grains.

1461
00:44:29,112 --> 00:44:31,181
It's pointless to shake them off.

1462
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:33,088
- You should throw them far.
- Right. You should throw them.

1463
00:44:33,112 --> 00:44:34,281
Yes, based on my experience.

1464
00:44:34,282 --> 00:44:35,402
What do you think is better?

1465
00:44:35,682 --> 00:44:37,222
Let's eat the rice we have left here.

1466
00:44:37,482 --> 00:44:38,991
- But...
- Because it's carbs?

1467
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:40,251
- Yes.
- I came up with a strategy.

1468
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:41,692
- Ready.
- See if it works, okay?

1469
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:43,492
Set. Go.

1470
00:44:44,622 --> 00:44:46,632
- No.
- Hey, stop it.

1471
00:44:47,362 --> 00:44:49,761
(He wanted to push them and make them fly, but...)

1472
00:44:49,762 --> 00:44:51,201
- Seon Ho, it's not working.
- There you go.

1473
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:52,932
That's not it. It's not working.

1474
00:44:53,472 --> 00:44:54,902
Yes, that's better. Keep going.

1475
00:44:55,102 --> 00:44:56,371
- That's better. On the side...
- Stick them on your face.

1476
00:44:56,372 --> 00:44:59,641
Not your forehead. Yes, that's better. There you go.

1477
00:44:59,642 --> 00:45:01,811
Yes, that's good. You're doing great now.

1478
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:02,911
He's doing a really bad job.

1479
00:45:02,912 --> 00:45:05,041
Yes, he's doing a bad job. But still... Hey.

1480
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:07,242
- He's really bad at this.
- You're really bad at this.

1481
00:45:07,412 --> 00:45:08,752
Hey, you're so bad at this.

1482
00:45:11,082 --> 00:45:12,252
Are you okay?

1483
00:45:13,352 --> 00:45:15,092
- Seon Ho.
- Are you all right?

1484
00:45:15,452 --> 00:45:16,692
Seon Ho, it's okay.

1485
00:45:16,962 --> 00:45:19,262
- It's okay. Let's be rich.
- Three...

1486
00:45:19,492 --> 00:45:22,502
(The youngest member keeps going despite his injury.)

1487
00:45:22,832 --> 00:45:25,002
- It's okay. Let's be rich.
- Three,

1488
00:45:25,062 --> 00:45:26,801
- two, - Let's be rich.

1489
00:45:26,802 --> 00:45:28,722
- one. Time's up.
- Gosh. He did such a bad job.

1490
00:45:28,972 --> 00:45:30,771
- Are you okay?
- Let me see.

1491
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:31,871
(Flopping down)

1492
00:45:31,872 --> 00:45:33,071
You might be bleeding.

1493
00:45:33,072 --> 00:45:35,171
- Can you check my forehead?
- There's a dent now.

1494
00:45:35,172 --> 00:45:36,211
(The youngest member hit his forehead really hard.)

1495
00:45:36,212 --> 00:45:37,652
- You should've been careful.
- Hey.

1496
00:45:38,112 --> 00:45:39,251
It hurts so much.

1497
00:45:39,252 --> 00:45:40,681
- There's a deep dent. Let me see.
- It must hurt.

1498
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:43,422
(But the result is not so good.)

1499
00:45:43,622 --> 00:45:44,781
It was funny though.

1500
00:45:44,782 --> 00:45:45,891
- Was it funny?
- Yes.

1501
00:45:45,892 --> 00:45:47,751
- Put something on your forehead.
- The bottled water...

1502
00:45:47,752 --> 00:45:49,592
- Ouch. It hurts. That's okay.
- I'm sorry.

1503
00:45:50,762 --> 00:45:52,791
The leader of Team Ho Joon Ho, Cho Sae Ho, will try.

1504
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,352
- Get about 60 or more, Sae Ho.
- Okay.

1505
00:45:54,432 --> 00:45:55,492
Ready.

1506
00:45:56,002 --> 00:45:58,701
- He's burying his face in it.
- Set. Go.

1507
00:45:58,702 --> 00:45:59,871
(Sae Ho, show us what you've got.)

1508
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:01,272
- That's good. Keep going.
- Start.

1509
00:46:02,202 --> 00:46:04,171
- That's really good.
- You're doing well.

1510
00:46:04,172 --> 00:46:06,711
- He's good at this.
- Amazing.

1511
00:46:06,712 --> 00:46:08,041
(Human thresher)

1512
00:46:08,042 --> 00:46:09,811
Gather the rice.

1513
00:46:09,812 --> 00:46:11,411
- You're doing great now.
- He's good at this.

1514
00:46:11,412 --> 00:46:12,951
You're doing well right now. Keep going.

1515
00:46:12,952 --> 00:46:14,552
Use your forehead too.

1516
00:46:14,682 --> 00:46:16,381
Gather... There you go. Good.

1517
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:18,658
- Sae Ho, you should...
- There's a lot of rice here. Okay.

1518
00:46:18,682 --> 00:46:20,321
That's good. Yes, keep going.

1519
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:21,891
- He's so good at this.
- You're doing well right now.

1520
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:24,192
(He's so good at this.)

1521
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:30,531
- You're doing well right now.
- He's so good at this.

1522
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:32,201
- Yes, you're doing an amazing job.
- He's doing so well.

1523
00:46:32,202 --> 00:46:33,601
- You have ten seconds left.
- You're doing an amazing job.

1524
00:46:33,602 --> 00:46:34,671
- Just a little bit more.
- Keep going.

1525
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:36,341
- Let's be rich. Let's go.
- Faster.

1526
00:46:36,342 --> 00:46:37,501
- Let's be rich.
- You're doing well.

1527
00:46:37,502 --> 00:46:38,901
Nice. I knew you could be rich.

1528
00:46:38,902 --> 00:46:41,211
- Three, two, - This is your last chance.

1529
00:46:41,212 --> 00:46:42,341
- one.
- That's good.

1530
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:43,412
- Time's up.
- Okay.

1531
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:45,911
(Hazy)

1532
00:46:45,912 --> 00:46:47,411
I don't think I got a lot. Oh, that's not bad.

1533
00:46:47,412 --> 00:46:49,321
- It's a lot.
- I'm sure it's more than 60 grains.

1534
00:46:49,322 --> 00:46:50,421
It's more than 60 grains.

1535
00:46:50,422 --> 00:46:51,651
- Did I do well?
- You did well.

1536
00:46:51,652 --> 00:46:52,751
(The oldest member of the team sacrificed himself.)

1537
00:46:52,752 --> 00:46:53,851
You did an amazing job, Sae Ho.

1538
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,151
I think you got more than 60 grains.

1539
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:56,512
- It's savory.
- It's good, right?

1540
00:46:56,922 --> 00:46:58,022
We got a lot.

1541
00:46:58,322 --> 00:46:59,562
We did well.

1542
00:47:00,032 --> 00:47:02,161
The results came out. Listen, everyone.

1543
00:47:02,162 --> 00:47:04,001
- Let's be rich.
- We'll be rich. Let's go.

1544
00:47:04,002 --> 00:47:05,261
How many grains did Joon get?

1545
00:47:05,262 --> 00:47:08,072
Let me announce the results. Joon got 71 grains.

1546
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:11,042
- What's gotten into him?
- I'm rich.

1547
00:47:11,242 --> 00:47:14,711
- What's with him? That's crazy.
- As for Sae Ho,

1548
00:47:14,712 --> 00:47:15,742
he got 72 grains.

1549
00:47:16,182 --> 00:47:18,611
- Great.
- Goodness. They're incredible.

1550
00:47:18,612 --> 00:47:20,352
I'm impressed. I love you.

1551
00:47:20,412 --> 00:47:21,982
And Seon Ho got...

1552
00:47:22,312 --> 00:47:23,582
thirty-three grains.

1553
00:47:23,722 --> 00:47:24,981
- It's okay.
- Okay.

1554
00:47:24,982 --> 00:47:27,491
- You gained 59 yeopjeons.
- It's okay.

1555
00:47:27,492 --> 00:47:28,622
- Okay.
- Okay. That's good.

1556
00:47:28,892 --> 00:47:30,922
- We got a lot, right?
- We did really well.

1557
00:47:31,422 --> 00:47:33,491
(A bunch of yeopjeons have been deposited in your account.)

1558
00:47:33,492 --> 00:47:34,631
- We're rich.
- You did well in the game.

1559
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:35,961
And you received rich energy, didn't you?

1560
00:47:35,962 --> 00:47:37,331
- Yes, we got a lot of it.
- Good. Then...

1561
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:38,901
let's go and meet the others.

1562
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:41,022
- Okay. Let's go.
- Mr. Lee Byung Chul says to smile.

1563
00:47:41,072 --> 00:47:42,231
A smile brings you luck.

1564
00:47:42,232 --> 00:47:44,472
(With a lot of good energy, let's go and have more fun.)

1565
00:47:44,872 --> 00:47:46,611
How many yeopjeons do we have now?

1566
00:47:46,612 --> 00:47:48,072
Did we gain 59 yeopjeons here?

1567
00:47:48,342 --> 00:47:49,641
- Then we have...
- We have 89 yeopjeons.

1568
00:47:49,642 --> 00:47:51,441
- Right.
- We're so rich.

1569
00:47:51,442 --> 00:47:53,981
But the other team probably got a lot of yeopjeons as well.

1570
00:47:53,982 --> 00:47:55,551
- No way.
- We did a really good job.

1571
00:47:55,552 --> 00:47:57,521
- We did really well back there.
- Did we?

1572
00:47:57,522 --> 00:47:59,321
I've been so lucky lately.

1573
00:47:59,322 --> 00:48:00,351
(Joon is on a roll.)

1574
00:48:00,352 --> 00:48:02,152
- That's good.
- I haven't been lucky lately.

1575
00:48:02,692 --> 00:48:03,891
You guys were right about that.

1576
00:48:03,892 --> 00:48:05,591
You said we shouldn't try too hard. I got hurt while trying too hard.

1577
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:07,131
- You tried to do well.
- Exactly.

1578
00:48:07,132 --> 00:48:08,361
You should try not to do well.

1579
00:48:08,362 --> 00:48:10,402
You should've shaken the rice off in a relaxed way.

1580
00:48:10,502 --> 00:48:12,062
You should practice games like this.

1581
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:14,701
You mean, I should buy some rice and play the game?

1582
00:48:14,702 --> 00:48:16,942
- Yes.
- About the next mission...

1583
00:48:17,302 --> 00:48:18,471
We're going to meet the other team.

1584
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:19,571
(Sae Ho tries to guess the next mission.)

1585
00:48:19,572 --> 00:48:20,988
- We'll meet them again.
- We'll play a game together.

1586
00:48:21,012 --> 00:48:23,058
Could it be about stealing something from each other?

1587
00:48:23,082 --> 00:48:24,812
No, it's too early to do such a game.

1588
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:25,982
You think?

1589
00:48:26,252 --> 00:48:28,681
Do you think the other team gained a lot of yeopjeons?

1590
00:48:28,682 --> 00:48:30,052
We played a hard game.

1591
00:48:30,622 --> 00:48:32,262
- We gained a lot of yeopjeons.
- Indeed.

1592
00:48:32,382 --> 00:48:33,391
Yes, we did.

1593
00:48:33,392 --> 00:48:35,092
By selling our belongings,

1594
00:48:35,452 --> 00:48:37,221
we gained more than 20.

1595
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:39,661
- Right.
- We got 59 yeopjeons back there.

1596
00:48:39,662 --> 00:48:41,431
I thought it would be easy, but those yeopjeons...

1597
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:42,861
were not real yeopjeons. They were too light.

1598
00:48:42,862 --> 00:48:45,143
- They're fake yeopjeons.
- They were too light to stack.

1599
00:48:45,362 --> 00:48:47,202
If they were heavy, we would've done better.

1600
00:48:47,902 --> 00:48:48,972
The road to wealth.

1601
00:48:49,102 --> 00:48:51,372
The theme of the whole town is wealth.

1602
00:48:52,642 --> 00:48:56,012
(It's noon when the sun is right above us.)

1603
00:48:58,742 --> 00:49:00,381
(The members meet again in team uniforms.)

1604
00:49:00,382 --> 00:49:01,812
What is this place? Is it a park?

1605
00:49:02,382 --> 00:49:03,952
This town is really pretty.

1606
00:49:04,282 --> 00:49:06,122
Every place in this town has a wide-open view.

1607
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,828
I wonder what kind of game we'll play here.

1608
00:49:07,852 --> 00:49:09,891
- Stay cheery just for another game.
- What game is it?

1609
00:49:09,892 --> 00:49:10,892
All right.

1610
00:49:10,893 --> 00:49:13,231
- Mr. Lee Byung Chul was born here.
- Yes.

1611
00:49:13,232 --> 00:49:15,132
- He was born in 1910.
- Stop it.

1612
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:16,861
- We all know that.
- We visited his birthplace.

1613
00:49:16,862 --> 00:49:18,182
- We visited the place.
- Really?

1614
00:49:18,362 --> 00:49:20,101
- What game did you play?
- Did you do well in your mission?

1615
00:49:20,102 --> 00:49:21,301
- No, we didn't.
- What game did you play?

1616
00:49:21,302 --> 00:49:23,101
- You tell us first.
- I hurt my forehead. Look.

1617
00:49:23,102 --> 00:49:24,948
- Why? Oh, gosh. What happened?
- What happened?

1618
00:49:24,972 --> 00:49:27,371
- While playing the game...
- We had to use our heads.

1619
00:49:27,372 --> 00:49:28,771
- We played such a game.
- What game was that?

1620
00:49:28,772 --> 00:49:30,681
- We had to move something with it.
- Using our head,

1621
00:49:30,682 --> 00:49:32,551
we had to crack walnuts.

1622
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,552
Your forehead is red too.

1623
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,751
We had to smash walnuts with our head...

1624
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:36,621
- Stop lying. Tell us the truth.
- What game did you play?

1625
00:49:36,622 --> 00:49:38,252
Us? We just walked.

1626
00:49:38,752 --> 00:49:40,552
- Really?
- We'll tell you honestly.

1627
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,451
We played this game.

1628
00:49:42,452 --> 00:49:43,732
(They can just tell each other.)

1629
00:49:43,922 --> 00:49:45,161
There was some rice.

1630
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:46,991
We stuck rice on our faces...

1631
00:49:46,992 --> 00:49:48,632
and moved it into a bowl in front of us.

1632
00:49:49,032 --> 00:49:50,201
As many grains of rice we got into the bowl...

1633
00:49:50,202 --> 00:49:51,661
- Then why did he hurt his forehead?
- I was...

1634
00:49:51,662 --> 00:49:53,271
- shaking off rice like this.
- While doing that,

1635
00:49:53,272 --> 00:49:54,901
- he hit his forehead on the bowl.
- On the bowl?

1636
00:49:54,902 --> 00:49:57,502
(He suffers an aftereffect of the headbutting.)

1637
00:49:57,702 --> 00:49:59,772
I think they moved yeopjeons using their forehead.

1638
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:01,611
- I just said we moved rice.
- We moved rice.

1639
00:50:01,612 --> 00:50:02,612
I don't believe you.

1640
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:03,612
(Dumbfounded)

1641
00:50:03,613 --> 00:50:04,711
Why would he not believe me?

1642
00:50:04,712 --> 00:50:06,351
Why would we lie about the game? It won't change anything.

1643
00:50:06,352 --> 00:50:07,352
They'll find out eventually.

1644
00:50:07,353 --> 00:50:08,951
- It's simply meaningless.
- Can you tell us...

1645
00:50:08,952 --> 00:50:10,592
how many yeopjeons the other team gained?

1646
00:50:10,652 --> 00:50:13,051
I'll tell you how many yeopjeons each team has now.

1647
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,852
- Okay.
- Team Kim Moon Cheol...

1648
00:50:15,322 --> 00:50:17,061
built towers with yeopjeons...

1649
00:50:17,062 --> 00:50:18,921
- on Se Yoon's belly.
- I see.

1650
00:50:18,922 --> 00:50:20,361
- We built towers with yeopjeons.
- As a result,

1651
00:50:20,362 --> 00:50:22,392
- they gained 59 yeopjeons.
- Gosh.

1652
00:50:23,202 --> 00:50:25,301
They don't seem surprised. They must have more than 100.

1653
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:28,002
Wait. Hang on. That means they gained the same amount...

1654
00:50:28,572 --> 00:50:29,871
- That's right.
- Oh, my.

1655
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:31,401
- We also...
- Team Ho Joon Ho...

1656
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:34,071
played a game where they had to move grains of rice.

1657
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,471
- They also gained 59 yeopjeons.
- We got 59 yeopjeons.

1658
00:50:35,472 --> 00:50:36,781
- We got 59 yeopjeons.
- The same as us.

1659
00:50:36,782 --> 00:50:38,011
- We got the same amount.
- Gosh. We failed...

1660
00:50:38,012 --> 00:50:39,252
That means we're winning.

1661
00:50:39,712 --> 00:50:41,072
We failed to turn the game around.

1662
00:50:41,412 --> 00:50:44,181
You'll play games we prepared...

1663
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:46,191
inspired by the quotes of rich people.

1664
00:50:46,192 --> 00:50:48,792
- Sounds great.
- It's Said The Rich Man.

1665
00:50:48,852 --> 00:50:50,661
- Said The Rich Man.
- Said The Rich Man.

1666
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:51,821
A rich man said...

1667
00:50:51,822 --> 00:50:54,861
A rich man said, "You must play fair to be a winner."

1668
00:50:54,862 --> 00:50:56,401
"If you're going to cheat and win,"

1669
00:50:56,402 --> 00:50:57,882
"you might as well be the runner-up."

1670
00:50:58,002 --> 00:51:00,701
He emphasized the importance of being straight and narrow.

1671
00:51:00,702 --> 00:51:01,702
- Who said that?
- Being straight and narrow?

1672
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:03,641
That doesn't suit our attitude.

1673
00:51:03,642 --> 00:51:06,311
So is it possible to be the runner-up...

1674
00:51:06,312 --> 00:51:07,671
if I cheat?

1675
00:51:07,672 --> 00:51:09,112
I wouldn't mind being the runner-up.

1676
00:51:09,342 --> 00:51:10,681
Being the runner-up would be the faster option.

1677
00:51:10,682 --> 00:51:12,911
The game you'll play is Walk the Straight and Narrow.

1678
00:51:12,912 --> 00:51:14,081
- Walk the Straight and Narrow.
- Walk the Straight and Narrow.

1679
00:51:14,082 --> 00:51:16,151
- So we should play fair?
- Do you see the line in the middle?

1680
00:51:16,152 --> 00:51:17,382
- Yes, the yellow line.
- Yes.

1681
00:51:17,652 --> 00:51:21,152
You have 30 seconds to complete the mission. In 30 seconds,

1682
00:51:21,222 --> 00:51:24,592
do 15 elephant nose spins at the start line,

1683
00:51:25,192 --> 00:51:28,061
walk straight following that yellow line,

1684
00:51:28,062 --> 00:51:29,761
and get to the finish line.

1685
00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:30,861
- Okay.
- Got it.

1686
00:51:30,862 --> 00:51:33,601
If you succeed, we'll give you ten yeopjeons.

1687
00:51:33,602 --> 00:51:34,731
Okay.

1688
00:51:34,732 --> 00:51:37,142
But if there are footprints that are out of the line,

1689
00:51:37,572 --> 00:51:40,012
we'll deduct yeopjeons according to the number of footprints.

1690
00:51:40,372 --> 00:51:41,811
(The order of the players for Walk the Straight and Narrow)

1691
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:44,312
(Team Ho Joon Ho, Team Kim Moon Cheol)

1692
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:46,912
All right, everyone. We'll begin now.

1693
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:49,722
- Seon Ho, ready.
- Let's go!

1694
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,321
Set. Go.

1695
00:51:52,322 --> 00:51:53,351
You're running out of time.

1696
00:51:53,352 --> 00:51:57,391
- One, two...
- Two, three, four, five...

1697
00:51:57,392 --> 00:51:59,731
He must be dizzy. He's already feeling dizzy.

1698
00:51:59,732 --> 00:52:01,191
- I don't think I can do this.
- Eleven,

1699
00:52:01,192 --> 00:52:03,001
twelve, thirteen,

1700
00:52:03,002 --> 00:52:04,332
fourteen, fifteen.

1701
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:05,661
- Go! Start walking.
- You don't have time to waste.

1702
00:52:05,662 --> 00:52:06,671
- Go backward.
- Let's go!

1703
00:52:06,672 --> 00:52:08,432
- You're running out of time.
- Where is it?

1704
00:52:08,702 --> 00:52:10,601
- Ten, nine, - It's over.

1705
00:52:10,602 --> 00:52:12,471
- eight, seven, - Run.

1706
00:52:12,472 --> 00:52:14,141
- six, five, - Run!

1707
00:52:14,142 --> 00:52:15,871
- four, three...
- Oh, my.

1708
00:52:15,872 --> 00:52:17,081
- Run!
- Five...

1709
00:52:17,082 --> 00:52:19,011
(He runs quickly and gets to the finish line.)

1710
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:20,492
- Okay.
- He crossed the finish line.

1711
00:52:21,682 --> 00:52:22,982
My gosh. I'm feeling so dizzy.

1712
00:52:23,522 --> 00:52:25,922
(His dizziness doubled because of the hot weather.)

1713
00:52:26,322 --> 00:52:28,321
(Good job.)

1714
00:52:28,322 --> 00:52:30,021
- What?
- He did well.

1715
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,061
All of his footprints are on the line.

1716
00:52:31,062 --> 00:52:33,091
- Doesn't it count?
- Check the result while tidying up.

1717
00:52:33,092 --> 00:52:34,832
I'll be honest. There's one here.

1718
00:52:35,192 --> 00:52:37,552
It's okay if the footprint is partially on the line, right?

1719
00:52:45,202 --> 00:52:46,211
(There are 2 footprints that are away from the line.)

1720
00:52:46,212 --> 00:52:48,671
- There are 2 of them.
- There are 2 wrong footprints.

1721
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:50,541
As a result, he gained eight yeopjeons.

1722
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,742
Okay. Joon, you've got this.

1723
00:52:52,012 --> 00:52:53,351
Don't worry. It won't be that hard.

1724
00:52:53,352 --> 00:52:54,658
(The second player from Team Ho Joon Ho is Joon.)

1725
00:52:54,682 --> 00:52:55,812
Ready.

1726
00:52:56,682 --> 00:52:58,882
- Set. Go.
- Joon!

1727
00:52:59,222 --> 00:53:00,821
- He's spinning so slowly.
- One.

1728
00:53:00,822 --> 00:53:02,152
- It's over.
- Two.

1729
00:53:02,322 --> 00:53:03,961
- Three. You should spin faster.
- Three.

1730
00:53:03,962 --> 00:53:06,061
- Four, five, - Four, five,

1731
00:53:06,062 --> 00:53:07,761
- six, seven...
- six, seven,

1732
00:53:07,762 --> 00:53:10,261
- He majored in dance.
- eight, nine,

1733
00:53:10,262 --> 00:53:11,582
- Joon majored in dance.
- ten...

1734
00:53:11,932 --> 00:53:13,402
He's getting faster now.

1735
00:53:13,872 --> 00:53:15,131
Since he majored in dance, he must be good at this.

1736
00:53:15,132 --> 00:53:16,278
(Since he majored dance, he must have a good sense of balance.)

1737
00:53:16,302 --> 00:53:17,541
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen.

1738
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:18,742
- Okay. Go!
- Fifteen.

1739
00:53:19,202 --> 00:53:22,371
(Joon will start walking.)

1740
00:53:22,372 --> 00:53:24,212
Okay. That's good.

1741
00:53:26,782 --> 00:53:27,782
Okay. That's good.

1742
00:53:27,783 --> 00:53:29,282
(Falling down)

1743
00:53:29,752 --> 00:53:32,252
(It's not going well for him unlike his enthusiasm.)

1744
00:53:32,822 --> 00:53:34,752
(Dumbfounded)

1745
00:53:34,952 --> 00:53:37,922
- Five, four, three...
- Three.

1746
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:40,792
He got there.

1747
00:53:40,793 --> 00:53:41,961
(He still got there in time.)

1748
00:53:41,962 --> 00:53:43,101
You did a good job.

1749
00:53:43,102 --> 00:53:44,132
Joon, that was funny.

1750
00:53:45,562 --> 00:53:46,731
I thought he majored in dance.

1751
00:53:46,732 --> 00:53:48,101
(They can't believe he majored in dance.)

1752
00:53:48,102 --> 00:53:49,172
All right.

1753
00:53:49,232 --> 00:53:50,241
This isn't a joke.

1754
00:53:50,242 --> 00:53:51,242
(What's the result for Joon who majored in dance?)

1755
00:53:51,243 --> 00:53:53,003
(It looks like he majored in entertainment.)

1756
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,782
What are you doing? You said you majored in dance.

1757
00:54:06,922 --> 00:54:09,291
- You said you could turn 20 times.
- I didn't step outside.

1758
00:54:09,292 --> 00:54:10,721
(In denial)

1759
00:54:10,722 --> 00:54:13,992
What? I don't think I ran like that.

1760
00:54:15,462 --> 00:54:16,702
He's acting like he's innocent.

1761
00:54:16,902 --> 00:54:18,222
You're pretending to be innocent.

1762
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:20,502
I thought I was running straight.

1763
00:54:20,602 --> 00:54:21,732
Except for the beginning.

1764
00:54:21,832 --> 00:54:23,272
Sae Ho, show us what you've got.

1765
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:26,342
(All they have is Sae Ho now.)

1766
00:54:27,442 --> 00:54:29,782
(To Sae Ho, elephant nose turning means...)

1767
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:32,342
(I can assure you that I'm good at it.)

1768
00:54:32,952 --> 00:54:35,012
(Sae Ho's strength)

1769
00:54:35,382 --> 00:54:37,582
(Sae Ho's specialty)

1770
00:54:39,252 --> 00:54:40,851
Sae Ho, protect the jungle...

1771
00:54:40,852 --> 00:54:41,921
(Here comes the best elephant nose spinner.)

1772
00:54:41,922 --> 00:54:43,092
Ready.

1773
00:54:43,192 --> 00:54:44,422
Sae Ho, you'll throw up.

1774
00:54:44,892 --> 00:54:46,232
- Set.
- Sae Ho!

1775
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:48,231
- Let's go.
- You have to do well here.

1776
00:54:48,232 --> 00:54:49,461
You have to do well now. One...

1777
00:54:49,462 --> 00:54:51,178
- He's not doing it properly.
- Two, three, four...

1778
00:54:51,202 --> 00:54:52,802
His hand looks like an elephant's trunk.

1779
00:54:54,032 --> 00:54:55,471
Right, it looks like a trunk.

1780
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:56,748
It looks like an elephant's trunk.

1781
00:54:56,772 --> 00:54:58,641
- That's the last one. Let's go.
- You got it.

1782
00:54:58,642 --> 00:55:01,412
(Sae Ho is on his way.)

1783
00:55:02,042 --> 00:55:04,181
Nine, eight,

1784
00:55:04,182 --> 00:55:05,911
- seven, six, - Goodness.

1785
00:55:05,912 --> 00:55:07,552
- My goodness.
- five...

1786
00:55:08,552 --> 00:55:11,321
(Was Sae Ho in his element?)

1787
00:55:11,322 --> 00:55:13,292
Ten, nine,

1788
00:55:13,452 --> 00:55:15,592
- eight, seven, - Where is he going?

1789
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:17,321
- Oh, my.
- six, five...

1790
00:55:17,322 --> 00:55:18,422
(What is that?)

1791
00:55:18,492 --> 00:55:20,291
Ten, nine,

1792
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:21,332
(Stumbling)

1793
00:55:21,662 --> 00:55:22,761
- Where is he going?
- Goodness.

1794
00:55:22,762 --> 00:55:25,232
(He lost his title as the best player.)

1795
00:55:26,602 --> 00:55:29,171
(Am I this horrible at this?)

1796
00:55:29,172 --> 00:55:31,201
- What was that?
- He was heading...

1797
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,601
- He went right.
- That was completely right.

1798
00:55:32,602 --> 00:55:34,371
He said he was the ace, so he wanted to go last.

1799
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,741
What was that?

1800
00:55:35,742 --> 00:55:37,941
- What is this?
- What just happened?

1801
00:55:37,942 --> 00:55:39,111
(What is the record of the former best player?)

1802
00:55:39,112 --> 00:55:40,412
I'm usually good at this.

1803
00:55:51,522 --> 00:55:53,461
(A total of 7 footsteps were outside.)

1804
00:55:53,462 --> 00:55:55,792
Sae Ho earned three yeopjeons.

1805
00:55:57,232 --> 00:55:58,732
That used to be my strength.

1806
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:01,848
- What are you doing? Come on.
- It's because it's too hot.

1807
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:03,371
- It's too hot.
- Right, it's hot.

1808
00:56:03,372 --> 00:56:05,402
I couldn't help but stagger.

1809
00:56:05,702 --> 00:56:08,672
Team Kim Moon Cheol, come on in.

1810
00:56:10,112 --> 00:56:11,882
- Ho Joon Ho.
- Go away.

1811
00:56:13,152 --> 00:56:15,282
Hurry up now. We need to play the game.

1812
00:56:16,152 --> 00:56:18,051
Gosh, these guys are harsh today.

1813
00:56:18,052 --> 00:56:19,891
- You are so harsh.
- It's hot, hurry up.

1814
00:56:19,892 --> 00:56:20,922
They are screaming at me.

1815
00:56:21,422 --> 00:56:22,791
We'll play now.

1816
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:23,991
(The first player is Se Yoon.)

1817
00:56:23,992 --> 00:56:25,121
- Which side should I go first?
- Ready.

1818
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:26,191
It doesn't matter.

1819
00:56:26,192 --> 00:56:28,362
Set. Go.

1820
00:56:28,892 --> 00:56:30,301
- He's fast.
- That's pretty fast.

1821
00:56:30,302 --> 00:56:31,701
- Three, four, - You can go easy.

1822
00:56:31,702 --> 00:56:33,431
- Se Yoon, slow down.
- five. That's very fast.

1823
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:34,601
Six...

1824
00:56:34,602 --> 00:56:35,902
Do you usually spin like this?

1825
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:38,401
Four, five...

1826
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:40,571
- Go!
- You can go now.

1827
00:56:40,572 --> 00:56:41,641
Just go!

1828
00:56:41,642 --> 00:56:43,082
(I'm on my way.)

1829
00:56:44,742 --> 00:56:47,651
(What is that?)

1830
00:56:47,652 --> 00:56:48,782
Just go!

1831
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:53,321
(Off course)

1832
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:55,652
- Goodness.
- Eight, seven,

1833
00:56:55,952 --> 00:56:58,521
six, five, four...

1834
00:56:58,522 --> 00:56:59,842
(He's way too far from the line.)

1835
00:57:01,692 --> 00:57:03,802
(Feeling dizzy)

1836
00:57:04,062 --> 00:57:05,232
(Laughing)

1837
00:57:06,432 --> 00:57:07,702
Why did you even spin?

1838
00:57:08,132 --> 00:57:10,178
Why did you even spin if you weren't going to play well?

1839
00:57:10,202 --> 00:57:12,041
You shouldn't have spun if this was all you had...

1840
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:13,071
(He only got the 1st 2 steps right.)

1841
00:57:13,072 --> 00:57:15,142
- These are all out. One, two...
- That's eight.

1842
00:57:15,242 --> 00:57:17,441
That's 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

1843
00:57:17,442 --> 00:57:19,681
- nine, ten, eleven.
- No, that's eight.

1844
00:57:19,682 --> 00:57:21,681
- You can come and count.
- What do you mean?

1845
00:57:21,682 --> 00:57:23,451
- One.
- That's one.

1846
00:57:23,452 --> 00:57:26,182
- Two, three, four, five...
- I'm so sorry.

1847
00:57:26,422 --> 00:57:27,492
Darn it.

1848
00:57:27,592 --> 00:57:28,592
Just give me one.

1849
00:57:29,252 --> 00:57:30,261
Give me one.

1850
00:57:30,262 --> 00:57:32,222
My mother-in-law is watching. Please give me one.

1851
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:35,661
- This is embarrassing.
- Se Yoon got zero yeopjeons.

1852
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:37,602
I couldn't stop once I started.

1853
00:57:39,802 --> 00:57:42,202
(The second player is DinDin.)

1854
00:57:42,832 --> 00:57:44,871
(It feels like he will play well.)

1855
00:57:44,872 --> 00:57:46,271
- With ten seconds...
- Okay.

1856
00:57:46,272 --> 00:57:47,352
- Ready.
- In five seconds.

1857
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,142
- Let's go.
- Set. Go.

1858
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:53,251
- One, two. Just a bit more.
- One, two,

1859
00:57:53,252 --> 00:57:55,011
- Three, four, - three, four,

1860
00:57:55,012 --> 00:57:56,111
- five...
- five...

1861
00:57:56,112 --> 00:57:57,251
- Twelve.
- Twelve. Go slowly.

1862
00:57:57,252 --> 00:57:58,421
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen. Last one...

1863
00:57:58,422 --> 00:57:59,581
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen. One more to go.

1864
00:57:59,582 --> 00:58:00,751
That's 15. You got it.

1865
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:02,691
(Can he make it up for Se Yoon who scored 0?)

1866
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:03,961
- You can go now!
- Go! What are you doing?

1867
00:58:03,962 --> 00:58:04,962
- Hurry up.
- Five,

1868
00:58:04,963 --> 00:58:07,192
- Run.
- four, three...

1869
00:58:07,992 --> 00:58:10,562
(It looks like he walked straight.)

1870
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:13,508
- What is he doing?
- I did well.

1871
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:14,732
What do you mean?

1872
00:58:23,312 --> 00:58:26,112
DinDin, you got two yeopjeons.

1873
00:58:28,382 --> 00:58:29,411
What?

1874
00:58:29,412 --> 00:58:30,581
(Disappointment...)

1875
00:58:30,582 --> 00:58:32,051
- That was hard.
- What was that?

1876
00:58:32,052 --> 00:58:33,221
(and blame)

1877
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:34,451
You aren't good at this.

1878
00:58:34,452 --> 00:58:36,021
- You did well.
- You should know.

1879
00:58:36,022 --> 00:58:37,391
You aren't good at this. Do you understand?

1880
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:38,392
(One more game that DinDin isn't good at)

1881
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:41,062
You have to know that you aren't good at this kind of game.

1882
00:58:41,592 --> 00:58:42,792
This is difficult.

1883
00:58:44,202 --> 00:58:46,472
(There is one man who is warming up.)

1884
00:58:47,872 --> 00:58:50,172
(He's the best player of the elephant nose spin.)

1885
00:58:50,442 --> 00:58:51,541
One, two...

1886
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:53,471
(Amazing spinning speed)

1887
00:58:53,472 --> 00:58:54,842
He's spinning even more now...

1888
00:58:55,272 --> 00:58:57,182
(He can even do a double spin.)

1889
00:58:59,112 --> 00:59:02,151
- Let's start now.
- The line isn't straight...

1890
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:03,152
All right.

1891
00:59:03,153 --> 00:59:04,273
You aren't going to do well!

1892
00:59:05,282 --> 00:59:06,921
What? I'm not going to do well?

1893
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:08,091
(You've got to be kidding me.)

1894
00:59:08,092 --> 00:59:09,892
- Set.
- You should control it.

1895
00:59:10,462 --> 00:59:11,591
Go.

1896
00:59:11,592 --> 00:59:12,303
- One, two...
- One, two...

1897
00:59:12,405 --> 00:59:14,100
- Set.
- You should control it.

1898
00:59:14,307 --> 00:59:15,407
Go.

1899
00:59:15,517 --> 00:59:17,116
- One, two, - One, two,

1900
00:59:17,117 --> 00:59:18,616
- three, four, - three, four,

1901
00:59:18,617 --> 00:59:20,447
five, six... Goodness, that's seven.

1902
00:59:21,287 --> 00:59:24,556
(He surely is a good player.)

1903
00:59:24,557 --> 00:59:26,187
One, two...

1904
00:59:26,227 --> 00:59:28,286
- Can you go without your shoe?
- Your shoe! Four,

1905
00:59:28,287 --> 00:59:30,026
five. You're done. You can go now.

1906
00:59:30,027 --> 00:59:31,826
- Just go.
- Go now!

1907
00:59:31,827 --> 00:59:32,827
(Jong Min is on his way.)

1908
00:59:35,427 --> 00:59:38,597
(Precise footsteps)

1909
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:42,637
(What will be the result of Jong Min's play?)

1910
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:46,407
Gosh, what was that?

1911
00:59:48,747 --> 00:59:50,616
(He is off course.)

1912
00:59:50,617 --> 00:59:51,647
Gosh, what was that?

1913
00:59:52,077 --> 00:59:53,987
(He missed the finish line.)

1914
00:59:54,847 --> 00:59:55,856
What was that?

1915
00:59:55,857 --> 00:59:57,317
(Jong Min is disqualified.)

1916
00:59:57,857 --> 00:59:59,926
(What a twist.)

1917
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:02,556
Jong Min, you earned zero yeopjeons.

1918
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,697
What was that?

1919
01:00:05,027 --> 01:00:06,673
- Gosh, this is frustrating.
- He didn't finish.

1920
01:00:06,697 --> 01:00:07,967
He couldn't finish.

1921
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:09,637
What is this?

1922
01:00:09,837 --> 01:00:12,066
(We won.)

1923
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,766
I'm leading the game when I have only two yeopjeons?

1924
01:00:13,767 --> 01:00:14,866
(He's in 1st place when he has only 2 yeopjeons.)

1925
01:00:14,867 --> 01:00:16,547
- I mean...
- What's wrong with this team?

1926
01:00:17,237 --> 01:00:19,006
You had to pass the finish line.

1927
01:00:19,007 --> 01:00:21,076
- That just made a huge difference.
- All right.

1928
01:00:21,077 --> 01:00:22,316
- That was funny.
- What?

1929
01:00:22,317 --> 01:00:24,676
All right. Here's the result of the game.

1930
01:00:24,677 --> 01:00:25,686
(Announcing the result of the game)

1931
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:29,056
DinDin earned 2. Se Yoon and Jong Min earned 0.

1932
01:00:29,057 --> 01:00:30,297
So this team got two yeopjeons.

1933
01:00:30,587 --> 01:00:31,717
Team Ho Joon Ho.

1934
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:34,256
Seon Ho earned 8, and Joon earned 4 yeopjeons.

1935
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:35,933
- Sae Ho has three.
- Hey, I'm leading. I did well.

1936
01:00:35,957 --> 01:00:38,357
- You have 15 yeopjeons.
- Okay!

1937
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:39,996
- Team Ho Joon Ho.
- Ho Joon Ho.

1938
01:00:39,997 --> 01:00:41,397
- We did well.
- We are...

1939
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:43,066
- Ho...
- Joon Ho.

1940
01:00:43,067 --> 01:00:45,166
(Team Ho Joon Ho is leading.)

1941
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:46,167
(The number of yeopjeons per team)

1942
01:00:46,168 --> 01:00:48,937
(Team Kim Moon Cheol: 87, Team Ho Joon Ho: 104)

1943
01:00:49,077 --> 01:00:51,036
You know what?

1944
01:00:51,037 --> 01:00:52,946
You still have a chance to win.

1945
01:00:52,947 --> 01:00:54,046
- Of course.
- Sure.

1946
01:00:54,047 --> 01:00:55,646
Nobody is disappointed here.

1947
01:00:55,647 --> 01:00:56,893
- We are going to win...
- Sure.

1948
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:57,976
This isn't the end.

1949
01:00:57,977 --> 01:00:59,816
- Said The Rich Man.
- Said The Rich Man.

1950
01:00:59,817 --> 01:01:02,257
Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, said,

1951
01:01:02,787 --> 01:01:05,286
"Forget the formula and go with the flow."

1952
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:06,486
This is what he said.

1953
01:01:06,487 --> 01:01:08,926
So this is how we prepared for the third game.

1954
01:01:08,927 --> 01:01:10,196
Go With The Flow.

1955
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:11,356
- Go With The Flow.
- Goodness.

1956
01:01:11,357 --> 01:01:12,467
This is Jong Min's game.

1957
01:01:12,497 --> 01:01:14,377
- With your instinct.
- Please set up the game.

1958
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:15,767
Set it up!

1959
01:01:16,767 --> 01:01:18,866
You are going to wear goggles that are opaque.

1960
01:01:18,867 --> 01:01:21,567
And you spray the water gun with ink in it on the other person.

1961
01:01:22,107 --> 01:01:24,536
You decide who can play first by playing rock-paper-scissors.

1962
01:01:24,537 --> 01:01:27,106
You have ten seconds each.

1963
01:01:27,107 --> 01:01:28,917
You can pick which seat you want.

1964
01:01:29,177 --> 01:01:31,946
You have to play the game until the other player gets the ink.

1965
01:01:31,947 --> 01:01:33,816
You can also change the guns.

1966
01:01:33,817 --> 01:01:36,656
You can get ten yeopjeons...

1967
01:01:36,657 --> 01:01:38,756
if you win the 1-on-1 match.

1968
01:01:38,757 --> 01:01:40,157
This can turn the tables around.

1969
01:01:40,227 --> 01:01:41,956
Okay, I'll go first. Bring it on.

1970
01:01:41,957 --> 01:01:43,327
(Bring it on, everyone.)

1971
01:01:44,457 --> 01:01:46,896
(Joon versus DinDin)

1972
01:01:46,897 --> 01:01:47,897
- Okay.
- Great.

1973
01:01:47,898 --> 01:01:48,936
- Are you ready?
- You should shake hands.

1974
01:01:48,937 --> 01:01:50,736
So you know where your hands are. Shake your hands.

1975
01:01:50,737 --> 01:01:52,636
All right. This is the first round.

1976
01:01:52,637 --> 01:01:55,067
(Shaking hands)

1977
01:01:55,267 --> 01:01:57,237
This is cuttlefish ink. So it's actually edible.

1978
01:01:58,077 --> 01:02:00,477
Rock-paper-scissors.

1979
01:02:02,107 --> 01:02:03,316
(Joon gets to shoot first.)

1980
01:02:03,317 --> 01:02:05,516
- Joon, you can shoot first.
- Joon.

1981
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:07,016
- You have 10 seconds.
- You have 10 seconds.

1982
01:02:07,017 --> 01:02:09,217
- Ten, nine...
- Where are you shooting?

1983
01:02:09,487 --> 01:02:11,356
- Right or left?
- Left?

1984
01:02:11,357 --> 01:02:12,556
Where is the handle?

1985
01:02:12,557 --> 01:02:13,826
- You are grabbing it upside down.
- The other side.

1986
01:02:13,827 --> 01:02:15,027
Five,

1987
01:02:15,057 --> 01:02:16,057
four,

1988
01:02:16,058 --> 01:02:17,258
- It's upside down.
- three...

1989
01:02:17,627 --> 01:02:19,567
Joon, you can't sit in the middle.

1990
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:21,787
- You have to pick one side now.
- Make up your mind.

1991
01:02:23,537 --> 01:02:25,597
- Have you decided?
- All right.

1992
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:27,047
- Are you done?
- You done?

1993
01:02:27,267 --> 01:02:30,707
(What does their grin mean?)

1994
01:02:31,507 --> 01:02:34,207
(On which side did DinDin sit?)

1995
01:02:34,677 --> 01:02:35,677
Shoot.

1996
01:02:35,678 --> 01:02:37,917
(He shoots the ink.)

1997
01:02:38,147 --> 01:02:39,517
- Shoot it.
- Just shoot it.

1998
01:02:40,447 --> 01:02:42,387
- Good!
- Aim lower.

1999
01:02:44,017 --> 01:02:46,256
(The top of DinDin's head is right in front of it.)

2000
01:02:46,257 --> 01:02:47,426
Nice. That's not bad.

2001
01:02:47,427 --> 01:02:48,526
(You're doing well.)

2002
01:02:48,527 --> 01:02:50,027
Lower. Nice.

2003
01:02:50,227 --> 01:02:51,397
Nice. That's not bad.

2004
01:02:52,497 --> 01:02:54,727
- There's no one.
- There's no one.

2005
01:02:58,267 --> 01:02:59,307
There's no one.

2006
01:02:59,707 --> 01:03:01,107
- There's no one.
- Lee Joon...

2007
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:02,436
succeeds!

2008
01:03:02,437 --> 01:03:03,937
(Lee Joon succeeds!)

2009
01:03:06,007 --> 01:03:07,077
Lee Joon...

2010
01:03:07,607 --> 01:03:09,747
- Look.
- Hooray, Lee Joon.

2011
01:03:10,477 --> 01:03:11,776
(A clash of joy and grief)

2012
01:03:11,777 --> 01:03:13,116
"Let's get it?"

2013
01:03:13,117 --> 01:03:15,286
- "Let's get it?"
- "Let's get it," my foot.

2014
01:03:15,287 --> 01:03:16,717
"I'll go first. Move?"

2015
01:03:16,817 --> 01:03:18,217
- We have a good spirit.
- Right.

2016
01:03:19,557 --> 01:03:23,456
(They're feeling great.)

2017
01:03:23,457 --> 01:03:25,497
Do you know what feels really bad?

2018
01:03:25,997 --> 01:03:28,167
The ink is warm.

2019
01:03:28,967 --> 01:03:31,166
- It feels like being hit with pee.
- You have to endure it.

2020
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:33,167
- It felt really bad.
- It felt like pee?

2021
01:03:33,737 --> 01:03:35,807
- It feels really bad.
- Really?

2022
01:03:36,407 --> 01:03:38,737
Who is the second player?

2023
01:03:38,977 --> 01:03:40,347
It's Sae Ho from Team Ho Joon Ho.

2024
01:03:41,547 --> 01:03:44,147
I'm Moon from Team Kim Moon Cheol. I came to take the loser down.

2025
01:03:44,277 --> 01:03:46,946
- We'll decide who goes first.
- Okay.

2026
01:03:46,947 --> 01:03:49,087
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Scissors!

2027
01:03:50,657 --> 01:03:51,687
Okay!

2028
01:03:52,657 --> 01:03:54,756
Cho Sae Ho will attack. You have ten seconds.

2029
01:03:54,757 --> 01:03:56,656
- Ten, nine, - Move.

2030
01:03:56,657 --> 01:03:58,697
- eight...
- Move, Se Yoon.

2031
01:03:59,797 --> 01:04:02,226
(Sae Ho makes noises to confuse him.)

2032
01:04:02,227 --> 01:04:03,536
No. It's better for you to listen to the noise.

2033
01:04:03,537 --> 01:04:04,836
Move, Se Yoon.

2034
01:04:04,837 --> 01:04:06,607
Five, four,

2035
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:10,837
three, two, one.

2036
01:04:11,137 --> 01:04:12,207
Decide.

2037
01:04:13,177 --> 01:04:15,777
(He sat down.)

2038
01:04:16,317 --> 01:04:18,416
(We're doomed.)

2039
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:19,716
- Cho Sae Ho!
- One, two, three.

2040
01:04:19,717 --> 01:04:22,117
- Shoot!
- No!

2041
01:04:23,017 --> 01:04:24,256
Keep shooting.

2042
01:04:24,257 --> 01:04:26,257
- All right.
- Lower the gun.

2043
01:04:26,827 --> 01:04:28,256
A bit higher.

2044
01:04:28,257 --> 01:04:29,756
- Cho Sae Ho...
- Higher.

2045
01:04:29,757 --> 01:04:30,896
- failed!
- What?

2046
01:04:30,897 --> 01:04:32,257
(Sae Ho failed.)

2047
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:34,587
- Moon Se Yoon will attack.
- It's my turn to attack?

2048
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:36,137
I'll count to ten.

2049
01:04:36,297 --> 01:04:38,267
Ten, nine,

2050
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:39,667
eight...

2051
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:41,667
(Se Yoon was reading Sae Ho's movement.)

2052
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:44,937
(He moves seats.)

2053
01:04:45,437 --> 01:04:46,507
Five.

2054
01:04:46,947 --> 01:04:49,446
(They have good teamwork. Seon Ho joins to make noise.)

2055
01:04:49,447 --> 01:04:51,916
Two, one, decide!

2056
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:54,387
(Will he be able to succeed this time?)

2057
01:04:55,087 --> 01:04:58,087
(Please.)

2058
01:04:58,617 --> 01:05:00,326
Moon Se Yoon, shoot!

2059
01:05:00,327 --> 01:05:01,527
(He shoots the ink.)

2060
01:05:02,327 --> 01:05:04,027
(Laughing)

2061
01:05:05,297 --> 01:05:07,867
(A direct hit)

2062
01:05:09,837 --> 01:05:11,497
You have to smile.

2063
01:05:11,737 --> 01:05:13,936
Moon Se Yoon, success!

2064
01:05:13,937 --> 01:05:16,437
(Se Yoon succeeds.)

2065
01:05:17,237 --> 01:05:18,307
I'm sorry.

2066
01:05:18,807 --> 01:05:20,706
I'm sorry, Sae Ho.

2067
01:05:20,707 --> 01:05:22,107
- But...
- Sae Ho.

2068
01:05:22,277 --> 01:05:24,377
- I get what DinDin said.
- You get it, right?

2069
01:05:24,477 --> 01:05:25,777
It feels awful.

2070
01:05:26,147 --> 01:05:27,417
- I'm sorry.
- It feels awful.

2071
01:05:27,547 --> 01:05:29,716
- I did my part.
- Well done.

2072
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,216
- You moved there in the end.
- Right. I know.

2073
01:05:31,217 --> 01:05:32,456
- Team Kim Moon Cheol.
- Yes.

2074
01:05:32,457 --> 01:05:33,687
You earned ten yeopjeons.

2075
01:05:34,327 --> 01:05:35,686
We hit after getting hit.

2076
01:05:35,687 --> 01:05:37,726
- You made up for earlier.
- Well done.

2077
01:05:37,727 --> 01:05:38,796
- Let's go.
- I should do it.

2078
01:05:38,797 --> 01:05:40,596
You can't lose with that energy.

2079
01:05:40,597 --> 01:05:41,627
Okay.

2080
01:05:42,027 --> 01:05:45,066
(Seon Ho versus Jong Min, the youngest and the oldest)

2081
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:47,667
You have to hit the head. That feels the worst.

2082
01:05:47,837 --> 01:05:49,067
It keeps flowing.

2083
01:05:49,137 --> 01:05:50,637
Since this is the ending,

2084
01:05:50,677 --> 01:05:52,006
let's shower each other.

2085
01:05:52,007 --> 01:05:53,047
- Okay.
- Okay.

2086
01:05:53,677 --> 01:05:55,407
We'll decide who goes first.

2087
01:05:55,607 --> 01:05:57,516
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I'll play rock.

2088
01:05:57,517 --> 01:05:58,517
You've already won.

2089
01:05:59,717 --> 01:06:01,987
- I'll play scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2090
01:06:02,147 --> 01:06:03,457
- Okay.
- He's lying.

2091
01:06:04,287 --> 01:06:06,026
(He habitually lies.)

2092
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:08,086
- Yoo Seon Ho...
- Go.

2093
01:06:08,087 --> 01:06:09,426
- will attack first.
- Let's go.

2094
01:06:09,427 --> 01:06:11,396
- Ten, nine, - Let's go.

2095
01:06:11,397 --> 01:06:12,926
- Nice.
- eight,

2096
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,727
- Don't move. That place is good.
- seven,

2097
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:16,766
(Seon Ho reacts immediately when Jong Min moves.)

2098
01:06:16,767 --> 01:06:18,867
- Stay calm, Seon Ho.
- six, five,

2099
01:06:18,997 --> 01:06:20,166
- This is done.
- four,

2100
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:21,606
- You can't hear anything.
- three,

2101
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:24,037
- I can't hear him.
- two, one.

2102
01:06:24,537 --> 01:06:25,576
Decide!

2103
01:06:25,577 --> 01:06:27,106
(I'll trust my instincts!)

2104
01:06:27,107 --> 01:06:28,677
You really can't hear anything.

2105
01:06:28,747 --> 01:06:29,747
(He made his decision.)

2106
01:06:29,748 --> 01:06:30,847
Okay!

2107
01:06:31,577 --> 01:06:34,546
(On which side did Seon Ho sit?)

2108
01:06:34,547 --> 01:06:37,657
Yoo Seon Ho, shoot!

2109
01:06:38,657 --> 01:06:42,327
(He gets showered with ink right away.)

2110
01:06:43,257 --> 01:06:44,956
(Seon Ho sat in front of Jong Min.)

2111
01:06:44,957 --> 01:06:46,166
Is it working?

2112
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:47,496
Amazing. It's amazing, Jong Min.

2113
01:06:47,497 --> 01:06:49,026
Why is it so big?

2114
01:06:49,027 --> 01:06:50,266
(It's working very well.)

2115
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:53,006
- Yoo Seon Ho, success!
- You said it's cuttlefish ink!

2116
01:06:53,007 --> 01:06:55,467
(Seon Ho succeeds.)

2117
01:06:56,107 --> 01:06:59,007
(Is this okay?)

2118
01:06:59,077 --> 01:07:00,846
- Team Ho Joon Ho.
- I don't go?

2119
01:07:00,847 --> 01:07:02,576
- You don't need to.
- Can't I do it as well?

2120
01:07:02,577 --> 01:07:04,047
No.

2121
01:07:04,677 --> 01:07:07,147
- It's flowing like mucus.
- He's the eldest. Let him play.

2122
01:07:08,547 --> 01:07:10,216
He's the eldest. Let him play.

2123
01:07:10,217 --> 01:07:12,986
(An ink party begins.)

2124
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,057
Hey.

2125
01:07:14,427 --> 01:07:15,427
Hey.

2126
01:07:15,428 --> 01:07:17,456
(I can't be the only one getting hit.)

2127
01:07:17,457 --> 01:07:19,627
- This is funny.
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?

2128
01:07:20,127 --> 01:07:23,166
(It ends up in a mess today as well.)

2129
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:25,096
As a result of Go With The Flow,

2130
01:07:25,097 --> 01:07:27,507
Team Ho Joon Ho earned 20 yeopjeons,

2131
01:07:28,007 --> 01:07:30,777
and Team Kim Moon Cheol earned ten yeopjeons.

2132
01:07:31,537 --> 01:07:32,646
(The number of yeopjeons per team)

2133
01:07:32,647 --> 01:07:35,477
(Team Kim Moon Cheol: 97, Team Ho Joon Ho: 124)

2134
01:07:36,547 --> 01:07:37,676
(Moving to the next spot with the yeopjeons)

2135
01:07:37,677 --> 01:07:38,677
Well done!

2136
01:07:39,717 --> 01:07:42,347
I'm sorry. I should have earned...

2137
01:07:42,657 --> 01:07:44,616
- Sae Ho.
- more yeopjeons. It was a shame.

2138
01:07:44,617 --> 01:07:45,916
- Well done.
- You did well in the beginning.

2139
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:47,286
You made a mistake this time. It's okay.

2140
01:07:47,287 --> 01:07:49,186
- Really? Nice.
- Sae Ho.

2141
01:07:49,187 --> 01:07:51,096
- I don't think it's okay.
- I'm sorry.

2142
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:53,266
- I'm really sorry.
- I expected a lot.

2143
01:07:53,267 --> 01:07:55,596
- I'm really sorry, Joon.
- But...

2144
01:07:55,597 --> 01:07:58,036
The image of Sae Ho I have...

2145
01:07:58,037 --> 01:07:59,436
Right. He does everything well.

2146
01:07:59,437 --> 01:08:01,506
- is of an ace.
- Look.

2147
01:08:01,507 --> 01:08:02,507
I'm an entertainer.

2148
01:08:02,737 --> 01:08:04,706
- Right? I'm an entertainer.
- Right.

2149
01:08:04,707 --> 01:08:06,146
So I mixed the two.

2150
01:08:06,147 --> 01:08:08,807
If I also do well after you did well...

2151
01:08:09,147 --> 01:08:10,816
- But the moment we think like that, - All right.

2152
01:08:10,817 --> 01:08:12,376
- Then this time, - we'll be unhappy.

2153
01:08:12,377 --> 01:08:13,817
We're going to win.

2154
01:08:13,917 --> 01:08:15,286
You were trying to entertain.

2155
01:08:15,287 --> 01:08:16,656
- Yes.
- So, did you give them...

2156
01:08:16,657 --> 01:08:18,016
a huge laugh?

2157
01:08:18,017 --> 01:08:19,887
- No.
- Right?

2158
01:08:20,287 --> 01:08:23,126
It was just full of disappointment.

2159
01:08:23,127 --> 01:08:24,696
- I'm sorry.
- I'm disappointed.

2160
01:08:24,697 --> 01:08:25,827
I'm sorry.

2161
01:08:25,927 --> 01:08:27,826
- We failed a number of times.
- Yes.

2162
01:08:27,827 --> 01:08:30,066
I still did my part, DinDin.

2163
01:08:30,067 --> 01:08:31,667
But Jong Min didn't do anything.

2164
01:08:31,997 --> 01:08:33,706
- Me?
- You didn't win at all today.

2165
01:08:33,707 --> 01:08:36,536
- You...
- I stacked 30 yeopjeons.

2166
01:08:36,537 --> 01:08:38,806
- What?
- Excluding that,

2167
01:08:38,807 --> 01:08:41,146
the number of yeopjeons you earned...

2168
01:08:41,147 --> 01:08:43,417
- through the games...
- Thirty.

2169
01:08:43,547 --> 01:08:44,646
Is three in total.

2170
01:08:44,647 --> 01:08:45,677
Thirty.

2171
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:48,147
- That's...
- Stacking? Don't be like that.

2172
01:08:48,217 --> 01:08:49,817
My belly did everything.

2173
01:08:50,457 --> 01:08:52,826
It would have ended if I had coughed.

2174
01:08:52,827 --> 01:08:54,926
If we hadn't done well in the stacking game,

2175
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:56,097
we would've been in trouble.

2176
01:08:57,057 --> 01:08:59,566
Why did you go in the wrong direction?

2177
01:08:59,567 --> 01:09:01,767
- What?
- You should go to the finish line.

2178
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:03,696
You should go to the finish line. You went the wrong way.

2179
01:09:03,697 --> 01:09:05,313
I was feeling dizzy. Where else could I go?

2180
01:09:05,337 --> 01:09:06,407
(Laughing)

2181
01:09:07,237 --> 01:09:08,467
I'm feeling a bit nauseous.

2182
01:09:09,237 --> 01:09:10,276
- I feel carsick.
- Carsick?

2183
01:09:10,277 --> 01:09:11,736
I'm feeling it a bit.

2184
01:09:11,737 --> 01:09:13,977
I knew you were, so we've arrived.

2185
01:09:14,077 --> 01:09:16,147
- Where?
- Here.

2186
01:09:16,247 --> 01:09:18,046
- Is it a restaurant?
- It feels like it would be.

2187
01:09:18,047 --> 01:09:19,146
A buckwheat noodle restaurant?

2188
01:09:19,147 --> 01:09:20,547
We have to eat.

2189
01:09:21,647 --> 01:09:22,716
The food here would be nice.

2190
01:09:22,717 --> 01:09:24,516
So this is the place they told us about yesterday.

2191
01:09:24,517 --> 01:09:26,486
- It is.
- Okay!

2192
01:09:26,487 --> 01:09:27,626
I greeted the owner.

2193
01:09:27,627 --> 01:09:29,656
I told you. I talked about it in the morning.

2194
01:09:29,657 --> 01:09:31,657
Where is the owner who gave us spoilers yesterday?

2195
01:09:32,027 --> 01:09:33,567
- But this place...
- Okay.

2196
01:09:33,767 --> 01:09:34,866
The food here would taste great.

2197
01:09:34,867 --> 01:09:36,336
- It would be amazing.
- Seriously.

2198
01:09:36,337 --> 01:09:37,966
- It's a 100-year-old customer.
- Because...

2199
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:39,683
- it's so...
- What's a 100-year-old customer?

2200
01:09:39,707 --> 01:09:41,366
- What?
- It's a 100-year-old restaurant.

2201
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:42,736
I guess the customer lived many years.

2202
01:09:42,737 --> 01:09:44,936
For a soba restaurant to be this big,

2203
01:09:44,937 --> 01:09:46,976
- it must taste great.
- It's a really good restaurant.

2204
01:09:46,977 --> 01:09:48,976
In Uiryeong, there are three delicacies...

2205
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:50,216
that represent Uiryeong.

2206
01:09:50,217 --> 01:09:51,247
Three delicacies?

2207
01:09:51,447 --> 01:09:53,517
- Beef gukbap, - Okay.

2208
01:09:54,747 --> 01:09:55,986
- manggaetteok, - Manggaetteok.

2209
01:09:55,987 --> 01:09:57,256
- Manggaetteok.
- and...

2210
01:09:57,257 --> 01:09:58,317
Uiryeong soba.

2211
01:09:59,017 --> 01:10:00,927
I've never heard of Uiryeong soba.

2212
01:10:01,257 --> 01:10:03,196
It's called soba,

2213
01:10:03,197 --> 01:10:05,156
but it's not like the Japanese soba.

2214
01:10:05,157 --> 01:10:06,967
- It's a Korean-style soba.
- Right.

2215
01:10:07,767 --> 01:10:09,836
We'll have Uiryeong soba for lunch.

2216
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:12,036
Yes. It's perfect for this weather.

2217
01:10:12,037 --> 01:10:13,506
- It's perfect.
- We could eat it cold.

2218
01:10:13,507 --> 01:10:14,907
Give it to us quickly!

2219
01:10:15,937 --> 01:10:17,106
Just give it to us!

2220
01:10:17,107 --> 01:10:18,206
Just give it to us.

2221
01:10:18,207 --> 01:10:20,087
It's really hot, and you're not giving us food.

2222
01:10:20,777 --> 01:10:24,376
Having an eye for valuable things...

2223
01:10:24,377 --> 01:10:26,046
is one of the essential traits of a wealthy person, isn't it?

2224
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,047
Right.

2225
01:10:27,048 --> 01:10:29,017
That's why we prepared this mission.

2226
01:10:29,387 --> 01:10:31,816
Expert Eye Quiz Show, Authentic Masterpieces.

2227
01:10:31,817 --> 01:10:34,726
- Nice.
- We have to guess the price?

2228
01:10:34,727 --> 01:10:36,726
There are several types of questions.

2229
01:10:36,727 --> 01:10:37,896
- All right.
- Let's hear them out.

2230
01:10:37,897 --> 01:10:39,256
You were on "TV Show Authentic Masterpieces."

2231
01:10:39,257 --> 01:10:40,497
- I went there.
- Of course.

2232
01:10:40,797 --> 01:10:41,896
I went there a few times.

2233
01:10:41,897 --> 01:10:44,267
Every time you get the answer right,

2234
01:10:44,697 --> 01:10:46,137
you'll get ten yeopjeons.

2235
01:10:46,967 --> 01:10:48,436
The team that earns many points...

2236
01:10:48,437 --> 01:10:49,776
can have lunch.

2237
01:10:49,777 --> 01:10:51,537
Can't we buy lunch for ourselves?

2238
01:10:52,337 --> 01:10:53,376
- Pardon?
- With our yeopjeons.

2239
01:10:53,377 --> 01:10:55,097
- We planned to use our yeopjeons.
- Right.

2240
01:10:55,277 --> 01:10:56,717
- We were going to go all in.
- Yes.

2241
01:10:57,077 --> 01:10:58,516
- Right.
- You don't need to answer.

2242
01:10:58,517 --> 01:11:01,186
It was a nice talk among elementary school kids.

2243
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:02,587
Let's do this with class.

2244
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,286
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2245
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:06,887
Let's start with the first question.

2246
01:11:06,927 --> 01:11:08,126
What's that?

2247
01:11:08,127 --> 01:11:09,726
(The first appraisal item)

2248
01:11:09,727 --> 01:11:11,767
We have to guess the price? I don't know the price.

2249
01:11:11,997 --> 01:11:14,226
- What's this?
- I recently bought these two.

2250
01:11:14,227 --> 01:11:16,173
- What's this? What are we guessing?
- The price?

2251
01:11:16,197 --> 01:11:17,397
Everyone.

2252
01:11:17,837 --> 01:11:19,906
Please arrange the following ramyeons in the order of price,

2253
01:11:19,907 --> 01:11:20,936
from highest to lowest.

2254
01:11:20,937 --> 01:11:21,966
From the highest?

2255
01:11:21,967 --> 01:11:27,246
(What's the price order of the ramyeons?)

2256
01:11:27,247 --> 01:11:29,076
You may discuss now.

2257
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:30,517
What do we have to guess?

2258
01:11:31,217 --> 01:11:33,316
- The order.
- The order? I can guess that.

2259
01:11:33,317 --> 01:11:35,786
- The order?
- What's this song?

2260
01:11:35,787 --> 01:11:37,787
Just the order, not the price?

2261
01:11:38,517 --> 01:11:40,627
This song really drops your energy.

2262
01:11:40,957 --> 01:11:41,957
- It makes sense.
- Is it the price...

2263
01:11:41,958 --> 01:11:43,527
at convenience stores or supermarkets?

2264
01:11:43,897 --> 01:11:45,556
The price at convenience stores.

2265
01:11:45,557 --> 01:11:47,896
I know the exact prices of these two.

2266
01:11:47,897 --> 01:11:49,536
I had a colonoscopy three days ago,

2267
01:11:49,537 --> 01:11:51,466
and I really wanted to eat ramyeon because you fast for a day.

2268
01:11:51,467 --> 01:11:53,106
- So I bought these two.
- Really?

2269
01:11:53,107 --> 01:11:54,407
- You know the prices?
- Yes.

2270
01:11:54,737 --> 01:11:56,206
This will be about 1.3 dollars.

2271
01:11:56,207 --> 01:11:58,207
I also think this is the most expensive.

2272
01:11:58,377 --> 01:11:59,706
It's 1, 2, 3, and 4, right?

2273
01:11:59,707 --> 01:12:01,877
- One, two, three, four.
- I think that's right.

2274
01:12:02,277 --> 01:12:03,776
I think this and this would have similar prices.

2275
01:12:03,777 --> 01:12:05,316
They're both...

2276
01:12:05,317 --> 01:12:07,316
But this is a bit more expensive.

2277
01:12:07,317 --> 01:12:08,916
- Really?
- It's a bit more expensive.

2278
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:10,156
This is the most expensive one?

2279
01:12:10,157 --> 01:12:11,517
This is definitely expensive.

2280
01:12:12,317 --> 01:12:13,757
Hey.

2281
01:12:13,957 --> 01:12:15,556
- What?
- What?

2282
01:12:15,557 --> 01:12:17,597
- Can't I look?
- Take off the towel.

2283
01:12:18,657 --> 01:12:19,926
Don't look.

2284
01:12:19,927 --> 01:12:21,826
My head is always turned this way.

2285
01:12:21,827 --> 01:12:23,137
Then don't turn.

2286
01:12:23,997 --> 01:12:25,096
(It's a really low-class Authentic Masterpieces show.)

2287
01:12:25,097 --> 01:12:27,407
- We just did it.
- You guys...

2288
01:12:27,907 --> 01:12:29,336
The most expensive one...

2289
01:12:29,337 --> 01:12:30,906
- is this or this.
- I think it's this one.

2290
01:12:30,907 --> 01:12:33,007
- It has olive oil.
- Right.

2291
01:12:33,477 --> 01:12:34,906
I think...

2292
01:12:34,907 --> 01:12:36,046
it's 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2293
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:37,317
- I don't know.
- Done.

2294
01:12:37,447 --> 01:12:39,476

We're not certain about this one, right?

2298
01:12:46,187 --> 01:12:48,026
- We're not certain.
- Let's just go with this.

2299
01:12:48,027 --> 01:12:49,456
Right. We're done.

2300
01:12:49,457 --> 01:12:50,496

- We're done.

I'm worried about these.

2304
01:12:56,937 --> 01:12:58,336
- It's completely different.
- Is it different?

2305
01:12:58,337 --> 01:12:59,366
It's completely different.

2306
01:12:59,367 --> 01:13:00,367
We went with...

2307
01:13:00,368 --> 01:13:01,437
I knew it.

2308
01:13:01,867 --> 01:13:03,206
The spicy ramyeon is the most expensive?

2309
01:13:03,207 --> 01:13:06,076
Right. Seon Ho bought it at a convenience store recently.

2310
01:13:06,077 --> 01:13:08,906
- How much was it?
- This was around 1.15 dollars.

2311
01:13:08,907 --> 01:13:10,046
- Right.
- The instant ramyeon.

2312
01:13:10,047 --> 01:13:12,276
- This was around 0.95 dollars.
- Right.

2313
01:13:12,277 --> 01:13:13,916
I think this is around 1.3 dollars.

2314
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:15,246
- Right. I thought that too.
- Right.

2315
01:13:15,247 --> 01:13:17,447
- What about the jjajang ramyeon?
- I'm not quite sure.

Are both teams incorrect?

2320

Both teams are incorrect.

2321
01:13:27,797 --> 01:13:29,666
- I think this is the answer.
- I shouldn't have given out a hint.

This was number one, right?

Jong Min misspelled "Buldak."

He spelled it with a C.

- I know you were in a hurry, - Fix it.

01:15:00,527 --> 01:15:02,186
- You said you knew!
- You said you knew!

2372
01:15:02,187 --> 01:15:03,696
This is 1.15 dollars and this is 0.95 dollars.

2373
01:15:03,697 --> 01:15:05,126
You said you knew.

2374
01:15:05,127 --> 01:15:06,156
They were certain about that.

2375
01:15:06,157 --> 01:15:08,103
We got it all wrong from the start because of you.

2376
01:15:08,127 --> 01:15:09,266
- Okay.
- All right.

2377
01:15:09,267 --> 01:15:10,797
- This was 1.15 dollars.
- Gosh.

2378
01:15:10,897 --> 01:15:12,736
Both teams got the first question incorrect.

2379
01:15:12,737 --> 01:15:15,707
Right. Here's the second question.

2380
01:15:16,437 --> 01:15:18,006
- Do we guess what's inside?
- What is this?

2381
01:15:18,007 --> 01:15:19,407
It must be caviar.

2382
01:15:19,747 --> 01:15:21,076
Out of the two,

2383
01:15:21,077 --> 01:15:23,846
which one is the real caviar?

2384
01:15:23,847 --> 01:15:30,056
(Which one is the real caviar?)

2385
01:15:30,057 --> 01:15:31,216
- I know.
- Could we try it?

2386
01:15:31,217 --> 01:15:32,386
- Could we try it?
- I got this.

2387
01:15:32,387 --> 01:15:33,886
- Just one person can try it.
- Trust me with this one.

2388
01:15:33,887 --> 01:15:35,626
- Me.
- You know I like being extravagant.

2389
01:15:35,627 --> 01:15:36,926
- I do.
- You know that, right?

2390
01:15:36,927 --> 01:15:38,926
- You love being extravagant.
- I can tell right away.

2391
01:15:38,927 --> 01:15:41,126
I've tried this many times.

2392
01:15:41,127 --> 01:15:43,596
Before trying it, let's check the color.

2393
01:15:43,597 --> 01:15:45,466
- Hold on.
- Just check the color.

2394
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:48,366
(The colors...)

2395
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:51,907
(are definitely different.)

2396
01:15:52,237 --> 01:15:55,846
(A battle of pride between the two men of extravagance)

2397
01:15:55,847 --> 01:15:57,647
You can't eat it all. We have to smell it.

2398
01:15:58,477 --> 01:15:59,917
- Can you smell anything?
- I can't.

2399
01:16:00,117 --> 01:16:01,847
This is hilarious as they're so serious.

2400
01:16:02,047 --> 01:16:03,786
DinDin is drinking some water.

2401
01:16:03,787 --> 01:16:05,557
- Look at DinDin.
- Gosh.

2402
01:16:05,987 --> 01:16:08,026
- This is hilarious.
- If you get this wrong,

2403
01:16:08,027 --> 01:16:09,827
you should eat cheap things from now on.

2404
01:16:10,027 --> 01:16:12,396
Eating expensive things without knowing the taste?

2405
01:16:12,397 --> 01:16:15,296
- There's no reason to do that.
- Just one person can try it.

2406
01:16:15,297 --> 01:16:16,737
(The two carefully give it a taste.)

2407
01:16:17,697 --> 01:16:19,167
Gosh, is this a joke?

2408
01:16:19,537 --> 01:16:22,267
- Hey, it's this one, right?
- What are you doing?

2409
01:16:22,707 --> 01:16:24,736
- All right.
- I'm a true gourmet.

2410
01:16:24,737 --> 01:16:26,806
There's no way I can't tell between the two.

2411
01:16:26,807 --> 01:16:27,807
Look at his front teeth.

2412
01:16:27,808 --> 01:16:29,817
Did you really think we wouldn't be able to tell?

2413
01:16:30,817 --> 01:16:31,877
This is hard.

2414
01:16:32,077 --> 01:16:33,546
Sae Ho doesn't know the answer.

2415
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:36,586
Five, four, three, two...

2416
01:16:36,587 --> 01:16:37,786
(Sae Ho becomes speechless.)

2417
01:16:37,787 --> 01:16:39,516
That team figured it out so easily.

2418
01:16:39,517 --> 01:16:40,597
Do you not know the answer?

2419
01:16:41,327 --> 01:16:43,396
(He looks very anxious.)

2420
01:16:43,397 --> 01:16:45,096
You guys are doomed!

2421
01:16:45,097 --> 01:16:47,526
I figured it out as soon as it came into my mouth.

2422
01:16:47,527 --> 01:16:49,026
DinDin looks so confident.

2423
01:16:49,027 --> 01:16:50,597
I'll tell you the reason.

2424
01:16:50,837 --> 01:16:52,867
Sae Ho is someone...

2425
01:16:53,537 --> 01:16:55,766
who has never bought caviar.

2426
01:16:55,767 --> 01:16:58,476
I can tell the difference after opening up the container.

2427
01:16:58,477 --> 01:16:59,477
You're right about that, but...

2428
01:16:59,478 --> 01:17:00,876
Hold on. Why is he struggling?

2429
01:17:00,877 --> 01:17:02,106
You said you knew this.

2430
01:17:02,107 --> 01:17:04,016
Too much time has passed.

2431
01:17:04,017 --> 01:17:06,647
- All right. Reveal the answer!
- You reveal the answer.

2432
01:17:07,287 --> 01:17:09,146
- It's number 1.
- It's number 2.

2433
01:17:09,147 --> 01:17:10,516
We have different answers.

2434
01:17:10,517 --> 01:17:11,816
Tell us the reason.

2435
01:17:11,817 --> 01:17:13,586
First of all,

2436
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:15,687
caviar isn't completely dark like black sesame.

2437
01:17:16,127 --> 01:17:19,726
Caviar is roe.

2438
01:17:19,727 --> 01:17:22,196
There's a small dot inside that can be seen from the outer layer.

2439
01:17:22,197 --> 01:17:24,277
That is why the color of the outer layer isn't dark.

2440
01:17:24,837 --> 01:17:26,736
- Why did you choose number two?
- Well,

2441
01:17:26,737 --> 01:17:29,306
based on the appearance,

2442
01:17:29,307 --> 01:17:30,836
I definitely thought number one was the real one.

2443
01:17:30,837 --> 01:17:33,477
But when I tried it, the texture of it...

2444
01:17:33,507 --> 01:17:35,406
felt different from the caviar I tried.

2445
01:17:35,407 --> 01:17:38,046
How should I put it? It felt stickier.

2446
01:17:38,047 --> 01:17:40,016
It had the texture of rice cakes.

2447
01:17:40,017 --> 01:17:41,816
- Number one?
- Right. That was my take of it.

2448
01:17:41,817 --> 01:17:42,916
I might be wrong.

2449
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:44,057
- Really?
- Yes.

2450
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:45,517
All right. What is it?

2451
01:17:46,017 --> 01:17:47,226
Is it the other way around?

2452
01:17:47,227 --> 01:17:49,187
- I think it's number two.
- Why?

2453
01:17:50,557 --> 01:17:51,826
- You can't change your answer.
- Why?

2454
01:17:51,827 --> 01:17:54,296
- Number one isn't caviar.
- Hold on.

2455
01:17:54,297 --> 01:17:55,426
- Now that I think about it...
- He suddenly gained confidence.

2456
01:17:55,427 --> 01:17:56,526
I've really tried it.

2457
01:17:56,527 --> 01:17:58,636
Now that I think about it, when I opened the caviar container,

2458
01:17:58,637 --> 01:18:00,237
- It's dark.
- I remember it being dark.

2459
01:18:00,907 --> 01:18:02,107
Of course, it's dark!

2460
01:18:02,237 --> 01:18:03,276
- Hey.
- Could we...

2461
01:18:03,277 --> 01:18:05,437
You said you could tell right away by its taste.

2462
01:18:05,837 --> 01:18:07,276
You're changing your mind because of how it looks?

2463
01:18:07,277 --> 01:18:08,623
We can't change our answer, right?

2464
01:18:08,647 --> 01:18:09,707
No.

2465
01:18:10,117 --> 01:18:11,376
- So...
- You can't do that.

2466
01:18:11,377 --> 01:18:12,576
Is there a right answer?

2467
01:18:12,577 --> 01:18:14,423
- Oh, there are just two answers.
- Of course, there's a right answer.

2468
01:18:14,447 --> 01:18:16,547
- He's out of his mind.
- He's being weird!

2469
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,386
- All right. Here's the answer.
- You never know.

2470
01:18:18,387 --> 01:18:19,457
Let's see.

2471
01:18:22,457 --> 01:18:23,457
Number one.

2472
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:26,127
(Herring roe, Caviar)

2473
01:18:26,357 --> 01:18:29,726
(Best man of extravagance, DinDin)

2474
01:18:29,727 --> 01:18:31,036
Yes!

2475
01:18:31,037 --> 01:18:32,466
(He lived in extravagance for this moment.)

2476
01:18:32,467 --> 01:18:34,437
- What's with this guy?
- Easy money.

2477
01:18:34,707 --> 01:18:36,836
- Easy money.
- But...

2478
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:39,236
This was what dumbfounded me.

2479
01:18:39,237 --> 01:18:41,906
As soon as the plates were placed, he didn't let us do anything.

2480
01:18:41,907 --> 01:18:44,416
I could tell right away. This is what it looks like, right?

2481
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:46,076
Number one looked like caviar right from the start.

2482
01:18:46,077 --> 01:18:47,086
You suddenly gained confidence.

2483
01:18:47,087 --> 01:18:48,586
- I was right, wasn't I?
- He said he wasn't sure earlier.

2484
01:18:48,587 --> 01:18:49,686
- I was right, wasn't I?
- That's how it looks.

2485
01:18:49,687 --> 01:18:51,287
He's like a coin getting flipped.

2486
01:18:51,887 --> 01:18:54,056
- All right. Team Kim Moon Cheol...
- Team Kim Moon Cheol.

2487
01:18:54,057 --> 01:18:55,956
Will receive ten yeopjeons.

2488
01:18:55,957 --> 01:18:56,996
- Yes!
- Yes!

2489
01:18:56,997 --> 01:18:59,126
- Easy money.
- Yes! Easy money.

2490
01:18:59,127 --> 01:19:00,697
- I'll draw the mole.
- Okay.

2491
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:03,166
It looks nice like a herring roe.

2492
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,466
(He gets caviar on his face for trying it on his own.)

2493
01:19:04,467 --> 01:19:06,467
All right. Please proceed with the next question.

2494
01:19:06,637 --> 01:19:07,957
- What is it now?
- What is this?

2495
01:19:08,467 --> 01:19:09,706
What is this?

2496
01:19:09,707 --> 01:19:10,976
- Is it expensive?
- All right, everyone.

2497
01:19:10,977 --> 01:19:12,037
I know this one.

2498
01:19:12,107 --> 01:19:13,547
Out of the following,

2499
01:19:14,177 --> 01:19:18,116
find the most expensive wasabi.

2500
01:19:18,117 --> 01:19:24,656
(Which one is the most expensive wasabi?)

2501
01:19:24,657 --> 01:19:26,056
Please play the song as we take a look.

2502
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:27,657
I really don't want to taste this.

2503
01:19:27,887 --> 01:19:29,456
Let's just try to figure it out with our eyes.

2504
01:19:29,457 --> 01:19:30,757
(I don't like spicy things.)

2505
01:19:33,997 --> 01:19:35,426
I won't be able to tell even by trying it.

2506
01:19:35,427 --> 01:19:36,427
(Looking carefully)

2507
01:19:36,428 --> 01:19:37,797
How can we tell?

2508
01:19:40,937 --> 01:19:42,006
How is it?

2509
01:19:42,007 --> 01:19:44,876
It looks like it has been a while since it has been ground.

2510
01:19:44,877 --> 01:19:46,977
- Can you see?
- No. I can't.

2511
01:19:48,077 --> 01:19:50,517
So this one has this kind of texture.

2512
01:19:51,317 --> 01:19:52,917
I think this is the most expensive one.

2513
01:19:57,087 --> 01:19:58,767
I won't be able to tell even by trying it.

2514
01:19:59,417 --> 01:20:00,687
How can we tell?

2515
01:20:05,157 --> 01:20:07,143
Could you tell us how expensive the most expensive one is?

2516
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:11,566
It's 35 dollars for 100g.

2517
01:20:11,567 --> 01:20:13,236
(The most expensive one is 35 dollars for 100g.)

2518
01:20:13,237 --> 01:20:15,036
If it's 35 dollars for 100g,

2519
01:20:15,037 --> 01:20:16,836
- it's definitely ground.
- Right.

2520
01:20:16,837 --> 01:20:19,336
And ground-up wasabi isn't that spicy.

2521
01:20:19,337 --> 01:20:20,777
(Ground-up wasabi isn't that spicy!)

2522
01:20:21,277 --> 01:20:22,746
I think it's number two.

2523
01:20:22,747 --> 01:20:24,076
(Tasting number 2)

2524
01:20:24,077 --> 01:20:25,717
- I think...
- It's this one.

2525
01:20:25,847 --> 01:20:27,047
Keep it down.

2526
01:20:27,217 --> 01:20:30,316
(Team Ho Joon Ho chooses number 2, which isn't spicy.)

2527
01:20:30,317 --> 01:20:32,416
I figured it out again this time.

2528
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:34,287
I must've really spent a lot of money.

2529
01:20:34,627 --> 01:20:36,326
I figured it out as soon as I saw it.

2530
01:20:36,327 --> 01:20:37,597
- Really?
- It was obvious.

2531
01:20:37,727 --> 01:20:39,696
- I'll tell you the difference.
- Convince us.

2532
01:20:39,697 --> 01:20:40,697
I'll tell you the difference.

2533
01:20:40,698 --> 01:20:42,266
- Keep it down. They might hear you.
- Right.

2534
01:20:42,267 --> 01:20:43,866
(DinDin's pick, number 1)

2535
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:46,436
The grains are moist.

2536
01:20:46,437 --> 01:20:47,566
The moisture of the grains.

2537
01:20:47,567 --> 01:20:48,836
This is what makes it expensive.

2538
01:20:48,837 --> 01:20:50,206
It's ground up for you on the spot at omakase restaurants.

2539
01:20:50,207 --> 01:20:51,277
Right.

2540
01:20:51,337 --> 01:20:53,136
- Check if it's spicy.
- Check if it's spicy.

2541
01:20:53,137 --> 01:20:55,347
(Tasting it right away)

2542
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:58,577
Is it spicy? It's not this one then.

2543
01:20:58,677 --> 01:20:59,916
It should be the one that isn't spicy.

2544
01:20:59,917 --> 01:21:02,047
No. It has to be the spiciest one.

2545
01:21:02,387 --> 01:21:04,668
The one that feels spicy right away is the expensive one.

2546
01:21:04,817 --> 01:21:06,687
I'm certain about this. Will you trust me?

2547
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:08,756
- Will you trust me?
- Are you sure?

2548
01:21:08,757 --> 01:21:11,756
(It's hard not to believe the extravagant at this moment.)

2549
01:21:11,757 --> 01:21:13,056
- Hold on.
- Give it a try.

2550
01:21:13,057 --> 01:21:14,426
The final 30 seconds.

2551
01:21:14,427 --> 01:21:16,736
I've ground it up myself before at home.

2552
01:21:16,737 --> 01:21:18,466
- You've tried it?
- It comes up right away, right?

2553
01:21:18,467 --> 01:21:20,666
(Screaming)

2554
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,766
What is it? Is it the expensive one?

2555
01:21:22,767 --> 01:21:24,476
(An inexplicable spiciness)

2556
01:21:24,477 --> 01:21:27,307
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Gosh!

2557
01:21:28,547 --> 01:21:29,747
- It's this one, right?
- Yes.

2558
01:21:29,877 --> 01:21:31,276
- All right. We're done.
- We're done.

2559
01:21:31,277 --> 01:21:32,676
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2560
01:21:32,677 --> 01:21:33,916
(The answer gets revealed.)

2561
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:34,947
Reveal your answer.

2562
01:21:35,917 --> 01:21:38,357
One, two, three.

2563
01:21:40,087 --> 01:21:41,686
- Do we have different answers?
- It's never number one.

2564
01:21:41,687 --> 01:21:43,056
It's number one. Do you know why?

2565
01:21:43,057 --> 01:21:44,357
The ones that are ground up...

2566
01:21:44,927 --> 01:21:47,766
bring up their spiciness the most, and it dies down quickly.

2567
01:21:47,767 --> 01:21:49,366
I've asked about this before.

2568
01:21:49,367 --> 01:21:51,337
- No.
- Is there a right answer...

2569
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:52,936
between the two?

2570
01:21:52,937 --> 01:21:55,306
- All right. This is the answer.
- Don't lose your confidence.

2571
01:21:55,307 --> 01:21:56,307
It's definitely number two.

2572
01:21:56,308 --> 01:21:58,136
(Is it number 2 that was the least spicy?)

2573
01:21:58,137 --> 01:22:00,007
(Or is it number 1 that the spiciest?)

2574
01:22:00,037 --> 01:22:01,107
- It's number two.
- Okay.

2575
01:22:02,107 --> 01:22:03,847
- It was number two.
- See? I told you.

2576
01:22:03,977 --> 01:22:06,246
- I told you.
- He doesn't know anything.

2577
01:22:06,247 --> 01:22:07,786
- I didn't do that.
- Right.

2578
01:22:07,787 --> 01:22:10,116
- He cut me off.
- You sounded so certain about it.

2579
01:22:10,117 --> 01:22:11,117
You've been to a lot of Michelin-starred places, right?

2580
01:22:11,117 --> 01:22:12,117
The one that DinDin chose.

2581
01:22:12,118 --> 01:22:14,257
- Number 1.
- Number 1...

2582
01:22:14,857 --> 01:22:16,726
is 1.48 dollars for 100g.

2583
01:22:16,727 --> 01:22:19,357
(The cheapest one)

2584
01:22:19,397 --> 01:22:21,466
It was the cheapest wasabi.

2585
01:22:21,467 --> 01:22:23,796
(Cheap things suit the extravagant guy.)

2586
01:22:23,797 --> 01:22:25,837
Since when were we caviar experts?

2587
01:22:26,097 --> 01:22:27,466
- Since when were we like that?
- You said it was number one too.

2588
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:28,506
No, I said number two.

2589
01:22:28,507 --> 01:22:30,006
Nice one!

2590
01:22:30,007 --> 01:22:31,136
(Team Ho Joon Ho 1, Team Kim Moon Cheol 1)

2591
01:22:31,137 --> 01:22:33,577
All right, everyone. This is the last question.

2592
01:22:34,047 --> 01:22:35,546
If we get this one right,

2593
01:22:35,547 --> 01:22:36,876
we can win both the yeopjeon...

2594
01:22:36,877 --> 01:22:38,246
- and the food.
- Right.

2595
01:22:38,247 --> 01:22:39,646
- All right.
- Let's begin.

2596
01:22:39,647 --> 01:22:40,647
(Enthusiastic)

2597
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:43,286
(The question is revealed.)

2598
01:22:43,287 --> 01:22:46,286
Which number is the handwriting of King Sunjo,

2599
01:22:46,287 --> 01:22:48,986
the 23rd king of Joseon?

2600
01:22:48,987 --> 01:22:53,357
(Which number is the handwriting of King Sunjo?)

2601
01:22:53,867 --> 01:22:58,897
(How would we know that?)

2602
01:22:59,537 --> 01:23:03,907
For your information, this was written when King Sunjo was young.

2603
01:23:04,037 --> 01:23:06,607
- When he was a child?
- And, everyone,

2604
01:23:06,977 --> 01:23:10,917
one of them is the real handwriting of King Sunjo,

2605
01:23:11,647 --> 01:23:14,816
and the other two are written by the production crew.

2606
01:23:14,817 --> 01:23:15,847
Seriously?

2607
01:23:16,347 --> 01:23:17,417
They wrote well.

2608
01:23:18,257 --> 01:23:20,627
Can you tell me how old Sunjo was back then?

2609
01:23:21,027 --> 01:23:22,687
- Sunjo...
- Six?

2610
01:23:22,957 --> 01:23:25,156
Hang on. Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se...

2611
01:23:25,157 --> 01:23:26,703
(He recites the list of kings for no reason.)

2612
01:23:26,727 --> 01:23:28,196
(Jong Min, look at this.)

2613
01:23:28,197 --> 01:23:29,197
Hey.

2614
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:30,236
(It's number 2!)

2615
01:23:30,237 --> 01:23:32,867
Which king was Sunjo?

2616
01:23:33,197 --> 01:23:34,837
- He was the 23rd king.
- The last one?

2617
01:23:35,867 --> 01:23:37,406
Jeong, Sun, Heon, Cheol, Go, Sun.

2618
01:23:37,407 --> 01:23:39,307
So he was the king after King Jeongjo.

2619
01:23:39,507 --> 01:23:41,406
Do you really have to know that?

2620
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:43,877
I need to find out the handwriting at that time.

2621
01:23:44,117 --> 01:23:45,517
Can you recognize that?

2622
01:23:47,847 --> 01:23:49,117
What do you think...

2623
01:23:49,587 --> 01:23:50,956
King Sunjo learned back then?

2624
01:23:50,957 --> 01:23:53,927
Filial piety? Or sun and moon?

2625
01:23:54,587 --> 01:23:56,957
Number one is more about the basics.

2626
01:23:57,597 --> 01:23:59,657
I think number two...

2627
01:23:59,857 --> 01:24:01,197
was written roughly.

2628
01:24:01,497 --> 01:24:03,473
I think he would've been told to write it clearly.

2629
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:04,797
Do you know what I mean?

2630
01:24:05,237 --> 01:24:08,306
Since he was the king, he would've been taught that way.

2631
01:24:08,307 --> 01:24:09,366
Right.

2632
01:24:09,367 --> 01:24:11,906
They wouldn't let him scribble like this.

2633
01:24:11,907 --> 01:24:14,047
- I know what you mean.
- He should write it clearly.

2634
01:24:15,047 --> 01:24:18,647
(Team Ho Joon Ho chooses number 1!)

2635
01:24:18,847 --> 01:24:20,346
He was six years old.

2636
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,946
Actually, I learned calligraphy.

2637
01:24:22,947 --> 01:24:24,357
- Did you?
- I did.

2638
01:24:24,757 --> 01:24:27,357
This one looks too timid.

2639
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:29,627
- Joseon...
- The handwriting.

2640
01:24:29,757 --> 01:24:31,157
Can you say it's timid?

2641
01:24:31,397 --> 01:24:33,697
What if it were King Sunjo's handwriting?

2642
01:24:34,997 --> 01:24:38,337
(He has a point.)

2643
01:24:38,597 --> 01:24:39,836
- I think...
- I'm not sure.

2644
01:24:39,837 --> 01:24:41,037
I think it's number one.

2645
01:24:41,167 --> 01:24:43,066
- Okay.
- I think it's number three.

2646
01:24:43,067 --> 01:24:44,436
We all have different opinions.

2647
01:24:44,437 --> 01:24:45,477
We do.

2648
01:24:46,037 --> 01:24:47,647
We picked 1, 2, and 3 each.

2649
01:24:48,147 --> 01:24:49,506
We're unanimous.

2650
01:24:49,507 --> 01:24:50,877
We're unanimous.

2651
01:24:51,447 --> 01:24:53,146
- We are...
- This is really...

2652
01:24:53,147 --> 01:24:54,847
- You each chose different numbers?
- Yes.

2653
01:24:54,987 --> 01:24:56,516
- By the way...
- Hey. If he was a child,

2654
01:24:56,517 --> 01:24:58,016
- Hey! I got it!
- it would be filial piety.

2655
01:24:58,017 --> 01:24:59,417
- I know.
- What is it?

2656
01:24:59,487 --> 01:25:00,886
- This one.
- Is that it?

2657
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:02,286
- Yes.
- Okay.

2658
01:25:02,287 --> 01:25:04,696
- We will go with Jong Min's choice.
- He's the king of history.

2659
01:25:04,697 --> 01:25:07,597
The thing is, that's the handwriting from that time.

2660
01:25:07,797 --> 01:25:09,397
One, two, three.

2661
01:25:09,667 --> 01:25:10,667
Show us your answers.

2662
01:25:10,937 --> 01:25:12,096
- It's the same.
- Okay.

2663
01:25:12,097 --> 01:25:14,367
- Show us your answers.
- It's the same.

2664
01:25:14,837 --> 01:25:16,967
- Here's why.
- We...

2665
01:25:17,937 --> 01:25:19,237
When you write "Sun,"

2666
01:25:19,507 --> 01:25:21,807
after the first stroke, you should press it down.

2667
01:25:22,047 --> 01:25:23,916
The stroke looks thick.

2668
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:26,916
That means Sunjo wrote that after learning calligraphy.

2669
01:25:26,917 --> 01:25:28,786
And when he wrote "Moon,"

2670
01:25:28,787 --> 01:25:30,816
the 2nd stroke was thicker than the 1st one.

2671
01:25:30,817 --> 01:25:33,317
That means he learned calligraphy.

2672
01:25:33,957 --> 01:25:35,456
- We chose...
- That's not thick.

2673
01:25:35,457 --> 01:25:37,696
Number two, following Jong Min's opinion.

2674
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:38,956
And DinDin agreed.

2675
01:25:38,957 --> 01:25:40,566
At 1st, DinDin chose number 2.

2676
01:25:40,567 --> 01:25:41,666
- I chose number 2.
- I chose number 3.

2677
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:42,843
Our opinions differed at first.

2678
01:25:42,867 --> 01:25:45,136
- But we went with number one.
- Actually...

2679
01:25:45,137 --> 01:25:46,296
- I think it's correct.
- This is better.

2680
01:25:46,297 --> 01:25:47,367
It's safe this way.

2681
01:25:47,537 --> 01:25:49,336
Do you want to change your answer?

2682
01:25:49,337 --> 01:25:50,777
- No.
- No, we won't.

2683
01:25:51,277 --> 01:25:52,277
- No.
- No, we won't.

2684
01:25:52,278 --> 01:25:54,506
Your face is saying, "That's correct."

2685
01:25:54,507 --> 01:25:56,276
"I want one of you to change your answer."

2686
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:57,917
- We won't change.
- Are you sure?

2687
01:25:58,347 --> 01:26:00,077
Really? Can we change?

2688
01:26:00,277 --> 01:26:01,316
Change?

2689
01:26:01,317 --> 01:26:02,846
Do you want to change?

2690
01:26:02,847 --> 01:26:03,887
(Studying their faces)

2691
01:26:05,087 --> 01:26:06,087
Let's change!

2692
01:26:07,427 --> 01:26:09,387
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- Let's change.

2693
01:26:09,527 --> 01:26:10,726
- Lastly...
- Change.

2694
01:26:10,727 --> 01:26:13,327
Show us your final answer in 30 seconds.

2695
01:26:13,827 --> 01:26:15,467
- Jong Min...
- You know what?

2696
01:26:15,627 --> 01:26:17,367
If you think of Jong Hyun's character,

2697
01:26:17,697 --> 01:26:19,196
he doesn't have the strength...

2698
01:26:19,197 --> 01:26:20,937
to handle the backlash after this.

2699
01:26:21,337 --> 01:26:22,907
So I don't think he will set us up.

2700
01:26:23,407 --> 01:26:25,006
- Maybe no one got it right.
- All of a sudden?

2701
01:26:25,007 --> 01:26:26,276
What if we're wrong?

2702
01:26:26,277 --> 01:26:27,477
What will you say?

2703
01:26:28,077 --> 01:26:29,176
"What was that?"

2704
01:26:29,177 --> 01:26:30,416
(A serious look)

2705
01:26:30,417 --> 01:26:32,546
- "What did you do?"
- "Why did you tell us to change?"

2706
01:26:32,547 --> 01:26:34,147
"Did you not want us to eat that much?"

2707
01:26:35,417 --> 01:26:37,656
DinDin has a point. If number one is the correct answer,

2708
01:26:37,657 --> 01:26:38,887
DinDin won't let it slide.

2709
01:26:39,257 --> 01:26:40,826
I guess you're right.

2710
01:26:40,827 --> 01:26:42,556
If you don't want to change, you don't have to.

2711
01:26:42,557 --> 01:26:44,157
We've already made up our mind.

2712
01:26:44,427 --> 01:26:46,427
- Can we call dibs?
- I want to change our answer.

2713
01:26:46,727 --> 01:26:48,696
Why would you call dibs?

2714
01:26:48,697 --> 01:26:50,026
I don't think this is correct.

2715
01:26:50,027 --> 01:26:51,736
Is it like you can change your answer and we can't?

2716
01:26:51,737 --> 01:26:52,836
I don't think this is correct.

2717
01:26:52,837 --> 01:26:54,336
- Five.
- Let's go with this.

2718
01:26:54,337 --> 01:26:55,707
- Four.
- No.

2719
01:26:56,137 --> 01:26:57,976
- Three.
- Look at his face. It's wrong.

2720
01:26:57,977 --> 01:26:59,506
- Two.
- We should hurry.

2721
01:26:59,507 --> 01:27:00,827
- One.
- Let's just go with this.

2722
01:27:00,977 --> 01:27:03,176
- I don't know.
- Show us your answers.

2723
01:27:03,177 --> 01:27:04,617
- I think it's number 2.
- Number 3.

2724
01:27:05,277 --> 01:27:07,046
- What's your answer?
- Number one.

2725
01:27:07,047 --> 01:27:08,246
- You didn't change?
- We will stick to it.

2726
01:27:08,247 --> 01:27:09,567
Finally, the answers are divided.

2727
01:27:09,847 --> 01:27:11,417
You told us to change!

2728
01:27:12,887 --> 01:27:14,056
- All right.
- You forced us,

2729
01:27:14,057 --> 01:27:15,686
- so we had to change our answer.
- Right.

2730
01:27:15,687 --> 01:27:17,256
All right. Guys...

2731
01:27:17,257 --> 01:27:19,397
(The answer is finally revealed.)

2732
01:27:20,727 --> 01:27:23,096
- Please let us have this one.
- Number three?

2733
01:27:23,097 --> 01:27:26,836
The handwriting of King Sunjo, the 23rd king of Joseon.

2734
01:27:26,837 --> 01:27:28,957
- It can't be number three, right?
- The answer is...

2735
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:30,306
Please.

2736
01:27:30,307 --> 01:27:31,777
(Desperate)

2737
01:27:32,777 --> 01:27:33,777
Number three.

2738
01:27:33,778 --> 01:27:35,106
(The answer to the last question is number 3!)

2739
01:27:35,107 --> 01:27:36,146
See?

2740
01:27:36,147 --> 01:27:37,147
Number three.

2741
01:27:37,148 --> 01:27:41,517
(Shouting)

2742
01:27:41,887 --> 01:27:44,087
A king's handwriting should look powerful.

2743
01:27:44,987 --> 01:27:47,356
(Dejected)

2744
01:27:47,357 --> 01:27:49,477
It's number three. We wouldn't have chosen it anyway.

2745
01:27:49,557 --> 01:27:50,827
We thought it was number two.

2746
01:27:51,097 --> 01:27:53,097
(Frozen)

2747
01:27:53,397 --> 01:27:55,966
(The original handwriting of King Sunjo)

2748
01:27:55,967 --> 01:27:57,196
You know what?

2749
01:27:57,197 --> 01:27:58,766
- I can't believe this.
- This is a record...

2750
01:27:58,767 --> 01:28:02,007
of what a king wrote when he was six years old.

2751
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:03,366
- I...
- It should be distinctive.

2752
01:28:03,367 --> 01:28:05,036
But number two is too characterless.

2753
01:28:05,037 --> 01:28:07,476
Number two looks like a kid's handwriting.

2754
01:28:07,477 --> 01:28:08,746
- The person who wrote number two...
- They drew it.

2755
01:28:08,747 --> 01:28:10,106
Shouldn't do calligraphy.

2756
01:28:10,107 --> 01:28:11,576
Number one is too showy.

2757
01:28:11,577 --> 01:28:13,376
- Right.
- It's too show off some skills.

2758
01:28:13,377 --> 01:28:15,316
- Number 1 was...
- So it's number 3.

2759
01:28:15,317 --> 01:28:16,487
All right then.

2760
01:28:16,847 --> 01:28:19,087
Team Kim Moon Cheol gets 20 yeopjeons,

2761
01:28:19,257 --> 01:28:20,986
and Team Ho Joon Ho...

2762
01:28:20,987 --> 01:28:22,556
gets ten yeopjeons. Give this to them.

2763
01:28:22,557 --> 01:28:24,957
- Team Kim Moon Cheol...
- Okay!

2764
01:28:25,127 --> 01:28:27,266
Won the lunch.

2765
01:28:27,267 --> 01:28:28,596
(Team Kim Moon Cheol won the lunch!)

2766
01:28:28,597 --> 01:28:30,837
I'm so happy. I'm really happy after so long.

2767
01:28:31,237 --> 01:28:33,066
I'm starving. Can't you just let us eat?

2768
01:28:33,067 --> 01:28:34,236
(That's impossible.)

2769
01:28:34,237 --> 01:28:35,407
I'm really hungry. Seriously.

2770
01:28:35,967 --> 01:28:38,436
- It's 100 years.
- I'll have a double portion.

2771
01:28:38,437 --> 01:28:39,737
This place is 100 years old.

2772
01:28:40,007 --> 01:28:42,976
(Just looking at it makes you feel cool to the bone.)

2773
01:28:42,977 --> 01:28:44,217
What's this?

2774
01:28:44,247 --> 01:28:46,376
(Cold buckwheat noodles)

2775
01:28:46,377 --> 01:28:48,117
It's as big as a washbowl.

2776
01:28:50,017 --> 01:28:52,256
(It makes you feel energized in the hot summer.)

2777
01:28:52,257 --> 01:28:54,787
It's so sweet and tangy when you mix it with the sauce.

2778
01:28:54,887 --> 01:28:56,727
The noodles are so soft.

2779
01:28:58,327 --> 01:29:00,356
Look at the perilla oil.

2780
01:29:00,357 --> 01:29:02,767
The buckwheat noodles look great.

2781
01:29:02,927 --> 01:29:05,296
You will also get buckwheat dumplings and a pork cutlet.

2782
01:29:05,297 --> 01:29:06,936
- Yes!
- Nice!

2783
01:29:06,937 --> 01:29:08,066
(Buckwheat dumplings and a pork cutlet on the side)

2784
01:29:08,067 --> 01:29:09,736
This is insane.

2785
01:29:09,737 --> 01:29:11,713
(Buckwheat dumplings and a pork cutlet on the side)

2786
01:29:11,737 --> 01:29:15,346
(The killer menu of Uiryeong, buckwheat noodles, are served.)

2787
01:29:15,347 --> 01:29:17,576
It would've been nice if we could eat together.

2788
01:29:17,577 --> 01:29:18,946
(The killer menu of Uiryeong, buckwheat noodles, are served.)

2789
01:29:18,947 --> 01:29:20,746
I'm worried about them. They would want to eat so much.

2790
01:29:20,747 --> 01:29:22,016
My goodness.

2791
01:29:22,017 --> 01:29:24,216
- Oh, no.
- It's as big as a washbowl.

2792
01:29:24,217 --> 01:29:28,526
Can we get two extra bowls so we can take some of the food?

2793
01:29:28,527 --> 01:29:29,926
It's 4pm now.

2794
01:29:29,927 --> 01:29:31,056
(It's so hard to watch them eat.)

2795
01:29:31,057 --> 01:29:33,057
It has a lot of perilla oil in it.

2796
01:29:33,797 --> 01:29:35,726
- Look.
- Gosh, the buckwheat noodles...

2797
01:29:35,727 --> 01:29:36,997
look amazing.

2798
01:29:37,297 --> 01:29:38,597
This is crazy.

2799
01:29:39,067 --> 01:29:41,837
(He tries the soup first.)

2800
01:29:45,507 --> 01:29:47,807
(What? This taste is...)

2801
01:29:49,977 --> 01:29:52,577
(The savory taste feels refreshing and pleases the mouth.)

2802
01:29:55,717 --> 01:29:57,316
It's refreshing. This feels so good.

2803
01:29:57,317 --> 01:29:58,887
My goodness. Hey.

2804
01:29:59,157 --> 01:30:00,626
The soup is so good.

2805
01:30:00,627 --> 01:30:04,297
(A refreshing treat in the middle of summer)

2806
01:30:04,497 --> 01:30:06,526
It has jangjorim for garnish.

2807
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:09,026
It's on another level.

2808
01:30:09,027 --> 01:30:11,643
The buckwheat noodles of Uiryeong are different from ordinary ones.

2809
01:30:11,667 --> 01:30:13,266
It has beef jangjorim for garnish...

2810
01:30:13,267 --> 01:30:15,236
- and a sauce.
- Right. This is it.

2811
01:30:15,237 --> 01:30:17,107
It is the delicacy of Gyeongsang Province.

2812
01:30:17,267 --> 01:30:19,307
- I'm so hungry.
- Seriously,

2813
01:30:19,507 --> 01:30:21,176
I'm starving here.

2814
01:30:21,177 --> 01:30:22,177
I'm feeling dizzy.

2815
01:30:22,178 --> 01:30:25,076
I'm sorry, but the noodles taste amazing.

2816
01:30:25,077 --> 01:30:26,877
- I just had a bite.
- Really?

2817
01:30:27,617 --> 01:30:31,716
(The chewy texture of the noodles can be felt even on the screen.)

2818
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:32,816
My goodness.

2819
01:30:32,817 --> 01:30:33,916
(The aroma of perilla oil makes your mouth water.)

2820
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:35,026
The perilla oil is crazy.

2821
01:30:35,027 --> 01:30:36,727
The aroma of perilla oil is amazing.

2822
01:30:40,197 --> 01:30:41,866
This is insane.

2823
01:30:41,867 --> 01:30:43,967
- Let me smell it.
- Just smell it.

2824
01:30:44,237 --> 01:30:46,667
- Let me smell it.
- Just smell it.

2825
01:30:46,797 --> 01:30:49,837
- The noodles are so soft.
- My goodness.

2826
01:30:50,807 --> 01:30:53,507
(Dizzy)

2827
01:30:53,707 --> 01:30:55,106
This is my favorite. Perilla oil.

2828
01:30:55,107 --> 01:30:56,583
(He leaves after letting them smell it.)

2829
01:30:56,607 --> 01:30:58,346
Seriously, I'm feeling dizzy.

2830
01:30:58,347 --> 01:31:00,076
(He's so hungry that he's feeling dizzy.)

2831
01:31:00,077 --> 01:31:01,117
I'm dizzy.

2832
01:31:01,547 --> 01:31:02,586
(Lip-trilling)

2833
01:31:02,587 --> 01:31:04,186
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

2834
01:31:04,187 --> 01:31:05,187
(Lip-trilling again)

2835
01:31:05,817 --> 01:31:07,356
Still, they're eating now.

2836
01:31:07,357 --> 01:31:08,926
(Since he can't eat, he tries to disturb them.)

2837
01:31:08,927 --> 01:31:09,987
The sound...

2838
01:31:10,797 --> 01:31:12,497
That spoils their appetite.

2839
01:31:13,957 --> 01:31:16,667
(They don't care.)

2840
01:31:19,767 --> 01:31:21,567
This is really good.

2841
01:31:22,567 --> 01:31:24,107
It's so delicious. What do I do?

2842
01:31:26,407 --> 01:31:27,447
(Savoring)

2843
01:31:31,047 --> 01:31:34,247
(It's so bouncy and chewy.)

2844
01:31:37,917 --> 01:31:39,816
The noodles are unbelievably chewy.

2845
01:31:39,817 --> 01:31:41,856
Seriously, the noodles are unbelievable.

2846
01:31:41,857 --> 01:31:42,956
This is so cruel.

2847
01:31:42,957 --> 01:31:44,496
- Just because we got it wrong...
- I'm really hungry.

2848
01:31:44,497 --> 01:31:46,526
- We're suffering.
- I'm starving.

2849
01:31:46,527 --> 01:31:48,326
It's really interesting.

2850
01:31:48,327 --> 01:31:50,327
- It's fun.
- I didn't eat a single meal today.

2851
01:31:53,197 --> 01:31:55,237
My gosh. They're enjoying the food.

2852
01:31:56,307 --> 01:31:58,477
Jong Min, how good is it?

2853
01:32:00,007 --> 01:32:02,107
- My goodness.
- Is it seriously good?

2854
01:32:02,177 --> 01:32:03,246
It's really savory.

2855
01:32:03,247 --> 01:32:04,516
I want to try it.

2856
01:32:04,517 --> 01:32:05,616
It has perilla oil in it.

2857
01:32:05,617 --> 01:32:07,947
It's a little salty.

2858
01:32:09,047 --> 01:32:10,317
It's perfectly seasoned.

2859
01:32:10,687 --> 01:32:12,017
It tastes just right.

2860
01:32:12,157 --> 01:32:13,987
And the aroma of perilla oil is quite strong.

2861
01:32:14,187 --> 01:32:16,426
Is that 1 of the top 3 meals you've ever had?

2862
01:32:16,427 --> 01:32:17,627
- Yes.
- It is.

2863
01:32:17,897 --> 01:32:18,927
Of course.

2864
01:32:21,267 --> 01:32:22,766
He always says it is 1 of the top 3 dishes.

2865
01:32:22,767 --> 01:32:25,436
(Jong Min's top 3 list is updated every time.)

2866
01:32:25,437 --> 01:32:27,167
- Seriously...
- I feel bad for them.

2867
01:32:27,297 --> 01:32:28,507
This is so harsh.

2868
01:32:28,567 --> 01:32:29,737
Everyone.

2869
01:32:31,207 --> 01:32:33,976
We will give some food to the losing team too.

2870
01:32:33,977 --> 01:32:35,046
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2871
01:32:35,047 --> 01:32:36,947
- We'll serve you too.
- Thank you.

2872
01:32:37,147 --> 01:32:38,616
- For real?
- Bring it in.

2873
01:32:38,617 --> 01:32:40,846
(For real?)

2874
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:43,446
Okay, good. At least it's rice.

2875
01:32:43,447 --> 01:32:45,117
- What's this?
- It's carbs. Thank you.

2876
01:32:45,357 --> 01:32:46,417
This is enough.

2877
01:32:47,587 --> 01:32:49,086
Is that rice topped with radish?

2878
01:32:49,087 --> 01:32:51,527
(Picked radish on top of plain rice)

2879
01:32:52,727 --> 01:32:55,226
That's the cold broth the noodles are served in.

2880
01:32:55,227 --> 01:32:58,067
Thank you so very much. This is enough.

2881
01:32:58,497 --> 01:32:59,537
Is this it?

2882
01:33:00,497 --> 01:33:02,036
It's rice. We need carbs.

2883
01:33:02,037 --> 01:33:03,137
I'm about to faint.

2884
01:33:03,437 --> 01:33:05,777
Can I have some wasabi from earlier?

2885
01:33:06,837 --> 01:33:08,376
Do you know what's really annoying?

2886
01:33:08,377 --> 01:33:09,647
This made my mouth water.

2887
01:33:11,117 --> 01:33:12,446
I'm starving.

2888
01:33:12,447 --> 01:33:15,716
(A mouthful taken with gratitude)

2889
01:33:15,717 --> 01:33:16,946
It's plain rice...

2890
01:33:16,947 --> 01:33:18,917
that wasn't seasoned at all.

2891
01:33:21,127 --> 01:33:23,327
How should I put it? You put no care into it.

2892
01:33:25,897 --> 01:33:27,596
(Still, we love it.)

2893
01:33:27,597 --> 01:33:28,597
This is great.

2894
01:33:29,827 --> 01:33:31,536
(They wish desperately that they'll win next time.)

2895
01:33:31,537 --> 01:33:32,766
This tastes great.

2896
01:33:32,767 --> 01:33:34,737
(Next episode)

2897
01:33:34,967 --> 01:33:37,037
(Gaping in awe)

2898
01:33:37,437 --> 01:33:40,437
(An incredibly luxurious dinner)

2899
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:43,606
(If you want dinner, )

2900
01:33:43,607 --> 01:33:45,617
(you must take risks?)

2901
01:33:45,947 --> 01:33:48,546
(War of Money just got fiercer.)

2902
01:33:48,547 --> 01:33:49,786
(What did you do today?)

2903
01:33:49,787 --> 01:33:52,787
(Distrust)

2904
01:33:53,457 --> 01:33:55,586
(Resentment)

2905
01:33:55,587 --> 01:33:57,856
(Even theft occurs...)

2906
01:33:57,857 --> 01:33:59,427
(amid this War of Money.)

2907
01:33:59,727 --> 01:34:02,366
(Even tears are shed.)

2908
01:34:02,367 --> 01:34:04,127
(You can't trust anyone.)

2909
01:34:04,237 --> 01:34:05,296
It's so scary.

2910
01:34:05,297 --> 01:34:07,237
(Desperate voices in the dark?)

2911
01:34:08,107 --> 01:34:09,937
(The war isn't over yet.)

2912
01:34:10,307 --> 01:34:15,446
(Who will be victorious?)

2913
01:34:15,447 --> 01:34:16,646
This is fun.

2914
01:34:16,647 --> 01:34:19,147
(See you on Sunday night at 6:10pm.)
