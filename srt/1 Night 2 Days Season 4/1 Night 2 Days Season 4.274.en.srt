1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,850
(The day grows dark
as the sun begins to set.)

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,550
The soybean soup was filling.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,280
I wonder how many beans we had.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,050
- What's going on?
- You can go inside.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,020
- I see something over there.
- Wait. What?

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,390
Is that a stage light?

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,990
What's this?

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,890
- What's going on?
- Hey.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,860
(Why is the stage light set up?)

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,860
Right.

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,800
- You can't see the grannies here.
- Right.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,470
- Are they inside?
- The ladies...

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,400
Why don't we call for them
to find out where they are?

14
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,540
What?

15
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,670
Grandma!

16
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,770
- You want us to call them?
- Mom!

17
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,410
He said, "Mom."

18
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,980
What's going on?

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,750
There must be guests today.

20
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,780
(A song plays all of a sudden.)

21
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,620
- Whose song is it? It's that song.
- It's Kendrick Lamar's song.

22
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,780
It's Kendrick Lamar's song.

23
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,220
What's going on?

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,920
- What?
- What's this?

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,060
- What?
- What's this?

26
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,190
- It's hip-hop.
- It's hip-hop.

27
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,230
Who's who? I can't tell them apart.

28
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,400
(The grannies get
complete hip-hop makeovers.)

29
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,470
(Their jaws drop open.)

30
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,040
(Let's dance to the song for now.)

31
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,510
Suni and the Seven Princesses.

32
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,850
Gosh, you poor thing.

33
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,750
- It must've been a lot of work.
- Gosh, no.

34
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,120
Planting the chili peppers
must've been tough.

35
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,150
- I heard you guys had to work.
- Yes.

36
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,820
- My gosh.
- Yes, we did.

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,650
- You look great in this outfit.
- You look so cool.

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,460
Ladies.
(She's still worried about them.)

39
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,560
- Are you ready?
- Gosh, no.

40
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,130
I guess they prepared a performance.

41
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,330
- They must've prepared something.
- Let's step back.

42
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,460
What did they prepare?

43
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,400
- What if they start rapping?
- They look so cool.

44
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,470
- Play the music.
- You got this, Grandma!

45
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,470
- Go ahead.
- You got this.

46
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,570
("Ain't No Rappers Like Us"
by Suni and the Seven Princesses)

47
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,150
(There aren't any rappers like us)

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,920
(The members are surprised
by their rap skills.)

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,720
(Suni and the Seven Princesses)

50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,660
(The school bell rings)

51
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,030
(Let's gather around now)

52
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,230
(Our teacher is waiting for us)

53
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,860
(In the senior citizen center)

54
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,530
(Then the beat suddenly changes.)

55
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,670
- What's going on?
- What?

56
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,170
(They are trying
to hold back their tears.)

57
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,340
(We learned the letters
and wrote poems)

58
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,910
(We also published a book)

59
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:32,590
(We can now read addresses,
business cards, and lyrics)

60
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,230
(We signed the form
at the bank ourselves too)

61
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,400
(We can take the bus too)

62
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,030
(Laughing)

63
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,040
- Okay.
- Gosh, when did they prepare this?

64
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,600
- What's going on?
- When did they do all this?

65
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,740
(We are students now)

66
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,180
(Just a few decades older
than the others)

67
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,110
(We take our backpacks
and go to school)

68
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,290
(We study with our friends,
wrinkled faced and bodies weakening)

69
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,750
(We bicker over
who's right and wrong)

70
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,190
(As we share laughter,
we can't be more delighted)

71
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,860
(We're the representative
grandma rappers)

72
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,800
(Our average age is 85)

73
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,770
("Ain't No Rappers Like Us"
by Suni and the Seven Princesses)

74
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,240
Suni and the Seven Princesses!

75
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,240
(They slayed it!)

76
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,010
- You're the best.
- A performance...

77
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,310
- by Suni and the Seven Princesses.
- I bet you were pretty surprised.

78
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,110
Actually, these lovely ladies
who are joining us today...

79
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,780
are the pride of Chilgok.

80
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,850
They're the oldest group of rappers
in Korea.

81
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,020
They're Suni
and the Seven Princesses.

82
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,860
(After learning the letters
rather late,)

83
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,530
(they began writing
the rap lyrics themselves.)

84
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,600
(As rappers, they perform
on all kinds of stages now.)

85
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,860
(A new performance
by Suni and the Seven Princesses...)

86
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,800
(is garnering attention.)

87
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
(Source: Reuters)

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,270
(Meet Suni and the Seven Princesses)

89
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,440
(The rapping grannies making it big)

90
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,980
(Drawing attention from
both domestic and international media)

91
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,980
(The rapping grannies lead
a new culture of senior citizens.)

92
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,250
(Suni and the Seven Princesses)

93
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,250
You were amazing.

94
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,980
- We missed a lot of our beats.
- Rapping on the beat...

95
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,180
- We were awful. What do you mean?
- No.

96
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,750
- That must've been hard.
- Right.

97
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,290
The grannies are making us
cry a lot today.

98
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,120
- Right. I got so emotional.
- My gosh.

99
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,760
Sae Ho couldn't enjoy
the performance.

100
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,430
- He was so touched.
- Yes. My gosh.

101
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,130
I looked at the lyrics.

102
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,900
I think you wrote all the lyrics.
Didn't you?

103
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,670
- We did.
- They wrote all the lyrics.

104
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,540
By the way, you must be the leader.
Jum Soon. It must be you.

105
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,970
The name of the group is
Suni and the Seven Princesses.

106
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,840
- You know,
- Yes.

107
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,440
I was born as a daughter.

108
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,880
- And I had an older brother.
- Yes.

109
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,810
My older and younger brothers
graduated from university.

110
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,020
My grandfather said I couldn't study
because I was a girl.

111
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,520
I couldn't even make it
to the school gate.

112
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,260
- Back then...
- I could never go to school.

113
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,560
So that always broke my heart.

114
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,660
(The disappointment
still lingers in her heart.)

115
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,460
Back then, girls couldn't go
to school. I'm serious.

116
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,860
- That's right. Gosh.
- Yes.

117
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,760
- Listening to your story...
- Yes.

118
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,270
makes us so sad.

119
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,370
(They channeled their sadness
into the lyrics.)

120
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,400
So...

121
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,140
(Tae Hee quietly wipes away her tears.)

122
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,380
(The only thing we can do is...)

123
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
"We are students now."

124
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,650
"Just a few decades older
than the others."

125
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,990
"We take our backpacks
and go to school."

126
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,460
"We study with our friends,"

127
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
"wrinkled faced
and bodies weakening."

128
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:26,960
(All we can do is to root for them
as they take on a grand challenge.)

129
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,970
(It was an honor to hear you
singing your life stories.)

130
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,200
We came here
without planning anything.

131
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,370
We should've prepared something.

132
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,510
You've done so much for us.

133
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,310
(They feel undeserving
of the grannies' hard effort.)

134
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,740
Thank you so much
for the excellent performance.

135
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,350
Today, we have to make sure
the ladies eat at their usual time.

136
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,220
We are going to prepare dinner
earlier than usual.

137
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,650
We prepared dinner
to return the kindness...

138
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,960
of inviting us to your town.

139
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
- Gosh.
- Okay.

140
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,730
We used all kinds
of precious ingredients...

141
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,060
from the mountains and ocean.

142
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,730
It's the feast of delicacies.

143
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,800
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

144
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,870
The chef from our food team
cooked dinner for you.

145
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,230
- We can finally face them.
- Delicacies?

146
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,240
Yes. However...

147
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,700
- Our food is really good.
- However?

148
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,040
- However... The ladies will eat.
- However?

149
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,040
But the members will follow
the results of the Dinner Game.

150
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,280
Only one team can join the ladies...

151
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,080
- for dinner.
- Gosh. That's too mean.

152
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,150
- Was that necessary?
- You know, we're okay with this.

153
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,550
But they won't be able to eat
because they feel bad.

154
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,920
No. So we'll separate the tables.

155
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,320
- You'll separate us? Okay.
- They'll eat separately.

156
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
He's so cold-hearted.

157
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,830
All right. Let us set up
the area for the game first.

158
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,130
- And we'll resume.
- Okay.

159
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,390
- That was a great performance.
- They might get cold.

160
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,630
- Aren't you cold?
- Thank you.

161
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,960
- You were so good.
- Thank you.

162
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,130
Seriously.

163
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,130
- Aren't you cold?
- No.

164
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,570
- Aren't you cold?
- It was a lovely performance.

165
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm so happy that I can't feel cold.

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,010
Gosh, no.

167
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,510
- You practiced this for two years?
- Yes.

168
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,240
- It's been over 2 years.
- It's been over 2 years.

169
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,640
(They gather around and chat.)

170
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,210
- All right, everyone.
- Seriously.

171
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,180
Let's begin the game now.

172
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,250
- Okay.
- Okay.

173
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,050
The feast of delicacies is
at stake...

174
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,420
on today's Dinner Game.

175
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,750
It's Show Me the Grandma.

176
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,020
- Show Me the Grandma.
- Show Me the Grandma.

177
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,020
- All right.
- Yes.

178
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,060
The ladies will put their own spin
on the lyrics of a song...

179
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,430
and deliver it as a rap on the spot.

180
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,270
You must guess the title
and the singer of the song.

181
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,470
- As a rap?
- My gosh.

182
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,700
- As a rap?
- This won't be easy.

183
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,770
As a rap?

184
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,300
- We have the upper hand for this.
- We definitely have the advantage.

185
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,570
- We can't afford to lose.
- We can't.

186
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,640
Each round will be worth
a different number of points.

187
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,480
You must take turns
to participate...

188
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,850
as only one of you can play
on behalf of your team.

189
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,350
- This is good, right?
- Please decide...

190
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,450
the order of players first.

191
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,620
Wouldn't it be better for Seon Ho
to take DinDin?

192
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,350
- Right.
- But...

193
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,520
- Hold on.
- I can be bold and try...

194
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,060
- If you win it, it will be over.
- Yes.

195
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,060
- Right.
- We'll win for sure then.

196
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,160
- I'll try to win.
- Okay.

197
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,660
- We've decided.
- Same here.

198
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,930
- I listen to a lot of songs now.
- Okay.

199
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,130
All right.

200
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,770
The members for Round One,
please step forward.

201
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,530
- You can just stand up.
- Okay.

202
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,240
Okay. I'll go for it.

203
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,570
(Team Team Pil Sun's player, Sae Ho)

204
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,270
- A battle between new recruits.
- All right.

205
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,540
(It's a match between new recruits.)

206
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,940
(Round 1 begins.)

207
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,280
Seon Hwa. Begin rapping.

208
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,680
(Focused)

209
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,920
(No matter how hard)

210
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,990
(I try to forget you)

211
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,350
(Think about the long years)

212
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,290
(We spent together)

213
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,320
This is too easy.

214
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,590
(This is too easy for him?)
(The time spent together)

215
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,460
(Makes me sad)

216
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,460
(So I can't stop crying)

217
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,230
(I will show you)

218
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,200
I will show you

219
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,300
- I got it.
- It's Ailee's.

220
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,600
- Sae Ho was faster.
- I got it.

221
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,300
- "I Will Show You" by Ailee.
- There you go!

222
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,540
- That's correct.
- My gosh.

223
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,010
- You won.
- Yes.

224
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,380
(Team Pil Sun obtains 1 point.)

225
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,680
(Let's check the song.)

226
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,520
Think about the long years
we spent together

227
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,850
(A perfect match)

228
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,020
- Hey, is your name Ailee?
- I said, "Ailee."

229
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,730
Is your name Ailee?

230
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,790
(He was in a rush.)

231
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,130
Gosh, that's good.

232
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,630
(I will show you a new me)

233
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,700
- You're great.
- Great.

234
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,470
Cho Sae Ho.
(You're good!)

235
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,270
(He responds to their support
and shows off his charm.)

236
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,840
- She's uncomfortable.
- She seems uncomfortable.

237
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,940
- Don't you like me?
- She's uncomfortable.

238
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,380
- I really like you.
- Yes.

239
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,350
So this is how you play it.

240
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,420
- Okay?
- Yes.

241
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,820
Who will participate in Round Two?

242
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,190
- How many points are at stake?
- One point.

243
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,220
I'll go for it.

244
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,260
- Okay.
- Okay!

245
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,690
- I was so close.
- All right.

246
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,460
(Singer Jong Min versus Se Yoon,
the Member of a Music Quiz Show)

247
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,930
Jum Soon will rap for this round.

248
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:18,930
- Okay.
- You got this.

249
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,630
- You have to step back.
- Gosh.

250
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,470
- He can't see the paper.
- Step back.

251
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,740
(Laughing)

252
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,870
Please start rapping.

253
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,510
(I told you I didn't want)

254
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,510
(To see you)

255
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,410
(I told you not to call me)

256
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,410
Gosh, I know this one.

257
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,110
Are you really

258
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:42,290
(Her clear pronunciation makes it
impossible not to figure it out.)

259
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,160
- I got it.
- Jong Min.

260
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,390
- Three,
- You know, it's their song.

261
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,030
- Kang Min Kyung and Hae Ri.
- two, one.

262
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,990
- Wrong.
- I got it.

263
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,400
- Se Yoon.
- It's "8282" by Davichi.

264
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,100
("8282" by Davichi)

265
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,170
Correct.

266
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,870
Nice job stealing his answer.

267
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,870
I stole his answer.

268
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,970
(Davichi)

269
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
(Davichi)

270
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,140
(Laughing)

271
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,240
Nice job.

272
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,340
Why did you give him a hint?

273
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,510
I knew it.
But I couldn't think of Davichi.

274
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,010
(He ended up giving Se Yoon a hint.)

275
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,520
- Why did you give them a hint?
- Come on. Hurry.

276
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,650
You know what? It's 1 to 1.

277
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,790
You don't have to feel so bad.
It's only 1 to 1.

278
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,460
Hurry.

279
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,720
(Yes. Let's dance for now.)

280
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,590
Nice!

281
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,730
(Flocking to the grannies)

282
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,760
Move.

283
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,200
(All of a sudden,
they start putting on a show.)

284
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,330
Let's go.

285
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
"I love you."

286
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,940
(I love you)

287
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,410
(We love you, Grandmas!)

288
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,450
(Getting ready for the high notes)

289
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,250
All right. Scream!

290
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,080
(Scream!)

291
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,020
- My gosh.
- He's good.

292
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,190
- All right.
- I knew the lyrics.

293
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,960
- I sang this song a lot.
- I couldn't remember their name.

294
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,360
I couldn't remember their name.

295
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,430
- I was clueless.
- You were good, though.

296
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,760
All right. Next,

297
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,330
Ok Ja will present the song.

298
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,830
- What's that?
- Gosh, this is hard.

299
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,800
- I was completely lost.
- Hey, pay attention to her flow.

300
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,270
All right. Please start rapping.

301
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,410
(Pitch-black sunglasses)

302
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,740
(Sky-blue hair)

303
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,180
- Gosh, this song...
- Just like your hair

304
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,450
(He doesn't have a clue.)

305
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,550
- Gosh, this song...
- Just like your hair

306
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,910
(Just like your hair)

307
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,280
(I have a yellow streak in my hair)

308
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,350
I got it.

309
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,350
- Gosh, this is so easy.
- DinDin.

310
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,620
- He got it.
- It's Park Myung Soo's song.

311
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,120
- "Prince of the Sea!"
- I knew it.

312
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,030
(Let's check the song.)

313
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,200
(Pitch-black sunglasses)

314
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,530
(Sky-blue hair)

315
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,600
(A perfect match)

316
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,140
(It's another dance party.)

317
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,040
Okay.

318
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,140
All right, everyone.

319
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,980
- I knew it with the first line.
- Okay.

320
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,320
- With the next round,
- This was so easy.

321
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,750
you will earn two points.

322
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,190
- Okay.
- I got confused.

323
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,490
- Joon.
- One more time.

324
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,090
Just win one round for us.

325
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,360
- Pitch-black sunglasses
- I got confused just now.

326
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
- Why couldn't I remember that?
- All right.

327
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,590
- For this round,
- I see. Two of them will rap.

328
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,290
they will rap together.

329
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,030
- My gosh.
- Two points are at stake on this.

330
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,100
- Gosh.
- All right.

331
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,700
Okay.

332
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,230
We'll begin.

333
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,400
Please start rapping.

334
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,070
(Every day)

335
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,840
(You and I)

336
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,410
(I like it)

337
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,040
(We should have met)

338
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,940
(Twice or thrice)

339
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,710
(I pinch myself)

340
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,580
(It's like dreaming)

341
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,590
- Like dreaming
- I got it.

342
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,090
"Password 486" by Younha.

343
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,090
- That's it.
- Wrong.

344
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,190
- It's wrong?
- Okay. It's our turn now.

345
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,390
- Can you rap a little more?
- Listen to it.

346
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,430
(Thinking about you)

347
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,060

(Misty Joo)

349
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,430
I got it.

350
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,470
- "Chu" by Lovelyz.
- Three, two...

351
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,070

(This popular song is called...)

357
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,950
("Mr. Chu" by Apink)

358
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,290
(Her vocal feature makes
the song even more delightful.)

359
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,800
(And here comes
the highlight of the song.)

360
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,460
(Kiss on the lips)

361
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,530
(A sweet kiss)

362
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,140

367
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,810

368
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,240
- Take it.

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,290

376
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,560
- "Mr. Chu."
- It's Apink's song.

377
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,920
It's Apink's song.

378
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,130
It's Apink's song.

379
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,230
(He was close,
but he missed out on 2 points.)

380
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,930
Let's celebrate.

381
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,430

386
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,210
You're good. Go for it.

387
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,010
Excellent!

388
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,010
(Shaking)

389
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,780
(Why is he dancing? He lost.)

390
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,110
Gosh, let's keep trying.

391
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,450
Let's go, Team Ok Geum!

392

We can just win
the other two rounds.

399
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,300
(Actually, I wanted to end)

400
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
(Our relationship today)

401
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,700

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,110
Sae Ho.

411
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,420
(Dancing in sync)

412
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,050
I'm sorry about that.

413
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,790
My gosh.

414
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,530
- That was great.

415
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,090
(Satisfied by their show)

416
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,230
That was great.

417
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,230
Gosh, how nice.

418
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,130
Hey, we're winning by a landslide.

419
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,770
Gosh, I was close.

420
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,030
- Gosh, I knew it too.
- No, it wasn't.

421
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,140
I had it in the bag.

422
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,070
- I got it.

(Team Pil Sun: 3, Team Ok Geum: 6)

429
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,350
(Team Ok Geum
might lose their lead.)

430
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,420
All right, everyone. Starting now,

431
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,650
- everyone can participate.
- Okay.

432
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,690
- Great.
- I guess it's a hard one.

433
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,220

will win three points.

434
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,260

- Go.
- Go.

442
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,770
(It's a bummer that she is)

443
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,240
(Viewers, why don't you try too?)

444
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,810
(Oh, I'm still young)

445
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,210
(It seems she can't accept
my true feelings of love)

446
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,320

- He didn't say "Pil Sun."

451
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
- What?
- He didn't say "Pil Sun."

452
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,360
- It's SHINee's song.
- I said it.

453
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,900

We got three points. Well done.

456
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,800
(The score is tied
in a matter of seconds.)

457
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,910
What's that? He looks ugly.

458
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,310
- Great job.
- Nice!

459
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,940
He's getting an electric shock.
Nice.

460
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,550
I haven't seen that in a while.

461
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,750
(Doing his electric shock dance
to celebrate)

462
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,820
What's that?

463
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,350
He's breakdancing.

464
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,550
- We got this.
- All right.

465
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,590
We're tied.

466
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,990

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,800

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,960
This will be your last round.

471
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,530
- The last round?
- Yes.

472
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,670
- Then it's over?
- Yes.

473
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,900
Is the last round worth 100 points?

474
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,370
Gosh, really?

475
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,740
- The last round...
- Or 20,000 points.

476
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,940
- The points won't matter.
- It's 100 points, right?

477
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,340
This is your last round.

478
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,370
- Give us a hard one.
- This will decide the winning team.

479
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,710
- We have to get this right.
- Okay.

480
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,840
- Focus, please.
- Give us a hard one.

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,980
- Focus.
- He said...

482
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,080
- there'd be delicacies.
- Yes.

483
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Then today's dinner
will have amazing dishes.

484
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,350
(Their dinner is at stake
on this single round.)

485
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,350
This is driving me crazy.

486
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,890
You're ready, right?

487
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,890
- Yes.

488
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,420

(If they're right,
Team Pil Sun will have dinner.)

500
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,610

sweep them away.)

525
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,710
- You will get to eat dinner.
- All right.

526
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,140
(Team Pil Sun won dinner.)

527
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,370
Our teamwork was amazing.

528
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,040
Well done, everyone.

529
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,210
Ladies, let's go and have dinner.

530
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,550

531
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,350

532
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,650
- Congratulations, ladies.
- Thank you.

533
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,850
You worked very hard.

534
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,790
You did an excellent job.

535
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,220
- You're adorable today.
- Well done.

536
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,290
Why can't you eat?

537
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,530
- You can eat with us.
- He won't give us food.

538
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,660
- You can eat with us.
- It's him...

539
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,930
- who won't give us food.
- He won't give us food.

540
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,160
(That guy won't give us food.)

541
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,330
(That guy)

542
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,330
He won't give us food.

543
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,000
We'll share food with you.

544
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,300
He told us not to eat.

545
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,140
Could you talk to him?
He won't give us food.

546
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,300
Please give them food.

547
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,740
(Perplexed)

548
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,940
- Did you hear that?
- Please give them food.

549
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,710
It must be hard to say no.

550
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,380
It must be difficult.

551
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,580
You'll be responsible
if she gets an upset stomach.

552
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,620
- We'll join you later.
- Please treat him well.

553
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,880
- It's this way.
- Ladies, it's this way.

554
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,750
Goodness.

555
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,450
- The steps are high.
- Gosh.

556
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,860
(They go for delicacies
with the elder ladies.)

557
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,760
(The scorching sun became softer
in the early evening.)

558
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,860
Ma'am.

559
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,260
- Let's go eat.
- Let's go eat.

560
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,300
We're going to the second floor.

561
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,770
Please come.

562
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,800
Let's go.

563
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,440
Goodness, why is it so cold?

564
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,540
Isn't it cold?

565
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,170
It's quite windy here.

566
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,170
(Holding her hand tightly)

567
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,580
I'm happy to go there with Garlic.

568
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,710
You're going with Garlic.

569
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,310
I'm happy to go there with Garlic.

570
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,610
- This is great.
- Are we going upstairs?

571
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,780
- Will it be safe to climb down?
- I'm in a good mood.

572
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,150
(While holding hands, they go
to the 2nd floor to eat.)

573
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,750
It'd be easier
to hold onto the rail.

574
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,890
- What's all this?
- It smells so good.

575
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,890
- Doesn't it?
- Goodness.

576
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,360
What's all this?

577
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,990
- Gosh.
- What's all this?

578
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,990
There's hairtail.

579
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,730
- Look at all these delicacies.
- This is wonderful.

580
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,870
(A sumptuous feast)

581
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,100
It's a feast.

582
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,900
(It's just like a feast.)

583
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,000
The food looks great.

584
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,870
(Amazed)

585
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Ladies.

586
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,940
Does the feast look good to you?

587
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,110
- Yes.
- Yes.

588
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,280
- How will I be able to eat this?
- Come on.

589
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,050
(Today's food for the elder ladies)

590
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,420
This is...

591
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,890
- a feast of delicacies.
- Okay.

592
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,320
(A feast of delicacies)

593
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,390
It's cooked perfectly.

594
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,930
This is amazing.

595
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,730
Where did they grill it?

596
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,130
(Chewy and sweet
steamed duck with kabocha)

597
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,810
What's a lobster?

598
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,070
- There's something missing.
- It's crayfish from the sea.

599
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,410
I've never tried this before.

600
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,680
Today's food is the best
we've ever had.

601
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,880
You made it very fancy.

602
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
- Let's cut it for them.
- Thank you for the food.

603
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,250
- I'll remove the bones too.
- Thank you.

604
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,660
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your food.

605
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,060
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy.

606
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,060
Enjoy.
- It's delicious.
- Ma'am.

607
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,130
I'll remove the bones...

608
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,790
- from the hairtail.
- Thank you.

609
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,800
Is it good?

610
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
- Like this.
- It's good.

611
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
(Preparing the hairtail
so that it's easier to eat)

612
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,430
Can you serve me some fish?

613
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,970
I will. Please wait.

614
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,370
That's enough for me.

615
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,010
(A thick piece of meat
for the elder lady)

616
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,810
- Gosh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

617
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,810
Yes.

618
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,110
Do this while holding it down.

619
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,180
How is it so thick?

620
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,880
Let's see.

621
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,420
(Removing small bones
on both sides like an expert)

622
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,050
Where did they grill this?

623
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,520
I'm not sure.

624
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,360
Please eat.

625
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,160
- Is there any napkin?
- Napkin?

626
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,260
(Thanks to our grandchildren,
we get to eat comfortably.)

627
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,330
(Seon Ho finally gets a bite
of the hairtail.)

628
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,870
The hairtail is seasoned well.

629
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,300
- It's seasoned perfectly.
- Right?

630
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,710
- There's abalone.
- Ma'am, I'll do it for you.

631
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,940
- Okay.
- No, we can eat it like this.

632
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,710
This is an invigorating
short rib soup.

633
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,880
It has everything including
sarcodon mushroom and abalone.

634
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,090
(Abalone and sarcodon mushroom
with tender short ribs)

635
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,190
Can you serve them some abalone?

636
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,090
(All the invigorating food is
for the elder ladies.)

637
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,430
It's boneless short ribs.

638
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,060
(Happy)

639
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,530
It melts in my mouth.

640
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,760
Here it is.

641
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,430
(Eating)

642
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,840
(The tender meat...)

643
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,770
(and rich broth)

644
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,410
This broth tastes the best.

645
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,740
The broth?

646
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,810
(This is good.)

647
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,510
This is pasta.

648
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,350
Jum Soon, do you know
what spaghetti is?

649
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,380
It's a dish from Europe.

650
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,990
I've never seen or heard
of such a thing.

651
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,950
Would you like to try
some spaghetti?

652
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,990
Did you try it?

653
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,530
(Grandma Jum Soon tastes pasta
for the first time.)

654
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,790
- Isn't it great to win?
- Isn't the food delicious?

655
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
(Both the victory
and food taste sweet.)

656
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,130
The hairtail tastes good.

657
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,600
(It's delicious.)

658
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,300
I'd like to try this.

659
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,500
Would you like some?

660
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,840
I've never had anything like it.

661
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,040
(She's never seen
grilled lobster before.)

662
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,680
(It suits her palate
because of the pleasant texture.)

663
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,010
Should I get you some?

664
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,720
Take a bite of it.

665
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,520
(Sae Ho removes the chewy
and light lobster meat for her.)

666
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,760
(Thank you for taking care of me.)

667
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,260
Which dish do you like the most?

668
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,090
Everything tastes good.

669
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,130
Everything?

670
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,860
First, the beef is delicious.

671
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,900
(1 vote for
the invigorating short rib soup)

672
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,230
These dishes are...

673
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,530
- more than enough for me.
- The hairtail?

674
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,300
The hairtail and the meat.

675
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,400
The meat?

676
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,540
(1 more vote

677
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,770
(Today's popular dish)

678
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,410
I'm very grateful.

679
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,980
I'm happy to try something
I've never had before.

680
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,110
I see.

681
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,810
I'm very happy.

682
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,050
(Thanks to you, I'm very happy.)

683
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,290
I feel okay with not eating,
which is very rare.

684
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,860
(Am I the only one
who wants to eat?)

685
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,890
(Have some of this.)

686
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,960
(He won't let me.)

687
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,930
(Observing closely)

688
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,100
Can you close your eyes?

689
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,400
(Can I really eat it?)

690
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,070
- Everyone.
- They will give us food.

691
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,340
- Don't worry.
- Yes.

692
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,280
- The losing team needs to...
- Don't worry.

693
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,740
- eat something, right?
- Right.

694
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,150
What will you give us?

695
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,950
My goodness.

696
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,750
(Boiled eggs)

697
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,920
(Are you joking?)

698
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,590
(Goodness)

699
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,530
Why does it feel like we had eggs
not so long ago?

700
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,960
(Food for the losers
during their last trip in Yeoju)

701
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
(Se Yoon again)

702
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,170
(They ate too many eggs that day.)

703
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,100
(Joon again)

704
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,600
Gosh.

705
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,910
(Let's just eat since we're hungry.)

706
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,410
The protein looks delicious.

707
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,210
I've been eating eggs...

708
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,950
Is there such a big difference
when you win?

709
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,020
It's nice to win.

710
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,820
(It's definitely nice to win.)

711
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,590
- Hey, young man.
- Yes?

712
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,850
Put it in your mouth.

713
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,720
He won't let me eat.

714
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,860
Wouldn't it be impolite...

715
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,130
- not to listen to her?
- Right.

716
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,530
She's telling him...

717
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,560
- to have a bite.
- She wants to give him food?

718
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,870
She's telling him to eat this one.

719
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,230
(The elder lady's words
make Director Joo waver.)

720
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,340
Open your mouth and put it in.

721
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,800
Eat it.

722
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,240
- This?
- Yes.

723
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,840
- But he'll scold me.
- He won't.

724
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,010
I won't let him. Just eat it.

725
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,240
It's your order.

726
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,610
- Just eat it.
- Disobeying isn't good either.

727
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,680
- That's impolite.
- Can I put this on top?

728
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,150
Yes.

729
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,620
- I'm going to eat.
- Everyone.

730
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,850
All right.

731
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,820
(Well done.)

732
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,850
Okay.

733
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,990
- All right.
- That's it.

734
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,490
- You should do that too.
- Everyone.

735
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,890
- Doesn't the food look good?
- Yes.

736
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,760
Among the three of you,

737
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,100
- only one person will...
- Okay.

738
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,600
get to try the feast of delicacies.

739
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,900
Stay in the back.

740
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,970
We will give a chance...

741
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,300
- What's wrong with him?
- to one of you.

742
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,900
- I'm desperate.
- Let's be fair and square.

743
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,070
(Desperate)

744
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,940
Based on the popularity votes
from the ladies,

745
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,710
we'll pick one of you.

746
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
All right.

747
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,540
Before the voting starts,

748
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,150
you'll be given a brief moment
to show off your charms.

749
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,380
Please pick one person...

750
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,450
who you think did a good job.

751
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,790
- Gosh, I can't do that.
- I understand,

752
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,860
- but it's only for fun.
- It would break my heart...

753
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,660
to pick only one person.

754
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,890
I understand,

755
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,230
but please pick one person
after watching them.

756
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,230
Okay.

757
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,000
This is the most
nerve-racking performance.

758
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,870
I never felt so nervous.
My heart is beating fast.

759
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,100
(The first candidate, Se Yoon)

760
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,840
I'm also a rapper.

761
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,180
(Working in the same field
as the ladies)

762
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,180
(The second candidate, Cheol)

763
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,680
It's called loss of muscles.

764
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,220
Without food,
my body goes into shock.

765
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,550
I can't keep my back straight.

766
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,020
Poor you.

767
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,490
(The third candidate, Chang Sun)

768
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,960
(It's starting now.)

769
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,190
Are you enjoying your food?

770
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,690
- Yes.
- Yes.

771
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,560
Eating without music would be sad,
wouldn't it?

772
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,430
I'll sing a song
so you can eat better.

773
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,000
If you agree,
give me a round of applause.

774
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,440
Okay.

775
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,840
(Anticipating)

776
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,310
(Snapping)

777
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,040
You're so good.

778
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,180
- Good.
- All right.

779
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,310
(Singing passionately)

780
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,610
Look at him blushing.

781
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,420
(Laughing)

782
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,950
He's such an introvert.

783
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,420
(For an introvert, it's hard
without musical accompaniment.)

784
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,620
Look at him blushing.

785
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,660
His face is about to explode.

786
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,630
(There you go!)

787
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,360
Can I just eat?

788
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,500
You have something to show?

789
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,160
I could see...

790
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,130
- Se Yoon blushing more as he sang.
- I know.

791
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,230
Ladies.

792
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,270
That was number one.

793
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,570
- Next up is Cheol.
- Se Yoon is number one.

794
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,410
- Yes.
- I can't believe that I went first.

795
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:19,140
Hello, Suni
and the Seven Princesses.

796
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

797
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,580
When I rap,

798
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,420
please rap with me.

799
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,990
This rap performance
will bring us together.

800
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,990
All right.

801
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,220
When I say, "DinDin is DinDin,"

802
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,620
- Aren't you Cheol?
- please say,

803
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,990
"DinDin is DinDin."

804
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,030
- Shall we try it?
- Okay.

805
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,060
Will you be okay?

806
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,060
(Cheol, will you be okay?)

807
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,300
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

808
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,000
(Se Yoon, I'll give it a try.)

809
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,700
It's more nerve-racking
than the finals on "Show Me the Money."

810
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,800
(His ears became red.)

811
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,300
This is really nerve-racking.

812
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,300
(Good luck, Cheol.)

813
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,970
DinDin...

814
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,980
(It's embarrassing for some reason.)

815
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,510
This isn't right.

816
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,580
Get a grip. You can do this.

817
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,850
- Okay.
- Let's eat.

818
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,350
- His expression...
- This is so good.

819
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,980
Here I go.

820
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,980
(Is everyone ready to have fun?)

821
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,160
(He finally starts to rap.)

822
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,220
(Dancing up and down)

823
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,560
- Nice.
- Yes.

824
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,230
One, two, three, four.

825
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,530
(DinDin is DinDin)

826
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,600
(DinDin is DinDin)

827
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,670
(DinDin is DinDin)

828
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,640
- Louder.
- You're doing well.

829
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,870
Louder.

830
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,140
(Encouraging them to respond)

831
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,140
Louder.

832
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,580
Everyone, scream!

833
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,680
(A professional presence on stage)

834
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,880
- Good job.
- Thank you. This was DinDin.

835
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,920
Well done.

836
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,320
The one who sang 2nd is number 2.

837
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,920
(I did it!)

838
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,120
Next up is number three.

839
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,790
- Why are your ears so red?
- Number three.

840
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,360
(Soon, the last person is up.)

841
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,630
You aren't allowed
to take off your clothes.

842
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,000
- That would be cheating.
- Don't do it.

843
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,100
Keep your clothes on.

844
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,300
You've done it enough times.

845
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,400
Man number three is quiet.

846
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,740
Being quiet isn't good.

847
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,070
- Or...
- Gosh, he's got it.

848
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,540
Show us your muscles.

849
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,240
(Attracting them easily
with his muscles)

850
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,750
- Gosh.
- What's this?

851
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,780
(Oh, my)

852
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,280
Go ahead and take photos.

853
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,190
She looks so excited.

854
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,060
She gave you a thumbs-up.

855
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,960
(He made himself attractive
with his muscles.)

856
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,990
- Now, I'll sing a song.
- That was funny.

857
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,730
His performance is long.
That's cheating.

858
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,500
Five, six, seven.

859
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,030
(Have a drink)

860
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,170
All right.

861
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,470
(The perfect song to sing)

862
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,470
(He's also dancing.)

863
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,010
Have a drink

864
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,080
You're doing well.

865
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,580
(His dance captivates
the elder ladies' hearts.)

866
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,520
(Run)

867
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,980
You're doing well.

868
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,850
Have three drinks

869
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,890
(Exploding with excitement)

870
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,720
You should eat.

871
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,800
(He finishes by showing off
his muscles.)

872
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,230
Well done.

873
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,670
(Very satisfied)

874
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,330
Among the three,
whom did you like the most?

875
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,700
All of them did well.

876
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,940
Gosh, it's hard to pick.

877
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,940
Please come back in.
The result is out.

878
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,940
(Pit-a-pat)

879
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,780
- Is the result out? That's cruel.
- Yes, it's out.

880
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,450
Two of you almost had
the same number of votes.

881
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,550
- Is that so? Who came last?
- First of all...

882
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,220
Let me announce the result.

883
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,390
Who will eat boiled eggs
without worrying?

884
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,820
It was nip and tuck.

885
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,160
The person to eat boiled eggs.
Congratulations.

886
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,130
Congratulations, Joon.

887
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,760
(Joon is picked.)

888
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,060
Is it Joon?

889
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,670
(He showed them his muscles.)

890
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:36,810
(He also got the most reception.)

891
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,340
- What did you not like about it?
- I...

892
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,540
- I announced your name.
- Why?

893
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,350
Unfortunately, you came in second.

894
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,250
- Really?
- You came in second.

895
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,250
(He's glad that he wasn't last.)

896
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,420
You came in second.

897
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,220
I thought that I came last.
Thank you.

898
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,260
(Between them,
there's a winner and a loser.)

899
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,160
(Drum roll)

900
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,660
At the very end,
the match between...

901
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,530
Joon and DinDin was nip and tuck.

902
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,540
What did you say?

903
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,440
(Chang Sun placed 2nd.)

904
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,070
(Then did I place 1st?)

905
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,710
(Oh, no)

906
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,250
- What? What did you say?
- Gosh.

907
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,480
(He shared a spoiler so naturally.)

908
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,480
Congratulations.
Today's winner is DinDin!

909
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,390
- DinDin is DinDin, everyone.
- Good job.

910
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,420
- DinDin is DinDin, everyone.
- I'm sorry.

911
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,090
I apologize.

912
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,590
Due to being an inexperienced host,

913
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,600
I revealed the result smoothly
without realizing it.

914
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,770
- DinDin and Se Yoon.
- Mister.

915
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,670
- Mister, how could you...
- I apologize.

916
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,100
You can't do that as a host.

917
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,270
Come on. It was fun.

918
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,940
Thank you, ladies.

919
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,740
- Hip-hop.
- Hip-hop.

920
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,740
(Hip-hop lovers connect
with hip-hop.)

921
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,640
- Hip-hop.
- Hip-hop.

922
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,980
(This is the loyalty among rappers.)

923
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,880
(The dance singers consume protein.)

924
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,850
Come and join us. We ate a lot.

925
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,350
Yes, don't worry, ma'am.

926
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,220
- We'll get to eat.
- Exactly. This won't do.

927
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,960
Come to the table.

928
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,790
(Thinking)

929
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,190
- As the ladies wish...
- You should eat with us today.

930
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,260
What?

931
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,800
You should've let us eat
much earlier.

932
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,400
- I...
- What?

933
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,930
Both of you, come to the table.

934
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,400
(Please enjoy the food
with everyone.)

935
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,540
My goodness.

936
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,110
- Come here and eat.
- Thank you.

937
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,210
(Hurry and join us.)

938
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,210
No, it's okay.

939
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,950
(Grandma Ok Geum
yields her seat to Joon.)

940
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,250
It's hard to reach
the side dishes from there.

941
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,380
Go on.

942
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,380
All right. Mr. Trot.

943
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,490
Sit there.

944
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,050
Thank you. I'll eat comfortably.

945
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,890
Joon is the one...

946
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,590
(Happy)

947
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,660
Isn't it delicious?

948
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,490
Isn't it good? Try this.

949
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,630
Ma'am.

950
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,560
(Delicious food is the best
when shared.)

951
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,300
By the way,

952
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,540
what about these people?

953
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,600
(These people)

954
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,700
You don't like Coke?

955
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,570
I washed my hands.

956
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,280
Here you go.

957
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,080
(Grandma Jum Soon gives food
to the staff as well.)

958
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,510
- Here you go.
- Goodness.

959
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,450
Go on and eat it.

960
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,610
- Thank you.
- Sure.

961
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,620
(Moved)

962
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,320
We see this rarely on 2 Days and 1 Night.

963
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,150
Here you go.

964
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,220
Go on and take it.

965
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,860
Here you go.

966
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,260
Gosh, thank you.

967
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,300
Those in the back. Here you go.

968
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,630
(She gave food to everyone.)

969
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,900
Thanks to the ladies,
it feels like Family Month.

970
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,940
I agree.

971
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,810
You must be tired.
This is our last game.

972
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:25,810
(It's 8 p.m. already.)

973
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,910
We had a good time today.
Why would I be tired?

974
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,980
Don't you usually go to bed
at this hour?

975
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,120
No, not yet.

976
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,220
It's not our bedtime.

977
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,150
I'll go to sleep when I get home.
I have nothing else to do.

978
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,060
On 2 Days and 1 Night,

979
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,320
we play what's called
Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

980
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,930
"Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors?"

981
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,000
The losers have to sleep outdoors.

982
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,230
You can't sleep outdoors.

983
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,270
(Please help us sleep indoors.)

984
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,940
We will proceed right away...

985
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,410
to Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

986
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,040
The losing team will sleep...

987
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,340
in the front yard of the house...

988
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,640
- The front yard?
- that you visited earlier today.

989
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,810
Was there a front yard?

990
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,080
(It's written as front yard.)

991
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,720
- Next to the vegetable garden?
- Next to the vegetable garden.

992
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,490
- The eaves.
- Next to the vegetable garden.

993
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,150
- The winners sleep in the room.
- But...

994
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,790
Please pick a partner.

995
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,930
With whom do you want to play?

996
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,630
- DinDin, Se Yoon, or Chang Sun.
- Chang Sun. DinDin.

997
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,200
(Thinking)

998
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,270
Would you like to be
Cheol's partner?

999
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,640
Yes.

1000
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,110
She's been DinDin's huge fan.

1001
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,440
(A devoted DinDin's fan)

1002
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
She keeps picking DinDin.

1003
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,610
(Feeling bitter)

1004
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,110
Pil Sun, who will it be? Cabbage,
Webfoot Octopus, or Garlic.

1005
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,310
With whom would you like to play?

1006
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,550
Cabbage, Webfoot Octopus, or Garlic.

1007
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,850
(A competition
among various ingredients)

1008
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,590
- Cabbage.
- Cabbage? Okay.

1009
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,950
- Cabbage.
- She picked Cabbage.

1010
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,520
What about Seon Hwa?

1011
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,720
Who among the four?

1012
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
(Seon Hwa's favorite)

1013
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,960
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

1014
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,900
I'll pick Seon Ho.

1015
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,100
Moon Se Yoon.

1016
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,570
Okay.

1017
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,570
- All of you are Team Ok Geum.
- Okay.

1018
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,040
- All of you are Team Pil Sun.
- Pil Sun.

1019
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,110
Tonight's Sleeping Indoors
or Outdoors is...

1020
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,680
- Granny Galli.
- "Granny Galli?"

1021
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,150
It's a board game.

1022
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,710
This Sleeping Indoors
or Outdoors is...

1023
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,220
a competition between the ladies.

1024
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,280
(Only the ladies will participate
in the game.)

1025
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,720
Where you sleep will depend
on your partner.

1026
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,760
Okay.

1027
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,530
Those on the team
with ladies who remain last...

1028
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,330
- will sleep outdoors.
- Okay.

1029
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,660
If you're the last to remain?

1030
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,870
I'll explain more simply later.

1031
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,030
(He's so reliable.)

1032
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,940
It's easy. Let me explain.

1033
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,740
- You get five minutes for planning.
- Okay.

1034
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,770
That's enough time.

1035
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,980
Can you put this down?

1036
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,180
Put it down.

1037
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,540
- Then what happens?
- On two cards...

1038
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,850
The total is five. Ring the bell.

1039
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,450
Ring it.

1040
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,980
That's it.

1041
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,480
When there are five of them...

1042
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,820
Four and one?

1043
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,050
Exactly. Okay?

1044
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,350
Can you flip the card?

1045
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,120
(The youngest is gentle
especially with the elder ladies.)

1046
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,630
What's this? Exactly.
There are five.

1047
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,630
(Imprisoning her
in Seon Ho's compliments)

1048
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,730
- How many are there?
- You must ring.

1049
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,560
That's right. Give me a high-five.

1050
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,770
- You've got this.
- Okay.

1051
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,430
(Now is the real game.)

1052
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,540
All right, let's start
with Grandma Soon Yeon.

1053
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,800
Okay.

1054
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,640
- Is it in order?
- Get ready, start.

1055
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,940
It started. All right.

1056
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,910
(Starting like she doesn't care)

1057
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,410
- Did she play?
- Yes.

1058
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,950
- Okay.
- Next?

1059
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,780
Ms. Tae Hee. All right.

1060
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,420
- There are four.
- Next.

1061
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,120
Here you go.

1062
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,950
- No.
- Isn't that right?

1063
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,160
(No)

1064
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,760
- Isn't that right?
- No.

1065
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,630
(Grandma Seon Hwa got confused
after seeing a card of 5.)

1066
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,660
- No.
- No.

1067
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,030
(Why not?)

1068
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,900
When you add all the strawberries,

1069
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,370
- the total is nine.
- Nine doesn't work.

1070
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,830
- You can't ring the bell...
- I see.

1071
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,770
because the total is nine.
All right.

1072
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,410
Ms. Soon Yeon, go ahead.

1073
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,470
(The game resumes.)

1074
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,410
Put down the card and decide.

1075
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,540
- Gosh.
- No, right?

1076
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,250
No. All right.

1077
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,310
Look at them carefully.

1078
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,010
(They look more focused
than they have been today.)

1079
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,450
Keep going.

1080
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,380
(Nervous)

1081
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,520
(1 strawberry, 6 plums, 4 limes)

1082
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,520
Next is Ms. Pil Sun.

1083
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,420
(3 strawberries, 6 plums, 7 limes)

1084
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,660
(5 plums)

1085
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,260
(Finally, there are 5 of a kind.)

1086
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,830
Ma'am.

1087
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,730
(You must...)

1088
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,300
(ring the bell now.)

1089
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,400
Ma'am.

1090
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,440
(Grandma Ok Geum
rang the bell quickly.)

1091
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,010
- Five.
- What about this?

1092
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,910
- Ok Geum.
- One, two, three, four, five.

1093
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,140
(She even explains perfectly
to the other ladies.)

1094
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,180
- My mom won first place.
- That was good.

1095
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
(DinDin and Ok Geum succeed.)

1096
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,950
Ms. Ok Geum, you won first place.

1097
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,020
Good job.

1098
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,890
Ms. Jum Soon will start next.

1099
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,020
Here's Round Two.

1100
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,360
(1 banana)

1101
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,060
(3 bananas)

1102
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,860
How many are there?

1103
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,570
- No.
- The total is seven.

1104
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,530
- These must be five.
- Okay.

1105
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,300
- The total is 7.
- There are 7.

1106
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,710
(The game resumes.)

1107
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,010
You just need to add them.

1108
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,270
- In order.
- Next?

1109
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,810
Look at the cards carefully.

1110
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,810
(2 bananas, 6 plums, 5 limes)
There are five.

1111
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,550
(Grandma Tae Hee reacts quickly.)

1112
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,250
- There are five.
- Ma'am.

1113
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,550
Please take your card.

1114
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,780
Please come this way.

1115
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,120
- All right. This time,
- Ms. Pil Sun.

1116
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
- Pil Sun will go first.
- Right.

1117
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,620
- Flip it.
- Yes. Now, put it down.

1118
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,090
- Okay. Flip it.
- What?

1119
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,860
- Okay.
- Okay!

1120
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,090
(Okay!)

1121
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,200
- Okay. Jum Soon, let's go!
- Great job.

1122
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,230
- Jum Soon!
- That was good.

1123
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,070
- You did a good job.
- Jum Soon!

1124
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,570
- We still have a chance, ma'am.
- It's over, right?

1125
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,900
No, it's not over yet.

1126
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,010
There's a member left
from that team, so it's not over.

1127
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,070
- It's not over yet.
- It's not over.

1128
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,080
(Team Ok Geum will win
if Soon Yeon wins the next round.)

1129
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,980
- Soon Yeon!
- You really did a wonderful job.

1130
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,450
Our team will sleep indoors
if you win.

1131
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
- Okay.
- Soon Yeon!

1132
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,650
- You go first, ma'am.
- You go first, ma'am. Ready, go.

1133
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,090
Ready, go. Put it down.

1134
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,730
- That's 6. It's not correct.
- It's 6. Incorrect.

1135
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,290
- Oh, my. You are...
- Why did you ring the bell?

1136
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,700
(Don't fight.
You two are on the same team.)

1137
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,860
(Embarrassed)

1138
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,660
I think they'll have a big fight
after we leave.

1139
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,370
(They might fight after the shoot.)

1140
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,740
(In the midst of confusion,
Soon Yeon places her card.)

1141
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,740
(3 strawberries, 6 bananas)

1142
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,910
(3 strawberries, 3 bananas, 5 limes)

1143
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,440
(She's faster
than the speed of light.)

1144
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,680
- Seon Hwa won.
- Team Ok Geum...

1145
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,240
(This is exciting.)

1146
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,150
- Soon Yeon!
- Now we have two players left.

1147
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,510
(Granny Galli Status)

1148
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,580
(Ok Geum, Jum Soon, Seon Hwa,
and Tae Hee passed.)

1149
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,380
Now it's a match
between the two of them.

1150
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,490
- When we practiced earlier,
- It's okay. Take your time.

1151
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,160
- you learned this, right?
- I know, but it won't come out.

1152
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,320
- What a coincidence.
- All right. Now...

1153
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,430
(Laughing)

1154
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,330
The two of them are having a match again.
How interesting.

1155
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,430
(My, this is fun.)

1156
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,500
- We'll place cards. Just look.
- Okay.

1157
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,930
- You just have to look.
- Just look at the cards.

1158
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,270
- Go, Pil Sun!
- You've got this!

1159
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,170
- Soon Yeon!
- Pil Sun!

1160
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,840
- Pil Sun!
- Pil Sun!

1161
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,340
(The real match...)

1162
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,480
(begins now.)

1163
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,920
(The ladies are fully immersed
in the game as well.)

1164
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,860
Ma'am, Pil Sun is holding out
her hand. Is it okay with you?

1165
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,390
(She's reaching her hand out
toward the bell?)

1166
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,760
- That's okay.
- But she's holding out her hand.

1167
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,330
- That's okay.
- Is it okay with you? Okay, then.

1168
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,430
- Now, we'll start.
- All right.

1169
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,760
- Which team will win?
- All right.

1170
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,800
Soon Yeon will go first.

1171
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,600
- We'll start now.
- I know that. Don't worry.

1172
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,430
(3 limes)

1173
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,930
Go, Soon Yeon!

1174
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,510
(1 strawberry, 2 bananas)

1175
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,270
(Not only the one who flips cards,)

1176
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,210
(but the ones who are watching
are also nervous.)

1177
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,110
- No, that's not it.
- Our team rang it first.

1178
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,050
- I rang it first.
- There are seven of them.

1179
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,620
(Please calm down. It's not correct
since there are 7 fruits.)

1180
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,790
- There are 7 of them.
- That's 7.

1181
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,360
- Oh, that's right. I got it.
- Let's put these cards away.

1182
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,160
Wait. Let's take a break.
This is so nerve-racking.

1183
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,330
(Having a headache)

1184
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,430
Give me a second. My gosh.

1185
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,600
- Ring it when you see five fruits.
- Let's take a deep breath.

1186
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,300
- This is tough.
- Let's start again now.

1187
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,330
- All right. Let's start.
- Okay.

1188
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,100
(There we go!
We have 5 strawberries!)

1189
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,840
(What do you need now?)

1190
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,940
(It's speed.)

1191
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,740
(Which team will win?)

1192
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,250
(Pil Sun wins with a narrow margin.)

1193
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,350
Pil Sun!

1194
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,750
(Close call)

1195
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,960
(His eyes pop.)

1196
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,830
(We won.)

1197
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,360
- Pil Sun!
- Ma'am, you made it.

1198
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,630
(Proud)

1199
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,900
(Shout it out. "Queen Pil Sun!")

1200
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,940
(Team Ok Geum will sleep outdoors.)

1201
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,470
(Upset)

1202
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,340
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.
- It's okay.

1203
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,740
The weather is fine,
so we'll be okay.

1204
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,940
(The weather got warmer now,
so don't worry.)

1205
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,880
- Ladies, you can go to bed now.
- It was so much fun.

1206
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,750
- Great job, everyone.
- Thank you.

1207
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,950
- Thank you.
- Good job.

1208
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,290
Let's get going.

1209
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,790
Let's go home.

1210
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,020
Pil Sun!

1211
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,320
- Pil Sun!
- Yes.

1212
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,430
- Let's get going.
- You were the best. I mean it.

1213
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,390
You did a great job, really.
I was impressed.

1214
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,400
(Pil Sun's agility
still amazes them.)

1215
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,460
- She was so fast.
- Come again?

1216
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
It's dark.

1217
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,070
I guess you can't see anything
at night here.

1218
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,170
Exactly.

1219
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,100
- They must need a flashlight.
- Right.

1220
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,610
- It's pitch dark outside.
- It's too dark.

1221
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,410
You can see the stars clearly, though.

1222
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,210
(The stars are more visible
as there isn't much light.)

1223
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,640
- I see an airplane.
- It must be enjoyable.

1224
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,310
They're very energetic.

1225
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,110
I hear the sound of the countryside.

1226
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,750
- Is it the sound of frogs?
- There must be frogs here.

1227
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,020
- Yes, there are.
- I hear frogs.

1228
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,620
Ribbit, ribbit, there's a frog
They croak like this.

1229
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,020
(They sing together
while holding hands tightly.)

1230
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,390
Hold my hand too, ma'am.

1231
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,690
- Right.
- I want to hold your hand too.

1232
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,130
It's good to walk with you
while holding hands.

1233
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,130
- I haven't heard frogs in a while.
- Exactly.

1234
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,370
You can hear them
only in the countryside.

1235
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,440
Right. You can hear frogs
where there's a rice paddy.

1236
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,470
- That's right.
- Yes.

1237
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,610
- These days, it's rare.
- There are no frogs elsewhere.

1238
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,340
- They're only in a very rural area.
- That's right.

1239
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,080
- We're here.
- We'll go in now.

1240
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,080
- Let's hurry up and go in.
- It was fun.

1241
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,410
- Ma'am...
- Let's go.

1242
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,710
- Ma'am, good night.
- Let's go in.

1243
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,020
- Let's go in. You too.
- Good night.

1244
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,480
Ok Geum.

1245
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,250
- Salute.
- Salute.

1246
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,150
- Salute.
- Good night.

1247
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,460
- Salute.
- Good night. Sleep well.

1248
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,560
- Good night.
- They already set it up.

1249
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,530
I feel like I'm in my old neighborhood
in the countryside.

1250
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,400
Exactly. We used to say good night
to our neighbors, right?

1251
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,530
(When was the last time we said
good night to our neighborhood?)

1252
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,900
- I don't even remember when it was.
- I've never done it before.

1253
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,900
Right.
Let's go in.

1254
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,870
Who painted the gate?
The blue gate is so pretty.

1255
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,670
- Oh, my. Look at this.
- I can't believe we'll sleep here.

1256
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,680
This is where we'll sleep.

1257
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:58,010
- We lost. You have no choice.
- You're right.

1258
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,180
We lost. We have no choice.

1259
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,420
Oh, dear.

1260
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,920
(They all go into the house
to wash up before sleeping.)

1261
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,490
Ma'am,
would you like to wash up first?

1262
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,690
- Yes.
- Then please go ahead.

1263
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,220
- We'll tidy up here.
- Okay.

1264
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,420
(While she's washing up...)

1265
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,860
Shall we lie down here
just for a while?

1266
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,060
We can't sleep in this room tonight.

1267
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,030
(Lying down)

1268
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,660
- It's so nice in here.
- Nice.

1269
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,470
- I think it's a heating pad.
- It's so nice.

1270
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:20,370
We're supposed to enjoy this vibe.

1271
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,370
Why can't we sleep in here
when we're at our grandma's house?

1272
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,640
Who sleeps in a tent outside
when they visit their grandma?

1273
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,810
I want to sleep under this ceiling
and with this closet.

1274
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,680
- I love this vibe.
- I wanted to enjoy this vibe.

1275
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,580
I want glow-in-the-dark stickers
on the ceiling.

1276
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,520
I could watch the star stickers
until I fall asleep.

1277
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,820
That's the vibe I wanted to enjoy.

1278
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,920
When you visit your grandma
on a national holiday like Chusoek,

1279
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:44,090
you sleep in a room like this.
Oh, you're back.

1280
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,890
Did you finish washing up already?

1281
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
- Isn't it cold in here?
- Pardon?

1282
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,100
- Isn't it cold in here?
- No, it's not cold at all.

1283
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,700
It's so nice in here.
I love being in this room.

1284
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,340
We should wash up and leave
so that she can go to bed.

1285
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,640
Wash up before you leave.

1286
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,810
Do you have some blankets
to cover yourselves outside?

1287
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:58,970
Yes, we do.
They prepared everything for us.

1288
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,340
- Is that so?
- They prepared everything.

1289
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,350
- Lying down here...
- I want to stay here.

1290
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,350
(I want to sleep with Grandma.)

1291
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,480
I know.
Oh, this might hurt your back.

1292
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,750
Right. Thank you.

1293
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,750
(She pulls the mic to the front,
worrying about his back.)

1294
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,990
(It warms my heart.)

1295
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:14,960
My grandma used to pat my head,
and I fell asleep right away.

1296
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,060
Can we sleep in this room?
We could accidentally fall asleep.

1297
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,660
The staff probably won't say anything.

1298
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,260
Pat me on the head gently.

1299
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,500
And I'll fall asleep.

1300
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,170
What are they going to do
when I actually fall asleep?

1301
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,970
I can dump cold water on you
to wake you up.

1302
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,240
(Oh, no. You can't do that.)

1303
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,070
- Where's your humanity?
- Stop. Don't do that.

1304
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,280
- Tonight...
- Don't pinch him.

1305
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,880
Isn't the light
in that room working?

1306
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,780
That room? Why?

1307
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,820
- Why?
- I have to apply ointment,

1308
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,820
but I can't see the mirror.

1309
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,290
Come on in. I'll do it for you.

1310
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,120
You got hurt earlier.

1311
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,460
But your hands are dirty.

1312
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,920
She can do it, then.

1313
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,320
She didn't wash her hands.

1314
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,260
What are you talking about?
She washed up.

1315
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,200
She didn't wash her hands. I saw it.

1316
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,600
I can do it for you. Why...

1317
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,370
- It's okay. I'll do it by myself.
- He needs your help.

1318
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,300
- Help him put on a bandage.
- Shall I?

1319
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,370
Put a bandage on him.

1320
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,670
I need to apply ointment first,

1321
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,870
and then I should put on a bandage.

1322
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:07,210
I'll do it for you. Sit down here.

1323
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,310
- But you didn't wash your hands.
- Sit down.

1324
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,680
- You didn't wash...
- I washed my hands.

1325
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,450
No. You didn't wash your hands.

1326
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,350
- I washed them.
- I saw it.

1327
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,350
(I'll let you win just this time.)

1328
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,560
- Stay still.
- Please put some ointment first.

1329
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,220
I'll put it
on the back of your neck.

1330
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,960
(DinDin squeezes out the ointment
on his finger.)

1331
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,300
(Let me do it for you.)

1332
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,500
(Rubbing hard)

1333
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,630
Please be gentle.

1334
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,170
It hurts. Please be gentle.

1335
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,340
- Gosh. Be gentle, please.
- Press it.

1336
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,410
It turned red.

1337
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,870
- Why are you pressing? It hurts.
- And here.

1338
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,410
Stay still and leave it to me.

1339
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,510
It wouldn't hurt
if you just relaxed your finger.

1340
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,680
But you keep flexing your finger,
which is why it hurts.

1341
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,620
Good. It's done.

1342
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,920
Thank you.

1343
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,490
- We're home.
- It's nice.

1344
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,360
- It feels like home now.
- Right.

1345
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,590
Gosh, my legs hurt.
Aren't you tired? Are you all right?

1346
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,890
I don't usually go to bed
at this hour.

1347
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,900
I go to bed at around 10 p.m.

1348
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,130
So I'm not sleepy now.

1349
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,970
How did you feel
about meeting us today?

1350
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,370
Didn't I say I was happy?

1351
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,800
I felt like I was with my grandsons.
It felt so good.

1352
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,540
I've been happy all day.

1353
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,240
I'm very happy.

1354
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,940
I stay at home alone every day.

1355
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,610
I enjoyed playing the games.

1356
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,250
I enjoyed watching you
playing the games too.

1357
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,650
Since I'm always alone,
everything was fun.

1358
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,620
By the way,
when did you start rapping?

1359
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,120
I've been rapping...

1360
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,290
- for 2 or 3 years.
- Amazing.

1361
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:27,060
I went to Andong...

1362
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,990
and performed on stage.

1363
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,660
I started rapping and dancing.

1364
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,700
(I performed a rap song like this.)

1365
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,470
The people in the audience laughed
and clapped. They went crazy.

1366
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,970
That made me feel so good.

1367
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,640
Didn't you feel shy,
performing on stage?

1368
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,010
- I didn't feel shy.
- Impressive.

1369
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,080
I don't feel shy anymore
now that I'm old.

1370
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,150
Are there any songs you often sing
other than rap songs?

1371
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,320
- I like to sing old songs.
- Which one?

1372
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,450
Songs like
"Crying over Bakdaljae Pass."

1373
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,820
- Songs like that.
- Which song? Please sing for us.

1374
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,890
- "Crying over Bakdaljae Pass."
- How do you sing it?

1375
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:03,960
(Mount Cheongdo Bakdaljae)

1376
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,300
- Bakdaljae, I get it now.
- Bakdaljae.

1377
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,530
(My sweetheart passing Bakdaljae)

1378
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:14,040
(Passing with a basket of water
in your jeogori)

1379
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,110
(Every mountain pass)

1380
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,810
(I've cried)

1381
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:25,450
(I've shouted)

1382
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:29,950
(Until my heart burst)

1383
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:31,550
- Amazing.
- Goodness.

1384
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,090
I can't sing well now.

1385
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,360
No, you're still good.

1386
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,960
- Your vibrato is...
- In the past...

1387
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,990
In the past,

1388
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,760
I joined the climbing club
every month.

1389
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,260
I used to sing there.

1390
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,970
I didn't know how to make use
of my free time.

1391
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,030
When my work was done...

1392
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,270
(It's 9:45 p.m., her bedtime.)

1393
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:50,440
I'll sleep here.

1394
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,770
- No.
- Really?

1395
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:54,740
Look at this jade mat.
It's very warm here.

1396
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,250
- You're sleeping on the jade mat.
- Right.

1397
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,780
She's going to sleep here.

1398
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,280
- She has a jade mat.
- She'll have a good sleep.

1399
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:00,750
What's that?

1400
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,080
I'll just sleep here.

1401
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,990
- And we sleep outside?
- Right, here.

1402
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,690
- What's that?
- Is that a dragonfly?

1403
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:06,690
(A huge mosquito
came inside the house.)
(Goodness)

1404
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,390
It's a huge mosquito.
The mosquito from the old days.

1405
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,690
- It's a mosquito.
- It's huge.

1406
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,230
Let me get it.

1407
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,530
Sure, get that.

1408
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,060
- Did you get it?
- Did you kill it?

1409
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,500
- Did you see it fall?
- Where did it go?

1410
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,330
That mosquito is huge.

1411
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,570
It's right here.

1412
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,300
- Did you catch it?
- It's here.

1413
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,310
(The huge mosquito
fell in between the flower mockup.)

1414
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:24,970
(He tries shaking it off.)

1415
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,340
- Is it here?
- Goodness.

1416
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,440
(But it wouldn't fall off.)

1417
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,740
- I've never seen such a huge one.
- Let me see.

1418
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,310
- It's huge.
- Let me see.

1419
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:31,310
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

1420
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,550
Don't use your hand.

1421
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,780
Here, I got it.

1422
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,650
(Why would she pick it up
with her hand?)

1423
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,660
(Nonchalantly throwing it away
in the trash can)

1424
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,690
Goodness, she's good.

1425
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,690
(Feeling a bit embarrassed)

1426
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,330
- Close the door.
- Okay.

1427
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,960
You won't know who comes in.

1428
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,260
- All right.
- We'll take a shower and sleep.

1429
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,570
- Okay.
- Good night.

1430
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,600
Good night.

1431
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,540
(We should go to bed too.)

1432
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,610
- Good night.
- Good night.

1433
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,010
- Have a good night.
- Okay.

1434
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,110
- It has been months...
- Why won't it close?

1435
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,880
since I slept in a tent.

1436
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,150
I know, it has been so long.

1437
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,680
What kind of mindset
do you need to have?

1438
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,380
- Hold on.
- I mean...

1439
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,750
- Hold on.
- What's happening?

1440
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:10,790
(A text was sent
to each team at 10 p.m.)

1441
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,590
They told us to come to Gyeongsudang
if we are hungry.

1442
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:13,620
- Really?
- Yes.

1443
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,020
- Who sent that?
- Director Joo.

1444
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,960
If we feel hungry? I am hungry.

1445
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,860
- We should go.
- Hungry?

1446
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,230
I'm getting hungry.

1447
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,460
- Me too.
- You are hungry?

1448
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,760
- Right?
- I'm hungry.

1449
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,630
- You are hungry?
- I am hungry.

1450
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,000
Really? I'm okay.

1451
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,500
You should come with us.

1452
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,070
What's the menu
for the late-night snack?

1453
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,870
- I don't know.
- I won't go if it's not tasty.

1454
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,980
- We have another text.
- What does it say?

1455
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,350
- It will surprise us.
- What?

1456
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,550
They said it'd surprise us.

1457
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,210
- Really?
- Let's go.

1458
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,480
I'm coming because I'm hungry.

1459
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,480
- Let's go.
- Is that so?

1460
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,120
So it'll be surprising?

1461
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,190
(Then I'm coming.)

1462
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,490
(Everyone is out to have
late-night snacks.)

1463
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,790
- Goodness.
- It's a bit scary out here.

1464
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,660
What can be a good menu
to have at this hour?

1465
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,960
- Tteokbokki.
- Tteokbokki.

1466
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,330
I want to have ramyeon.

1467
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,360
It's either ramyeon
or fried chicken at this hour.

1468
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,400
- Fried chicken?
- What? They're all waiting for us.

1469
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,300
I know. It'd have been bad
if we didn't go.

1470
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,070
Let's get going
since we're all hungry.

1471
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:03,510
What is this?

1472
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,840
- You are all here.
- All hungry people are here?

1473
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,240
- What is this?
- What's the late-night snack?

1474
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,710
- What's this?
- What did you prepare this time?

1475
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,510
- We were going to sleep.
- We must've come.

1476
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,850
You would have scolded us
if we didn't come out.

1477
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:16,050
- I wasn't going to eat at first.
- What is all this?

1478
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,390
I had to force him to come.

1479
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,820
I almost fell asleep.

1480
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,290
- It's cold.
- I mean this...

1481
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:22,560
- It's cold.
- What is all this?

1482
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,990
- I'm here because I'm hungry.
- I heard that you all were hungry.

1483
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,700
We are going to leave
if we don't like the menu.

1484
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,830
I'll leave for sure.

1485
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,870
We have fried chicken
for the late-night snack.

1486
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:31,870
Really?

1487
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:33,440
- Fried chicken is nice.
- I'm glad.

1488
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,470
(Getting up and clapping
at the same time)

1489
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,940
- We mentioned fried chicken too.
- We were nervous.

1490
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,610
- Thank you.
- I love fried chicken.

1491
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,940
I don't eat spicy chicken.
It will make my face swell.

1492
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,010
- I need spicy chicken too.
- Great.

1493
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,480
This game is
for three hot fried chickens.

1494
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:47,050
- It has to be hot.
- Whenever you get it wrong,

1495
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,480
- You will remove one?
- I will...

1496
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,890
You remove half by half.

1497
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:53,660
I'll get rid of each part
of one whole fried chicken.

1498
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,690
- That's nice.
- Then it's doable.

1499
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,690
- Each part?
- How many questions do you have?

1500
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,690
This is it.

1501
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,400
It looks a bit odd.

1502
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,530
I mean a chicken has dignity too.

1503
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,830
Chicken dignity.

1504
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:10,070
(The best menu for late-night snack,
fried chicken)

1505
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,380
You have to let go of the left wing
if you get this question wrong.

1506
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,010
I'll remove it one by one
whenever you get it wrong.

1507
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,120
- You remove a part from each box?
- Right.

1508
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,250
(Taking out each part
from all the three boxes)

1509
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,890
This is a big game.
You should be reprimanded if you lose.

1510
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,450
I won't let it slide
if you get it wrong.

1511
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,490
You have to fill up the blanks
for the first round.

1512
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,590
(Round 1: Filling the blanks)

1513
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:34,130
Some of the given phrases
or sayings...

1514
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,530
will have blanks.

1515
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:38,770
You must guess
what goes in the blanks.

1516
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:39,900
- Do we say it at the same time?
- Does the order matter?

1517
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,240
How do you want it to go?

1518
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,370
- In this order?
- Yes.

1519
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,940
- It should be okay.
- You mean start from there?

1520
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,680
- Yes.
- Whoever is bold should go first.

1521
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,440
- Whoever is bold.
- I am bold.

1522
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,880
All right, let's start.

1523
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,250
Here is the first question.

1524
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,450
(The first question
for filling in the blanks)

1525
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,450
- All right.
- Okay, we are ready.

1526
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:56,080
- I don't think you'll get it.
- I'll get it.

1527
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,820
- One, two, three.
- I'm smart!

1528
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,220
- One, two, three.
- I'm smart!

1529
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,260
Three.

1530
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,790
(Filling the blanks:
Unstoppable force)

1531
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,690
- Here.
- Unstoppable force.

1532
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,790
(Correct)

1533
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,000
(Surprised)

1534
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,560
- What happened to him?
- Goodness.

1535
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,130
Can you slow down a bit?

1536
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,500
All right, next question.

1537
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,640
One, two, three. Here.

1538
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,640
- Three, two, one.
- Reforming your character.

1539
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,570
This is too easy.

1540
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,040
- It's quite fast.
- Okay.

1541
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,610
One, two, three. Here.

1542
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,310
- Three, two...
- Know your enemy and yourself.

1543
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,510
- That was easy.
- I didn't know this.

1544
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:25,680
You guys are good.

1545
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,420
We're halfway through.

1546
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,980
Seon Ho is dumb. We're in trouble.

1547
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,550
- All right, let's go.
- Let me show you.

1548
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,690
He knows many phrases.

1549
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,590
One, two, three. Here.

1550
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,920
- Know your enemy and yourself.
- Three, two, one.

1551
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,330
- Effortlessly gaining advantage.
- Incorrect.

1552
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:39,160
- Put yourself in his shoes.
- Put yourself in his shoes.

1553
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,900
Hold on. Isn't it the same one
as the previous one?

1554
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,630
One, two, three. Here.

1555
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,400
(They purposely prepared these
to confuse them.)

1556
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,900
The earlier one had this letter
as the first letter.

1557
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,770
You made this confusing on purpose.

1558
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,840
You twisted it.

1559
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,110
- How about thumb and index?
- Thumb and index finger?

1560
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,840
Then "wedding rouge"
should also work.

1561
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,110
(That was a fresh idea.)

1562
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,550
- It works, right?
- I mean...

1563
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:59,110
It can go on and on.
It could be gee, gee, gee.

1564
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,520
Your questions are dirty.

1565
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,150
I was actually flustered because...

1566
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,750
- No. He got it wrong.
- What should we remove?

1567
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:06,620
Let's get rid of chicken breast.

1568
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,090
- Let's get rid of the wing.
- Right breast.

1569
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,260
- Don't remove the wings!
- Why not?

1570
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,190
- Let's get rid of chicken breast.
- Come on.

1571
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,600
- Chicken breast is full of protein.
- Majority vote.

1572
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,400
Who wants to get rid of the breast?
One, two, three.

1573
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,770
- It's done.
- Who wants to remove the wing?

1574
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:18,870
One, two, three. Okay.

1575
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:19,900
(My goodness)

1576
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,270
- Let's remove the right one.
- Sure.

1577
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:23,970
- Get rid of the right one.
- The right one is thicker.

1578
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:26,340
Why is the right side thicker?

1579
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,710
- The left one is bigger.
- Because it's right-handed.

1580
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,580
(Laughing)

1581
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,180
- If a chicken is right-handed...
- Is this even right?

1582
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,210
Does it use more of its right hand
like this?

1583
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,990
(Got rid of left chicken breasts
from all three boxes)

1584
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,090
Let's keep going.

1585
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,020
Let's relax a bit.

1586
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,690
- Who starts first?
- Me.

1587
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,430
- Okay.
- Let's start.

1588
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,890
One, two, three. Here.

1589
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,330
- Three, two,
- "Meeting the paradise..."

1590
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:48,700
- one.
- "after a hardship."

1591
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,330
Correct.

1592
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,200
- It's confusing.
- One, two, three. Here.

1593
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,900
- Three, two...
- Unstoppable longing.

1594
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,640
(Correct)

1595
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,570
One, two, three. Here.

1596
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,110
- Three, two...
- Blue comes from indigo.

1597
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,110
(Correct)

1598
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:01,940
One, two, three. Here.

1599
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,480
- Three, two...
- All going well.

1600
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:04,980
This is too easy.

1601
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,410
- We're almost there.
- Start.

1602
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,750
Go, Se Yoon and Joon.

1603
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,050
- These two aren't very smart.
- All right.

1604
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,320
- No.
- Let's keep going.

1605
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,460
One, two, three. Here.

1606
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,060
- Three, two, one.
- This is easy.

1607
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,990
(Se Yoon, this is easy.)

1608
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,700
(Life always has ups and downs.)

1609
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,700
Arrogant...

1610
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,130
- Life always has ups and downs!
- What do you mean?

1611
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,100
(Life always has ups and downs.)

1612
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,600
Life always has ups and downs!

1613
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,000
- You didn't get this, Se Yoon?
- Life...

1614
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,910
- Get rid of the chicken breast.
- The right one this time.

1615
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,010
No!

1616
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,810
I need to get my protein.

1617
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,880
- You should go to bed!
- No!

1618
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,980
Get rid of the right wing.

1619
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,880
Why are we even doing this?

1620
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,950
(I laughed without realizing.)

1621
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,520
- Get rid of the wing.
- We were in bed.

1622
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,420
(Got rid of the right breast
from all three boxes)

1623
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,930
Can't we just ask the grandmas
to get us fried chicken?

1624
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:52,530
- You mean after waking her up?
- Yes.

1625
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,030
- This can't be too hard.
- Let's start from Joon.

1626
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,800
- All right. Let's go.
- We'll start.

1627
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,070
One, two, three. Here.

1628
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,940
- Three, two...
- From the chili...

1629
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,100
(A dragon is born in a chili?)

1630
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,610
- One.
- Goodness.

1631
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,810
- I'm sorry.
- Incorrect.

1632
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,510
(Got rid of the left wings
from all three boxes)

1633
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,150
We are changing the question type.

1634
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,310
- Of course.
- Great.

1635
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,380
This question...

1636
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,380
(It's so hard to have
a late-night snack.)

1637
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,620
- Is That Him?
- Is That Him?

1638
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,750
We'll show you a picture.

1639
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,760
You have to say the name of the man
and his work in three seconds.

1640
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,160
- The name of their works too?
- Yes.

1641
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,090
We won't be able to eat then.

1642
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,460
- We can't eat it.
- Seriously. I might have no idea.

1643
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,400
Why are we even here?

1644
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:32,170
You have to think
that you can do this.

1645
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,340
- You can do this.
- I can do this.

1646
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,540
- I can do this.
- With that mindset.

1647
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,410
- Okay. I'm rooting for you.
- What do you mean?

1648
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:39,910
I'm rooting for you.

1649
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,110
(Next time, let's sleep
when we can.)

1650
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:42,540
- I'm rooting for you.
- Let's go.

1651
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,710
- Let's go.
- I'll start.

1652
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,510
(Joon goes first.)

1653
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,320
One, two, three.

1654
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,550
- Three, two...
- Park Bo Gum.

1655
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:49,820
"Love in the Moonlight."

1656
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,050
- Correct.
- He's good.

1657
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,350
I don't know many dramas.

1658
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,690
- Joon is good at games like this.
- All right.

1659
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:54,920
- Hold on.
- I'll start.

1660
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,860
Wait. Change seats with me.

1661
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,630
- All right.
- I can tell the flow isn't good.

1662
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,230
- Me?
- I can't get it right now.

1663
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:02,300
- I'll start.
- Is that allowed?

1664
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,700
- One, two, three. Here.
- I think it'll be easy.

1665
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,440
- Three, two, one.
- Ju Ji Hoon.

1666
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,300
- Incorrect.
- "Dark Figure of Crime." I said it.

1667
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,010
- I said, "Dark Figure of Crime."
- No.

1668
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,310
He was talking to himself.

1669
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:13,640
- Okay.
- He was talking to himself.

1670
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,640
Let's pass.

1671
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,910
- I'm his friend.
- Okay.

1672
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,850
One, two, three. Here.

1673
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,980
- Three, two, one.
- Kim Go Eun. "Exhuma."

1674
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,920
- There you go. You got it.
- Correct.

1675
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,220
Let's keep going.

1676
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,250
One, two, three. Here.

1677
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,420
- Three, two...
- Cho Jung Seok.

1678
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,460
"Hospital Playlist."

1679
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:28,590
- He's good.
- Correct.

1680
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:29,760
Don't go too fast.

1681
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,360
- Why did it get so fast?
- That's right.

1682
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,130
- It was too fast.
- I'm looking at my watch.

1683
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,160
- "Hospital Playlist."
- I'm looking at my watch.

1684
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,300
- There's not enough time to say.
- Let's keep going.

1685
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,430
One, two, three. Here.

1686
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:39,470
- Three, two,
- Park Bo Young.

1687
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:40,470
- one.
- "Light Shop."

1688
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,440
- He got it.
- Goodness.

1689
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,540
(Jong Min got this one right.)

1690
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,940
(No!)

1691
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,780
Hold on a second.

1692
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,240
Please change my seat, Byung Jin Mo.

1693
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,650
I don't think this is right. Jin Mo.

1694
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:53,250
- Se Yoon.
- I can't do this.

1695
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,490
(It's the best chance
to make up for the disgrace.)

1696
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,090
Let's go.

1697
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:02,820
(They can eat if Se Yoon
gets it correct.)

1698
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,260
One, two, three. Here.

1699
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:07,800
- Three, two, one.
- Go Youn Jung.

1700
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:13,400
"Hospital..."

1701
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,600
(It's over.)

1702
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,710
(Grunting)

1703
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,580
- Wrong!
- There's "Moving."

1704
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,910
You could have said "Moving."

1705
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,680
(They failed again.)

1706
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,390
(Se Yoon...)

1707
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,190
I would have said that.

1708
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:34,890
Apologize to Go Youn Jung.

1709
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,360
I'm sorry, Go Youn Jung.

1710
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:39,790
(All the right wings are removed.)

1711
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:40,960
I can see ourselves...

1712
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,000
going home
with just one chicken leg.

1713
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,770
(They wanted to eat
at least the chicken leg.)

1714
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:47,770
We'll start.

1715
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,700
One, two, three. Here.

1716
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,640
- Three, two, one.
- Han Ji Min!

1717
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,110
Dong Yi!

1718
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,610
- Dong Yi?
- Dong Yi.

1719
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,640
(That's Han Hyo Joo.)

1720
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,510
- Here. Three,
- Ryu Seung Ryong.

1721
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,580
- two, one.
- "Along with the Gods."

1722
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,120
(They failed 2 questions in a row.)

1723
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,180
- No.
- He wasn't in there.

1724
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,350
- He wasn't in there.
- "Moving."

1725
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:06,820
He was in "Moving!"

1726
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,260
(What's wrong with all of you?)

1727
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,190
(They only have 6 pieces
of thigh left.)

1728
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,500
We'll fail everything
and just sleep late.

1729
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,200
- We just got tired.
- We got tired.

1730
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,300
I've been regretting it.
I should've just stayed in bed.

1731
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:23,670
(The alleys have turned dark,)

1732
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,440
(and the frogs are crying
for morning to come.)

1733
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,140
I thought we were going to have
a good sleep.

1734
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,450
(We're the only ones like this.)

1735
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,750
The next game...

1736
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,050
- The multiplication table.
- is something you really like.

1737
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,320
It's the Six Syllable Quiz.

1738
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:41,220
You will see the first letters
of the syllables...

1739
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,260
and each will write one syllable.

1740
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,690
- We have to write it?
- Yes.

1741
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,390
- Let's start.
- Let's write whatever we can.

1742
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,530
Just write anything.

1743
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,670
One, two, three. Here.

1744
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:54,500
(Drama: JJWSST)

1745
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,540
- Three,
- System.

1746
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,910
- four,
- System?

1747
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,170
- Please.
- five.

1748
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:00,840
- It's so easy.
- Hold it up!

1749
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,580
- It's so easy!
- Now!

1750
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,750
- Please.
- Now.

1751
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,450
Write it! Everyone wrote it.

1752
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:06,810
Hey.

1753
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,280
- I wrote it.
- Okay.

1754
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:10,690
Let's open it.

1755
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,490
- Ji.
- Jeung.

1756
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,260
- We.
- Sang.

1757
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,260
- Seu.
- To.

1758
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,460
(Jijeungwesangseuto)

1759
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,390
What is it?

1760
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,130
- Is it correct?
- It's "The Trauma Code."

1761
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,530
(They only have 3 pieces left.)

1762
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,400
(The answer was "The Trauma Code.")

1763
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,770
Honestly, you're being mean.

1764
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:29,400
- Why?
- You knew we'd get it all wrong,

1765
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,740
but you still called us
to do this for an hour and a half.

1766
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,240
You called us
because you wanted to laugh.

1767
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,840
- He's...
- "It ended early. I'm not sleepy."

1768
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,810
"Let's call these guys
and torture them a bit."

1769
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,550
- "I'm bored. Let's torture them."
- "I'm not sleepy."

1770
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,850
"Should I call these idiots
and sleep after laughing a bit?"

1771
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,390
"Should I order the chicken?"

1772
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:46,090
"Don't order it.
They wouldn't get it right."

1773
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:49,160
- You didn't even order it.
- He didn't even order it.

1774
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,360
Did you order the chicken?

1775
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,760
- You ordered it, right?
- Show us the chicken!

1776
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,160
Maybe they didn't order the chicken.

1777
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,230
We have the chicken.

1778
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,270
(Just answer the questions correctly.)

1779
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,670
Let's go.

1780
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,400
Let's start right away.

1781
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,640
One, two, three. Here.

1782
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,610
Children's story.

1783
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:06,940
(Children's story: SNW NMK)

1784
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,180
One, two,

1785
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:12,280
three, four,

1786
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,480
- Really? Se Yoon.
- five.

1787
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,650
- Write it.
- What are you doing?

1788
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,290
- I wrote it.
- I'll reveal the answer.

1789
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:20,660
I wrote it.

1790
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:23,490
- I know it.
- Se Yoon knows.

1791
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,960
No. He's confused.

1792
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,830
They both don't know.

1793
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:28,000
They're writing something else.

1794
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,030
(Children's story: SNW NMK)

1795
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:32,600
(Answer: "A Fairy and a Woodman")

1796
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,600
- Let's start with Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho first.

1797
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,710
(Did Chang Sun get it wrong?)

1798
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,270
- I feel sorry.
- Nyeo.

1799
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,340
Na.

1800
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:42,710
Mu.

1801
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:44,780
- What is it?
- Open Joon's first.

1802
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:47,420
- Joon's first.
- What about Joon's?

1803
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,550
So.

1804
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:50,620
- Lee Joon.
- What?

1805
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,090
- Sonyeowa.
- Namu...

1806
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:53,220
Namukko.

1807
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:55,420
(Namukko)

1808
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,420
(Laughing)

1809
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,590
- Was he Japanese?
- Yes.

1810
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:01,160
"Sonyeowa Namukko."

1811
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,270
(They lost the chicken,)

1812
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:08,500
(but they still got to laugh.)

1813
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,670
- "Sonyeowa Namukko."
- He was Japanese.

1814
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:11,710
Wait.

1815
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,540
- This is funny.
- "Sonyeowa Namukko."

1816
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,980
(They failed
to get even one piece of chicken.)

1817
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,410
I won't eat it.

1818
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:19,410
You wouldn't be happy
about the current situation.

1819
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:20,450
- That's right.
- Yes.

1820
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,820
A viewer who loves 2 Days and 1 Night...

1821
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,120
- Asked us to play this.
- sent us a game...

1822
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,590
- That's nice.
- with a letter.

1823
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,030
(A letter and a toy car
was sent to KBS.)

1824
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,560
- Isn't that a top?
- I think it's a top.

1825
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,260
Joon can read it.

1826
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:35,700
Okay.

1827
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,330
This is amazing.

1828
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,440
- Gosh.
- It would move forward.

1829
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,540
It's like the ones you make
in science museums.

1830
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,970
Dear Director Joon.
Hello. I'm Jung Ye Joon...

1831
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,710
in grade three of
Mosan Elementary School, Pyeongtaek.

1832
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,040
- He's a child.
- A grade schooler.

1833
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,380
- Ye Joon.
- He's in grade three.

1834
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:53,510
I'm a passionate viewer
of 2 Days and 1 Night.

1835
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,250
There's a game I prepared.

1836
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,050
It's called Vroom Vroom Race.

1837
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,190
He talks well
when he's just in grade three.

1838
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,520
He wrote various dishes...

1839
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,930
in each of the 16 boxes
in the example.

1840
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:08,860
We should pull the car...

1841
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,500
to make it move,

1842
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,370
and we can eat the dish
written on the location it stops.

1843
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:14,600
He's so smart.

1844
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:16,140
This... Goodness.

1845
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,610
Thank you, Jung Ye Joon.

1846
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,710
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1847
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,840
Thank you.

1848
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:24,950
(Shall we drive now?)

1849
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,250
Okay.

1850
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,680
We should at least eat one leg
since we've ordered it.

1851
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,350
We should eat it.

1852
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,690
We should still eat it.

1853
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:34,320
- Legs.
- Yes.

1854
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,790
- Shall we go?
- Yes!

1855
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:36,920
- Right away?
- Yes.

1856
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,030
(He starts the car.)

1857
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,690
- One...
- That was too powerful.

1858
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:40,860
(Tapping)

1859
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:44,530
(He desperately tries
to adjust the speed.)

1860
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:46,470
What's that?

1861
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:49,540
(They will earn the chicken part
written on the location it stops.)

1862
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,610
(He's excited.)

1863
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:52,540
- Left breast.
- Left breast.

1864
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,710
I don't want to eat the left breast.

1865
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:58,110
I envy you for having something.

1866
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,350
Chang Sun's will definitely be out.

1867
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,620
After two seconds.

1868
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,650
- One, two, go.
- One, two, three.

1869
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,790
That's too late.

1870
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:10,120
- That's too late.
- No.

1871
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,390
- He's got it.
- It's out.

1872
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:12,630
- It's there.
- That was too strong.

1873
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,760
He did it.

1874
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,500
- Will it...
- It's too strong.

1875
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,770
(It quickly reaches the stop area.)

1876
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,970
It'll stop at chicken leg.

1877
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:22,500
Goodness.

1878
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,940
(Chang Sun failed
to earn the chicken.)

1879
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,810
You're full of energy.

1880
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,510
- Thigh?
- Okay.

1881
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,140
Thank you, Ye Joon.

1882
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,410
(Vroom)

1883
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:33,680
It's too strong.

1884
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,220
It's too weak.

1885
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,680
- It's too weak.
- It's done.

1886
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,020
Good.

1887
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,020
- It's too strong. Goodness.
- It's strong.

1888
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,690
Goodness. It's strong.

1889
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:42,820
Ye Joon.

1890
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,390
(DinDin failed to get the chicken.)

1891
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:45,790
(Seon Ho goes for it next.)

1892
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:47,330
- He's got it.
- That was good.

1893
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:48,560
- It's too fast.
- It's too fast.

1894
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,600
It's fast.

1895
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,130
- Goodness.
- It's fast.

1896
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:52,400
Ye Joon!

1897
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,400
(Seon Ho failed to get the chicken.)

1898
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,840
Start! It's going!

1899
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,700
It's too strong.

1900
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:59,270
- Leave it.
- It's weak.

1901
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,640
It's too weak.

1902
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,310
- I think he got it.
- You got it.

1903
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:03,410
- I think you did it.
- You did it!

1904
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,450
(Good speed and direction)

1905
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:07,520
It worked!

1906
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,520
(Did he succeed?)

1907
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,550
Thigh.

1908
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,120
It's in between.
Will he get both of them?

1909
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:13,990
- Leg.
- Leg.

1910
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:15,590
(Jong Min won the chicken leg.)

1911
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,990
All the best, Ye Joon!

1912
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:21,130
You're a genius, Ye Joon! Good luck!

1913
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:22,800
(Only Sae Ho and Jong Min
succeeded.)

1914
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,300
I didn't get to practice.

1915
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,930
(The troublemaker
of the Night of Night Snacks goes.)

1916
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,200
- Which elementary school was it?
- It's strong.

1917
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,970
- Myeonil Elementary School. Done!
- It's strong.

1918
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,970
- It's done.
- It's done!

1919
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,740
- It worked.
- I did it.

1920
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,540
- It's a dud.
- Okay. A little bit further.

1921
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,880
No. Okay.

1922
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:40,210
- I did it. Okay.
- It's a dud.

1923
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,780
A little bit further. No. Okay.

1924
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,620
(Will it be a success...)

1925
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,150
(or a fail?)

1926
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:50,630
(Stopping)

1927
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:55,460
(I'm sorry, Se Yoon.)

1928
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,200
No!

1929
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,100
(Things are not working out
for him tonight.)

1930
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:06,310
(We're having a fun night.)

1931
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,040
What a shame.

1932
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,850
Shall we play...

1933
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,480
- with a part at stake?
- With the chicken we have.

1934
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,420
Please choose one player.

1935
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,620
- This is the last round.
- Okay.

1936
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,590
- We don't have time.
- Jong Min did well.

1937
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:19,750
- Right.
- Let's trust Jong Min.

1938
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,560
Let's have one person do it.

1939
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,660
If he succeeds,

1940
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,530
let us all have the part we want.

1941
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:25,990
We'll give you one each.

1942
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:27,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

1943
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:30,130
(The last round to earn the chicken)

1944
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,130
Should I start?

1945
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,070
- Stay on your toes.
- Let's go, Kim Jong Min.

1946
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,340
- I'll go.
- Go for the thigh.

1947
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,210
- Please cheer for me.
- Good luck!

1948
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:39,570
- Let's go!
- Go, Kim Jong Min!

1949
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:41,440
I cheer for you.

1950
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,080
- Here I go!
- It has to be weak.

1951
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,110
Gosh.

1952
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:46,550
Gosh, look at him.

1953
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,150
- Go for it.
- Let's see.

1954
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,020
- He's good at this.
- That looks good.

1955
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,550
- What?
- It's quite strong!

1956
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:54,420
(How will
the Night of Night Snacks end?)

1957
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,720
- Hold on. He did it!
- He did it.

1958
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,960
- He did it!
- He's so good at this!

1959
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,290
(Chicken leg)

1960
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,460
(Jong Min manages to make it stop
at "chicken leg.")

1961
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,270
Kim Jong Min!

1962
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:06,670
- Kim Jong Min!
- He's so good at games.

1963
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:07,740
(It's a chicken party for everyone.)

1964
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,700
Nice one!

1965
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,610
- Ye Joon!
- You did well.

1966
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:13,440
- We will root for you!
- We will root for you!

1967
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,680
Thank you, Ye Joon!

1968
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,740
- Jong Min is good at this.
- As expected.

1969
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:17,950
(We had a lot of fun, Jung Ye Joon!)

1970
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:19,080
He's a true star.

1971
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:20,350
Thank you for the food.

1972
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:22,050
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1973
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,520
- Thank you for the food, Jong Min.
- Enjoy the food.

1974
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,150
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1975
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,050
We would've starved
if it wasn't for you.

1976
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,460
- It's good, though.
- It's good.

1977
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,290
- It's good.
- It's good, isn't it?

1978
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,460
Ye Joon did well
to come up with the game.

1979
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,830
- Right. It was great.
- Right.

1980
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,060
We're eating thanks to you, Ye Joon.

1981
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:38,630
You should visit sometime, Ye Joon.

1982
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:40,330
(You're the best.)

1983
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,340
- Gosh, that was good.
- We finished it.

1984
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,370
We ate so quickly.

1985
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,410
(The night snack session
finished quickly.)

1986
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:46,870
(Team Sleep Outdoors has returned
to Ok Geum's house.)

1987
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,240
How are you going to sleep?

1988
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,450
(The window is opened?)

1989
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:55,350
(The window is opened instead
of the door as she might wake up.)

1990
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,750
(Opening carefully)

1991
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:01,460
(Ok Geum is sleeping.)

1992
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:08,400
(Walking quietly)

1993
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,030
(She moves.)

1994
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,330
(Shocked)

1995
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:14,440
(He heads to the bathroom
in quick steps.)

1996
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,040
(After quietly using the bathroom,)

1997
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:22,580
(he falls asleep right away
as he's full.)

1998
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:25,750
(Just a while after
the members fall asleep,)

1999
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:28,180
(Ok Geum wakes up at 4 a.m.)

2000
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,220
(She starts her day with a stretch.)

2001
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:36,160
(She stretches her legs
right after that.)

2002
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:42,460
(She has amazing flexibility.)

2003
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:46,730
(While her morning stretching
carries on,)

2004
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:51,240
(the memorable night passes by.)

2005
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:54,980
(The morning sunshine
reaches the house.)

2006
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,480
(Pil Sun's house at 7:30 a.m.)

2007
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,520
(The grandsons
are still fast asleep.)

2008
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:04,120
(They are sleeping comfortably
at their grandmother's house.)

2009
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,690
(She is up and watching the news
like most grandmothers.)

2010
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,660
(She heads somewhere.)

2011
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,600
Gosh, the blankets...

2012
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:18,730
He didn't even use the blanket.

2013
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:20,100
(The grandmother covers up
the grandsons with the blankets.)

2014
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:21,870
Oh, hello.

2015
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,970
- Get more sleep.
- Goodness.

2016
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:25,940
- Where are you going?
- Get more sleep.

2017
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,880
- Where are you going?
- The village hall.

2018
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,840
- Let's go together.
- When?

2019
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,580
Come to the village hall later.

2020
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,650
- Right.
- I'll head there on my own.

2021
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,080
It's 8 a.m.?

2022
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,720
- Let's go together.
- What?

2023
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,790
I told you to get some more sleep.

2024
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:39,950
There's still more time.

2025
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:42,190
- Let's go together.
- Let's go together.

2026
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,020
What? Did I wake you all up?

2027
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:45,090
Not at all.

2028
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:47,600
Did you sleep well last night?

2029
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,200
Yes. I did.

2030
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,830
Where did you all go at night
to return late?

2031
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:53,970
While I was in bed,

2032
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,540
- I heard sounds.
- Right.

2033
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,970
She's going to the village hall.

2034
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,240
- Really?
- We'll go and come back.

2035
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,540
No! Sleep some more.

2036
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:04,480
Sleep some more.

2037
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,910
You wouldn't have slept much
after coming in late.

2038
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,950
We'll walk you there.

2039
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:10,250
- We'll just take a walk.
- Why do that?

2040
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,650
We'll just take a walk.

2041
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:13,590
- We'll walk with you.
- Right. Let's go.

2042
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:15,420
- All right then.
- Let's go.

2043
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:18,790
(The eldest grandson
guards the house.)

2044
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:20,390
- Gosh, ma'am.
- Yes?

2045
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,400
- There are no clouds in the sky.
- Right.

2046
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:25,330
(Clapping)

2047
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,100
It's good to clap in the morning.

2048
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,200
- Clap. That's nice!
- Right.

2049
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:31,770
(She feels great after seeing
her grandsons' cute acts.)

2050
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:34,440
- That's nice!
- That's nice!

2051
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,440
(Meanwhile, the members
of Team Sleep Outdoors...)

2052
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:40,110
(don't seem like
they will get up any time soon.)

2053
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,620
(Walking over)

2054
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,120
Wake up!

2055
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,260
My goodness!

2056
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,260
It's already 7:30 a.m.

2057
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:51,360
Gosh.

2058
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,630
(A new wake-up song
from their grandmother)

2059
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,560
Just 30 more minutes, please.

2060
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,760
(Why did you all head out at night?)

2061
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,730
My goodness.

2062
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:00,400
I passed out last night.

2063
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,640
(While the youngest grandson
is still dreaming,)

2064
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,970
(Se Yoon wakes up.)

2065
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:06,570
Gosh, what a great day.

2066
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,080
(The rest follow into the house
as well.)

2067
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:11,350
(Joon enters the house.)

2068
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:13,650
Good morning.
Did you sleep well last night?

2069
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:16,120
Oh, I just checked to see
if you all were awake.

2070
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,350
Sorry? Oh, right.

2071
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,790
We woke up after hearing your voice.

2072
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,520
They won't give you any food,
so hurry up and eat before you go.

2073
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:26,230
I prepared some food.

2074
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:28,060
That's a good idea.

2075
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:31,400
We can eat secretly
and pretend not to have eaten.

2076
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:36,100
I smell something like jeon.

2077
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,510
(He never misses the smell of food.)

2078
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:40,070
Come on over.

2079
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,940
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2080
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,380
(The breakfast table is prepared
in one corner.)

2081
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,780
(Touched)

2082
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,550
- Gosh!
- Take a seat.

2083
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:47,920
It's the chive jeon.

2084
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,250
(While the grandsons were sleeping,)

2085
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:55,560
(she had her meal first.)

2086
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:00,430
(She made a pile of chive jeons
for her grandsons...)

2087
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:04,570
(and put them on a plate
after cutting them nicely.)

2088
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:07,840
(She waited for them to wake up
while watching TV.)

2089
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,010
You made this for us thinking
we won't be able to eat anything.

2090
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:13,440
Gosh, look at the Korean melon.

2091
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,610
(This is the breakfast meal
she put together.)

2092
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:16,610
(A generous bowl of rice,)

2093
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:19,480
Gosh, look at all this.

2094
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,810
(chive jeon, fresh kimchi,
and Korean melon for dessert)

2095
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:25,020
I felt worried having to
let you all sleep outside.

2096
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,690
I was reminded of that too.

2097
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,120
The seasoned vegetable? Oh, gosh.

2098
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:35,460
She prepared this for us as she knew
we weren't going to get any food.

2099
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,960
Don't get angry!

2100
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,270
(Don't get angry
about me giving them food!)

2101
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:40,070
- Gosh.
- Don't get angry!

2102
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,570
(Enjoy your meal.)

2103
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:42,600
My gosh.

2104
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,870
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

2105
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:45,910
(She serves a generous amount
of her homemade loach soup.)

2106
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,210
When did you prepare all of this
in the morning?

2107
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:49,240
(Touched)

2108
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:50,710
- Thank you for the food.
- Right.

2109
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:52,910
Thank you for the food.

2110
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,320
(He starts with
the homemade loach soup...)

2111
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,920
(that was boiled for a long time.)

2112
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,020
I enjoy having this.
(Amazed)

2113
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,250
This doesn't make sense.

2114
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,890
(They fill their stomachs
thanks to their grandmother.)

2115
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:02,560
It's making my stomach
feel so comfortable.

2116
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:04,660
It's really good, ma'am.

2117
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:07,030
- The soup tastes great.
- The soup is amazing.

2118
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,430
Where is this doenjang from?

2119
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,300
It's loach soup.

2120
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,170
Loach soup. Right?

2121
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,240
(DinDin, who is a small eater,
enjoys the food.)

2122
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,440
I think it's my first time eating
this much in the morning.

2123
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:21,110
Yes. It's refreshing.

2124
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:22,880
It's great.

2125
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,680
(Feeling proud)

2126
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:25,780
It's delicious.

2127
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:28,250
(Their rice bowls have been emptied
in a flash.)

2128
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,350
(The joyful morning passes by.)

2129
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:33,150
It feels like a Friday.

2130
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:34,660
What's wrong with your face?
Are you okay?

2131
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,760
- Yes. I slept well.
- Really?

2132
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:39,230
I think I had the best sleep
during all shoots.

2133
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,890
- Did you get six hours of sleep?
- Really?

2134
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,960
If you don't have...

2135
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,630
any other shoots after this,

2136
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:46,700
you would want to stay here
for another night, right?

2137
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,870
- Yes.
- It was that good, right?

2138
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,800
I said this to Se Yoon
as soon as we got out.

2139
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:52,570
"We should just stay here
for two more days."

2140
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,740
I took my socks and jacket off.

2141
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,040
It felt so comfortable.

2142
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,710
It was cold, but it felt just right
as I took it off after sweating.

2143
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:02,050
It feels a bit like "Hidden Singer."

2144
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:04,020
- "Hidden Singer?"
- What is that?

2145
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,190
- What is that?
- What is that?

2146
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,150
- Ma'am!
- Hello.

2147
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,260
- Hello.
- Hello.

2148
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,230
- Where do we sit? Anywhere?
- Okay.

2149
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:13,390
- Pil Sun!
- Gosh.

2150
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,260
Gosh.

2151
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,930
We finished washing the dishes.

2152
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,140
- Great job.
- Hello.

2153
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:22,670
Hello.

2154
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,970
(The cute set looks quite obvious.)

2155
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:26,140
It's so cute.

2156
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,310
The panels are so cute.

2157
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,310
What is all this?

2158
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,750
Did you all sleep well?

2159
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:32,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

2160
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,980
Today's morning mission...

2161
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:37,380
Hidden Grandmother of Friendship.

2162
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:39,190
- Hidden Grandmother of Friendship?
- Hidden Grandmother?

2163
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:40,590
It's a group game.

2164
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:42,890
The six ladies that were with us...

2165
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:45,830
- will sit behind the booths.
- Right.

2166
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:50,830
You have to find Jum Soon
out of them.

2167
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:51,930
(They win if they find Jum Soon.)

2168
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,330
- Jum Soon?
- We'll find her right away.

2169
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:55,240
You get three attempts.

2170
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:57,170
What happens if we don't find her?

2171
01:13:57,170 --> 01:14:00,970
If you fail,
you all will dive into water...

2172
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,940
- for the opening of the next shoot.
- What?

2173
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,280
- Why are you doing this?
- The opening?

2174
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,450
Why do we have to dive into water
for the opening?

2175
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,820
That's a great question.

2176
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,050
- Hold on.
- These things...

2177
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,550
We will get our hair done
at the salons...

2178
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:14,050
- Right.
- and come prepared.

2179
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,120
"Hello!" We then dive in?

2180
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,560
(You are spot on.)

2181
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,930
- Hold on.
- Is that what will happen?

2182
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,960
- That's a reasonable question.
- He's right about that.

2183
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,370
But we should be grateful
for them to be telling us that.

2184
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:28,000
- Why?
- It's better than...

2185
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,170
not knowing about it.

2186
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,640
After doing the opening
in a bright mood,

2187
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,910
I was told to choose a card.

2188
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:37,110
Two bodyguards came
and threw me into the water.

2189
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,180
(He has a bitter memory
of being thrown into the water.)

2190
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:44,320
(His hair and makeup
got washed away.)

2191
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:46,120
Those things happened often
in the past.

2192
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,750
It's great to know about it
in advance.

2193
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:51,230
Also, Ok Geum and Pil Sun...

2194
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:54,190
will give you hints
and words of advice...

2195
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,660
- as they know Jum Soon well.
- All right.

2196
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,530
- Right.
- That's great.

2197
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,870
All right. Hello, everyone.

2198
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,640
"This is my grandmother!"

2199
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,110
We are here with the ladies
of Chilgok's Utgat Village...

2200
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:08,080
under the name of friendship.
Hidden Grandmother of Friendship.

2201
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,340
I am your host, Moon Se Yoon!

2202
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:12,150
It's great to see you all.

2203
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:14,250
It's great to see you all.
Hello, Jong Min.

2204
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,150
You suit this place really well.

2205
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,890
You look like a person
who lives in the village.

2206
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,620
You look like the young village head
of this place.

2207
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:21,660
- Thank you.
- That's great.

2208
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:23,020
Was there a memorable moment...

2209
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,530
that you experienced here
in Chilgok?

2210
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:27,360
A memorable moment
that I experienced here in Chilgok?

2211
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,960
Thank you.

2212
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:32,100
I will explain the rules
for Round One.

2213
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,530
For Round One,

2214
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,700
three ladies will rap at once.

2215
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,870
- Three ladies at a time.
- This will be too hard.

2216
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:41,070
After hearing them,

2217
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:44,210
you should guess...

2218
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:48,680
in which booth our leader,
Ms. Jum Soon, is in.

2219
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,250
In Round One,

2220
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:54,250
the rappers in Booth 1, 2, and 3
will rap first.

2221
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:56,790
Please start rapping. Check it out!

2222
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:04,700
(If we're not there, it's not rap)

2223
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,430
"If we are..."
This is how Ms. Jum Soon talks.

2224
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:09,270
- Yes.
- Right.

2225
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,340
(Is the one with a high-pitched voice
Ms. Jum Soon?)

2226
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,940
(Is she in Booth 1, 2, or 3?)

2227
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,740
All right. Now,

2228
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:21,550
the rappers in Booths 4, 5, and 6
will rap.

2229
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:22,650
Check it out!

2230
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,820
(If we're not there, it's not rap)

2231
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,490
Round One is over.

2232
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:31,830
(Are we supposed to find her
only with this?)

2233
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:34,800
If we are sure
that she's in either...

2234
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,060
- Booth 1, 2, or 3,
- I'm sure.

2235
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:38,500
we will be able to find her
with three chances.

2236
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,530
- If it's either Booth 1, 2, or 3.
- But if she's in Booth 4, 5, or 6,

2237
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:41,670
we will be in trouble.

2238
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:43,100
Which booth do you think she's in?

2239
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:45,640
- I don't know.
- She doesn't fall for that.

2240
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,770
- She doesn't know.
- What number do you think it is?

2241
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,110
- Shush.
- Ms. Jum Soon...

2242
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:52,750
Why? Do you have no idea?

2243
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,350
You know, right?

2244
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:55,920
- Is she trying to tell us...
- You know where she is.

2245
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,120
- that it's Booth One?
- You know where she is.

2246
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,590
You can give us a hint.

2247
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,660
- Hint.
- No. I don't know anything.

2248
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,120
(Laughing)

2249
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:07,290
- What did you...
- They're supposed to give us hints.

2250
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,230
What did you tell our grandmas?

2251
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,330
I think she's
in either Booth 1, 2, or 3.

2252
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,330
- Let's pick these three first.
- Right.

2253
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:16,270
- We get three chances.
- You have a gut feeling.

2254
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:18,240
- We get 3 chances.
- You have 3 chances.

2255
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,140
- Okay.
- All right. Booth One.

2256
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,310
Is it Ms. Jum Soon?

2257
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,650
Grandma in Booth One.

2258
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:26,910
- Please come on out.
- Please come on out.

2259
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:31,120
If it is correct, the members
won't get into the water.

2260
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:34,550
(Who is in Booth 1?)

2261
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,990
- Please relax and...
- Oh, dear.

2262
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,760
(The grandma in Booth 1...)

2263
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,270
(is Ms. Chu Yu Eul.)

2264
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:48,200
Number one was Ms. Chu Yu Eul.
You failed.

2265
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,000
Please come over here.

2266
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:53,740
In Round Two,
the rules change a little.

2267
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,780
In Round Two, they will rap in turn.

2268
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:58,410
Please listen carefully
to their rap...

2269
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:00,650
and guess the correct answer.

2270
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,120
Grandma in Booth Two.

2271
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,220
Please start rapping. Check it out!

2272
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:08,790
(I'm a student now)

2273
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,690
- No, it's not her.
- I'm sure it's not her.

2274
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:11,990
Booth Three.

2275
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,490
(I'm an old student)

2276
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,630
There she is! Ms. Jum Soon!

2277
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,600
Ms. Jum Soon!

2278
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,770
(Is number 3 really Jum Soon?)

2279
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:21,770
Next.

2280
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:27,610
(The grandmas in Booths 4, 5, and 6
continue rapping in turn.)

2281
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,410
Yesterday, we were...

2282
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:31,550
If we guess
all five of them correctly,

2283
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:32,750
will the production crew
get into the water?

2284
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,880
- What do you say?
- That's a good suggestion.

2285
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,180
It's an interesting game of odds.

2286
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,320
Will they be able to guess
all of them correctly?

2287
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:41,820
That means the time
we spent together yesterday...

2288
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:42,960
- was meaningful.
- Of course.

2289
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,560
- Exactly.
- Please stop looking around.

2290
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:48,030
How long do you need to look around?

2291
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,000
You should make your own decision.

2292
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,400
One of the six members
will get into the water.

2293
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,400
(If they get it wrong,
one member will get into the water.)

2294
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,240
Sae Ho comes
the day before the shoot,

2295
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,040
so he doesn't get
his hair and makeup done.

2296
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,140
That isn't why I come early.

2297
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:01,540
(Laughing)

2298
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,640
I'm telling you again.

2299
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,480
All right.
Sae Ho will get into the water.

2300
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,810
- He'll get there one day early.
- He will come early.

2301
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:08,520
- Okay. Then I will...
- He will get into the water.

2302
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,480
Wait. For the sake of our team.

2303
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,490
I trust DinDin.

2304
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,890
If he gets it wrong,
I will get into the water...

2305
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:15,660
in the morning of our next shoot.

2306
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:16,990
(Deal)

2307
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:17,990
Okay?

2308
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,500
(A bonus game with a lot at stake)

2309
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:24,400
I think Ms. Jum Soon is
in Booth Three.

2310
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,570
Let's find that out first.

2311
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:26,970
Ms. Jum Soon is in Booth Three.

2312
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:29,370
We will find Ms. Jum Soon first.

2313
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:31,140
- It's obvious.
- I'm sure we're right.

2314
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:33,340
Is Ms. Jum Soon in Booth Three?

2315
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,640
Let's check Booth Three first.

2316
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,510
Number three. Please come on out.

2317
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:40,650
- I'm 100 percent sure.
- All right. Is that correct?

2318
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:41,950
We don't even need to check.
I'm 100 percent sure.

2319
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:43,780
The one that loses
will get into the water.

2320
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,550
If they guess it correctly,

2321
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:47,320
- Ms. Jum Soon!
- they can go home!

2322
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:50,520
(Ms. Jum Soon has
a clear, high-pitched voice.)

2323
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,990
(Is the members' guess correct?)

2324
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:54,090
They can go home
without entering the water!

2325
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,300
- Yes!
- Ms. Jum Soon!

2326
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,670
(Make some noise, Grandsons!)

2327
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:02,840
It turns out Ms. Jum Soon was...

2328
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,170
in Booth Three!

2329
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:07,440
- We recognized her voice.
- Please sit in the middle.

2330
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:10,680
(Obviously, number 3
is Ms. Jum Soon.)

2331
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,010
How did they know that?

2332
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:13,780
We recognized your voice right away.

2333
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:14,980
- Did you?
- Yes.

2334
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,250
We could tell right away.

2335
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:18,390
- When we heard it...
- Who is in Booth Two?

2336
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:20,820
- Wait.
- I don't know.

2337
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:21,960
Do you think we will tell you?

2338
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,520
I think...

2339
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,720
- they were well-trained...
- The grandmas...

2340
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,930
not to say anything.

2341
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:27,730
- They wouldn't tell us anything.
- They wouldn't talk.

2342
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,330
- Now...
- Let me hold it.

2343
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:30,930
- Your arms will hurt.
- No, it's okay.

2344
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,130
Ms. Jum Soon is out.

2345
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:35,100
So the penalty of all the members
getting into the water is gone.

2346
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,700
(They succeeded
in the morning mission.)

2347
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,370
What will happen now?
Will the production crew enter the water?

2348
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:41,370
- This is the main match.
- Which booth are you sure about?

2349
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:43,680
Seon Ho, you were sure
Ms. Tae Hee was in Booth Five.

2350
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,150
- I'm sure.
- Booth Five is Ms. Tae Hee.

2351
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:47,380
Let's check out Booth Five first.

2352
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:50,920
They say Ms. Tae Hee is
in Booth Five.

2353
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,150
- I'm sure.
- This is about Sae Ho's fate.

2354
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:54,450
- Booth Five.
- I'm nervous.

2355
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,690
Let's find out who Rapper Five is.

2356
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:58,120
- I'm sure about this.
- Please come on out!

2357
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,760
- Booth Five is Ms. Tae Hee.
- For your information,

2358
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,830
- I did this because of Seon Ho.
- Yoo Seon Ho's choice.

2359
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:03,630
- All right.
- We talked a lot yesterday.

2360
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:05,570
Let's find out.

2361
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,170
This game is getting
more interesting.

2362
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:10,600
(Who is in Booth 5?)

2363
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,570
(Soon Yeon)

2364
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,910
(Ms. Soon Yeon was in Booth 5.)

2365
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,180
Ms. Soon Yeon is out.

2366
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:21,820
Sae Ho will get into the water...

2367
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,550
on the day before the next shoot!

2368
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:24,750
What did you do?

2369
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:26,820
What was that?

2370
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:28,520
(The production crew
won't get into the water.)

2371
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,390
(Ms. Tae Hee, whom Seon Ho
was looking for, was...)

2372
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:31,930
- It was mixed up.
- Oh, no.

2373
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,190
- It was Booth 4.
- She was in Booth 4.

2374
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,400
(Unfortunately,
she rapped in Booth 4.)

2375
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,600
- Ms. Tae Hee was in Booth Four.
- You said you talked a lot.

2376
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:42,600
Everyone, you succeeded
in the morning mission,

2377
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,070
Hidden Grandmother of Friendship.

2378
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,340
(The 5 members are exempted
from getting into the water.)

2379
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:47,210
And Sae Ho...

2380
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:49,710
will get into the water
in the morning.

2381
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:53,450
On the day of the next shoot? Okay.

2382
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:56,350
Everyone, our one-night trip...

2383
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:59,820
in Utgat Village, Chilgok
has come to an end.

2384
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,250
- Yes.
- Time passed quickly.

2385
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,160
You will go
to the grandmothers' houses,

2386
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:06,390
pack your stuff,
and say goodbye now.

2387
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:08,960
- Then we will leave for Seoul.
- What?

2388
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,630
(Sad)

2389
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:12,600
- I'm sad that you're leaving.
- Right.

2390
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,200
- Thank you.
- How was it?

2391
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:16,600
It's time to end it.

2392
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,340
I had a lot of fun for two days.

2393
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:22,610
Now that it's over,
I feel like crying.

2394
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:24,910
- Well...
- I'm sad. Seriously.

2395
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,380
Because of your poem,

2396
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,680
we burst into tears
as soon as we got here.

2397
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,490
You are moving our hearts
until the last moment.

2398
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:33,550
Oh, no.

2399
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,560
I hope you will continue
to have a great time...

2400
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,530
- and have a lot of fun.
- Yes.

2401
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,730
We hope to see you again.

2402
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:45,130
Ms. Seon Hwa, please say a word.

2403
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:47,570
Yes. I was really happy.

2404
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,400
Of all the days I've lived,

2405
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,110
this is the happiest moment.

2406
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:56,110
I was so happy to meet you guys.

2407
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:58,040
I'm so glad that we came here.

2408
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,350
I can't express my feelings
in words.

2409
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,880
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

2410
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:04,550
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

2411
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:07,050
I didn't imagine I'd meet you
like this. I was so happy.

2412
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:09,490
- Thank you.
- It was really nice.

2413
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:12,190
The grandmothers here
are so affectionate.

2414
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:13,990
- Oh, dear.
- You must've had a hard time.

2415
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:15,500
- That's not true.
- All these people came here...

2416
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,530
and welcomed us.
It was such a nice time.

2417
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:19,700
Where else would I be able
to be treated like this?

2418
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,530
- You guys are the best.
- Yes!

2419
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:23,470
You're the best!

2420
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:25,310
I'm very grateful and happy.

2421
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:26,910
Thank you all for coming.

2422
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:28,540
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2423
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,980
Thank you so much.
I was really happy.

2424
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,280
(It was a precious memory
that they are grateful for.)

2425
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,220
- Thank you for everything.
- All right.

2426
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:40,120
Thank you for spending time with us.

2427
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:44,890
I'm so happy that I could meet
the writers and everyone.

2428
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:50,200
I feel like crying
that I have to say goodbye.

2429
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,700
- Thank you.
- Please stay healthy.

2430
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:00,240
And please continue to rap...

2431
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,310
with your cheerful energy
like you've always done.

2432
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:03,440
- Yes.
- It was really nice.

2433
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,740
Thank you.

2434
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,280
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2435
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,450
(Thank you. Please stay healthy.)

2436
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,450
We should go and pack our stuff now.

2437
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,180
I'm so sad.

2438
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:13,990
You are so sensitive
and susceptible.

2439
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:16,320
- Let's take a picture, Grandma.
- What?

2440
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,520
- Picture?
- Yes.

2441
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,390
You should keep writing poems.

2442
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:20,930
- Okay.
- It was really beautiful.

2443
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,830
- Thank you.
- I loved your poem.

2444
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:29,940
(It's time to go home.)

2445
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,700
Can I make a deep bow to you?

2446
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,840
- You don't need to.
- I want to do this.

2447
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,110
- You don't have to do it.
- But still...

2448
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:36,140
I just want to see your face.

2449
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,710
- That's what we want to do.
- Let's do it.

2450
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:40,750
- Oh, dear.
- Thank you, Grandmother.

2451
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,580
We'd like to do this
since you're our grandmother.

2452
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,820
- Thank you for the past two days.
- Yes.

2453
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,420
Please stay healthy.

2454
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,990
- Please stay healthy.
- Thank you.

2455
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:49,460
- My goodness.
- Thank you.

2456
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,290
Oh, dear.

2457
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:53,960
I feel bad that you're doing this.

2458
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:55,060
Please don't be.

2459
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:57,530
- I'm sorry.
- Grandma, please be happy.

2460
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,170
- Well...
- I'm always happy.

2461
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:02,000
- Garlic, first.
- My grandson.

2462
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,300
- Garlic.
- Garlic.

2463
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:04,440
- Please stay healthy.
- My son.

2464
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,540
- Cabbage.
- Cabbage.

2465
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,440
- My son.
- Yes.

2466
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,740
Perilla Leaf.

2467
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,440
- Grandma.
- Yes?

2468
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,510
We prepared a gift for you.

2469
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:15,720
You don't have to do that!

2470
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,820
This makes me feel bad.

2471
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:20,650
- No, don't be. We want to.
- It's from 2 Days and 1 Night.

2472
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:22,690
My gosh. Thank you so much.

2473
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:25,290
- This is a blanket.
- Okay.

2474
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:27,560
- And this is a hairpin.
- Okay.

2475
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,660
- Here.
- Is it?

2476
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:30,760
- It looks great on you.
- Oh, dear.

2477
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:33,300
- Thank you.
- How nice.

2478
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,700
- It's pretty.
- You look great.

2479
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,170
(Dancing)

2480
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:37,670
- Look in the mirror.
- Mirror?

2481
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:39,110
All right. Let me see.

2482
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:40,670
I love it.

2483
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:42,410
I love it.

2484
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:43,680
(She loves the gift so much
that it makes her dance.)

2485
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:46,280
We have to go now.

2486
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,810
(They are saying farewell
at Ok Geum's place too.)

2487
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,120
- Grandma.
- What?

2488
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,090
We'll leave this here.

2489
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:54,550
- Let's do that.
- Put mine up there too.

2490
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:56,320
We'll leave this here like this.

2491
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,160
Remember our names. He's Cheol.

2492
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:00,090
- Oh, dear.
- I'm Chang Sun.

2493
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:01,490
(The boys leave their name tags
for her to remember them by.)

2494
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,060
- Hers too.
- Yours too.

2495
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,160
- Give it to me.
- Her name tag.

2496
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,770
This is great.

2497
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:08,300
This is so cute.

2498
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:10,270
(The names of Grandma
and her three grandsons)

2499
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:11,370
It's so cute.

2500
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:13,710
Let's go.

2501
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:15,510
(They meet at the village hall
for a final farewell.)

2502
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:16,610
Grandma.

2503
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:19,680
(Tae Hee smiles
as soon as she sees Seon Ho.)

2504
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:22,150
- She likes you so much.
- Really?

2505
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:23,180
Yes.

2506
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:24,950
You're so sweet.

2507
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:26,120
(She liked how approachable he was.)

2508
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,320
- She adored him.
- So much.

2509
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,490
My gosh.

2510
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:33,730
It's so funny.

2511
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,630
When we first came in here,

2512
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:37,060
we were frozen stiff.

2513
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:38,670
- I know.
- We were.

2514
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,930
- Not now.
- After just one day...

2515
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:43,870
Staying together
for even one day makes you a family.

2516
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:47,470
(This was a special 2 Days and 1 Night.)

2517
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:53,080
(It was a warm, precious time
spent with the Chilgok grannies.)

2518
01:26:54,110 --> 01:27:01,720
(Throughout the 2 days,
they kept saying they were happy,)

2519
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:07,390
(and they valued the time...)

2520
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:12,200
(they spent with the members.)

2521
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:15,130
- This is so...
- It's sad.

2522
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,300
- Why do I feel this way?
- Why is this so sad?

2523
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:21,210
I was here for just a day,
and I'm sad.

2524
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:25,140
- We brought some gifts.
- What gifts?

2525
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:26,380
(They did their best
to be a grandson.)

2526
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,350
It suits you well.

2527
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,720
- We'll say goodbye and leave now.
- Yes.

2528
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,050
- Okay.
- We must go.

2529
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:35,360
- Are you leaving now?
- Yes.

2530
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,560
We won't meet again?

2531
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:40,030
Will we get to meet again?

2532
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:41,190
I promise.

2533
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:43,900
- I'll come back. I promise.
- I'll see you again.

2534
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,100
- When will we next meet?
- Watch your health.

2535
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,840
We can come back.

2536
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,200
When will that be?

2537
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:52,410
- Don't cry.
- Well done.

2538
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:53,910
- Don't cry.
- Okay.

2539
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:55,640
Thanks for the best meal.

2540
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,740
Don't cry.

2541
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:59,080
- Bring your kids next time.
- Go on inside!

2542
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:00,780
Go home!

2543
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:02,920
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

2544
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,320
- We're off.
- Bye.

2545
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,250
- Bye.
- Go and don't look back.

2546
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:07,520
- Okay.
- Bye.

2547
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,690
We're not to look back.

2548
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:09,890
Goodbye, Granny.

2549
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:12,290
Don't turn around. Just walk ahead.

2550
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,690
Goodbye.

2551
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,430
(Farewell.)

2552
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:20,430
Darn it.

2553
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:23,170
- Yes.
- Let's take a photo.

2554
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:25,200
One, two, three.

2555
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,710
Chilgok.

2556
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:30,080
- Chilgok.
- Okay, one...

2557
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,080
Chil for Chilgok.

2558
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,210
One, two, three.

2559
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:33,510
- Chilgok.
- Chilgok.

2560
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:34,750
(2 Days and 1 Night Family Month special
with the Chilgok grannies)

2561
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:39,250
(Chilgok Ever After)

2562
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:41,150
(Next episode)

2563
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:45,060
- What's this?
- Who's entering?

2564
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:46,130
(In shock)

2565
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:48,590
(What's this?)

2566
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:53,800
- Park Bo Gum?
- Bo Gum!

2567
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,570
- Sang Yi!
- What's going on?

2568
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,010
(Park Bo Gum and Lee Sang Yi)

2569
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:00,610
(Sang Yi!)

2570
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:06,610
(He takes over with his charisma.)

2571
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:09,950
(He brings a new order of laughter.)

2572
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:11,880
(Lee Sang Yi's so weird.)

2573
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,220
Let's have an Americano.

2574
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,820
(Cheerful Bo Gum
has an angelic smile.)

2575
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,760
(Mustard greens kimchi
made him angry?)

2576
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:19,260
(Snorting laughter)

2577
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:21,090
(Joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure)

2578
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,560
(Giggling)

2579
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,660
(I'll succeed!)

2580
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:26,570
(He even enjoys
a thrilling escapade.)

2581
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,840
(They get closer in real time.)

2582
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,800
You're excited.

2583
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:33,170
(You can't have more fun than this!)
