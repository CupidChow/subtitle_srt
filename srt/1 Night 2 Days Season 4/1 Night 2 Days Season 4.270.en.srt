1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,370
Why didn't I think of Bookku Ddoong?

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,810
I'm so disappointed.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,810
- My head aches.
- That was a close match.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,710
My head...

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,980
Sae Ho taught me something
when we ate aged kimchi...

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,350
and pork belly yesterday.

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,650
What was that?

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,320
"However hard or annoying it is,"

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,160
- "I never get annoyed."
- That's right.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,820
"That's spitting in your own face."

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,830
That's right.

12
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,830
You can grumble...
- to be entertaining.
- Yes.

13
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,130
- You know that mindset.
- Yes.

14
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,460
Tomorrow morning,
with a solemn heart,

15
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,500
with a heart full of pleasure,
instead of you all,

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,340
I will watch the sunrise
and bring back the good energy.

17
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,570
- That's great.
- Sounds good.

18
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,510
Let's say this was
the worst day of all.

19
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,040
Because of the future games,
you don't get dinner.

20
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,540
You must sleep outdoors.

21
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,010
Would you still smile?

22
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,180
I can't help it.

23
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,210
- Say I miss dinner.
- Yes.

24
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,210
I'll be hungry.

25
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,950
Then I must
climb a mountain in the morning.

26
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,950
I'll lose weight.

27
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,550
- You must sleep outdoors.
- Outdoors?

28
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,290
- Isn't it a great time to...
- Okay.

29
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,660
I can feel the season.

30
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,320
Say you mess up
the getting-off-work mission...

31
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,860
and you alone must leave at 5 p.m.

32
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,390
- From here?
- By ferry.

33
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,130
I can take all the time I need.

34
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,960
- Your manager...
- I like the mindset.

35
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,630
You went home
and put in the door code,

36
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,270
but your wife has changed it.

37
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,500
(Your wife changed the door code!)

38
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,710
How fun is that?
It's time to crack a code.

39
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,280
That's fun.

40
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,840
Let's say your wife...

41
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,910
- Your wife...
- That's enough.

42
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,450
(Getting annoyed)

43
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,980
- Stop it.
- Are you annoyed?

44
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,020
You sound annoyed.

45
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,420
Isn't that great?

46
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,420
I'll watch you throughout the day.

47
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,860
- Okay.
- Isn't that great?

48
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,790
- Wait up.
- Hurry up.

49
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,190
Mister.

50
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,630
It's getting colder.

51
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,630
What's this? Why is it so windy?

52
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,530
Is a typhoon on the way?

53
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,540
The wind's really strong.

54
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,700
(The sound of the actual wind.)

55
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,840
Will he end up...

56
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,140
getting blown to Daema Island
while climbing the mountain?

57
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,340
"Zoom!"

58
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,840
That's okay. Wouldn't that be great?

59
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,710
I get to visit Daema Island.

60
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,650
It's that time when you feel hungry.

61
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,980
- Yes.
- I'm very hungry.

62
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,580
- I'm very hungry.
- Seriously.

63
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,790
I ate so little earlier.

64
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,960
Naedo Island isn't just known
for its beautiful scenery.

65
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,630
It's also known for its seafood
that lives in the clear waters.

66
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,690
- Seafood?
- Yes.

67
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,100
There are abalones.
Abalone and octopus.

68
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,300
- Hijiki!
- And hijiki.

69
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,230
Your dinner today...

70
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,430
is prepared by a lady
who lives on Naedo Island.

71
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,570
It's a Naedo Island seafood meal.

72
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,810
- A home-cooked meal.
- Please.

73
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,470
(Full of freshness
and the smell of the sea.)

74
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,110
Since it's specially prepared
by a local lady,

75
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,280
- I hope you get to eat.
- Me too.

76
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,950
For the Naedo Island seafood meal,

77
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,750
- you play the Dinner Game.
- Okay.

78
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,450
It's called Hand Over
the Dinner Table.

79
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,790
- Hand it over!
- It's my dinner table.

80
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,860
- Hand it over.
- Hand it over!

81
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,220
Bring it in, please.

82
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,530
Byung Jin is back.

83
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,560
Byung Jin Mo.

84
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,730
(Game bracket)

85
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,400
That look of a professional.

86
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,200
"Is this the spot?"

87
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,730
"This is it."

88
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,740
"Toy Hammer Cham, Cham, Cham,"
"eat fast?"

89
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,910
I'll explain the rules.

90
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,680
- Only one person can eat dinner.
- What?

91
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,710
- What?
- What?

92
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,280
- Why are you like this today?
- You said we'd feast.

93
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,410
- You feasted at lunch.
- That was it?

94
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,720
(It's not surprising.)

95
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,180
It's a one-on-one knockout...

96
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,290
to decide on a final winner.

97
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,520
Number six will win.

98
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,390
- If they catch a balloon...
- They can win in one go.

99
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,160
You're right. You're smart.

100
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,690
Number one has to win this...

101
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,460
and everything else?

102
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,730
It's randomly allocated.

103
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,830
You'll pick your own number.

104
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,270
- Okay.
- Pick one each.

105
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,470
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

106
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,570
This is arbitrary.

107
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,210
I want to pick again.

108
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,580
- It must be number one.
- Is it number one?

109
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,180
Number six!

110
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,280
(Result of ball pick: Sae Ho, 6)

111
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Oh, dear.

112
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,590
(Lee Joon, 5)

113
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,220
Show us your number in secret.

114
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,220
(DinDin, 4, Se Yoon, 3)

115
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,290
Number two!

116
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,320
Give up early and lose.

117
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,730
Yoo Seon Ho got number one.

118
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,290
Too bad.

119
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,300
This is how the bracket looks.

120
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,430
- Okay.
- The first game is between...

121
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,930
Yoo Seon Ho...

122
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
and Kim Jong Min.

123
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,910
The game you will play is...

124
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,110
Toy Hammer Cham, Cham, Cham.

125
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,780
- Sounds good.
- Bring in the table.

126
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,480
What's this?
Do I defend with the pot?

127
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,050
Yes. Are you bad at this?

128
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,680
Do I get hit if I lose...

129
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,980
- and hit if I win?
- Look.

130
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,980
Here's an example.

131
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,950
You play Cham, Cham, Cham.

132
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,750
I hit and you defend.

133
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,890
Cham, Cham, Cham.

134
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,090
He wins because we went
different ways.

135
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,190
- That's it.
- Is that it?

136
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,830
- Okay.
- That's how we'll play.

137
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,500
- Best of three?
- Best of three.

138
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
It'll be over fast.

139
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,660
- We'll play fast.
- Okay!

140
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,530
Jong Min has the upper hand.

141
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,130
He played this a million times.

142
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,600
(He goes by another name.)

143
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,640
Rock-paper-scissors!

144
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,310
(Kim "Toy Hammer" Jong Min...)

145
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,940
(has 18 years on-the-job experience.)

146
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,080
I've never played this in my life.

147
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,710
Really?

148
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,980
You're at a disadvantage.

149
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,720
It can't be helped. It's a game.

150
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,150
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

151
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,190
Okay!

152
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,350
("Toy Hammer" Jong Min goes first.)

153
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,060
Get ready.

154
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,760
(The game takes place...)

155
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
I apologize in advance.

156
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,060
- I won't let you off lightly.
- Okay.

157
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,730
(amid strong winds.)

158
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,860
You attack first.

159
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,930
- I attack first.
- Why?

160
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,930
Get ready.
- Get ready.
- I'll go this way.

161
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,070
- Get ready.
- Focus.

162
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,370
Here goes.

163
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,440
(Jong Min attacks first.)

164
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Cham, Cham, Cham!

165
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,470
- Okay.
- What was that?

166
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,510
Cham, Cham, Cham!

167
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,080
Okay.

168
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,110
- What was that?
- That was...

169
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,840
(He lost 1 point
in the blink of an eye.)

170
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,080
(This is Kim "Toy Hammer" Jong Min!)

171
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,380
(His nimbleness surprises everyone.)

172
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,390
Jong Min.

173
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,890
- Is it one-zero?
- One-zero.

174
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,760
- It's over if you lose again.
- That was so fast.

175
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,020
How do you do this?

176
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,630
He did this a million times.

177
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,160
Cham, Cham, Cham!

178
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,060
(This attack failed.)

179
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,930
(Defense complete)

180
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,330
What's this?

181
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,700
You should hit him!

182
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,870
Come on. You're so useless at this.

183
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,940
It's confusing.

184
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,240
Cham, Cham, Cham!

185
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,210
What are you doing?

186
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,910
(This isn't it?)

187
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,810
(What is he doing?)

188
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,310
- Then I should...
- It's like watching two idiots.

189
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,610
What is this?

190
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,480
- Hey!
- If he's wrong, you hit him.

191
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,220
- Yes.
- Going in the opposite direction...

192
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,290
- Yes.
- Okay.

193
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,750
Cham, Cham, Cham.

194
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,420
- That's it.
- Okay.

195
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,620
- That's how to play.
- Okay.

196
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,330
Is it still one-zero?

197
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

198
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,060
Cham, Cham, Cham!

199
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,630
(It's the same direction,
so Seon Ho must defend himself.)

200
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,770
Cham, Cham, Cham!

201
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,030
Yes!

202
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,370
Cham, Cham, Cham!

203
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,340
(You don't get time to learn!)

204
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,580
Jong Min wins.

205
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,380
- Next.
- Does that mean I'm done?

206
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,780
You're done. Go over there.

207
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,380
Your turn is over.

208
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,280
Next.

209
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,490
(Jong Min still has
a long way to go.)

210
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,060
(But waiting for the victor is...)

211
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,060
Jong Min and Se Yoon will play...

212
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,160
eating fast.

213
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,330
There's no way you can beat him.

214
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,630
Competing with Se Yoon
at eating fast?

215
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,970
You can never win.

216
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,400
Jong Min. Give up.

217
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,340
(His mouth is the size of a cave.)

218
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,940
(He can fit almost anything
in one bite.)

219
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,780
There's no way I'd lose at this.

220
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,180
(A wall no one has scaled until now)

221
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,220
Shoot.

222
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,120
- Bring it in.
- I'm done for.

223
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,290
Shall I give up?

224
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,520
- That...
- My gosh.

225
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,560
Can't I compete instead?

226
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,160
- It's ice cream.
- I want some.

227
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Go, Se Yoon.

228
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,070
(It's ice cream, but to Se Yoon,
it's more like gukbap.)

229
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,370
My gosh. That...

230
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,040
Eat all the ice cream...

231
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,910
and whistle first to win.

232
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,540
(Se Yoon looks flustered?)

233
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,750
Can we swap?

234
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,050
I went to the dentist,
and I can't eat cold stuff yet.

235
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,380
Don't you lie.

236
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,420
- I swear.
- What?

237
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,620
- He went to the dentist.
- Okay.

238
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,020
- They're sensitive.
- You had your teeth done?

239
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,520
This one is still sensitive.

240
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
This will be too cold.

241
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,890
Is there anything
other than ice cream?

242
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,660
- My teeth are sensitive.
- Really?

243
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,530
(This is my chance.)

244
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,530
- Let's play it now.
- Great.

245
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,530
Get ready.

246
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,260
It's cold.

247
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,270
(He can already feel
his teeth hurting.)

248
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,330
- Hold on.
- If we did this next month,

249
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,400
I could've won.

250
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,840
- Let's play now. Get ready.
- My hands are so cold.

251
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,140
- My hands are freezing.
- My hands are so cold.

252
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,270
Get ready,

253
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
set...

254
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,310
It's better to have
a lot of small bites.

255
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,210
(Oh, my. This is cold!)

256
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,750
(The cold sensation
numbs his jaw joint.)

257
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,950
(The toothache pierces
into the roots of his teeth.)

258
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,820
Come on. Don't exaggerate the pain.

259
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,090
- What's going on?
- Jong Min.

260
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,360
- It's still a close match.
- Jong Min.

261
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,230
You have a shot.
Se Yoon can't eat fast.

262
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,990
- Right. Jong Min has a shot.
- What's going on?

263
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,230
Jong Min.

264
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,760
- My gosh.
- What?

265
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,670
- What?
- What's going on?

266
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,500
(Jong Min goes berserk.)

267
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,710
- What's going on?
- Oh, my.

268
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,740
- If you hurry...
- Jong Min.

269
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,180
Se Yoon, you must eat faster.

270
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,350
(Se Yoon is falling short
of expectations.)

271
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
You must hurry.

272
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,250
(Is he smiling?)

273
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,520
(Joon is laughing with Se Yoon
as he glances at them.)

274
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,200
(Director Joo lets out an evil laugh
unlike anything heard before.)

275
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,300
(So everything...)

276
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,000
(has been manipulated.)

277
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,130
One, three, five.

278
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,500
(1 hour ago, in the front yard)

279
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,970
(Director Joo
secretly contacts someone.)

280
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,340
(On the receiving end,)

281
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,150
(it's DinDin.)

282
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,780
(Could you come outside
with Sae Ho?)

283
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,980
(Don't let Jong Min see you leave.)

284
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,050
I see. Okay.

285
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,720
(As instructed,
they secretly come outside...)

286
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,260
(without alarming Jong Min.)

287
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,630
What about Sae Ho?

288
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,390
- He's getting dressed.
- Really?

289
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,660
- He'll be out.
- Will he come out soon?

290
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,330
- Come here.
- Wait.
Don't talk.

291
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,500
- Close the door.
- It's closed.

292
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,100
Guys.

293
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,800
- Listen up.
- Okay.

294
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,740
We will soon play the Dinner Game.

295
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,070
It will be 1 against 5.

296
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,640
Here's your mission.
You must rig the game...

297
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,750
to let Jong Min win first place
without realizing it.

298
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,550
If you succeed, you'll be winners
and enjoy your dinner.

299
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,320
(It's the highlight...)

300
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,190
(of 6 Jong Mins Special,
continuing from last week.)

301
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,390
(The goal of these five members...)

302
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,430
(is making sure Jong Min win.)

303
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,630
But if Jong Min loses...

304
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,200
or figures out that
you're letting him win,

305
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,400
- you will have failed your mission.
- Okay.

306
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,070
- Okay.
- Take this.

307
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,570
Number one.

308
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,740
We came up with
an arbitrary table for the games.

309
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,880
(Actually, they all had
their own ball in advance.)

310
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,910
You take number three, Se Yoon.

311
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,910
All right. So, from the ball box,

312
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,280
Jong Min will be bound
to draw number two.

313
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,590
(When Jong Min
was drawing his ball,)

314
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:20,520
(the members were hiding
their balls in their hands.)

315
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,160
Keep the ball with you safely.

316
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,730
(They must pretend to have drawn
the ball from the box.)

317
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,570
You must act
as if you drew it from the ball box.

318
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,570
I see.

319
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,930
(They must put the ball
in the box to pretend.)

320
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,470
He'll never figure it out.

321
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,940
(He'll never figure it out.)

322
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,810
(Se Yoon stuck out his tongue
behind Jong Min.)

323
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,480
- I want to eat dinner!
- Okay.

324
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,450
(He's clueless even when Sae Ho
makes a V with his fingers.)

325
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,650
What do I do with Cham, Cham, Cham?

326
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,920
- Copy Jong Min.
- Like this.

327
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,980
(You must copy Jong Min.)

328
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,220
Cham!

329
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,160
(That's how he ended up
desperately acting like an idiot.)

330
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,960
I'm so envious.

331
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,630
- It wasn't obvious, right?
- No.

332
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,190
- My gosh. I see.
- So...

333
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,330
That was super smooth.

334
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,330
(That was super smooth.)

335
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,770
Se Yoon can't eat fast.

336
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,900
(He's putting on
all kinds of performances...)

337
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,700
(until Jong Min finishes it.)

338
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,440
No, Jong Min. You got this.

339
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,570
- What's going on?
- Jong Min.

340
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,280
(Jong Min starts balling up
the ice cream.)

341
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,340
- It's still a close match.
- He can't eat it.

342
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,350
Jong Min.

343
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,510
(He planning
to finish it in one go.)

344
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,820
(Laughing)

345
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,620
- You can eat that in one bite?
- You have a shot.

346
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,050
You have a shot.

347
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,390
(Taking a big bite)

348
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,560
(Spitting it back out)

349
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,760
Jong Min, trust me. Take your time.

350
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,960
He can't eat it.

351
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,830
(He's even pretending
to lick the ice cream.)

352
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,700
(Why can't Se Yoon eat?)

353
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,970
That's the last bite.

354
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,770
- Jong Min finished it.
- Is that his last bite?

355
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,580
- Oh, no!
- Did he finish it?

356
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,140
No. He didn't finish eating it yet.

357
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,410
- Hey.
- He didn't finish it yet.

358
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,150
Come on, put it in there.

359
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,820
My gosh, this is fun.

360
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,620
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

361
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,620
Jong Min succeeded!

362
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,200
(We also succeeded!)

363
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,900
- What?
- He scored a big one.

364
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,370
That was a big score.

365
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,000
- What is this?
- I scored a big one!

366
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,200
- Come on.
- Hey.

367
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,500
I can't believe
I lost the food match.

368
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,510
(Passionately acting to the end)

369
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,840
- My gosh.
- This makes no sense.

370
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,610
- Let's go to the next round.
- This makes no sense.

371
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,710
- Jong Min.
- Next round.

372
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,610
You must read
a complicated sentence next.

373
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,680
He'll probably lose this one.

374
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,950
Jong Min, should I just advance?
Or do you want to try?

375
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,850
- Let's do it. Let's battle it out.
- Jong Min...

376
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,850
Jong Min, you just ate ice cream.
I bet it will be harder.

377
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,220
No, I'm feeling great right now.

378
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,890
- Give us the sentence.
- You really want to do this?

379
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,390
- How arrogant you are.
- Jong Min.

380
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,730
Here's the sentence.

381
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,660
- It's like battling against Usain.
- I hope Jong Min wins.

382
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,300
- This?
- Can I look at the sentence?

383
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,000
- Let me see it.
- They have to read it once?

384
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,740
- My gosh.
- He can't do it.

385
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,440
This is the end for you, Jong Min.

386
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,170
- This is it.
- But...

387
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,470
The passage we prepared
won't be easy to read.

388
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,340
All right.

389
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,740
(Chaffpopkin
and Chischyakov Brothers...)

390
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,210
(Munch-munched on potato chips...)

391
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,850
(Hambigi-hamburger,
Hambugatti-hambugi-on-and-on...)

392
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,320
(There are many traps
throughout the passage.)

393
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,350
My gosh.

394
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,850
- Gosh, this is hard.
- It's...

395
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,020
It will be hard for DinDin too.

396
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,090
DinDin.

397
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,930
Will you cut
Jong Min's pronunciation some slack?

398
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,290
Fine. I'll cut him some slack.

399
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,760
- It doesn't matter.
- Really?

400
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,300
I can finish this in ten seconds.

401
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,530
- How many? One?
- I'll allow it.

402
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,430
- Three?
- Three? That's a lot.

403
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,000
He'll probably make 3 mistakes
in the 1st sentence.

404
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,940
He can keep going
until he makes three mistakes.

405
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,940
Yes.

406
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,810
Personally, I want Jong Min to win.

407
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,210
- Jong Min, you got three passes.
- Okay.

408
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,210
Then Jong Min can keep going
until he makes three mistakes.

409
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,210
- Okay.
- Yes.

410
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,850
- Okay! I have a shot then.
- To be honest...

411
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,720
You can keep reading
until you make three mistakes.

412
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,980
- Okay.
- Yes.

413
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,050
- Let's begin. Get ready,
- I'll time you precisely.

414
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,490
set...

415
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,120
"Chaffpopkin
and Chischyakov Brothers..."

416
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,730
"were watching the movie,
'Power Weight,' while playing..."

417
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,830
"Rachmaninoff's piano concerto
in the background."

418
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,930
(This is making us nervous.
Why is he reading it so well?)

419
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,430
"They munch-muncked..."

420
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,430
- Darn it.
- My gosh.

421
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,140
(He awkwardly stutters.)

422
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,200
"Chaffpopkin..."

423
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,870
(DinDin, it's too obvious.)

424
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,910
"Chaffpopkin..."

425
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,080
(But Jong Min is
just happy about it.)

426
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,680
(DinDin reads the passage again
while acting flustered.)

427
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,080
"Rachmaninoff's piano concerto
in the background."

428
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,550
"They munch-munched
on potato chips."

429
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,050
Muck...

430
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
(He purposely pronounced the word.)

431
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,450
- What?
- "Chaffpopkin..."

432
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,450
- Hey, it's over.
- "Chaffpopkin..."

433
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,290
(Jong Min could suspect him
if he underperforms too obviously.)

434
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,030
(Seon Ho is showing
DinDin the time.)

435
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,530
(Jong Min is so focused that
he doesn't even look at DinDin.)

436
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,000
"When they wanted more food,"

437
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,530
"Hambugauga, Hambigi..."

438
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,000
(He doesn't even try to hide
glancing at the watch.)

439
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,710
"They ate the hamburger..."

440
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,470
"Hambugatti-hambugi-on-and-on burgers."

441
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,110
- What?
- It took 50 seconds.

442
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,440
(DinDin took 50 seconds.)

443
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,410
This is crazy.

444
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,210
What happened?

445
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,950
I can't seem to pronounce
"munch" well.

446
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,850
- He's nervous.
- Hey, this is anyone's game now.

447
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,890
- He's nervous.
- This is anyone's game now.

448
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,890
Anything could happen now.

449
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,990
No, I just need to focus.

450
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,660
- I can read one letter at a time.
- My gosh.

451
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,690
All right. Let's begin.

452
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,190
- Even machines...
- You can make up to three mistakes.

453
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,660
- You can make up to three mistakes.
- Okay.

454
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,930
All right. Let's begin. Get ready,

455
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,830
- set...
- This is so hard.

456
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,770
All right.

457
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,470
"Chaffpopkin..."

458
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,140
(Chaffpopkin
and Chischyakov Brothers...)

459
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,910
"and Chischyakov Brothers..."

460
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,540
"were watching the movie,
'Power Weight,'"

461
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,640
"while playing..."

462
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,310
(1 mistake was allowed
and deducted for Jong Min.)

463
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,020
"Rachmaninoff's piano concerto..."

464
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,150
- He's good.
- "in the background."

465
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,390
"They munch-munched
on potato chips."

466
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,020
(He's even drooling
to win this game.)

467
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,290
"On potato chips."

468
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,560
- Okay.
- Two.

469
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,860
(2 mistakes were allowed
and deducted for Jong Min.)

470
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,160
- Okay.
- "On potato chips."

471
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,000
"When they wanted more food,
they went to a burger joint."

472
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,530
(He's facing a crisis.)

473
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,670
"Hambugi-hamguk..."

474
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,100
(Please win this match.)

475
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,370
"Hambukeo-hambuksddaks,"

476
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,010
"Hamburg-hambugauga..."

477
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,110
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

478
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,010
"Hambigi-hamburger..."

479
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,310
(Jong Min's pronunciation
goes into another level.)

480
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,150
(Will the scammers be able
to help Jong Min win the game?)

481
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,990
"Hambigi-hamburger..."

482
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,460
"Hambugatti-hambugi-on-and-on burgers."

483
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,490
(Shocked)

484
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,130
- What?
- No way!

485
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,760
(Jong Min won!)

486
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,060
- How many mistakes did he make?
- What was that?

487
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,100
- What's happening?
- Two.

488
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,400
- It took him 41 seconds.
- My gosh.

489
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,430
- My gosh.
- How many seconds?

490
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,440
Forty-one seconds.

491
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,900
(He's awfully happy about winning.)

492
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,370
- I scored a big one.
- I can't believe this.

493
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,370
I don't believe this.

494
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,410
Hey, the remaining two games...

495
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,440
- are solely about luck.
- The passage...

496
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,680
- He could get lucky then.
- My gosh.

497
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,010
I couldn't pronounce, "munch."

498
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,050
Jong Min won the game,
Read Complicated Sentences.

499
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,280
- Yes!
- Kim Jong Min.

500
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,720
(I'm Kim Jong Min.)

501
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,650
- Jong Min.
- You won three in a row!

502
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,590
- You made it to the semifinal.
- You won three in a row!

503
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,790
(You might win the whole thing
at this rate.)

504
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,530
(Laughing)

505
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,530
- My gosh.
- Here.

506
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,400
Jong Min has two games to go.

507
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,830
- It's about luck. What's remaining?
- Yes.

508
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,330
Random Header
and Catching Water Balloons.

509
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,330
- I see.
- Okay.

510
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,900
This is all about luck. No way.

511
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,570
- He has momentum now.
- This is about luck.

512
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,000
The fourth game is Joon's.

513
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,310
The game is called Random Header.

514
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,310
- What?
- What's that?

515
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,180
One of them is a regular soccer ball
and the other is filled with water.

516
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,210
The member who chooses
the regular soccer ball will win.

517
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,820
It's just about luck.

518
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,450
I wish I had one
that required my skills.

519
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,690
- Gosh.
- Jong Min.

520
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,490
- My gosh, he was fast.
- I can't believe you won.

521
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,090
Your pronunciation...

522
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,820
How should we do this?

523
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,390
Why don't you grab the ball
with water to let Joon know?

524
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,030
- So I'll grab the one with water?
- Okay.

525
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,300
Whoever picks that one
will lose, right?

526
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,660
- Yes, that's right.
- Okay.

527
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,930
- We should let Joon know.
- Okay.

528
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,770
(He's watching them.)

529
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,970
(What are they talking about?)

530
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,570
- Then I'll grab it.
- You grab the one with water.

531
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,340
That was the best performance
of him I've seen so far.

532
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,440
- It's been three years.
- But...

533
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,640
it was so fast.

534
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,910
Joon. My gosh,
you might not win this one.

535
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,950
- This is about luck.
- Yes, it's solely about luck.

536
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,510
- All right.
- How will we do it?

537
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,120
Pick my ball.

538
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,180
- Pick your ball?
- Yes.

539
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,820
- Pick whatever I'm holding.
- Okay.

540
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,390
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

541
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,290
All right, everyone. Gather around.

542
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,190
- What is this? Oh, my.
- Gosh.

543
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,430
I don't think we can touch them.

544
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,130
- We can't touch them?
- Okay.

545
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,900
- Who will throw the ball?
- Let's go.

546
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,600
- Gosh, this is heavy.
- But...

547
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,670
- Should we do it?
- The two of them?

548
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,100
(Observing intently)

549
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,870
Do you want to pick first?
Or should I?

550
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,400
- My gosh.
- Joon.

551
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,610
- The water...
- What do you want?

552
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,840
I'll pick first.

553
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,480
I have to hold it no matter what.

554
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
(This isn't what I had in mind.)

555
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,910
- The two of you have to do it?
- Let me pick first.

556
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,010
- No.
- This one.

557
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,510
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

558
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,780
Rock-paper-scissors.

559
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,850
- Ready or not,
- Ready or not,

560
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,880
- rock-paper-scissors.
- rock-paper-scissors.

561
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,890
(Please win, Joon.)

562
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,920
- Ready or not,
- Ready or not,

563
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
- rock-paper-scissors.
- rock-paper-scissors.
Okay!

564
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,060
(Joon gets to pick first.)

565
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,890
(He makes it so obvious
that he's happy to pick first.)

566
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,430
But picking first won't necessarily
give you an advantage.

567
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,470
Why are you so happy
about winning rock-paper-scissors?

568
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,670
- Right.
- What's the point? My gosh.

569
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,740
- You can look at the balls.
- Right.

570
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,340
(Well, something is off.)

571
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,570
I doubt you can tell
which one it is.

572
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,240
Even I can't tell.

573
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
(Feeling insecure)

574
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,110
I need to check their acting.

575
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,180
(They begin before
Jong Min suspects them further.)

576
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,080
(Joon must pick Sae Ho's ball
no matter what.)

577
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,890
(Dropping)

578
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,560
(Still passionately acting
during the game)

579
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,460
(Jong Min,
this is the ball you want.)

580
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,430
- Wait.
- Hey, this is so obvious!

581
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,030
(This is so obvious!)

582
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,030
- What?
- Sae Ho, you're making it obvious.

583
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,260
- What?
- My gosh.

584
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,270
(Jong Min thinks
Sae Ho is holding the real ball.)

585
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,330
That's...

586
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,970
Then I'll pick Sae Ho's ball.

587
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,000
Me too.

588
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,340
I won rock-paper-scissors.

589
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,610
(Luckily,
Joon has the right to pick first.)

590
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,610
- Sorry.
- I'll let you switch the balls.

591
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,980
(You two switch the balls.)

592
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,180
(An unexpected offer)

593
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,310
I'll let you switch.

594
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,310
(Flustered)

595
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,880
- Sure. Should we switch?
- I'm fine.

596
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,220
(Frozen)

597
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,250
Switch.

598
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,320
- Are you sure?
- Yes, go ahead.

599
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
(What do I do?)

600
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,620
(If they switch, Jong Min will lose
with the water ball.)

601
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,690
(If they don't,
Jong Min will suspect them.)

602
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,690
Are you sure?

603
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,730
(Anxious)

604
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,190
(The biggest crisis
for the scammers)

605
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,900
But if they switch,

606
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,270
there's no point for Joon
to have chosen Sae Ho's ball.

607
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,470
- Right.
- He's smart.

608
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,500
- Right.
- What are you talking about?

609
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,240
- Right.
- Yes.

610
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,840
I'll go with Sae Ho's ball.

611
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,210
- Shall we?
- Okay.

612
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,480
- Throw them.
- One, two, three!

613
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
(Thud)

614
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,250
- What?
- What?

615
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,350
What just happened?

616
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,250
(Wait, did I win again?)

617
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,050
- What?
- Jong Min wins!

618
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,220
What?

619
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,720
(I don't mind
even if my skull shakes.)

620
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,090
(Kim Jong Min wins
4 games in a row!)

621
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,090
- What?
- My gosh.

622
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,530
- I was holding the water ball.
- Really?

623
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,160
- Are you okay?
- This is crazy.

624
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,230
(What a relief.
He didn't figure it out.)

625
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,570
Jong Min will go to the final match.

626
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,970
- I won again.
- How come I failed to see that?

627
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,140
- This is crazy.
- Jong Min keeps winning.

628
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,140
(Kim Jong Min is an idiot.)

629
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,240
- Jong Min.
- You'll make history today.

630
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,710
-You'll make history today.
- I thought...

631
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,210
- mine was the real one.
- What if he really makes history?

632
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,810
You know what?
Since he made it this far,

633
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,910
I think it's only fair
that Jong Min wins the final game.

634
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,150
- I agree.
- Okay.

635
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,680
I'm going up against him again.

636
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,220
- Gosh, Jong Min.
- It's the final game.

637
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,990
- Jong Min is on a roll.
- Gosh, Jong Min.

638
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,160
- Gosh, Sae Ho.
- No.

639
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,060
I bet Sae Ho will be furious
if he loses this one.

640
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,120
- What?
- What is this?

641
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,730
My gosh, I've come so far.

642
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,860
- Jong Min. For your last game,
- You started...

643
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,030
you'll go up against Sae Ho.

644
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,900
(The final match is
between Jong Min and Sae Ho.)

645
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,470
You must catch water balloons.

646
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,500
- I see.
- Again?

647
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,870
They have to catch the balloons
with a bucket on their head.

648
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,100
- Bring them in.
- Gosh, this is a hard one.

649
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,210
This one is hard.

650
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,440
If you get soaked from this game,

651
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,780
but don't get to eat,
it will be the worst.

652
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,880
It will be the worst if I lose.

653
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,210
I would've worked hard for nothing.

654
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,110
Jong Min, have you won
this many games on the show?

655
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,550
- No.
- This is crazy.

656
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,520
Whoever loses will be furious.

657
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,990
Whoever loses...

658
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,520
Okay.

659
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,690
(The last hurdle for the scammers)

660
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,920
Jong Min,
should I throw them for you?

661
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,620
It doesn't matter. Anyone can do it.

662
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,790
- I want Joon to do it for me.
- Okay.

663
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,360
Like this.

664
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,200
Sae Ho,
I'm good at throwing balloons.

665
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,000
Here's what you need
to be careful with.

666
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,440
Let's say you caught the balloons.

667
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,300
If you lean forward to catch more,
you'll drop all of them.

668
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,610
- Really? Okay.
- Yes.

669
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,670
Let's begin!

670
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,110
- Let's go.
- They must be in the basket.

671
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,680
- Seon Ho, are you ready?
- Jong Min.

672
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,850
- The second round.
- Just throw it in here.

673
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,310
- Okay.
- Jong Min, let's make a miracle.

674
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,580
- What's going on?
- Get ready...

675
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,120
- Gosh.
- Hey, what was that?

676
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,290
(Both of them fail to catch
the first balloon.)

677
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,920
Hey, throw it better! Aim it better.

678
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,990
Wait.

679
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,730
Great.

680
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
Gosh, hey!

681
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,030
- I got it.
- Okay.

682
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,900
(He accidentally catches it
while looking at Jong Min.)

683
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,930
- I got it.
- Okay.

684
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,930
- What?
- Okay.

685
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,300
- My gosh.
- Let's go. Okay.

686
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,640
(Jong Min has already obtained
3 water balloons.)

687
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
- Okay.
- Great.
(But...)

688
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,710
- It went in!
- Okay.

689
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,880
- Jong Min.
- It must be visible. Nice.

690
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,180
- There you go.
- You're tied.

691
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,210
(Sae Ho ties the game
with 3 balloons?)

692
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,780
(But why is Sae Ho good
at catching the balls?)

693
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,920
(Why are they tied?)

694
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,050
(To make it worse...)

695
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,060
(Popping)

696
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,820
- There you go.
- You're tied.

697
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,230
(Sae Ho takes the lead now.)

698
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,860
- Hey, Sae Ho is winning.
- Hey.

699
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,900
- You got four.
- Gosh.

700
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,730
(If Sae Ho wins,
their scam will not work.)

701
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,530
- You have 30 seconds left.
- It must be visible.

702
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,370
(Sae Ho, get a grip!)

703
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,370
Jong Min.

704
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,010
- Who's winning?
- Jong Min.

705
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,370
Gosh, you're tied.

706
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,570
(Special measures must be taken.)

707
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,740
- It must be visible.
- Hey, Sae Ho is winning.

708
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,080
- He's winning.
- You got four.

709
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
(Thumping)

710
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,510
If you lean forward to catch more,

711
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,910
- you'll drop all of them.
- Really? Okay.

712
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,350
(I can drop all of them.)

713
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,650
- You're so good!
- Gosh, what? You're so good.

714
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,020
You're so good.

715
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,320
- What?
- My gosh. They popped.

716
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,390
Stay focused!

717
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,890
Crouch down when you catch the ball.

718
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,960
- There you go. Okay.
- There you go.

719
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,030
Crouch down when you catch the ball.

720
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,030
- There you go. Okay.
- There you go.
Darn it.

721
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,560
(Pushing off the balloon
out in the open)

722
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,730
Sae Ho, you dropped three!

723
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,730
That's crazy. What's he doing?

724
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,000
- Come on!
- Jong Min.

725
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,200
Jong Min.

726
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,300
- Gosh, come on!
- Oh, my.

727
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,000
- Hey!
- Jong Min.

728
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,800
- Everyone, this is Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

729
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,210
Jong Min!

730
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,570
- At this moment...
- Gosh.

731
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,180
- Jong Min, stay focused.
- My gosh.

732
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,580
(A cool trick for the fans)

733
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,850
It must be visible.

734
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,280
Hey, you need to throw it like this!

735
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,320
Joon, throw it like this!

736
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,420
(Doing a half-hearted job)

737
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,920
- Joon.
- Hey, he's so good.

738
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,990
- Like this.
- He's so good.

739
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,390
- What? He's so good.
- What?

740
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,560
- He's so good.
- He's so good.

741
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,930
- Come on, Joon.
- I got it.

742
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm basically winning this for him.

743
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,170
- The basket is heavy now.
- Joon. This way.

744
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,000
- Three, two,
- Come on.

745
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,270
- one.
- Wait.

746
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,470
- Jong Min.
- My gosh.

747
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,010
- This is so heavy!
- Gosh.

748
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,440
It's so heavy!

749
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,440
(Congratulations, Jong Min.)

750
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,250
- He...
- He's the champion today.

751
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,680
- He's the champion today.
- All right.

752
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,150
Who throws water balloons like this?

753
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,120
- Gosh.
- Let's play one more round.

754
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,190
- Jong Min.
- No.

755
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,590
- I helped him win.
- My gosh. It's so funny.

756
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,290
(He's so thrilled.)

757
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,060
The final winner
of the Hand Over the Dinner Table...

758
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,730
- is Kim Jong Min.
- My gosh.

759
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,000
(The 5 consecutive winning streak
can't be watched without tears.)

760
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,100
- What?
- All right, everyone.

761
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,730
- My gosh, this is crazy.
- So...

762
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,940
As per the result
of the Dinner Game,

763
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,910
the Naedo Island seafood meal...

764
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,470
will be offered to everyone...

765
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,940
- but Jong Min.
- Yes!

766
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,910
- Okay!
- Yes!

767
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,010
- Yes!
- Okay!

768
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,050
What?

769
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,180
What's going on?

770
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,650
(The scammers successfully rig
the games to help Jong Min win.)

771
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,320
- Thank you, Jong Min.
- The basket

772
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,830
- What did you say?
- At my side

773
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,560
I go out to harvest vegetables

774
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,030
What are you doing?

775
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,730
How come I can't have dinner?

776
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,600
- You were...
- Watch the show for your answer.

777
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,670
The real Dinner Game for today...

778
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,740
- was Scam Jong Min to Win.
- Right.

779
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,970
What is this?

780
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,210
Jong Min, during the games,
if you said...

781
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,980
"What is this? Did you plan this?"
Then we would've lost.

782
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,780
- You didn't say a word of that.
- Gosh, it was a bit odd...

783
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,920
because there was no way
he would lose a food match to me.

784
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,090
(On hindsight,
he was the star of all the games.)

785
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,990
(He miraculously won
5 games in a row.)

786
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,100
It's so heavy.

787
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,430
- I was like, "What's going on?"
- Everything was planned.

788
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,230
- So...
- It was the same with the passage.

789
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,570
So there were many games.

790
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,930
Which game made you the happiest?

791
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,000
- The reading one.
- The reading one.

792
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,240
(It was
when he won the reading game.)

793
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,810
"I can't believe
I pronounced them correctly."

794
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,680
- I knew I'd lose to DinDin.
- Yes.

795
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,880
All right.

796
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,710
- Let's take a short break.
- Yes.

797
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,320
- Then you'll have your dinner.
- Okay.

798
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
- Yes.
- Let's give him some food.

799
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,050
- Good job.
- Yes.

800
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,250
(Feeling bitter)

801
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,660
It would've made no sense.

802
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,160
I knew something was off.

803
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,390
(I knew something was off.)

804
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,960
(Night falls on Naedo Island.)

805
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,060
(Gosh, this is amazing.)

806
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,130
This is amazing.

807
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,870
They separated our tables.
What a pity.

808
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,900
(Then there's Jong Min's table.)

809
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,370
- What's this?
- Hold on.

810
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,310
- That looks so good.
- It's hijiki rice.

811
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,310
(A collection of seasonal seafood
from Naedo Island)

812
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,110
(Its appearance alone
grabs your attention.)

813
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,080
- Are they cockles?
- Are they Pacific geoducks?

814
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,820
- What are those?
- Gosh.

815
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,820
My gosh. Look at this.

816
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,290
(Horse clams look similar
to Pacific geoducks.)

817
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,120
(Freshly caught mackerels
were used for this dish.)

818
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,890
- Braised mackerels.
- It smells so good.

819
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,990
- Braised mackerels.
- My gosh.

820
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,000
(It's the ingredient
the members gathered themselves.)

821
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,430
(It's made
with big and plump hijiki.)

822
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,370
(Hijiki rice and seasoned hijiki)

823
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,570
(Daesuri gastropods)

824
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,710
(And there's homemade kimchi
from a resident of the island.)

825
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,640
(The Naedo Island meal offers
a taste of Geoje's ocean.)

826
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,280
- I love it.
- My gosh.

827
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,810
Gosh, this must be soup.

828
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,020
I feel bad for Jong Min.

829
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,150
How could so many of you
do this to me?

830
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,350
You will be severely condemned.

831
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,890
We'll be condemned after eating.

832
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,760
- We will be after eating.
- Let us eat first.

833
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,130
You worked very hard today.
Please enjoy your meal.

834
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

835
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,000
- May we start?
- Go ahead.

836
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,230
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

837
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,930
I should add the sauce here.

838
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
- Let's mix it.
- It was an amazing fight.
The sauce...

839
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,570
I love this very much.

840
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,370
I feel bad for Jong Min.

841
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,070
- By the way...
- It's very...

842
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,140
- My goodness.
- Try this.

843
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,210
Look at the meat.

844
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,380
(Flatfish)

845
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,020
Try it.

846
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,490
(There's 1 man
staring at 5 happy people.)

847
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,620
Jong Min...

848
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,060
(Staring, feeling pressured)

849
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
Goodness.

850
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,530
Can you look at the wall instead?
You're making me uncomfortable.

851
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,130
I can't eat well
while making eye contact.

852
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,430
- I'm sorry.
- Seriously.

853
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,860
(It's his fault
for not being suspicious.)

854
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,930
(Eating)

855
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,140
Gosh, this sauce is...

856
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,840
Can you describe the taste,
at least?

857
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,340
First of all,
the texture is excellent.

858
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,470
Right.

859
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,480
It's crunchy.

860
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,510
You know sauces that are good
because they're simple?

861
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,510
Yes.

862
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,910
The sauce isn't too fancy.
It's just simple.

863
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,250
- I see.
- I mean, this sauce.

864
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,490
It's simply made by hand.

865
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,620
(It's home cooking.)

866
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,790
It's savory too.

867
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,260
(DinDin takes a bite
of seasoned hijiki.)

868
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,360
(Crunching)

869
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,330
This hijiki is very delicious.

870
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,970
- Hijiki?
- Yes.

871
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,100
Yes, hijiki is delicious.

872
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,400
(Eating)

873
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,070
The seasoned hijiki is to die for.

874
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,770
Hijiki has an amazing texture.

875
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,870
Hijiki is good.

876
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,740
(Joon dips a horse clam
in soy sauce.)

877
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,380
- Which one is delicious?
- The clams are delicious.

878
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,550
- The clams are delicious.
- They're good.

879
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,580
Are they? How do they taste?

880
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,490
They don't taste like
how they usually taste.

881
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,590
- Really?
- They're like meat.

882
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,920
This is really good.

883
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,420
- These clams are excellent.
- They're incredible.

884
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,060
(A subtle sweet taste permeates
the chewiness.)

885
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,730
(Slurping seaweed)

886
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,560
The braised mackerel is made
with seaweed.

887
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,930
- This is unusual.
- Braised mackerel with seaweed.

888
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,100
It's close to being braised seaweed.

889
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
This is delicious.

890
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,000
(Everyone is satisfied with the meal
except for one person.)

891
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,170
It's very refreshing.

892
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,940
Look at the meat.

893
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,480
(All I did was do my best.)

894
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,180
I feel bad for Jong Min.

895
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,210
I agree.

896
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,680
- I feel bad for him.
- This is all because of you.

897
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,580
- I feel bad about it, but...
- It's good mixed too.

898
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,720
(Eating)

899
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,290
Jong Min, aren't you hungry?

900
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,220
- Is there any food for me?
- Yes.

901
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,760
We'll also provide you with a meal.

902
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,190
- Please bring it.
- Shall I eat too?

903
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,830
I hope that it's a good meal.

904
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,990
(For Jong Min who suffered
from being fooled)

905
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,530
It's just hijiki.

906
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,500
(Seasoned hijiki)

907
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,600
It's just hijiki.

908
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,570
Thank you for the food.
This isn't so bad.

909
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,100
The big table...

910
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,410
If it doesn't work...

911
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,970
Isn't it good?

912
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,840
The hijiki is very good.

913
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,510
- It's light and savory.
- Yes, it's light.

914
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,280
It's very savory
because of sesame oil.

915
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,350
Should we give him a clam?

916
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,650
Can we give him one clam?

917
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,150
- That sounds good.
- To Jong Min?

918
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,920
Yes, I'd like to try it.

919
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
Do you want one?

920
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,990
- You can't give it to him for free.
- We can't?

921
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,490
- I'm sorry.
- No?

922
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,390
She's stricter than Jong Hyun.

923
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,630
Right.

924
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,460
That's a bummer.

925
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,730
Do you want to do a relief mission?

926
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,470
- Is there a mission?
- Is that possible?

927
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,800
- If all members agree,
- Okay.

928
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,610
we'll proceed
with the relief mission.

929
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,340
- If we agree...
- Please agree with it.

930
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,710
You've set me up.

931
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,780
Here's the relief mission
for Jong Min.

932
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,720
You will hear KOYOTE's song
for three seconds.

933
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,720
The five of you without Jong Min...

934
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,450
must guess the song title correctly.

935
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,560
You must name
a total of three songs.

936
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,690
You get three chances per song.

937
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,330
Naming KOYOTE's songs are easy.
Okay.

938
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,130
I'd like to count on you.

939
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,660
- We'll do our best.
- Okay.

940
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,670
(The first song)

941
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,700
This is delicious.

942
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,140
Hey.

943
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,470
(The intro sounds very familiar.)

944
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,470
(Exclaiming)

945
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,940
Se Yoon, don't tell me
that you don't know.

946
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,280
(Of course I do.)

947
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,750
"Sad..."

948
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,610
- Incorrect.
- Darn it.

949
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,080
Isn't it "Sad Dream?"
That's what I thought.

950
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,390
(You can't do this)

951
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,720
(To me)

952
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,060
(He knows the lyrics
but not the song title.)

953
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,320
Isn't it "Sad Dream?"

954
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,420
Can I give them a hint?

955
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,860
It's a color.

956
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,090
I got it.

957
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,090
"Paran."

958
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,660
- DinDin.
- "Paran" by KOYOTE.

959
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,000
- Correct.
- Yes.

960
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,870
("Paran" is correct.)

961
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,870
It's called "Paran."

962
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,970
("Paran" by KOYOTE
was released in 2001.)

963
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,440
What was the dance?
Wasn't it simple?

964
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,670
- Can you show us a little?
- There he goes.

965
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,970
(Celebrating with joy)

966
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,940
(Working hard)

967
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,710
(Feeling bad for some reason)

968
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,710
One more time.

969
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,780
Yes.

970
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,490
(Just like back in the day)

971
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,750
Let's give him food.

972
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,060
(Feeling bad for him)

973
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,760
(The empty stomach made him
perform desperately.)

974
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,660
Was this Shinji's solo?

975
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,860
(Being annoying)

976
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,700
- It's because...
- KOYOTE has three members.

977
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,770
- Why does Shinji sing alone?
- We heard only her part...

978
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,170
- by chance.
- Right.

979
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,000
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

980
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,010
- This is...
- This is so...

981
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,380
(You said that you'd love me only)

982
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,710
This is Joon's favorite.

983
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,410
(KOYOTE's most famous song
that everyone knows)

984
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,650
"Pure Love" by KOYOTE.

985
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,680
("Pure Love")

986
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Incorrect.

987
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,050
That's not it. What are you doing?

988
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,490
Why do all the titles have
two syllables?

989
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,790
It's confusing.

990
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,690
("Pure Love," "Spark," "Meeting,"
"Time," "Broken Heart," "Never,")

991
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,260
("Sad Dream," "My Hero," "Paran,"
"Danjang," "Sadness," "Dash...")

992
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,930
(Over 60 songs by KOYOTE have...)

993
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,460
(2 syllables in Korean.)

994
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,260
- Give us a hint.
- I have no idea.

995
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,560
Here's a gesture hint.

996
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,430
(Groaning)

997
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,440
- By KOYOTE...
- Don't joke.

998
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,640
"Broken..."

999
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,210
- "Heart."
- "Heart."

1000
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,140
"Broken Heart Association."

1001
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,840
- Goodness.
- Isn't that correct?

1002
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,850
(You said that you'd pay me
for reruns)

1003
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,480
"Broken Heart" by KOYOTE.

1004
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,150
- Correct.
- Yes!

1005
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,590
(It's time to dance
after overcoming his broken heart.)

1006
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,420
Honestly, it's confusing.

1007
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,630
Let's finish the mission
so that we can eat together.

1008
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,190
- Let's eat together.
- I'll save you this time.

1009
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,360
Please do.

1010
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,100
- It's the last one.
- Give us a hard one.

1011
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,300
They have so many famous songs.

1012
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,630
We'll recognize it right away.

1013
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,200
(This song is...)

1014
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,870
- This is very hard.
- Jong Min, eat next time.

1015
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,780
- I don't know this one.
- Do you know, Jong Min?

1016
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,350
It's not a song by KOYOTE.

1017
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,350
- What?
- What?

1018
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,910
- It's one of my solos.
- What?

1019
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,480
This is too difficult.

1020
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,850
I might not even recognize
the chorus.

1021
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,320
- Can we listen to the chorus?
- I don't know...

1022
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,450
any of Jong Min's solos.

1023
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,620
You definitely know this.

1024
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,760
You'll get it right.

1025
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,160
(They decide to listen more.)

1026
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
All right.

1027
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,100
(The beat sounds familiar
for some reason.)

1028
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,170
- What?
- Isn't this a copy...

1029
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,400
of "Man Man Ha Ni" by U-KISS?

1030
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,300
- I know.
- Isn't it sung by Park Myung Soo?

1031
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,840
(A machine-like voice
from back in the day)

1032
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,380
This is nice.

1033
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,680
"Sali Go Dali Go?"

1034
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,980
("Sali Go Dali Go?")

1035
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,080
(I was quite famous)

1036
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:07,860
(Back then)

1037
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,360
(Sali Go Dali Go)

1038
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,360
It's right.

1039
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,400
- It's right.
- You know this song?

1040
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,870
Yes. Seon Ho.

1041
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,870
- "Sali Go Dali Go."
- Correct.

1042
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,900
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1043
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,170
(The youngest Seon Ho
unexpectedly gets the right answer.)

1044
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:27,380
("Sali Go Dali Go" by Kim Jong Min
released in 2014)

1045
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,150
(The addictive chorus...)

1046
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:32,650
(and overly sharp movements
are key.)

1047
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,120
Thank you.

1048
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,290
- I got the last one correct.
- Yes.

1049
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,050
Go ahead and enjoy
the food together.

1050
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,090
- Yes.
- All right.

1051
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,430
It's better because
the taste isn't sophisticated.

1052
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,490
The sauce is tasty.

1053
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,530
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

1054
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,430
(Flatfish seaweed soup)

1055
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,230
(Kimchi)

1056
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,230
How is it?

1057
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,340
The kimchi is excellent.

1058
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,440
- It's very good.
- This one.

1059
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,600
The kimchi is the best.

1060
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,270
The kimchi is really good.

1061
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,240
Today, we should do our best...

1062
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,580
for Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

1063
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,880
It's cold outside.

1064
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,310
- I agree.
- It's April 18.

1065
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,620
- It's not cold.
- A day like this is dangerous.

1066
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,920
(Oh, right.)

1067
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,650
- We're in April.
- Right.

1068
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,950
Jong Min, it was very cold
at your wedding.

1069
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,320
How low was the temperature
at the wedding hall?

1070
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,790
Se Yoon and I were the hosts...

1071
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,000
during the second part
of Jong Min's wedding.

1072
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,600
- He gave each of us 37.5g of gold.
- He said it in the past tense.

1073
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,000
(In return)

1074
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,670
- He gave me 37.5g of gold.
- Really?

1075
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,600
- Of course.
- In the form of a toad.

1076
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,570
How could I not
when Sae Ho took off his pants?

1077
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,610
He took his pants off.

1078
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,740
On your wedding day,

1079
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,380
why was the bride absent?

1080
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,210
Jong Min's suit was
in body painting.

1081
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,750
- What?
- Gosh, I was like...

1082
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,520
(Talking nonsense
after eating natural food)

1083
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,990
Gosh, I'm full. I overate.

1084
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,290
Did you enjoy your meal?

1085
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,660
- Yes, I did.
- Yes.

1086
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,090
It will be a bloody fight.

1087
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,490
"Bloody?" Are you determined
to win first place?

1088
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,030
Yes, today's theme is winning.

1089
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,170
If Joon sleeps indoors tonight,
his day will be perfect.

1090
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,240
Yes, I'm more determined than ever.

1091
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,140
There's something here.

1092
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,940
- What?
- There's a set outside.

1093
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,110
Is there something outside?

1094
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,840
- Welcome back.
- Hello.

1095
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,740
All right, everyone.

1096
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,510
We'll start
Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

1097
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,280
- Let's do it.
- It's finally here.

1098
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,020
Kim Jong Min.

1099
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,320
Please step outside.

1100
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Okay.

1101
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,860
Is it 5 against 1 again?

1102
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,290
It's because he's getting married.

1103
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,960
(Looking around)

1104
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,000
- When is your birthday?
- What?

1105
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,970
(Glancing)

1106
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,770
(September 24)

1107
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,800
What did you talk about?

1108
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
DinDin asked him
when his birthday was.

1109
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,070
(Sommers Sae Ho with acute hearing)

1110
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,910
It must be a game about me.

1111
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,940
(Laughing)

1112
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,080
Guys, good luck.

1113
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,310
We can do it.

1114
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,580
(Jong Min leaves energetically.)

1115
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,580
Okay.

1116
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,310
This must be for me.

1117
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,480
- What is it this time?
- This time...

1118
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,290
Please keep your voices low
starting from now.

1119
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,290
Okay.

1120
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:54,290
Could you lower your voice?

1121
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,390
- My voice?
- Yes.

1122
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,930
Yes!

1123
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,900
When you get caught talking loudly,

1124
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,800
your answer will be counted
as incorrect.

1125
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Okay.

1126
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,100
Everyone, in a few minutes,

1127
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,900
Jong Min will come back inside.

1128
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,700
When he comes back in,

1129
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,770
with which foot
will he step inside first?

1130
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,810
(They didn't expect to predict
Jong Min's behavior.)

1131
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,150
Is this the question?

1132
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,010
I'd say his right foot.

1133
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,480
Look.

1134
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,350
- Here's the door.
- I know.

1135
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,350
Anyone would come in like this.

1136
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,990
Who would walk in like this?

1137
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,260
Most people who are right-handed...

1138
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,960
take off their shoes like this.

1139
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,860
- They step in like this.
- Take a look.

1140
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,400
Listen, Jong Min went outside alone.

1141
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,800
He might think that
we're up to something again.

1142
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,970
What could be the worst situation?

1143
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,370
He'd open the door
without coming inside.

1144
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,700
"Aren't you up to something?"

1145
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,540
He'd step in with his left foot.

1146
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,940
Left foot?

1147
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,180
Is it worth discussing at all?

1148
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,010
(Jong Min is isolated
without knowing anything.)

1149
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,050
What are we doing?
Why am I sitting here?

1150
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,250
Will they fool me again?

1151
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,220
No, they wouldn't do it twice.

1152
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,320
- You may go back in.
- What?

1153
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,460
(Director Ho Shin)

1154
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,760
What was this about?

1155
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,360
What's going on?

1156
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,000
He's likely to step in
with his left foot.

1157
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,800
- Really?
- Of course. He has two feet.

1158
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,400
The three of us think
that it's his right foot.

1159
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,370
- I think it's the right foot.
- Let's go with the right foot.

1160
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,470
- Right?
- Did you choose the right foot?

1161
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,940
It's likely to be his right foot.

1162
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,310
This seems impossible,

1163
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,510
but if he jumps inside
with both feet,

1164
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,710
your answer will be incorrect.

1165
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,140
(Laughing)

1166
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,210
I know it seems impossible.

1167
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,510
- Saying it seriously sounds funny.
- Seriously.

1168
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,080
- You never know.
- If that's how he comes in...

1169
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,880
If that's how he comes in,

1170
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,150
all of us will sleep outdoors.

1171
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,390
Let's say that he opens the door...

1172
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,120
and enters on a handstand.

1173
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,930
Then I'll sleep in my underwear.

1174
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,430
- I'll sleep outdoors.
- Just take off your underwear.

1175
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,930
- I'll sleep outdoors.
- Take off your underwear too.

1176
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,930
Everyone, Jong Min
will come back inside soon.

1177
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,400
We have to look at the opposite.

1178
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,800
- This will be his right foot.
- He's coming.

1179
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,840
(The members' prediction is
his right foot.)

1180
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,970
What?

1181
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,970
(Jong Min needs to step in
with the right foot to succeed.)

1182
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,510
(Everyone looks at the same spot.)

1183
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,640
What?

1184
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,120
(Will the members' prediction
be correct?)

1185
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,220
What?

1186
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,250
(Jong Min stepped in
with his right foot.)

1187
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,090
- Yes, that's what I thought.
- Yes.

1188
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,160
- We...
- Yes, we were right.

1189
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,290
(Success)

1190
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,090
- Thank you.
- Good job.

1191
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,390
- Well done.
- Did I do well?

1192
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,560
- Thank you.
- Well done.

1193
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,460
- Did I do something well?
- I knew it. It's absolutely right.

1194
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,630
- Good job.
- Good job.

1195
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,900
Is it a team game? Okay.

1196
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,000
Everyone.

1197
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,600
For today's Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors,

1198
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,680
you must predict
Jong Min's behaviors and thoughts.

1199
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,110
Out of seven rounds,

1200
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,650
if you succeed in four rounds,

1201
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,380
everyone will sleep indoors.

1202
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,420
(Everyone will sleep indoors.)

1203
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,220
If we fail,
will we all sleep outdoors?

1204
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,890
- That's correct.
- Seriously?

1205
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,320
- Right.
- You got the first one right.

1206
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,220
Jong Min, please go back outside.

1207
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,060
- Jong Min, don't think complicated.
- Okay.

1208
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,530
- Do whatever you want.
- I'll be intuitive.

1209
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,100
- I'll act natural.
- Or we'll be confused.

1210
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,230
I won't overthink.

1211
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,730
Okay.

1212
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,770
(Jong Min is happy
that Round 1 was successful.)

1213
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,830
I got it now.

1214
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,340
They have to predict my behavior.

1215
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,170
- It can end in four rounds.
- Yes.

1216
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,540
- This is worth trying.
- I understand people's psychology.

1217
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,880
All right, everyone.

1218
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,380
Director Ho Shin who's outside...

1219
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,150
asked this to Jong Min.

1220
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,090
"Jong Min, what's on your mind now?"

1221
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,150
What will be Jong Min's answer?

1222
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,590
(They must predict
Jong Min's response.)

1223
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,990
This is so easy to answer.

1224
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,190
He'd say, "I'm not thinking
about anything."

1225
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,200
(Seon Ho's prediction:
"I'm not thinking about anything.")

1226
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,830
- "Nothing is on my mind."
- There are so many possibilities.

1227
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,200
Jong Min and I are similar.

1228
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,670
Yes, that's true.

1229
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,940
If someone asked me that,

1230
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,500
- I'd say, "Nothing much."
- Right.

1231
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
That would be my answer.

1232
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,640
I think this is correct.

1233
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,740
Nothing is on his mind.

1234
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,370
The director
won't suddenly ask him...

1235
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,540
"Jong Min, what's on your mind?"

1236
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,350
He won't. In the middle...

1237
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,910
of a casual conversation,

1238
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,680
- he'd ask what's on his mind.
- In the middle of a conversation?

1239
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,950
"What's on your mind?"

1240
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,890
- "Nothing much."
- This has to be the right answer.

1241
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,550
I have to be unconscious about it.

1242
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,120
I change as soon as I get conscious.

1243
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,390
Jong Min, what's on your mind
right now?

1244
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,830
(What will be Jong Min's response?)

1245
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,030
Me?

1246
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,530
Everyone, Jong Min has answered.

1247
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,740
Please agree on your final answer.

1248
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,710
- Let's go with this one.
- There are so many possibilities.

1249
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,370
The chance of winning isn't
even 50 percent.

1250
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,140
Remember what we told him?

1251
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,550
- We told him not to think.
- Right.

1252
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:15,920
(The members told Jong Min
not to think deeply.)

1253
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,790
Shall we go with "nothing much?"

1254
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,420
- Yes, it must be right.
- Let's go with it.

1255
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,690
I think it's right.
We know what Jong Min's like.

1256
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,360
- "Nothing is on my mind."
- "Nothing much."

1257
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:26,460
Jong Min, please come back in.

1258
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,000
(It's time to check the result
of Round 2.)

1259
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,500
Based on his reaction,
I think we're wrong.

1260
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,530
Jong Min.

1261
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,670
What's with the look on his face?

1262
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,210
(He comes in
while looking innocent.)

1263
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,140
He hasn't noticed it yet?

1264
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,880
Did you figure out
what the question was?

1265
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,380
No.

1266
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,950
- This is better.
- It's good.

1267
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,180
- This is better.
- In that case...

1268
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,350
- This is better.
- Stay quiet.

1269
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,780
Don't say anything, Jong Min.

1270
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,520
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

1271
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,920
What's on your mind right now?

1272
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,160
Nothing is on my mind.

1273
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,260
(Did they get it right?)

1274
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,530
- Aren't we right?
- What's wrong?

1275
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,860
- No?
- This is what you said.

1276
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,870
- No, you failed.
- What? What did he say?

1277
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,940
- When Director Ho Shin asked him,
- What?

1278
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,900
"What's on your mind right now?"

1279
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,940
- Jong Min's response was...
- What did you say?

1280
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,240
(Director Ho Shin:
What's on your mind right now?)

1281
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,750
(What was Jong Min's response?)

1282
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,750
Me?

1283
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,950
I'm wondering
what the game is about.

1284
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,350
What it is?

1285
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,550
I was wondering
what the next game was.

1286
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,860
- What?
- "What's the next game about?"

1287
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,260
That's what I thought a moment ago,
but nothing is on my mind now.

1288
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,830
I knew this would be hard,

1289
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,160
- but I thought we got it right.
- I know.

1290
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,530
I was wondering about the next game.

1291
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,970
Should I give a handshake
with my right hand?

1292
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,000
What should I say?

1293
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Okay.

1294
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,470
I never imagined that
he'd think about the next game.

1295
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,770
- Everyone.
- Gosh.

1296
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,940
Jong Min, please step out again.

1297
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,180
- Okay.
- Okay.

1298
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,510
(Failed)

1299
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,980
- You almost got the second right.
- I know.

1300
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,820
Doesn't Jong Min seem excited
that this episode is about him?

1301
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,620
(Despite failing, he keeps smiling.)

1302
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,850
That's why they asked me.

1303
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,290
All right, everyone.

1304
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,390
Here's the third question.

1305
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,230
As soon as Jong Min comes back in,

1306
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,660
we'll start Game of Wits.

1307
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,130
With Jong Min?

1308
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,930
You will succeed
if you make Jong Min...

1309
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,270
shout number four.

1310
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,240
What? Number four?

1311
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,370
- This is easy.
- We have to make him say it?

1312
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,810
Jong Min is the type...

1313
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,940
who doesn't come in
when we're counting.

1314
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,080
- He will wait.
- Right. That's good.

1315
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,880
- He will wait.
- He comes in at 3 or 4.

1316
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,950
Let's say "1, 2, 3."

1317
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,550
- This will work.
- Yes.

1318
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,490
Let's practice.
We have to say "1, 2, 3."

1319
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,650
Let's do it.

1320
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,920
Game of Wits starts...

1321
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,390
- now.
- You didn't do that when drunk.

1322
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,200
- I never played it while drunk.
- That's not how you said it.

1323
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,360
In the past,

1324
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,400
you said, "Game of Wits starts now."

1325
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,530
Suddenly, he slowed down.

1326
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,840
What's the matter with him?

1327
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,270
- It's to make us lose.
- It should be this fast.

1328
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,440
Say "Game of Wits starts now..."

1329
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,640
- at this speed.
- That's right.

1330
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,340
Game of Wits...

1331
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,350
starts now.

1332
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,410
One, two, three.

1333
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,710
- That's it.
- That'll work.

1334
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,350
(Whispering)

1335
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,650
They're very busy discussing.

1336
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,360
They're trying to restrain me
with 18 years of experience.

1337
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,090
Once they talk to me,

1338
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,960
my response will be the answer.

1339
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,600
They won't be able to talk to me.

1340
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,340
- Okay.
- It's a power struggle.

1341
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,740
Let's do it.

1342
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,870
- Please go inside.
- Okay.

1343
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,740
- They came up with a good game.
- I agree.

1344
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,610
(Jong Min leaves the power struggle behind
and comes in.)

1345
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,580
- Focus, everyone.
- We can do it.

1346
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,980
(Nervousness to its maximum)

1347
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,820
- Game of Wits starts now.
- One.

1348
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,890
- Two.
- Three.

1349
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,720
(As practiced, they shouted out
the numbers quickly.)

1350
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,920
(Now, everything is
up to Jong Min's wits.)

1351
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,990
Three.

1352
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,930
(Will Jong Min shout...)

1353
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,530
(number four?)

1354
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,830
- Game of Wits starts now.
- One.

1355
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:47,860
- Two.
- Three.

1356
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,860
Four.

1357
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,040
(Hugging him adoringly)

1358
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,910
We've got it.

1359
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,970
Well done.

1360
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,810
We made it.

1361
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,710
I made it all the way here...

1362
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,180
- with my wits.
- We did it.

1363
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,280
Did you see that?

1364
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,780
That was amazing.

1365
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,850
Tempo is everything to a singer.

1366
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,750
I'm always on the beat.

1367
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,660
(His eyes moved to the tempo.)

1368
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,130
(Kim Jong Min is a dancer
and a singer indeed.)

1369
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,490
- Three, four!
- Exactly.

1370
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,630
(The eldest member is
extremely excited.)

1371
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:20,930
Please go outside.

1372
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,530
- That was great.
- Good job.

1373
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,670
Jong Min, you're the best.

1374
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,670
(He gives him a thumbs-up
while kicking him out.)

1375
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,940
I'm good with beats. I'm a singer.

1376
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,110
There was an offbeat. Okay.

1377
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,880
(An explosion of dopamine)

1378
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,980
Dopamine.

1379
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,150
- Well done.
- Most people would be flustered,

1380
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,150
but he said it immediately.

1381
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,120
- Wasn't that a great timing?
- Yes.

1382
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,720
That was amazing.

1383
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,660
- Let's sit down.
- That was great.

1384
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,760
- This is worth playing.
- No way.

1385
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,290
Jong Min would definitely join us.

1386
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,090
Here's the next question.

1387
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,260
- This is fun.
- This is very fun.

1388
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,430
If Jong Min were a woman...

1389
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,070
If I were a woman?

1390
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,670
With which member would he marry?

1391
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,510
This is crazy.

1392
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,240
(A difficult choice to make)

1393
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,640
This is hard.

1394
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,910
Isn't it obviously me?

1395
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,250
No, it's me.

1396
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,050
- It's me.
- Right.

1397
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,050
- It's Seon Ho.
- Jong Min...

1398
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,790
keeps telling me
to get married soon...

1399
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:18,850
and that I'll be a good husband.

1400
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,760
Jong Min cares a lot
about appearances.

1401
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,890
He would never marry Se Yoon.

1402
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,630
(He's out, based on his appearance.)

1403
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,860
He wouldn't marry Sae Ho either.

1404
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,360
- As for Joon, he'd think,
- He'd even think of that?

1405
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:28,600
"He's a little weird."

1406
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,700
"DinDin can't be the one.
I'd marry Seon Ho."

1407
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,730
I'm 100 percent sure.

1408
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,270
- It's Seon Ho. You're right.
- Let me just...

1409
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,500
- Let me just say one thing.
- I don't think so.

1410
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,110
I think it'd be me too,

1411
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,540
but there's also a possibility that
it'd be Se Yoon.

1412
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,140
Jong Min said many times...

1413
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,150
that if he had a daughter,
he would marry her off to me.

1414
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,210
He never said that.

1415
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,250
He did say that before,
for a brief moment.

1416
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,620
- He didn't say that, not even once.
- You know...

1417
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,820
- Here's what Jong Min said to me.
- You're wrong.

1418
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,250
- I expect to be chosen a little...
- He did say that.

1419
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,420
because he spoke a lot with me
while preparing for his wedding...

1420
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,960
- No, it's not you.
- Let me finish.

1421
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,760
I told him what I had done
to prepare for my wedding,

1422
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,800
and he said I had done really well.

1423
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,300
While helping Jong Min
find a wedding singer,

1424
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,970
I spoke a lot to him on the phone,
and he said...

1425
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,170
(DinDin helped Jong Min
find a wedding singer.)

1426
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,540
that I was a really good person.

1427
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,740
- Jong Min says that to everyone.
- No.

1428
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,340
Jong Min even said sorry to me
in tears.

1429
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,010
- That's a lie.
- He cried?

1430
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,310
- He cried.
- This is not a popularity poll.

1431
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,310
- That's true.
- "Don't cry."

1432
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,980
Sae Ho is too far
from Jong Min's ideal type.

1433
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,250
He went on about
how ugly Sae Ho was.

1434
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,850
- Hey, I wouldn't complain...
- Look at his face.

1435
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,490
if anyone else said that, but you...

1436
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,460
- He said you were uglier than me.
- Do you want to have a contest?

1437
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,660
- When did he say that?
- When we... You know.

1438
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,330
You mean,
when the six of us took a poll?

1439
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,360
He said that before.

1440
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,260
- The talk is going on for long.
- Indeed.

1441
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,530
Why is it going on for so long?

1442
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,070
I didn't think much to decide.

1443
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,100
Why are they thinking so hard?

1444
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,870
He always said that you looked
as if you had beaten up.

1445
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,300
When spring comes and flowers bloom,

1446
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,470
let's take a national poll.

1447
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,740
If he thinks about it briefly,

1448
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,240
he would want someone...

1449
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,640
- who could make his life easier,
- Listen, Se Yoon.

1450
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,010
and who's family-oriented.
Then it's definitely me.

1451
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,110
Then let me ask you one thing.

1452
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,680
If you were a woman,
would you go out with yourself?

1453
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,320
- That's not how it works. Idiot.
- You wouldn't.

1454
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,850
- Gosh. This is really difficult.
- But Jong Min said...

1455
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,060
I would be a family man
and a good dad.

1456
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,490
- He said such things many times.
- Could it be Seon Ho?

1457
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,290
- Really? Okay.
- I'm sure it's him.

1458
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,130
Let's go with Seon Ho
since his hunch was right before.

1459
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,260
- You can trust me on this one.
- Have you made your opinion?

1460
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,460
- Let's do that for this one.
- Let's follow DinDin's decision.

1461
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,030
- You can go in now.
- Okay.

1462
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,400
When you go in,

1463
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,970
give the member you chose a hug.

1464
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,440
(Hug the member you chose
as your ideal type.)

1465
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,540
(The members chose Seon Ho.)

1466
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,280
(He seems a little expectant.)

1467
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:25,650
(Jong Min walks toward Seon Ho.)

1468
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:27,950
(Is Seon Ho the answer?)

1469
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:30,850
(No, he faked it.)

1470
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,450
My, this is nerve-racking.

1471
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:36,020
(Could it be Sae Ho?)

1472
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,890
It's not you.

1473
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,900
(Sae Ho got eliminated quickly.)

1474
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,930
(Happy, sad)

1475
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,470
I told you it wasn't you.

1476
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,700
- Why did you expect to be chosen?
- I told you so.

1477
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,800
- He was expecting it.
- I said it was definitely not him.

1478
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,470
Gosh, you really...

1479
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:53,980
(Sae Ho is out.
Who did Jong Min choose?)

1480
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,310
(Jong Min stops behind Seon Ho.)

1481
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,750
You're too young.

1482
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,620
Okay.

1483
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,390
(DinDin's prediction turned out
to be completely wrong.)

1484
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,890
(They failed in Round 4.)

1485
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:05,890
Okay.

1486
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,860
Okay. One of us is so dead.

1487
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,190
- My love is...
- Who is it?

1488
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,200
It's not Seon Ho?

1489
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,530
(They failed
as Jong Min's answer is Se Yoon.)

1490
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,670
We've got to kill this brat.

1491
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,900
- Let's kill this brat.
- But why? Why him?

1492
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,110
- What's wrong with you?
- Why? Tell me why.

1493
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,670
(He doesn't know what's going on.)

1494
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,380
- Hey, you punk!
- Why?

1495
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,110
Why did you choose Se Yoon?

1496
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,410
Because he's a family man.

1497
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,710
You idiot. Darn.

1498
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,080
I told you before...

1499
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,850
- that Se Yoon... Gosh.
- Jong Min. Why not me?

1500
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,680
- You can't be it.
- Why not?

1501
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,850
I don't like your face.

1502
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,350
- He's so mean.
- See? It's just as I said.

1503
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,860
I look better than you.
I said he'd never like your face.

1504
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,490
- That's mean.
- All that I guessed was right.

1505
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,600
But DinDin remained firm
that it wasn't me.

1506
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,860
- I'm sorry.
- He said...

1507
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,260
that you wouldn't want to marry me.

1508
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,400
I told you
why I wanted to get married,

1509
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,470
- and Se Yoon is a perfect fit.
- He always said it to me.

1510
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,270
He's very family-oriented.

1511
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:59,110
Even when he has dinner
before going home,

1512
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,710
he eats again at home
to eat with his family.

1513
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:06,150
He would take his family
to a lamb skewer restaurant.

1514
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,580
(The man who's always ready
to eat lamb skewers with his family)

1515
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,190
- Gosh, seriously.
- Se Yoon guessed everything right.

1516
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,520
So we got 2 questions right
and 2 wrong, right?

1517
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,990
Yes, the score is 2 to 2.
Both we and the staff got 2 points.

1518
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,660
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.
- We should get two right answers.

1519
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,560
As you must have realized,

1520
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,730
you guys know more about Jong Min
than we all thought.

1521
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,300
- Of course.
- We're good at this.

1522
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,870
And what's for sure is...

1523
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:29,870
that Jong Min seems excited
to be the star of the day.

1524
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,810
- Let's move on.
- Okay.

1525
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,480
What's that?

1526
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,010
(This time,
something begins outside.)

1527
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,810
- Oh, gosh. This is...
- Now...

1528
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,220
(The same objects are brought in.)

1529
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:43,050
These three types of snacks...

1530
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:47,360
have been offered to Jong Min.

1531
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,660
Which 1 of the 3 snacks...

1532
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,400
- does Jong Min want to eat now?
- Isn't it chocolate?

1533
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:56,060
- It's definitely chocolate.
- Right.

1534
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,070
It's yakgwa. What? Really?

1535
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:01,170
I think Jong Min will choose yakgwa.

1536
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,140
- I think it's yakgwa too.
- Jong Min likes yakgwa.

1537
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,540
- He'll definitely pick chocolate.
- Se Yoon, tell us what you think.

1538
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,280
I've seen him eating chocolate
in secret many times.

1539
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,480
- I've seen that many times too.
- He eats only chocolate.

1540
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,280
- Oh, right.
- But here's why he eats chocolate.

1541
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,420
- We don't get yakgwa here.
- True.

1542
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,350
I'll share something shocking
with you guys.

1543
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:18,990
(Joon has never seemed this certain
since the beginning of the shoot.)

1544
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,190
I saw Jong Min...

1545
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,490
hiding to eat chocolate...

1546
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,360
when the camera was off.

1547
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,730
- I saw that too.
- I saw it too, but he said,

1548
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,300
- "I don't like chocolate."
- You're lying.

1549
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,500
- You know what?
- No. He was very serious.

1550
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,970
Jong Hyun might be shocked
if I tell him this.

1551
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,340
Earlier on, I saw Jong Min...

1552
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,940
eating this chocolate cookie...

1553
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,580
in the waiting room number two.

1554
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,620
- He ate cookies?
- Yes, he always eats secretly.

1555
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,650
(Director Joo never knew this.)

1556
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,890
- I'm sorry.
- Talk to him later. He's happy now.

1557
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,950
- Anyway, you can talk to him later.
- Okay.

1558
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:54,490
I remember the exact words he said.

1559
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:58,730
"Usually, I never eat chocolate.
I don't like chocolate."

1560
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,100
"But I keep craving it..."

1561
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,530
- "when shooting this show."
- And this...

1562
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,800
- This is just my hunch.
- Just tell me this.

1563
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,700
I think it's yakgwa. Here's why.

1564
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,100
Jong Min must want...

1565
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,870
to eat a quick bite
and come back in.

1566
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,010
But this one can stick to the teeth.

1567
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,110
Yes, that's right. I agree.

1568
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,210
- It's yakgwa.
- I'll do that.

1569
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,380
(Joon and DinDin strongly argue
that it's yakgwa.)

1570
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:19,010
I'm sure they think I'll eat yakgwa
because I'm quite old.

1571
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:20,880
This one.

1572
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,190
But I wouldn't choose this.

1573
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,350
I don't know
if I should change my choice.

1574
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,390
(Jong Min predicts what the members
in the room might think.)

1575
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,720
Should I change my choice
or stick to it?

1576
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,830
(Should I just eat yakgwa?)

1577
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,130
Listen to me.

1578
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:34,860
- It's the same as why he chose me.
- That's right.

1579
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,830
He always let us see him...

1580
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,800
- eating chocolate snacks.
- We all saw him eating it.

1581
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,470
He once got caught
while doing a handstand.

1582
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,410
(4 months earlier)

1583
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:47,280
(While doing a handstand,)

1584
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,740
(Jong Min dropped
a chocolate cookie!)

1585
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,210
He let us see him eating it.
We should pick what he always eats.

1586
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,550
- Let's go with it, then.
- What he's used to eating.

1587
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,680
- It's definitely chocolate.
- Okay. Let's go with it.

1588
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,790
Now, please put the snack
of your choice in your mouth...

1589
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:00,460
and go into the room
while eating it.

1590
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,460
Got it.

1591
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,860
(Jong Min's favorite snack went
into his mouth.)

1592
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:07,830
(Finally,
it's time to reveal the answer.)

1593
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,500
- Jong Min, let's make this work.
- I knew it.

1594
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,530
- I knew it.
- He put it into his mouth.

1595
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,240
- It's not the sausage.
- Of course. I knew it.

1596
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:15,600
Okay. Jong Min.

1597
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,670
- Is it yakgwa?
- Open your mouth.

1598
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,510
Have one more
of your favorite snack.

1599
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,740
We have it here as well.

1600
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,140
Which snack do you want to eat?

1601
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:26,410
- Yes, that's right. Good.
- Oh, no. That's not it.

1602
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,120
(Moving his hand back and forth)

1603
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,150
(Every movement of his hand makes
the other members nervous.)

1604
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,090
(Both chose the chocolate cookie.
They succeeded.)

1605
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,390
- That's right!
- Jong Min!

1606
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,660
(Showing the chocolate cookie)

1607
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,730
- Yes! I knew it!
- I knew it!

1608
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,130
- I had no doubt.
- It's obviously chocolate.

1609
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,870
You always ate this secretly.

1610
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:46,900
(Two thumbs up)

1611
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,540
You ate this
in the waiting room earlier, right?

1612
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,070
In the waiting room.
I already told them.

1613
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,540
You ate it, right?

1614
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,610
(Nodding)

1615
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,750
- This is how well I know you.
- You know me.

1616
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,810
- Exactly. You know me so well.
- I know you.

1617
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,650
Jong Min, this was brought up...

1618
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,480
- while we were talking.
- Yes.

1619
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,350
You ate
a whole bag of nacho chips...

1620
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:07,290
and one of the chocolate cookies,
as far as we heard.

1621
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,960
If you eat that much food,
your stomach might explode.

1622
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,860
So you didn't eat...

1623
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,530
(Walking out right away)

1624
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:15,960
(He hurries back out
to his position.)

1625
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,200
I can't believe they told on me.

1626
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,240
The next question is
a personality test quiz.

1627
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,710
- This will be difficult.
- Guess what Jong Min...

1628
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,270
would choose.

1629
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,480
- I've been reading Freud's book.
- This is difficult.

1630
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:30,180
You have to guess
what Jong Min would think.

1631
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,480
(This might be the last question.)

1632
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,650
Good.

1633
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,450
Which of the following masks
would Jong Min wear to a ball?

1634
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,250
This is difficult.

1635
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,590
Number one. A bear mask.

1636
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,330
Number two. A Pierrot mask.

1637
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:47,000
Number three. A hahoe mask.

1638
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,130
- Number four.
- A multiple choice quiz is hard.

1639
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,470
A masquerade mask.

1640
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,370
(What will Jong Min choose?)

1641
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,870
- He must pick a masquerade mask.
- I think it's a masquerade mask.

1642
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,740
- A masquerade mask.
- It's cool.

1643
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,410
I can't decide between a hahoe mask
and a masquerade mask.

1644
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,740
Jong Min would choose a simple answer,
which is a masquerade mask.

1645
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,210
- I think it's a masquerade mask.
- Right. It's a masquerade mask.

1646
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,710
I think it's either a Pierrot mask
or a masquerade mask.

1647
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,780
- I'm sure it's a masquerade mask.
- I thought of a Pierrot mask too.

1648
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,850
- But he'd hate it...
- I think it's the answer.

1649
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,820
- because he'd look like a clown.
- To me, this is the easiest one.

1650
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,290
- It's the easiest question?
- The answer is number four.

1651
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,660
- A masquerade mask?
- You just know intuitively.

1652
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,760
- Everything Joon said was wrong.
- I just told you...

1653
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,660
The answer is number four.
This is the easiest question.

1654
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,270
- Make your decision now.
- Number four.

1655
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:25,570
- This is the easiest question.
- Number four?

1656
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:27,370
- Yes. Let's end it here.
- If it's not the answer,

1657
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,300
- All right.
- I have nothing to say.

1658
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,070
- When Jong Min comes in,
- Will he be wearing a mask?

1659
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,740
I will ask him the question.

1660
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,680
- Does he not know yet?
- No.

1661
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,580
- You must...
- We won't say anything.

1662
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,050
- look ahead...
- Okay.

1663
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,420
and never say a word.

1664
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,050
- If we get this right, it's over.
- Yes.

1665
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,490
You can go in now.

1666
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,460
You won't ask me a question? Why?

1667
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,520
I guess I have to read the room
instead of choosing what I want.

1668
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,730
(He will win the game
by reading the room now!)

1669
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,930
(The door of possibility of sleeping
indoors all together has opened.)

1670
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:56,100
- You can go in now.
- Make sure to look ahead.

1671
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,570
- Everyone, look ahead. Okay.
- Okay.

1672
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:01,270
(Extremely nervous)

1673
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:03,540
You have to answer in five seconds.

1674
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,710
- Five seconds?
- Yes.

1675
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,570
Which of the following masks
would you wear to a ball?

1676
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,740
Number one, a bear mask.

1677
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,980
Number two, a Pierrot mask.

1678
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,480
Number three, a hahoe mask.

1679
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,480
Number four, a masquerade mask.

1680
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,850
Five, four,

1681
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,020
three, two...

1682
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,120
A masquerade mask.

1683
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,430
(Jong Min: A masquerade mask,
Teammates: A masquerade mask)

1684
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:26,490
(They got it.)

1685
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,560
There you go!

1686
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:30,970
- You got it.
- Yes!

1687
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,140
- Can we know why you chose it?
- We got it.

1688
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,870
KOYOTE reminds you...

1689
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,740
- of the disco stage.
- That's right.

1690
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,180
- It feels like a party.
- Right.

1691
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,710
- We surely are one team.
- We are!

1692
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,040
I know. We're so good.

1693
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:46,250
We unanimously picked
the same answer.

1694
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,350
- Really?
- Goodness.

1695
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,920
- You got four questions right.
- Okay.

1696
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,220
- Everyone is sleeping indoors.
- Yes!

1697
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,960
You all know me so well.

1698
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,220
- We know you well.
- I was very surprised.

1699
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,460
- We know each other well.
- Right.

1700
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,590
It definitely was fruitful.

1701
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,460
- Jong Min, say something.
- Like what?

1702
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,830
You're the oldest one here.
You should say something for us.

1703
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,960
I thought you wouldn't know me well.

1704
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,530
- Come on. We know you well.
- How can we not know you?

1705
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:05,670
I didn't expect you all
to know me this much.

1706
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,470
(After spending summer, autumn,
and winter together,)

1707
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,980
(the six of them are facing spring.)

1708
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,650
Who are we? We are 2 Days and 1 Night.

1709
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:21,320
(This is the friendship
of 2 Days and 1 Night.)

1710
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,380
I'll keep an eye on you all now.

1711
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,320
(I'll keep an eye on you all now.)

1712
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,460
It even made us happy too.

1713
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,360
I know. We were like one team.

1714
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,600
We're a family.

1715
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,630
You all did a good job.

1716
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,530
Can we take a shower
and get ready to sleep?

1717
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,730
- Yes, you can.
- Okay.

1718
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,000
("To see takes time,
like making friends...")

1719
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,440
(by Georgia O'Keeffe)

1720
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,840
- I'm so happy.
- Thank you all.

1721
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:49,210
(It's getting late here
on Noedo Island.)

1722
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,880
(All they need to do now
is to go to bed.)

1723
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,350
- Let's go.
- Shall we? All of us?

1724
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,180
- Let's just quickly do it.
- My knees hurt.

1725
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,250
Are we having a meeting?

1726
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,750
They're shooting something.

1727
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,820
- Jong Min's seat is inside.
- What's happening?

1728
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,720
- What's happening?
- You all can take seats.

1729
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,590
- What's happening?
- Please take seats.

1730
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,260
- Are we getting inside the room?
- I mean...

1731
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:07,300
- Let me get some screentime.
- What's happening?

1732
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:08,860
(Smiling)

1733
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,860
- Hello.
- What's all this?

1734
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:11,900
(They're at this cafe
without knowing what's going on.)

1735
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:12,900
- What's this?
- What is all this?

1736
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,740
It's 2025...

1737
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,210
(Photos of someone
hanging by the window)

1738
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:26,280
(A beam projector
with a white screen)

1739
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,680
- Is it a bridal shower?
- Goodness.

1740
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,220
He's good-looking.

1741
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,890
- Hey, Jong Min.
- Goodness.

1742
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,790
- Are you ready to cry?
- Oh, my.

1743
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:35,290
- It's your photo. Is it your dad?
- It's Jong Min.

1744
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,420
- Right, my dad.
- Goodness.

1745
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,730
- Really?
- You look like him.

1746
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:39,990
- I do?
- Yes.

1747
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,000
(The hanging photos
were all Jong Min's.)

1748
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,400
(Jong Min's parents' wedding photo)

1749
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,430
Gosh, where did you get them?

1750
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,870
I'm sure they're from my family.
How did you get them?

1751
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,240
(Amazed)

1752
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,270
- Is it your mother?
- My mom.

1753
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:52,470
Really? She looks different.

1754
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:56,110
Jong Min was smaller
than his friends back then.

1755
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,450
I was very short.
I was in elementary school.

1756
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:00,010
Goodness, this is Jong Min.

1757
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,450
- What? Where?
- Is it Jong Min? When was it?

1758
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,520
- Who is this?
- It's my friend.

1759
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,950
His friend is so much taller.

1760
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,450
- Look at this.
- He's good-looking.

1761
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:06,690
- You were good-looking.
- Right.

1762
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:07,860
He was good-looking.

1763
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,390
- He's so handsome there.
- Was it when you performed solo?

1764
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:12,390
- Jong Min.
- When we first debuted as KOYOTE.

1765
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,500
I'm not sure if I can say this,
but he looks like Jae Joong here.

1766
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,330
- Well...
- He was so good-looking then.

1767
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,070
I'm falling in love with him.

1768
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,270
- I love these photos.
- He looks like Jae Joong in this.

1769
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:21,800
This is even more touching.

1770
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,740
The staff all wrote the letters
just for Jong Min.

1771
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,270
- No way.
- I'm serious.

1772
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,880
- Really?
- Did they really write it?

1773
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,110
Is it like a bridal shower?

1774
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:32,310
I'm about to tear up again.
It's driving me crazy.

1775
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,850
Jong Hyun wrote one too.

1776
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,020
(During the shoot,)

1777
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,380
(everyone wrote these notes
when they had a chance.)

1778
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,350
- "The second chapter of his life."
- It's giving me chills.

1779
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,660
- Even I'm tearing up.
- "Our dream, Jong Min's dream."

1780
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,690
"Congratulations on your wedding."

1781
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,530
"Jong Min, please be happy.
Congratulations."

1782
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:47,060
- "You're my hero."
- This is so sweet.

1783
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,100
- I'm very touched myself.
- "The second chapter of his life."

1784
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,900
- I'm tearing up.
- This is crazy.

1785
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,470
I should take a photo of this.

1786
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,440
- I need to take a photo of this.
- It's beautiful.

1787
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,570
It's crazy.

1788
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,180
- Let's sit first.
- Yes, let's take seats.

1789
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,950
Jong Min, come here.

1790
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:05,780
- This is Jong Min's seat.
- Jong Min's seat.

1791
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,980
- What? Nice.
- Please sit here, Jong Min.

1792
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,620
- Please sit here.
- Okay.

1793
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,120
You're tearing up.

1794
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,520
It's my allergy.

1795
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,560
What's going on? What video is it?

1796
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,220
- What's going on?
- What video is this?

1797
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:18,860
We didn't prepare it.

1798
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,190
- You didn't?
- No.

1799
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,260
- I guess they prepared something.
- Take tissue paper in advance.

1800
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,900
Please give me one piece too.

1801
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,100
- My nose is runny.
- I'm tearing up already.

1802
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,200
I'm tearing up now.

1803
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,940
- Let's play it.
- Let's go.

1804
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,270
Jong Min, we'll play it.

1805
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:31,740
- Shouldn't we turn off the lights?
- What is it?

1806
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,010
- What's going on? Who is in it?
- This is the opening of the video.

1807
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,480
- Is it like an old video?
- Where is that?

1808
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:39,480
- "This is a quick announcement."
- What's this?

1809
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,280
"Jong Min's pre-wedding..."

1810
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,320
"for the whole country
will start shortly."

1811
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,060
"For those who are watching
the show,"

1812
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:51,230
"please watch the video with us."

1813
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,260
Pre-wedding?

1814
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,360
Shall we say it together? 2 Days...

1815
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,660
- And 1 Night.
- Goodness.

1816
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,370
(Lee Su Geun,
Season 1's National Worker)

1817
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,970
Dear Jong Min,
congratulations on your wedding.

1818
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:04,140
I just want to say this to you.

1819
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,670
Just live your life...

1820
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,740
like me, you got that?

1821
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,080
- He has a happy marriage.
- Respect your wife.

1822
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,650
And I hope you will become a husband
respected by your wife.

1823
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,350
You know this story
because you were there.

1824
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:16,850
- My son's baby nickname was 2 Days.
- Right.

1825
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,820
If you get to give
a baby nickname...

1826
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,560
to your child,

1827
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,860
it would be nice
to name them 2 Days.

1828
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,260
Congratulations on your wedding.

1829
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,360
Thank you, Su Geun.

1830
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,130
- Jong Min.
- It's Tae Hyun.

1831
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,630
(Cha Tae Hyun,
Season 2 and 3's MC Generous)

1832
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:29,930
(Happy to see Tae Hyun)

1833
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,930
Congratulations on your wedding.

1834
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:38,270
I wish you a happy marriage...

1835
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:40,140
with your wife.

1836
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:42,540
The most important thing...

1837
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:45,550
- is to listen to your wife.
- All happy men say that.

1838
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,050
- And...
- I have to listen to my wife.

1839
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,820
whether it's a boy or a girl,

1840
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,090
I hope you have a baby
that looks just like you.

1841
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:57,030
Your baby will dominate...

1842
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,630
Korea's variety show scene
in 20 years.

1843
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:02,330
- I hope we'll have such talent.
- Talent?

1844
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,070
Congratulations again.

1845
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:05,430
Thank you.

1846
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,940
- Jong Min.
- It's Joon Ho.

1847
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,010
You need to fix your entire mindset.

1848
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:12,610
Getting married is not a joke.

1849
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,210
From now on, lighten up the mood...

1850
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,910
when you shoot the show.
Work even harder.

1851
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,250
You should never get fired.

1852
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,450
There is no permanent show
like this one.

1853
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:25,420
Did you shoot about 1,000 episodes?
Stay there until 2,000 episodes...

1854
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,690
so you can support your kid
until they go to college.

1855
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,860
You have to work
until your 70s and 80s.

1856
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,990
- That's for sure.
- He's right.

1857
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,630
Congratulations, Jong Min.
I'll see you at the wedding...

1858
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,000
on April 20.

1859
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,200
- Jong Min.
- Jung Hwa.

1860
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:42,070
(A congratulatory message
that we're grateful for)

1861
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,740
- You're getting married too?
- It's Jung Hwa.

1862
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:44,870
(Jung Hwa is someone who can't be
left out from Jong Min's life.)

1863
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:47,380
(Uhm Jung Hwa,
Jong Min's Sister Man Ok)

1864
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:49,180
You're getting married too?

1865
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:54,720
I'm so happy for you.
Congratulations on your wedding.

1866
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,150
To me, you are still a young boy...

1867
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:01,920
who came to dance with me with
such a young and beautiful face.

1868
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,090
We danced together
while making a V sign on stage.

1869
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:07,800
It still feels like yesterday
when we danced together.

1870
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:11,970
When I think of you, I always think
of you as a young dancer from then.

1871
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,840
You're still like a young boy to me.

1872
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,840
You have always been a good boy.

1873
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:20,270
You danced with charisma on stage.

1874
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:22,680
But when you came down the stage,
you told silly jokes...

1875
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,950
that weren't funny at all.

1876
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:27,180
You tried hard to make me laugh.

1877
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:30,220
- True.
- Are you becoming a Love-man...

1878
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,120

after your father died
when you were young.

2040
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,850

in our family...

when I think about it.

2044
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:24,730
You wouldn't know how proud I am
of my son...

2045
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:26,630
who worked hard and endured well...

2046
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,900
through the troubles on his own.

2047
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,140
I've not done much for you,

2048
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:35,880
but I've received so much from you.

2049
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:40,880
It's a bit late,
but I'm really happy...

2050
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,350
you found a good partner
and are getting married.

2051
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:44,020
I hope only good things...

2052
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:46,520
will come your way from now on.

2053
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,260
I pray the path you two walk...

2054
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,390
- will be rosy.
- Goodness.

2055
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,590
I get to smile when I think
about a son who resembles you...

2056
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:56,030
and a daughter
who looks like your wife.

2057
01:09:56,830 --> 01:10:00,400
I lived a happy life until now
thanks to you,

2058
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,670
so I wish you would be happy
from now on.

2059
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,210
Thank you, and I love you. From Mom.

2060
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:08,810
(Thank you, and I love you.
From Mom.)

2061
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,080
Thank you, and I love you. From Mom.

2062
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:22,820
(Mom's letter ends.)

2063
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,560
(And Father)

2064
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,600
(Father)

2065
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,600
(And Father)

2066
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,730
(Father)

2067
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:37,000
(The word alone makes him tear up.)

2068
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,840
I think he felt a lot of pressure...

2069
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,980
(He tried to fill in
for his father's absence.)

2070
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,410
because his dad wasn't there.

2071
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,510
(The high school student
had to grow up fast.)

2072
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:46,950
I think he became mature fast
because of that.

2073
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:49,080
(The high school student
had to grow up fast.)

2074
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,950
(Seoul episode in Season 3)

2075
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:55,290
(What kind of father would he
have been if he was around?)

2076
01:10:55,460 --> 01:11:01,760
(A father I could drink soju with)

2077
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,300
I think he would have bragged
about Jong Min a lot.

2078
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,270
His father...

2079
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,500
was an extrovert
and got along with people well.

2080
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,610
He would have talked about his son.

2081
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,410
He would have bragged.

2082
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:18,310
(Jong Min's father would have been
prouder of him than anyone.)

2083
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:24,220
(Jong Min came to live
as many years as his father.)

2084
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:29,220
(He is now on the new path
of marriage.)

2085
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,030
(We moved the time that stopped...)

2086
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:35,760
(to bring back the memories
of those days.)

2087
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:46,270
(AI-generated pictures
of Jong Min's family)

2088
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:49,740
Goodness.

2089
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,880
(This is fascinating.)

2090
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,280
This is fascinating.

2091
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,190
If he had been around,

2092
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,990
- This is fascinating.
- he would have been proud of you...

2093
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,690
and said you were really great.

2094
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:06,090
He would have bragged
about how great you are.

2095
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:09,460
He would have bragged
about you being humorous...

2096
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,300
because you resemble him.

2097
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,670
- This is fascinating.
- Well done.

2098
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,500
Goodness.

2099
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,970
He would have encouraged you...

2100
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:20,170
to live a good life in good health.

2101
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,480
It's so lively.

2102
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:23,440
All the best, son.

2103
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:33,820
He has his face. They look similar.

2104
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:35,560
Goodness.

2105
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:39,860
He would have encouraged you...

2106
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,800
to live a good life in good health.

2107
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,800
Goodness.

2108
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,130
Goodness.

2109
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,740
Goodness.

2110
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,450
This is fascinating.

2111
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:03,380
Groom, Kim Jong Min.
You may bow to your parents.

2112
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:08,090
(Groom, Kim Jong Min.
You may bow to your parents.)

2113
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:21,940
(4. March)

2114
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:24,300
- That marks the end...
- How fascinating.

2115
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,170
of Kim Jong Min's pre-wedding.

2116
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,410
Groom Kim Jong Min.

2117
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,350
You may march
toward your happy marriage life.

2118
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:33,780
That's from today.

2119
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:39,820
(The end of Jong Min's pre-wedding
for the whole country)

2120
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,790
Thank you.

2121
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:52,370
- We cried more than him.
- I know. Goodness.

2122
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,700
(Swollen)

2123
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,900
- This...
- We cried so much.

2124
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,300
It's embarrassing.

2125
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:58,210
They asked us to narrate...

2126
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:00,870
to make us cry.

2127
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:03,680
I know. I didn't know
they would make such a clip.

2128
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,550
- Really?
- They asked us to record it.

2129
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:09,980
We were wondering
how it would be played.

2130
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,620
This...

2131
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,590
How do you feel?

2132
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:17,220
It's fascinating, though.

2133
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:20,490
It's fascinating.

2134
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,630
It is fascinating.
They prepared so much.

2135
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:23,630
(He doesn't say much
because he's shy.)

2136
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:24,700
Right?

2137
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,330
(Smiling, crying)

2138
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,840
Thank you.

2139
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:33,410
You resemble your father.

2140
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:34,640
- Do we look similar?
- Yes.

2141
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,280
The last time I saw him
was when I was really young,

2142
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,380
so at some point,
I couldn't remember him so well.

2143
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,280
It's not like I look
at his pictures every day.

2144
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:44,020
My childhood memories
were disappearing over time.

2145
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:46,450
But I remember him
after seeing this.

2146
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,090
I think we look alike.

2147
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,460
- You have his face.
- Yes.

2148
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,190
I thought
I didn't look like him at all.

2149
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:52,860
Was he ill?

2150
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:53,930
- What?
- Was he ill?

2151
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:55,360
- It was an accident.
- How?

2152
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,130
He drowned in the sea.

2153
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:58,430
Really?

2154
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:00,430
Really?
That was a terrible accident.

2155
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:02,040
- It was terrible.
- It was terrible.

2156
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,670
He fell into it as he was parking.

2157
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:04,870
It was when the tide came in.

2158
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:06,270
Really?

2159
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,540
Did you go and tell him
you were getting married?

2160
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,540
We're planning to go.

2161
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,740
- You were going to go?
- Yes.

2162
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:11,850
What are you going to tell him?

2163
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:13,780
Well...

2164
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,550
"I was too late."

2165
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:18,790
"It's upsetting."

2166
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:20,950
"It would've been great
if you could be there."

2167
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:23,090
I think I'll say these things
to him.

2168
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:25,230
"It would've been great."

2169
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,730
- He would really love to be there.
- Right.

2170
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,500
Your mother got emotional...

2171
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,660
- in the middle.
- Right.

2172
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:31,670
- She kept sniffling.
- Right.

2173
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,900
- She got emotional.
- Right.

2174
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:37,340
As your father was missing,

2175
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:41,980
I think your mother was determined
to become a stronger mother.

2176
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,410
Right. She had to take care
of everything on her own.

2177
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:46,610
Starting from such a young age,

2178
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,520
you didn't rely on your mother...

2179
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,320
and kept working...

2180
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,390
after starting with the dance team.

2181
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:53,950
I did try to rely on her.

2182
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,220
Right.

2183
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,460
- But she had no money.
- Wasn't that when you were young?

2184
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:59,030
I tried to rely on her
when I was in high school,

2185
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:02,000
but she didn't have any money.
She must've felt so frustrated too.

2186
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,330
I do think about how hard
it must've been for her...

2187
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:05,730
now that I'm an adult.

2188
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:09,200
As I'm about to get married,
I get these thoughts...

2189
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,740
that it must've been tough for her.

2190
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:15,910
This is a letter
written by your mother.

2191
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:17,580
I will give it to you.

2192
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,510
- The letter she read out from.
- Right.

2193
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:21,950
This is the first time my mom
wrote me a letter.

2194
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,990
- She's usually very blunt.
- Right.

2195
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:26,850
She has great handwriting.

2196
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:29,020
- She does have great handwriting.
- Right.

2197
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,320
She has great handwriting.

2198
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:33,530
She must've run out of paper
while writing.

2199
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:34,630
Right.

2200
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,830
(There wasn't enough paper
for his mother to write out her heart.)

2201
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:38,670
Well,

2202
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,170
my father passed away...

2203
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:41,870
- before I got married.
- Right.

2204
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:44,400
He wasn't around for quite a while
before I got married.

2205
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,040
I always long for those moments...

2206
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,140
- when he could've been with us.
- Right.

2207
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:50,110
I got married, had children,

2208
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:52,210
and lived busily throughout my 20s.

2209
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:54,380
He's missed even more as things
just started to become stable.

2210
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:56,280
- Right.
- He wasn't able to...

2211
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,190
- enjoy these moments of joy.
- Right.

2212
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:00,020
I blamed him for leaving early
when I was young,

2213
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:03,760
but I now feel pity for him
not being able to be with us.

2214
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,290
It would've been great
if he were to be with us.

2215
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:07,290
I was a lot like you, Jong Min.

2216
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:10,060
I should've expressed my heart more
toward my mother...

2217
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:13,230
before getting married,

2218
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:15,200
but I wasn't able to.

2219
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,940
I just lived on without doing that.

2220
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:20,970
I wasn't able to show my gratitude
toward her.

2221
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,740
- Sons are especially like that.
- Right.

2222
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:26,210
- I know it could be hard for you,
- Right.

2223
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:29,020
but you should make an effort...

2224
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,390
- Right.
- and be able to express your heart.

2225
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:32,590
Got it.

2226
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:36,120
(DinDin moves quietly...)

2227
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,990
I liked this one.

2228
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:39,530
(and puts up a picture
of Jong Min's parents.)

2229
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,630
Please say a word to them.

2230
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:44,030
(The blunt son's letter
to his parents)

2231
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:45,230
Mother and Father!

2232
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,270
I'm going to get married.

2233
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,600
I've grown up this much,

2234
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,010
and I'm going to get married
although it is quite late.

2235
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:55,040
It would've been great
if you could've been here, Father.

2236
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,640
It's really upsetting.
You left so early...

2237
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:01,620
without me being able to
give to you.

2238
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,750
That is the most heartbreaking part
for me.

2239
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:07,050
I should've bought you nice things.

2240
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:10,460
It's upsetting that I wasn't able
to do that for you.

2241
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:14,130
Mom, you're already...

2242
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:16,260
over 70 now.

2243
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,600
I believe time will fly by again...

2244
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,040
like it already has.

2245
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:26,240
I will try my best to treat you well
every single day.

2246
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:30,140
I will live a happy life now
as I will be getting married.

2247
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,410
I will stay healthy...

2248
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,880
and make sure to visit you, Dad.

2249
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,720
Thank you so much for everything.

2250
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,060
I love you.

2251
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:45,690
Gosh.

2252
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:51,100
You had the ddakji in your hand
back then.

2253
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,100
(Jokes are made
to make him feel better.)

2254
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,870
I almost laughed out loud.

2255
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:59,840
(But he sheds tears in the end.)

2256
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:01,480
Gosh, it's because of you.

2257
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,980
I really didn't expect to cry.

2258
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:05,850
I think his father will listen
from above...

2259
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:08,080
- with the exact same smile.
- Of course.

2260
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,280
He will listen
with that look on his face.

2261
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,720
He will be at your wedding.

2262
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,450
- Of course, he will.
- Right.

2263
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:25,130
(After filling in
many years of time,)

2264
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:30,070
(you finally realize how big
their missing presence was.)

2265
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:31,970
- Thank you.
- With this energy,

2266
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,370
you must live a happy life,
no matter what.

2267
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:34,440
- Right.
- Right.

2268
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,080
It doesn't sound like a bad idea...

2269
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,980
to see the sunrise
to receive some good energy.

2270
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:39,910
- Do you think so?
- He can receive some good energy.

2271
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:41,180
- Right.
- Right.

2272
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,520
I can go up alone, but...

2273
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,090
"Thank you, everyone!"
You can shout out things like that.

2274
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:46,890
The viewers will know this.

2275
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,490
I've played these games
for 18 years.

2276
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:49,920
Games are played under a promise.

2277
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:50,960
(Laughing)

2278
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,190
- I can't go against that promise.
- All right.

2279
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:54,860
- A promise made with the viewers.
- Right.

2280
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,300
- Gosh.
- Got it.

2281
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,500
Thank you.

2282
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:00,400
- It might be a bit disappointing...
- That was a nice wrap-up.

2283
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,740
- to just end things here.
- Right.

2284
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:05,270
We'll give you a simple snack.

2285
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,710
- Really?
- Yes.

2286
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,740
- You can talk all you want...
- Really?

2287
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,140
before going to bed.

2288
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,480
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

2289
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,280
We get snacks whenever
someone gets married?

2290
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,550
You should get married next week,
Joon.

2291
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,320
It's you next.

2292
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:19,720
- Thank you.
- Should I take a picture for you?

2293
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:22,320
(With my parents, April 20, 2025)

2294
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,190
It really is simple.

2295
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,660
I was expecting fried chicken,
at least.

2296
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:27,660
Let's make a toast
with the soft drink.
Sure.

2297
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,160
- Congratulations on your wedding.
- Thank you.

2298
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,700
You should practice making a toast.

2299
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,130
You have to speak well
in front of the elders.

2300
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:36,600
He's the national son.

2301
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,610
He is also the national brother.

2302
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:40,970
I would really like to
congratulate you on your wedding.

2303
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:43,110
When I say, "2 Days,"
you all should say, "And 1 Night."

2304
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:44,580
- All right.
- It's for Jong Min.

2305
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,450
- All right. 2 Days!
- And 1 Night!

2306
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:47,880
- Nice one.
- Congratulations.

2307
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,050
- That was neat.
- That was neat.

2308
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:53,850
- What a precious moment.
- Right.

2309
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,120
It was great.

2310
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,220
(Jong Min stood in front of
the notes even after the shoot.)

2311
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:03,100
(He had a long conversation
over the phone with his mother.)

2312
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,230
(The members fell asleep right away
out of exhaustion.)

2313
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,570
(Darkness still lingers...)

2314
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:12,670
(at the break of dawn.)

2315
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:15,280
(Current time: 5:25 a.m.)

2316
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,980
(Director Ho Shin carefully
enters the base camp.)

2317
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:20,510
- Sae Ho.
- Yes?

2318
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,520
- You must leave to see the sunrise.
- Okay.

2319
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,620
(The one who must see the sunrise)

2320
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,420
Let's go.

2321
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:28,520
(He serves his punishment.)

2322
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,590
Dong Hoon?

2323
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:30,760
Hey, Dong Hoon.

2324
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:34,530
You're up early because of me.

2325
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,230
Unfortunately, I lost.

2326
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:40,170
- Why did you do that?
- Exactly.

2327
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:41,700
(He has nothing to say.)

2328
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:42,740
(I trusted you.)

2329
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:44,000
I couldn't see the faces.

2330
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,370
I'm sorry, Dong Hoon.

2331
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:46,410
(How could you not tell?)

2332
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:49,980
But we've had it good for us
up until now, right?

2333
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,010
(We've had it good for us.)

2334
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:54,010
So this is the entrance.

2335
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:55,880
Okay. Let's go.

2336
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,120
(The countless stairs appear.)

2337
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,950
So we go up these stairs.

2338
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:02,860
(The hiking begins in earnest.)

2339
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,360
Gosh, it's...

2340
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,730
(Looking around)

2341
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:08,090
The mountain before the sunrise
is scary.

2342
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,330
(Pitch-black)

2343
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,830
Gosh.

2344
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,530
Gosh.

2345
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,800
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

2346
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:19,540
I'm feeling great.

2347
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:20,910
(It's me, Positive Cho.)

2348
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,680
(Acting differently from his words)

2349
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:23,910
(Struggling)

2350
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,280
Gosh, this is nice.

2351
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:27,310
This is great.

2352
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,180
(Using all of his positivity)

2353
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,990
(Around 20 minutes later)

2354
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:35,090
(I'm dying.)

2355
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:36,190
We're here.

2356
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:38,020
Gosh.

2357
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:40,360
(He climbed up without any talking.)

2358
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,530
So this is it.

2359
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:44,400
(He has finally reached the top.)

2360
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:47,530
This is a great sunrise spot
of Naedo Island...

2361
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:49,100
where the blue sea blossoms up
like a camellia flower.

2362
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,740
It's the Sesim Viewing Point.

2363
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:52,940
Sesim Viewing Point?
That's such a nice name.

2364
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:55,940
On a day with clear weather,
even Daema Island can be seen.

2365
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:58,480
Let's look for it
when the sun rises later.

2366
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:01,250
Okay. So that's Daema Island.

2367
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,120
Hello, everyone. It's me, Sae Ho.

2368
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:07,290
I will share some morning tunes...

2369
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:08,890
that can be listened to
at this hour...

2370
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:10,520
before the sun rises.

2371
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,520
(Laughing)

2372
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,590
Why are you laughing at me?

2373
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:16,260
I will share some morning tunes.

2374
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:19,230
At a moment like this,

2375
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:22,400
I will shyly play our song.

2376
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:25,410
Gosh, it became bright
after chatting.

2377
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:28,040
Gosh, it's coming up now.

2378
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,680
(Darkness fades away,
and the sky is painted red.)

2379
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,510
It's beautiful. Gosh.

2380
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:32,750
(Sae Ho's face is painted red too.)

2381
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:35,720
It's beautiful.

2382
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,980
If you focus on it,

2383
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:40,290
you can see it come up slowly.

2384
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:41,450
That's so exciting.

2385
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,620
It's up.

2386
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:45,490
It's up.

2387
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:48,160
It's up. It's beautiful.

2388
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:49,830
It's beautiful.

2389
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:52,270
(The sky is full of red.)

2390
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:54,330
(The sea shines brilliantly.)

2391
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:55,400
It's beautiful.

2392
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,470
(Holding together)

2393
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:09,720
(Sae Ho makes a wish.)

2394
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:14,450
I can't keep my eyes off it.

2395
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:21,160
You guys should go down first.

2396
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,900
I'll go down
after enjoying it a bit more.

2397
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,970
(The second day on Naedo Island
was especially bright and clear.)

2398
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,040
(Sae Ho returned after watching
the sunrise.)

2399
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:38,450
(Sae Ho gets back to sleep
after his miracle morning.)

2400
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:43,420
(The sea regains
its blue color again.)

2401
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,320
(It's time to get up.)

2402
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:49,060
(The wake-up song plays.)

2403
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:51,090
(Wriggling)

2404
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:54,460
(Greeting the morning
with Jong Min's song)

2405
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,660
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

2406
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:57,800
(Great job.)

2407
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:58,830
I enjoyed it.

2408
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:01,300
- Was it cold?
- It wasn't cold.

2409
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,500
(Seon Ho was worried about Sae Ho
who had to carry out the penalty.)

2410
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,140
- Did you go up the mountain?
- Yes.

2411
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,110
Great job.

2412
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:07,540
(You went through so much
early in the morning.)

2413
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:11,910
(All the members are up.)

2414
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,080
It was really cold yesterday,

2415
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,580
- but the weather is nice today.
- I know.

2416
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:16,880
It's really nice.

2417
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:19,020
Did you guys sleep well last night?

2418
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,490
- Yes.
- Yes.

2419
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:23,490
Kkamsoon.

2420
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:25,330
- How cute.
- You're up, Kkamsoon.

2421
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:27,660
- Kkamsoon.
- My gosh.

2422
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:28,830
- Kkamsoon.
- She's so elegant.

2423
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:30,100
Kkamsoon.

2424
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,100
(Kkamsoon walks away
without even looking back.)

2425
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:33,730
Today's morning mission is...

2426
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,000
Island Escape Ticket Game.

2427
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,010
- Seriously, don't do this.
- My gosh.

2428
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:40,110
All right.

2429
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:42,180
- We have six envelopes.
- Yes.

2430
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:43,940
Some of them have the tickets...

2431
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:45,610
that will allow you...

2432
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:47,510
to escape the island by boat
right away.

2433
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,320
- Some of them?
- How many are they?

2434
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:51,420
You can decide on the order
as you want.

2435
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:53,020
Please pick one envelope each.

2436
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:55,320
- Does the order matter?
- Can I choose first?

2437
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,920
- Let's just pick what we want.
- Sae Ho went to see the sunrise,

2438
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,190
- so we should let him choose first.
- You go first, Sae Ho.

2439
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:00,060
- I'll pick one.
- You got the good energy there.

2440
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,630
Seriously, I prayed today.

2441
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:03,730
- Let me choose one. I pick this.
- Go ahead.

2442
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:05,330
(I prayed
while watching the sunrise,)

2443
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:06,870
(so I must have good energy.)

2444
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:08,740
- It looks like an empty envelope.
- I have a good feeling.

2445
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:10,740
- Do you?
- It's not bad.

2446
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,110
(They're done
choosing one envelope each.)

2447
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:14,270
I prayed while watching the sunrise.

2448
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:15,410
Who wants to switch with me? You?

2449
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:16,710
- No.
- Are you serious?

2450
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:18,040
- I'm fine.
- Let's switch.

2451
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,610
- The principle of variety shows.
- Exactly.

2452
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:22,650
When I'm asked to change it,
I should change it to make it fun.

2453
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:23,650
Exactly.

2454
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:26,420
I prayed a lot.

2455
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:28,220
- For what?
- I prayed for good things.

2456
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:29,460
Okay. Open it, then.

2457
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,020
- You should open it first.
- Shall I go first?

2458
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,530
- Will the prayer work?
- I woke up...

2459
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:33,830
early in the morning...

2460
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:35,460
and prayed to the sun.

2461
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:37,130
- Cho Sunrise.
- All right.

2462
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:38,630
- Go, Cho Sunrise.
- Open it now?

2463
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:40,300
- Cho Sunrise?
- Sunrise Cho.

2464
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:46,570
(Let me go home
with the energy of the sunrise.)

2465
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:50,010
- It's a ticket.
- It's a ticket anyway.

2466
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:51,680
Hang on. This feels good.

2467
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,980
- It's a ticket.
- What do I do?

2468
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:57,120
What kind of ticket is it?
It says a boarding ticket.

2469
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,920
(Boarding ticket)

2470
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,550
(Is it the ticket to go home
from the beginning?)

2471
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,190
It says a boarding ticket.

2472
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,690
(Sae Ho gets off work.)

2473
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:06,760
Is this it?

2474
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:08,460
(Unbelievable)

2475
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:10,460
- Is this it?
- Really?

2476
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,000
- My prayer worked.
- What?

2477
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,700
- It worked!
- What's going on?

2478
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,870
(Excited)

2479
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:18,640
This is happening
because your prayer worked.

2480
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,640
- It worked.
- Right.

2481
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,110
No more good things for you.

2482
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:22,840
- The last luck of this year.
- Yes.

2483
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,010
- This is it.
- Is it over now?

2484
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:26,880
It's okay.

2485
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,920
(It's okay
because I'm getting off work.)

2486
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,650
- Do you want to go next, Joon?
- Joon.

2487
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:33,550
- We switched, so we will go later.
- Okay.

2488
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:35,490
I'm sorry,
but I'm not interested in yours,

2489
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:36,690
so make it quick.

2490
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,190
- Why aren't you interested?
- Why not?

2491
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:41,890
- Why would you say that?
- I think you will...

2492
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:43,260
end up sitting here.

2493
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:44,260
- Hey.
- Hey.

2494
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,500
- I'm quite lucky.
- Okay. Just open it.

2495
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,730
- Is this it?
- Good.

2496
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,800
- Take it out?
- Yes. Just do it.

2497
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,500
Hang on. I missed it.

2498
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,840
Hang on. I missed it.

2499
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,240
(He's clumsy, indeed.)

2500
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,510
- You surprised me.
- I missed it.

2501
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,110
- The boarding ticket.
- Here I go.

2502
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:00,510
One, two. Go!

2503
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,880
- Oh, no.
- Oh, dear.

2504
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,520
- This is unbelievable.
- It leaves at 11:15 a.m.

2505
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:05,990
- This is unbelievable.
- It leaves at 11:15 a.m.

2506
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:06,990
(Lee Joon fails
to escape the island.)

2507
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,220
- He will be doing something.
- It leaves at 11:15 a.m.?

2508
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:11,360
Hey, you're quite prophetic.

2509
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,930
Joon is sitting like that.

2510
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:14,730
What will he do for three hours?

2511
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,300
- He will leave after three hours.
- My gosh.

2512
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,470
(Depressed)

2513
01:28:19,530 --> 01:28:22,600
(DinDin's prediction was right.)

2514
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,040
- What about this?
- Unbelievable.

2515
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,470
Jong Min is getting married soon.

2516
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:28,680
- Yes.
- Let's test your luck.

2517
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,740
- Okay. Here I go.
- The groom.

2518
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,550
- Take it out slowly.
- The groom.

2519
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:34,810
March.

2520
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:39,920
(What is the result
of the groom's march?)

2521
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:44,420
(Will he walk on a rosy path
like the virgin road?)

2522
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,830
- It's... It says 15.
- It says 15.

2523
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,090
Here.

2524
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:50,030
(Oh, my goodness)

2525
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:52,300
It's 11:15 a.m.

2526
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:53,800
I'm so stressed out.

2527
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,070
- You switched your ticket with his.
- Yes.

2528
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:57,700
Then I'll go next.

2529
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,970
- Is there something?
- Take it, Se Yoon.

2530
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:01,910
I picked it carefully for you.

2531
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:03,610
- He might go with you.
- Okay.

2532
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:05,010
- I picked it carefully for you.
- My gosh.

2533
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:07,250
- There aren't many.
- Let's go together, Se Yoon.

2534
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:09,050
What? There aren't many.

2535
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:10,120
We should go together.

2536
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:12,750
(Current Getting-off-work Status)

2537
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:14,220
This is unbelievable.
I picked a good one.

2538
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,720
We didn't have to
switch our envelopes.

2539
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,420
I would've been doomed
if I switched mine.

2540
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:21,230
- This is nice.
- You two will open it together.

2541
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,500
Let's do it at the same time.

2542
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:25,260
- Okay.
- Here we go. One, two, three.

2543
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,170
(What's the fate of these two?)

2544
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,540
- It's 9:15 a.m.
- It's 9:15 a.m.

2545
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:33,010
(Seon Ho gets off work.)

2546
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:37,210
(Does that mean mine says 11:15 a.m.?)

2547
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,680
(DinDin gets off work.)

2548
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:45,920
(The three of them are going home.)

2549
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,450
I'm so happy.

2550
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:48,860
- My gosh.
- This is amazing.

2551
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,290
What are they doing?

2552
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,890
There were three.

2553
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,330
I lost it
after playing rock-paper-scissors.

2554
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,160
Congratulations on your wedding,
Jong Min.

2555
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,360
Congratulations.
