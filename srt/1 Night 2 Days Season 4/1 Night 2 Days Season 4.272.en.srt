1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,310
You have to just go for it.
Whether you get 2 or 3.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,910
(Please help me, jegi.)

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,480
You don't want to do too poorly...

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,110
compared to the time you spent.

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,750
- Here goes.
- My gosh.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,320
Hey. You're doing it.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,290
Five, six, seven,

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,690
- eight, nine,
- You got it.

9
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,120
ten,

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
- eleven,
- No way.

11
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,390
twelve, thirteen,

12
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,430
- fourteen, fifteen.
- He's doing too well.

13
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,430
Shoot!
- Fifteen.
- He's doing too well.

14
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,430
(Shoot)

15
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,460
It's okay.

16
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,000
- You can beat that.
- Shoot!

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
(Se Yoon scored 15.)

18
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
(Quite disappointed)

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,200
It's okay. We stand a chance.

20
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,210
- Oh, my gosh.
- Fifteen's a good number.

21
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,970
If we lose, so be it.

22
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,480
Fifteen's a pretty good number.

23
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
Hang on.

24
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,110
Se Yoon scored 15.

25
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,450
Se Yoon, you did great.
Fifteen is a good number.

26
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,220
We can't blame Jong Min.

27
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,620
- Right.
- I'm nervous.

28
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,320
(Putting him at ease
is just adding more pressure.)

29
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,390
I won't drag it on.

30
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,690
- I'll start right away.
- Okay.

31
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,960
Here I go.

32
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,460
- Go for it.
- Here goes!

33
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,530
(He kicked a jegi for 18 years.)

34
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,160
(He's the recognized jegi master.)

35
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,500
Here goes! I'm ready.

36
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,540
(Can he score more than 15?)

37
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,540
I'm ready.

38
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,840
One, two,

39
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,110
three, four, five,

40
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,840
- six, seven.
- He got it.

41
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,910
(The jegi master
has a stable stance.)

42
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,110
(He went over 10 in no time.)

43
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,180
- It's over.
- Stay on it.

44
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,850
- Oh, dear.
- Gosh.

45
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,920
Stay on it.

46
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,650
(He's at 14 already.)

47
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,790
(Just 2 more and he wins.)

48
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,760
(No...)

49
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,930
(Praying he slips up)

50
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,260
Shoot.

51
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,370
(He leisurely scored 16.)

52
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,270
You're our hero.

53
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,440
You're our hero!

54
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,240
- Sae Ho should've played.
- No. I wouldn't have managed.

55
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,810
You can relax tomorrow morning.

56
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,280
Well done. It was all you.

57
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,150
- Let's Show Off Yeoju.
- Okay.

58
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,420
Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball won.

59
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,920
- Yes!
- One, two...

60
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,550
Kim Jong Min!

61
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,990
Kim Jong Min!

62
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,320
- Kim Jong Min!
- Kim Jong Min!

63
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,490
(Today's MVP)

64
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,960
- Kim Jong Min!
- What do we do?

65
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,860
Tomorrow, Team Saeri...

66
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,760
Do they go to Yeosu?

67
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,800
(No way...)

68
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,170
The Yeoju Cherry Blossom Festival is on.

69
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,670
- Okay.
- You'll perform at the opening...

70
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,670
of the Yeoju Cherry Blossom Festival.

71
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,070
(You'll perform at the opening.)

72
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,840
You'll perform at the opening.

73
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,810
(They'll headline the opening
of the Cherry Blossom Festival.)

74
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,910
- What?
- Without even brushing our teeth?

75
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,480
- With what?
- In front of a crowd,

76
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,980
we'll perform
without even washing our faces?

77
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,890
What time does the festival start?

78
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,290
The opening event starts at 11 a.m.

79
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,260
- Hey, it's not bad.
- But...

80
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,290
If it's an opening stage,
do we sing or what?

81
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,530
Team Saeri just lost,

82
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,400
so you must prepare
whenever you have the time.

83
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,600
We can do it.

84
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,470
How long must they perform for?

85
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,100
Don't they have to be up there
for 20 to 30 minutes?

86
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,370
Is it a concert?

87
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,610
I can chat for 30 minutes.

88
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,110
- I can talk.
- Sae Ho, that's...

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,380
exactly how you get
all the people to go straight home.

90
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,320
We'll now head over
to the base camp.

91
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,690
- You all did well.
- This is madness.

92
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,790
(The next morning)

93
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,120
(In front of a large crowd)

94
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,530
(The three men
get on the opening stage.)

95
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,630
That's so cool.

96
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,740
(It's a short show,
but they worked hard on it.)

97
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,710
(We'll reveal all later.)

98
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,610
We walked a lot today.

99
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,950
We're almost reaching 10,000 steps.

100
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,250
Joon is studying the song.

101
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,590
(A song by Sobangcha is playing.)

102
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,350
This is a simple song indeed.

103
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,620
It's simple. It's not hard.
So a lot of people dance to it.

104
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,960
(That's a great song by Sobangcha.)

105
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,500
- You know what?
- Then...

106
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,030
Or Se Yoon, Joon,
and I could do this instead.

107
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,800
- Okay.
- To me, I am

108
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
(Sae Ho's recommendation)

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,300
("I to You, You to Me" by Jatanpung)

110
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,640
The song by Jatanpung.

111
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,240
("I to You, You to Me" by Jatanpung)

112
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,510
(The song reminds the listeners
of their youthful memories.)

113
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,140
(The clear voice of the vocalist
stands out.)

114
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,610
- That could be a nice song too.
- To sing that,

115
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,010
you have too much phlegm.

116
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,220
- Who? Me?
- Yes.

117
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,280
(Rejecting the song
due to Sae Ho's phlegm)

118
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,850
What about "Meeting" by KOYOTE?

119
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,320
"Meeting" by KOYOTE?
I love that song.

120
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,320
("Meeting" by KOYOTE)

121
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,460
(Along with the title track
of their 1st album, "Pure Love,")

122
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,860
("Meeting" was well-received.)

123
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,230
(The song is a great example
of KOYOTE's cheerful music style.)

124
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,930
(It's a lovely song for a proposal.)

125
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,500
- Sing "Meeting."
- There's "Our Dream" too.

126
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,870
- There's also "Meeting."
- Sing "Meeting."

127
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,770
Sae Ho, you can sing Shinji's part
as Husky Shinji.

128
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,510
- Husky Shinji.
- Husky Shinji.

129
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,710
(Shinji's replacement, Husky Shinji)

130
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,280
- Forget everything
- How about Phlegmy Shinji?

131
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,480
(Phlegmy Shinji?)

132
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,750
"To You" is a great song too.

133
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,380
(Another song to consider,
"To You" by Infinite Track)

134
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,650
- Right. By Infinite Track.
- That's a great song too.

135
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,390
("To You" by Infinite Track)

136
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,460
(The song won the Grand Award...)

137
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,260
(in the 1988 College Musicians Festival.)

138
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,230
(A popular festival song
for its upbeat, hopeful melody)

139
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
(Dancing with his short arms
to advocate the song)

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,240
One, two, three, four.

141
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,840
(Mastering the choreography)

142
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,170
You can dance to it right away.

143
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,640
- Then...
- We can turn here.

144
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,940
You can dance to it right away.

145
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,980
(As they listen to
Sae Ho's singing...)

146
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,350
We can add that too.

147
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,620
Right. We can sing in the back
as the chorus singer.

148
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,750
Let's go with "To You."

149
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,250
- I'd vote for "To You."
- Let's change it to "To Yeoju."

150
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,490
- "To Yeoju"? My gosh.
- My gosh. That's nice.

151
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,120
Watch this.

152
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,760
(Team Saeri starts practicing
right away.)

153
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,790
I love the intro.

154
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,790
(Team Saeri starts practicing
right away.)

155
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,000
"I'd like to thank everyone
for coming today."

156
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,670
"We'll put on a fun performance
for you."

157
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,100
"Even if it's not perfect, I hope
you still show us your support."

158
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,740
"Our performance will begin now."

159
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,870
Gosh, he's good.

160
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,410
No way.

161
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,880
Hey, this is great.

162
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,050
(How will Team Saeri's version
of "To You" in Yeoju turn out?)

163
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,350
(They arrive at the base camp
as they spend time singing.)

164
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,090
- We're doing something right away.
- It's already set up.

165
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,090
- We're doing something right away.
- What's going on?

166
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,760
Make yourselves comfortable and sit.

167
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,800
Okay.

168
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Gosh, this is nice.

169
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,770
- We're doing something right away.
- This is...

170
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,170
- Yes.
- Okay.

171
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,140
Everyone, you're enjoying
your trip today. Right?

172
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,870
- Yes.
- Yes. It's great.

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,840
The highlight of our trip in Yeoju
still remains.

174
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,870
- What is it?
- You mean the Dinner Game?

175
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,840
You all know
Yeoju is famous for rice, right?

176
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,240
- We must have its rice. It's good.
- Yes.

177
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,110
- Yes.
- Say no more.

178
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,380
It's also mentioned
in the Geography Section...

179
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,450
of "The Annals of King Sejong."

180
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,080
Yeoju had been known to have
great rice from the ancient times.

181
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,990
Rice from Yeoju was included
in the royal meal for the kings.

182
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,590
Its rice is known
to be sweet and tasty.

183
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,590
It's sweet. The rice is different.

184
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,190
That's why we prepared this meal
for your dinner.

185
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,630
It's a Korean set meal
with Yeoju rice.

186
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,190
Nice. We ought to try the rice.

187
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,360
- Let us show it to you.
- My gosh.

188
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,030
- You'll show it to us?
- Bring it in.

189
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,100
- What is that?
- Is that chicken soup?

190
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,100
- Gosh, that's crazy.
- Put it right here for us to see.

191
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,140
- You said it'd feature Yeoju rice.
- My gosh.

192
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,410
I see soy sauce marinated crabs.

193
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,480
- Soy sauce marinated crabs!
- Look at the roe.

194
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,910
It's got japchae too!

195
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,510
Clear chicken soup
with sarcodon mushroom.

196
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,510
- My gosh, chicken soup.
- I love it.

197
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,250
Doenjang braised pork shoulder
with sweet potatoes.

198
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,720
- That's the one.
- It's doenjang braised.

199
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,050
Soy sauce marinated crabs.
Spicy eggplant japchae.

200
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,090
- Eggplant japchae.
- My gosh.

201
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,660
Shiitake mushroom
and perilla seed jeon.

202
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,990
- I see. That one.
- Shiitake mushrooms?

203
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,330
Korean melon kkakdugi.

204
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,490
- That's Korean melon kkakdugi?
- That's Korean melon?

205
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,530
- Yes.
- KMK?

206
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,900
- Gosh.
- That looks good.

207
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,900
Gosh, mixing that with Yeoju rice
would taste amazing.

208
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,130
That sounds so good.

209
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,640
(Here's the set of dishes
that call for rice.)

210
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,770
Is there a dish
you want to taste in particular?

211
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,970
- The soy sauce marinated crabs.
- The soy sauce marinated crabs.

212
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,210
I want to mix Yeoju rice
with the soy sauce marinated crabs.

213
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,680
I want to have a bite of the rice
like that.

214
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,180
My gosh.

215
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,480
(I desperately want to eat this.)

216
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,450
The Korean set meal with Yeoju rice
is at stake...

217
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,850
on the Dinner Game today.

218
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,720
- Will we play as a group?
- It's called the Sixth Sense.

219
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,220
- It sounds like...
- There must be a twist.

220
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,460
The game consists of six rounds.

221
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,760
- And you will play as a group.
- Okay.

222
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,130
- As a group?
- Yes.

223
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,160
- Great.
- Each question has...

224
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
a designated number of people...

225
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,900
to answer correctly. If you succeed,
you can keep the dishes.

226
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,630
- That sounds tough.
- Every time you fail,

227
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,100
you will have to remove a dish.

228
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,000
- This is going to be hard.
- Are you with me so far?

229
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,540
At the starting point,
you'll only see the keywords...

230
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,580
and the number of people
who must answer correctly.

231
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,510
You will leave one at a time,
listen to the question,

232
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,950
head over to the answer room,

233
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,550
- and answer the question.
- Okay.

234
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,080
Just based on the keywords?

235
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,750
This won't be easy.

236
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,720
Then we have to answer the question
inside the room?

237
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,760
- That's right.
- I see.

238
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,830
- This won't be easy.
- Let's give it a try.

239
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,290
There are six questions then.

240
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,530
If we get one question right,
we can keep the marinated crabs.

241
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,970
- Yes. Let's give it a try.
- It might not be that bad.

242
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,230
- We will now begin...
- That sounds tough.

243
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,030
the Dinner Game.

244
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,500
- Yes!
- We can do this.

245
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,640
The keyword of this round is...

246
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,940
- the children's story.
- The children's story?

247
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,010
- I don't know children's stories.
- Me neither.

248
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,040
- I do.
- That's the keyword.

249
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,180
I know a lot of children's stories.

250
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,880
Three of you must answer
the question correctly.

251
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,450
- I don't know any of those stories.
- I don't know them.

252
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,850
What's the occupation
of the seven dwarfs?

253
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,580
- They're miners.
- Right.

254
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,250
- I know that much.
- That's right.

255
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,620
- I know that too.
- Right.

256
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,390
Let's do this then.
So you're outside.

257
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,490
- Let's say it's easy.
- If it's too easy,

258
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,590
- We'd all know it.
- then...

259
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,860
the 1st group of 3 should pass it.

260
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,030
So the last three must get it right.

261
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,030
- Okay.
- They must get it right.

262
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,300
Then I won't answer it correctly.

263
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,870
Joon and Seon Ho
won't answer it correctly either.

264
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,000
- Right.
- But...

265
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,640
- you hear the question and...
- Let's say it's hard.

266
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,040
- Then we must play it for real.
- Right.

267
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,140
- Okay.
- Let's not criticize each other.

268
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,140
- We just have to play it.
- Okay.

269
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,410
If we fail,
there's nothing we can do.

270
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,940
(Strategy for Round 1:
Number of correct answers, 3)

271
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,780
(The first group will get it wrong
if it's easy.)

272
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,850
(If it's hard,
they'll try to get it right.)

273
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,780
(The rest will try to answer
correctly no matter what.)

274
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,380
- Just stick to our plan.
- Okay.

275
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,380
- It depends on your standard.
- Yes.

276
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,450
(The difficulty level
will be a key factor.)

277
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,190
Here's the question.

278
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,130
In the children's story,
"The Three Little Pigs,"

279
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,390
with what material...

280
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,830
did the second pig build his house?

281
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,000
(Sighing)

282
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,230
Isn't there a song about that?

283
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,470
(Does DinDin know
the correct answer?)

284
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,200
(Three little pigs)

285
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,670
(Are playing)

286
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,540
(With beaming smiles like the sun)

287
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,180
(He quickly hums
the children's song.)

288
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,010
(Several baby goats)

289
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,250
Wait, this is called "Baby Goat."

290
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,420
I have no idea. I don't think
anyone can get it right.

291
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,890
How do I know that?

292
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,320
With what material
did the pig build his house?

293
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,460
(DinDin arrives at the answer room.)

294
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,560
Please sit.

295
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,960
All right. Tell us your answer.

296
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,660
(He's supposed to get it right
if the question is too hard.)

297
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,470
I remember the youngest one
building it with straw.

298
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,470
So the wolf blows it down.

299
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,000
That's how his house flies away.

300
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,640
Then the second pig builds it
out of wood.

301
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,140
But that also flies away.

302
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,880
The third one builds it with bricks
and survives.

303
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,680
The second pig builds it
out of wood.

304
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,650
Wood? Okay.

305
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,080
- You don't tell me the answer?
- No.

306
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
I'll reveal it
when everyone is in the room.

307
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,090
But this is a difficult question.

308
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,620
Do people know the answer to this?

309
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,320
(Will Joon know the answer?)

310
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,990
The second pig... Wait.
I don't think they moved out yet.

311
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,400
The second pig...

312
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,260
I mean, they're still piglets.
How can they move out?

313
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,040
I don't think
piglets will live on their own.

314
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,840
That makes sense, doesn't it?

315
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,910
(He's still singing
the children's song.)

316
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,510
- Gosh, this was...
- You can't give him any hints.

317
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,040
Please sit.

318
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,450
Okay.
But this is such an easy question.

319
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,350
Then I should get it wrong.

320
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,380
I must get it wrong.
Did you get it right?

321
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,950
I'll get it wrong.

322
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,190
- What's your answer?
- It's a wooden house.

323
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,220
- A wooden house.
- So it's made of wood.

324
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,230
Yes. It's made of wood.

325
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,890
I said it was built out of wood.

326
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,660
But those piglets don't live
by themselves.

327
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,500
They haven't moved out yet.

328
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,600
I know that the last one builds
a red-brick house.

329
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,370
(The first pig builds...)

330
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,200
(a straw house.)

331
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,510
(The third pig builds...)

332
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,670
(a brick house.)

333
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,580
(What about the second pig?)

334
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,980
(He builds a wooden house.)

335
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,450
They're still piglets.

336
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Come on.

337
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,320
They're moving out?

338
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,360
(So far, 2 of them
answered it correctly.)

339
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,690
(It's the third member,
Seon Ho's turn.)

340
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,930
I should get it wrong.

341
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,590
This is way too easy.

342
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,530
This is way too easy.

343
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,300
- All right. Come in.
- They'll all get it right.

344
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,470
But do you know the answer?

345
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,240
- It's way too easy.
- Really?

346
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Yes. This is an easy one.

347
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,070
- You guys all know it.
- I played it right.

348
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,180
- Okay. The second pig...
- Tell me your answer.

349
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,810
builds the house with cameras.

350
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,950
What's the answer?

351
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,120
- A wooden house.
- A wooden house. Okay.

352
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,550
- It's a wooden house?
- Your answer is a wooden house.

353
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,750
The 1st one is a straw house.
The 2nd one is a wooden house.

354
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,190
The last one is a brick house.

355
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,420
So the second pig builds
a wooden house.

356
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,230
- That's right.
- Then they must get it wrong.

357
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,660
The rest of them must get it wrong.

358
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,700
This is too easy.

359
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,960
I'm sure they all know the answer.

360
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,070
No way. I must stick to our plan.

361
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,040
- All right.
- Look how confident he is.

362
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,170
You must answer it...

363
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,370
as soon as you enter.

364
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,210
A log house.

365
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,280
(He answers it correctly
as planned.)

366
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,080
All right. So your answer is
a log house? Okay.

367
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,110
- Listen.
- What's up with your expressions?

368
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,180
We had a plan. What's wrong?

369
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,520
I thought this was way too easy
and knew you would get it right.

370
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,820
So I got it wrong on purpose.

371
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,960
- But what?
- But these two got it right.

372
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,390
- Why?
- He thought we wouldn't know.

373
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,720
This was way too hard for me.

374
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,430
(On pause)

375
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,100
Hold on. Are you for real?

376
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,860
How can you not know
about "Three Little Pigs?"

377
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,870
It was too hard for me.

378
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,900
- Are you out of your mind?
- This is so easy.

379
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,000
So did you get it right in the end?

380
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,300
(Only 3 of them must get it right.)

381
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,740
- Is this considered easy?
- My gosh.

382
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,410
- This is an easy question.
- It's way too easy.

383
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,210
- It was practically a giveaway.
- Really?

384
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,140
We had a plan. The three of us
were supposed to get it right.

385
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,910
What's the answer?

386
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,710
(Sae Ho enters cheerfully.)

387
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,250
(He senses something is off
with the vibe.)

388
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,420
(Studying the room)

389
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,620
The jibs.

390
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,490
(The jibs)

391
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,290
- The jibs.
- The jibs.

392
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,030
- He didn't stick to the plan.
- The jibs.

393
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,560
- We'll remove the mushroom jeon.
- We'll take that out.

394
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,230
I feel bad, but we still have
a lot of main dishes left.

395
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,870
Will that be the answer room
this time around?

396
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,000
- Yes.
- Okay.

397
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,100
(For this round,
the rooms will be switched.)

398
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,010
(The question zone, the answer room)

399
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,880
The keyword for this round
is sports.

400
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,610
- This is so easy for me.
- I know a lot about sports.

401
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,880
- It will be easy.
- This will be easy for me.

402
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,810
- But you...
- How many right answers?

403
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,850
- Five.
- What?

404
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,220
- Hey.
- I know nothing about sports.

405
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,650
- Okay.
- He knows nothing about sports.

406
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,650
Joon knows a bit about sports.

407
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,750
- I think...
- I know a lot about sports.

408
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,220
Here's an example.
How many players for volleyball?

409
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,460
- Seven.
- Five.
- Seven.
- There are seven players?

410
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,130
- There are 7 players.
- In the 2002 Soccer Game,

411
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,560
how far did Korea advance?

412
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,500
- They advanced to the semifinal.
- The semifinal.

413
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,000
You're the Trash Card
for this round.

414
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,670
- Yes.
- If it's an easy question,

415
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,230
- I'll get it wrong.
- then you...

416
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,770
- Say, "They won."
- Okay.

417
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,170
"How far did Korea get in 2002?"

418
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,610
- Then get it wrong.
- It's too easy.

419
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,510
"How many players for soccer?"
That's easy. Get it wrong.

420
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,880
(Will they be able to succeed
with Round Two?)

421
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,820
Which baseball team won
the KBO League in 2024?

422
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,120
(Which baseball team won
the KBO League in 2024?)

423
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,220
I know nothing about baseball.

424
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,490
I don't watch baseball.

425
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,860
My gosh. I know the answer.
This is driving me crazy.

426
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,060
I really don't know anything
about baseball.

427
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,270
Answer it.

428
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
KIA Tigers.

429
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,240
(He guesses his answer for now.)

430
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,170
- All right.
- Yes.

431
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,780
(Sae Ho said he knew the answer.)

432
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,080
- Should I answer it?
- Yes.

433
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
KIA Tigers.

434
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,710
KIA Tigers.

435
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,550
(It's the same answer as DinDin's.)

436
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,990
(We'll reveal the answer now.)

437
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,990
("KIA Tigers Wins
Both Rounds 1 and 2")

438
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,460
("KIA Tigers Wins
the 2024 KBO League")

439
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,860
("KIA Tigers Beats Samsung Lions
and Wins After 7 Years")

440
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,960
(Correct answer: KIA Tigers)

441
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,630
Do you like baseball, Sae Ho?

442
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,270
But I know
which team won the league.

443
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,740
I also did an interview with
the players from the winning team.

444
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,070
Hold on. I heard the name
of a player from a winning team.

445
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,480
There's no way
five of us can get it right.

446
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,450
- I bet he doesn't know.
- Gosh.

447
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,310
There's no way he knows it.

448
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,090
I think a different team won
the league this year.

449
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,120
- All right.
- My answer is...

450
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,720
LG Twins.

451
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,960
(LG Twins)

452
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,990
I guessed it.

453
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,900
There's no way you would know.
You're not interested in baseball.

454
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
- I don't watch baseball.
- That's understandable.

455
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,070
- Even I didn't know it.
- Right.

456
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,200
He guessed it right, though.

457
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,300
How did you manage that?

458
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,370
He still got it right.

459
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,570
Well, I heard a few things.

460
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,040
Which baseball team won
the KBO League in 2024?

461
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,240
(The rest of them
must get it right.)

462
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,710
I don't know how they'll answer it.

463
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,580
- KIA Tigers.
- KIA Tigers.

464
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,780
- Gosh, they all knew that.
- Didn't we talk about this?

465
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,220
- He's clueless.
- But...

466
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,720
if you don't follow baseball...

467
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,990
- You wouldn't know the answer.
- Right.

468
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,190
We should hope Joon gets it right.

469
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,630
I don't even know the rules.

470
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,890
(Tearing up)

471
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,930
Baseball...

472
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,460
- Joon...
- Seriously.

473
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,170
His mother is from Gwangju.

474
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,930
- So he might know the answer.
- He might know then.

475
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,930
Are KIA Tigers based in Gwangju?

476
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,970
- Joon...
- Will it be hard for them?

477
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,740
might go with his mother's hometown.

478
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,810
He's here.

479
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,140
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet.

480
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,210
(If Joon gets it right,
they will succeed.)

481
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,480
Don't make eye contact.

482
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,710
What's the answer?

483
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,650
Samsung Lions.

484
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,750
(Is that the right answer?)

485
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,050
- Let's get rid of kkakdugi.
- Okay. Kkakdugi.

486
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,590
- Korean melon kkakdugi is out.
- Okay.

487
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,160
- My gosh, this is too hard.
- Everyone.

488
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,230
At this rate, we'll lose everything.

489
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,660
- We'll begin the next round.
- Please.

490
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
- The keyword is...
- What is it?

491
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,000
living organisms.

492
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,270
- I know a lot about them.
- Like biology?

493
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,400
- Living organisms.
- Living organisms.

494
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,570
The number of correct answers...

495
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,470
- is 2.
- We need 2.

496
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,170
Seon Ho knows a lot
about living organisms.

497
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,840
- He must get it right.
- Yes, I'll get it right.

498
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,140
- I'm somewhat knowledgeable.
- You are?

499
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,380
- Jong Min...
- Me.

500
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,380
- Jong Min.
- Yes.

501
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,550
- Seon Ho. Se Yoon.
- Okay.

502
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,580
- The 3 of them... Yes.
- The 3 of you...

503
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,580
- Okay.
- must get it right.

504
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,220
You should go first
and test out the water.

505
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,180
Get it wrong if you think
Se Yoon will know it for sure.

506
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,290
- Yes.
- You get it, right?

507
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,990
- Okay.
- Great.

508
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,120
- If you think Se Yoon knows it,
- My gosh.

509
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,320
- get it wrong. Okay.
- Okay.

510
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,590
(DinDin, Sae Ho, and Joon
will get it wrong.)

511
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,830
(Se Yoon and Seon Ho
will get it right.)

512
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,060
(Jong Min will get it wrong
if it's an easy question.)

513
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,030
(Will they be able to protect
the food this time?)

514
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,100
Let's go.

515
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,440
How many legs do spiders have?

516
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,710
(How many legs do spiders have?)

517
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,740
(Spiders have...)

518
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,010
(8 legs.)

519
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,510
One million legs.

520
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,680
They have 478,720 legs.

521
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,650
- That's correct, right?
- I can't answer that.

522
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Ten legs.

523
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,090
- Ten?
- Yes.

524
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,620
- That was quite close.
- It was close.

525
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,720
- You know the answer, right?
- I don't.

526
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,760
Really?

527
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,430
(The 2nd group of 3 is
still waiting.)

528
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,430
It might be easy.

529
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,760
How about this one?

530
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,830
For example...

531
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,230
How many legs do spiders have?

532
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,970
How many legs do spiders have?

533
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Well...
(Startled)

534
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,840
Living organisms sound hard.

535
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,040
- Biology.
- So to catch us off guard,

536
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,240
they might make it easy.

537
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,180
How many legs do spiders have?
Eight, right?

538
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,610
- They have 10 legs.
- Singer Gummy has 2 legs.

539
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,610
Two in the front...
Another two on the side.

540
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,650
- Wait, is it 8?
- Yes, it's 8.

541
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,650
They have eight legs.

542
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,150
- That can't be the question.
- Right?

543
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,720
- I think it will be really easy.
- Who's next? You can go.

544
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,990
Okay.

545
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,760
I'll make a judgment call.

546
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,190
I made it this far
by reading people.

547
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,260
- Here's the question.
- Okay.

548
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,530
(Jong Min's judgment call
will be crucial with this strategy.)

549
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,160
How many legs do spiders have?

550
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,300
(Grinning)

551
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
(Oh, my!)

552
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,400
We just went over that question.
We talked about it.

553
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,940
(If it's easy, Jong Min is
supposed to get it wrong.)

554
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,170
We went over it there.
I'm between two answers.

555
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
Okay.

556
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,180
I strongly believe
the other two can get this right.

557
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,950
I believe in them! I do.

558
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,590
(He believes in them
and decides to get it wrong.)

559
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,650
I believe in them.

560
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,820
- The legs...
- How many?

561
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,990
- Ten.
- Ten.

562
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,230
(He confidently says
the wrong answer.)

563
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,230
- Okay.
- Jong Min.

564
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,160
- Did you get it right?
- You purposely got it wrong, right?

565
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,460
- Yes.
- Actually,

566
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,700
it's going exactly as we planned.

567
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,030
- It's going perfectly.
- It's going perfectly.

568
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,340
It's going perfectly.
Everything is going perfectly.

569
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,000
But will Se Yoon know the answer?

570
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,910
Here's the question.

571
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,210
(Will he be able to get it right?)

572
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,910
How many legs do spiders have?

573
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,410
This is insane.

574
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,310
This is so hard.

575
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,080
There are different types
of spiders.

576
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,120
Which spider?

577
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,450
We can start with the giant spiders.

578
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,750
There are different types
such as wolf spiders.

579
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,950
But the singer, Gummy, has two legs.

580
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,890
But spiders in terms of insects
have different numbers of legs.

581
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,160
You can think of a typical spider.

582
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,330
I can go with the spider...

583
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,400
from "Home Alone"
with Macaulay Culkin, right?

584
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,700
Yes.

585
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,200
This is crazy.

586
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,000
Kevin.

587
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,140
It's either 8 or 10.

588
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,710
Right?

589
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,480
Going back and forth
is making me so hungry.

590
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,280
Seriously. I'm about to eat
an egg right now.

591
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,380
I'm warning you.

592
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,880
- I think you lost your weight.
- Gosh.

593
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,450
Going back and forth
is so exhausting.

594
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,480
Your face has gotten slim.

595
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,220
I'll base my answer...

596
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,090
with Kevin's older brother's spider
in "Home Alone."

597
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,090
He said, "Kevin,
you caused trouble again."

598
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,090
That's when the spider shows up.
One, two,

599
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,900
three, four, five, six,

600
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,670
seven, and eight.

601
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,600
I have to decide between 8 and 10.

602
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,200
It's eight.

603
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,570
Eight. That's your answer.

604
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,270
I was spot on.

605
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,510
My hunch has been great these days.

606
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,550
Then I'm 100 percent sure
he got it right. We discussed that.

607
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,720
- Shush.
- See?

608
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,820
- He already knows the answer.
- I mean...

609
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,880
All right.

610
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,090
- What's the answer?
- Eight.

611
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,160
- What? How many?
- Eight.

612
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,960
- What? How many?
- Eight.

613
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,730
- We got it.
- The number of legs for spiders.

614
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,990
The correct answer is...

615
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,800
- eight.
- We did it!

616
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,630
- Okay.
- We did it.

617
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,400
- We did it.
- My gosh.

618
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,770
- Our strategy worked.
- You got it right.

619
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,740
- Jong Min made the right call.
- We did it.

620
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,140
You know what?
When it was just the three of us,

621
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,410
we talked about
the number of legs for spiders.

622
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,670
- Jong Min was bold and gave up.
- You did well.

623
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,440
I said ten.

624
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,740
- Hey.
- Well done.

625
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,580
- Our strategy worked this time.
- Totally.

626
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,010
This is crazy. My gosh.

627
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,350
- Let's keep the marinated crabs.
- Okay.

628
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,820
- Let's keep the marinated crabs.
- Nice.

629
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,990
- That's enough for our meal.
- Hey.

630
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,520
At this rate,
we could get the other two as well.

631
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,090
- Let's do this. Great.
- Great.

632
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,290
- It's in.
- All right.

633
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,890
The keyword for this round is...

634
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,590
loyalty.

635
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,630
- Loyalty?
- Loyalty?

636
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,690
Is it a loyalty game?

637
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,360
- A loyalty game?
- A loyalty game?

638
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,230
And the number of correct answers
is four.

639
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
All right.

640
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,500
This could be a question
for the loyalty game.

641
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
Here's an example.
"Do you think you can do this..."

642
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,370
"for Jong Min? Yes or no?"

643
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,610
It could be something like that.
It's just an example.

644
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,340
Do you know
when Jong Min's birthday is?

645
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,610
November 13.

646
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,650
(Answering it right away)

647
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,650
You're wrong.

648
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,020
We have no choice with this.
We must follow the probability.

649
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,290
One of us must get it wrong
no matter what.

650
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,420
The five of us should try our best.

651
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,490
- Yes. So...
- We have no choice.

652
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,030
whoever goes second must decide...

653
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,560
"Wait, the rest of them
might get it right."

654
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,960
- Then he must get it wrong.
- Right.

655
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,930
- Okay. I got it.
- You'll get it wrong?

656
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,600
- No. I got it.
- It's better that way.

657
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,630
- I got it.
- What are you going to do?

658
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,630
- Will you get it wrong?
- What will you do?

659
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,740
- I'll get it wrong.
- Okay.

660
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,440
Since our previous strategy worked,

661
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,570
- you should try again.
- Try again.

662
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,740
If it doesn't work, that's fine.

663
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,210
(Will their strategy work again?)

664
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,440
Here's the question.

665
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,210
He's a member of 2 Days and 1 Night.

666
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,880
In which month is
Se Yoon's birthday?

667
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,720
(Stopping)

668
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,820
Which month?

669
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,460
(Which month was that?)

670
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,790
Which month?

671
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,660
(Jong Min isn't sure
about the answer either.)

672
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,030
I... Darn it.

673
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,900
Why does it have to be
Se Yoon's birthday?

674
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,700
When is his birth month?

675
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,970
We should have talked about it
a moment ago.

676
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,670
(Friend Sae Ho doesn't seem
to know either.)

677
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,710
Is Sae Ho's birth month November?

678
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,810
(Everyone's reaction is the same.)

679
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,250
I should've asked him.

680
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,910
How would I know that?

681
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,120
(No one knows
Se Yoon's birthday exactly.)

682
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,920
Gosh, I have no idea.

683
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,950
(How many will answer correctly?)

684
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,950
It's driving me crazy.

685
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,520
All right, what's your answer?

686
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,360
(What is DinDin's answer?)

687
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,030
October.

688
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,660
October?

689
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,530
(Jong Min comes in with
a profound and mysterious face.)

690
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,430
All right, what's the answer?

691
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,000
(What is Jong Min's answer?)

692
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,500
November.

693
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,740
(Sighing)

694
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,140
Everyone is coming in
with a gloomy look on their face.

695
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,110
He looks very gloomy.

696
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,580
(The look on his face got
very gloomy.)

697
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,420
He's one of Se Yoon's close friends.

698
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,720
- Based on loyalty...
- We're friends, but...

699
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,520
What's the answer?

700
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,950
October.

701
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,060
- October?
- October.

702
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,620
Or is it April?

703
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,530
Goodness.

704
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm confused between
May and November.

705
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
(Laughing)

706
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,400
(October, October, November)

707
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,370
What's the answer?

708
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,800
(Serious)

709
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
July.

710
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,070
July?

711
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,540
- Which month is it?
- I said October.

712
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,140
- I also said October.
- It must be October.

713
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:28,810
Really?
(Knocking)

714
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,920
- Be quiet.
- I have no clue.

715
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,820
(At that moment, Se Yoon appears.)

716
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,820
I was wondering
why you went in so quickly.

717
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,990
What's the answer?

718
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,090
(Everyone was confused
about Se Yoon's birthday.)

719
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,160
What's the answer?

720
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,000
(Is it October
as DinDin and Sae Ho thought?)

721
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,370
It's May.

722
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,170
(Everyone was wrong.)

723
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,570
I told you.

724
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,610
It's May?

725
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,880
- I said either May or November.
- Your answer was July.

726
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,010
- His birthday is in May?
- No, I said...

727
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,710
I said that it was
either May or November,

728
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,850
but DinDin laughed at me.

729
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,220
That's why I changed my answer.

730
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,780
Sae Ho was completely off.

731
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,820
How could you...

732
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,190
My birthday...

733
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,390
(Blinking)

734
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,090
I wouldn't feel hurt...

735
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,560
if at least one person gets
the right answer.

736
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,460
Really.

737
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,560
Everyone, Joon is coming in.

738
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,000
I bet Joon knows.

739
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,670
- He's close to him.
- My best friend.

740
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,570
I know where he lives,

741
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,400
and I even visited his place.
He's my best friend.

742
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,340
- What's the answer?
- I don't know about others,

743
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,010
but you should know
as my best friend.

744
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,180
June!

745
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,880
Only one person got it right.

746
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,580
Se Yoon was the only one
who got it right.

747
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,380
Was it only Se Yoon?

748
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,850
Se Yoon got his birthday right.

749
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,750
(Crying)

750
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,960
No one knows when my birthday is.

751
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Se Yoon's birthday is in May.

752
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,060
I will never forget it.

753
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,600
Let's move on
without making comments.

754
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,030
Move on before I start
to feel small.

755
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,260
Take out the japchae.

756
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,670
We'll take out the japchae.

757
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,770
The keyword
for the next question is...

758
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,440
- TV.
- TV?

759
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,910
- TV?
- TV.

760
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,480
Three of you must answer correctly.

761
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,110
- Three?
- It's worth trying.

762
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,980
I think we should
brainstorm questions...

763
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,480
before going outside.

764
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,450
What time does
2 Days and 1 Night get aired?

765
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,220
What time does
2 Days and 1 Night get aired?

766
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,690
(Stiffened)

767
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,650
- At 6:50 p.m.
- At 6:50 p.m.?

768
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,890
At 6:50 p.m.?

769
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,090
- Isn't it at 6:45 p.m.?
- Isn't it 6:40 p.m.?

770
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,190
At 6:40 p.m.?

771
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,230
It's at 6:20 p.m.

772
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,790
Isn't it at 6:15 p.m.?
It gets aired very early.

773
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,960
- What?
- Isn't it at 6:20 p.m.?

774
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,560
No, it's at 6:10 p.m.

775
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,770
- It's either at 10 or 15.
- See that?

776
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,130
Everyone's answer is different.

777
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,800
It's at 6:15 p.m.

778
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,470
- You should tell us.
- You don't know?

779
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,570
You don't know
when 2 Days and 1 Night gets on?

780
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,110
- Of course I do.
- You should tell us.

781
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,680
(Why does he look so startled?)

782
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,980
- You don't know?
- Wait,

783
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,450
this must be the question.

784
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,780
- This must be the question.
- Really?

785
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,780
- It must be possible.
- It can't be at 6:15 p.m.

786
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,550
- This must be the question.
- Really?

787
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,620
(Nervous)

788
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,320
I think we guessed the question.

789
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,520
We guessed it.

790
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
(Quietly)

791
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,230
I think we guessed the question.

792
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,960
(Suddenly,
Director Joo becomes busy?)

793
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,960
(Detecting something suspicious)

794
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,470
- Around 6 p.m...
- Okay, I'm going outside.

795
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,030
He's changing the question.

796
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,100
Hurry up.

797
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,170
In that case,

798
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,240
I'll give the wrong answer.

799
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,140
He's typing a lot.

800
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,340
Hurry up over there.

801
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,310
Let's say that you get
a completely different question.

802
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,810
Does that make me successful?

803
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,980
- You did a good job.
- Didn't I?

804
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,150
Your acting was perfect.

805
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,450
Here's the question.

806
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,390
(Was the tactful members' guess
right on point?)

807
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,160
(What will be the question
for Round 5?)

808
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,860
At what time does 2 Days and 1 Night...

809
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,430
get aired?

810
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,270
(The members predicted
the exact question.)

811
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,170
(Ecstatic)

812
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,210
Now I just have to pray
for the show...

813
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,870
to be on at 6:10 p.m.

814
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,940
At 6:10 a.m.

815
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,850
At 5:30 a.m.

816
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,580
- What's the answer?
- At 2 a.m.

817
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,720
- All of us must guess correctly.
- Right.

818
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,890
Guys, do you think
that 6:10 p.m. is correct?

819
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,290
Stop it.

820
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,930
Could it be at 6:15 p.m.?

821
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,190
(If only one of them gets it wrong)

822
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,590
Could it be at 6:15 p.m.?

823
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,860
It's confusing.

824
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,860
(The mission will fail.)

825
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,670
Why do I have this mental image
of the showtime as 6:15 p.m.?

826
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,740
I also thought that it was 6:15 p.m.

827
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,210
I always watch the show
when it gets aired.

828
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,310
I trust you.

829
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,210
Do you think that 6:10 p.m. is correct?

830
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,610
(Will they get crushed by
Director Joo's pressure?)

831
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,950
(What will be Sae Ho's choice?)

832
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,050
When does the show start?

833
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,280
It starts at 6:10 p.m.

834
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,750
Okay, it's done.

835
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,190
- At 6:10 p.m.
- Okay.

836
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,490
- It's done.
- At 6:10 p.m.?

837
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,960
From now on, let's discuss...

838
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,090
before going outside.

839
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,190
I did my best to guess correctly.

840
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,060
Could it be at 6:10 p.m.?

841
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,030
(Se Yoon is in anguish all alone.)

842
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,170
Is it 6:15 p.m.?

843
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,170
I have no choice but to believe it.

844
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,770
Sae Ho definitely said 6:10 p.m.
as the answer.

845
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,310
(He has to say 6:10 p.m...)

846
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,940
(as the answer just like Sae Ho.)

847
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
What's the answer?
(My friend...)

848
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,050
On Sunday evenings.

849
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,080
At six...

850
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,620
(Six in the evening)

851
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,650
At 6:10 p.m.

852
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,090
- At 6:10 p.m.
- Okay.

853
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,490
All of us are counting on Joon.

854
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,960
- Of course.
- We're counting on Joon.

855
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,660
- I'll be your savior.
- It's definitely before 6:15 p.m.

856
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,630
(Now only one person remains.)

857
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,930
I'll go.

858
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,300
(Jong Min sets off.)

859
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,640
Jong Min.

860
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,240
(Jong Min, I believe in you.)

861
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,110
Is it really 6:10 p.m.?

862
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,170
(He's still not sure about it.)

863
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,770
Or is it 6:30 p.m.?

864
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,680
(Jong Min was especially wavered
by Director Joo's words.)

865
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,050
- What's the answer?
- What's the answer?

866
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,520
At six...

867
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,650
(It depends on his answer.)

868
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,920
At six...

869
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,390
(The fate of everyone)

870
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,820
At 6:10 p.m...

871
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,690
(6:10 p.m. or 6:15 p.m.)

872
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,720
At 6:10 p.m.

873
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,630
(Jong Min decided to trust Joon.)

874
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,460
The three of us said
the same answer.

875
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
(If the answer is 6:10 p.m.,
they'll clear the mission.)

876
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,100
It went exactly as planned.

877
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,330
All right.

878
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,000
What time does
2 Days and 1 Night get aired?

879
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,640
In the evening...

880
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
(Please...)

881
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,110
Six in the evening.

882
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,270
- If it's 15, we'll be in trouble.
- It's 10...

883
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,480
Gosh.

884
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Ten...

885
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,350
(6 something in the evening)

886
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,350
Ten...
(6:15 p.m. or 6:10 p.m.)

887
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,450
It's 6:10 p.m.

888
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,650
Lee Joon!

889
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,490
Lee Joon!

890
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,490
It's 6:10 p.m.

891
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,090
(2 Days and 1 Night gets aired
on Sundays at 6:10 p.m.)

892
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,760
Lee Joon!

893
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,530
(Without the slightest hesitation)

894
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,760
(Joon gave a clear answer
to the members.)

895
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,930
Nice, Joon.

896
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,070
- Nice.
- We made it.

897
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,640
- Well done.
- Nice, Joon.

898
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,040
Sae Ho made a good guess.

899
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,140
To be honest, I wasn't sure
about the showtime.

900
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,810
Then Joon helped me out.

901
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,010
- That was great.
- When we were...

902
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,350
talking about this question,

903
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,780
Director Joo's face turned red
and started to shake.

904
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,550
- I got startled.
- How did he act?

905
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,390
He looked like this, so I thought
something was wrong.

906
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,690
I thought that
he was having a seizure.

907
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,160
- He started texting.
- All of a sudden.

908
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,990
What did Director Joo write
in the message?

909
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,700
"There must be some magic..."

910
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,060
"when you come up with questions."

911
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,800
"How did they guess?"

912
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,870
(What he actually wrote in the text)

913
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,970
He was very startled.

914
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,500
Remember what he said?

915
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,570
"My strategy worked, didn't it?"

916
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,240
- By the way,
- It's hard to believe.

917
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,180
when we asked him
about the showtime,

918
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,780
he said,
"If the question is different,"

919
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,140
"it'd mean that
my strategy worked, right?"

920
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,480
What strategy?

921
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
This time...
(Picking a dish to eat)

922
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,350
Why don't we get the pork shoulder?

923
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,690
- There's more of it.
- Let's get that.

924
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,220
- We'll let Joon pick.
- Okay.

925
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,390
- We won thanks to him.
- You're amazing.

926
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,920
- Shall we dedicate it to Joon?
- Pork shoulder.

927
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,890
- It isn't taken away.
- Right.

928
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,960
- The next round.
- It's the last one.

929
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,360
- It's the last one.
- It's the last question.

930
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Okay.

931
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,700
The keyword
for this round is person.

932
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Person?

933
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,570
Three of you should get
the right answer.

934
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,570
Okay.

935
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,970
When it comes to people,
I know many.

936
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,340
Then DinDin should say
the right answer.

937
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,810
- What about you, Joon?
- I'm okay with it.

938
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,940
- Okay.
- Are you okay with it?

939
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,940
- Yes.
- Okay.

940
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,950
Then it'll be the four of us.

941
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,950
Two of you will get it wrong.
Four of us will get it right.

942
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,820
- Okay.
- Go.

943
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,480
- I'll get going.
- Let's get chicken soup too.

944
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,390
- I'll say the wrong answer.
- Right.

945
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,490
- You won't know the answer anyway.
- That's true.

946
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,230
- Here's the question.
- Okay.

947
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,290
(What's the question
about a person for Round 6?)

948
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,930
Who is the first person
in history...

949
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,930
History?

950
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,500
to set the first step on the moon?

951
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,900
The guys won't know the answer.

952
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,610
(The guys won't know the answer.)

953
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,670
They won't know the answer.
I'll say it.

954
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
(Revealing the answer)

955
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,610
(Who is the first person
in history...)

956
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,750
(to set the first step on the moon?)

957
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,820
(Answer: Neil Armstrong)

958
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,820
Gosh.

959
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,320
I'm not sure about this.

960
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,330
It's making me anxious.

961
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,830
We put the members
in the wrong order.

962
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,600
They might say Louis.

963
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,670
Louis Armstrong.

964
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,470
Is that a singer?

965
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,570
(Louis Armstrong is a singer.)

966
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,310
I don't have more ideas.

967
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,740
(Nearby,
Se Yoon's concern came true.)

968
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,880
I studied this in the past.

969
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,650
We're in the wrong order.

970
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,290
This is terrible.

971
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,350
We have many ignorant people.

972
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,090
You probably followed the strategy.

973
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,220
(Ignorant)

974
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,360
(He got it wrong
just as they planned.)

975
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,530
My answer is...

976
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,530
(What is Se Yoon's answer?)

977
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,070
Neil...

978
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,440
Armstrong, a long time ago,
long time, no see.

979
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,540
- Neil Armstrong...
- No.

980
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,710
Neil Armstrong, A Long Time Ago,
Long Time, No See.

981
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,980
- Long Time, No See?
- Okay.

982
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,280
We're in the wrong order.

983
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,180
I feel anxious, don't you?

984
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,150
It's impossible not to know this.

985
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,190
This is so... But...

986
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,220
I'm afraid that
Seon Ho doesn't know.

987
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,560
He'll definitely say
"Louis Armstrong."

988
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,890
(Should I say the right answer?)

989
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,960
- You didn't know?
- I didn't think they'd know.

990
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,200
- You really didn't know the answer?
- No.

991
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,230
(Nodding)

992
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,570
Should I have said
the right answer? I thought you...

993
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,800
(I didn't know
that you were this ignorant.)

994
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,110
I'm afraid that
Seon Ho doesn't know.

995
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,610
(Will DinDin say the right
or the wrong answer?)

996
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,780
Armstrong.

997
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,810
Louis.

998
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,780
- What did you say?
- Louis Armstrong.

999
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,820
Starting from you...

1000
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,620
- He said it wrong on purpose.
- Exactly.

1001
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,990
- Is that so? Right.
- What's the right answer?

1002
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,290
- Neil Armstrong.
- That's right.

1003
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,890
We put people in the wrong order.

1004
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,930
When Seon Ho arrives,

1005
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,230
he might say,

1006
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,460
"Louis Armstrong."

1007
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,630
- He might not know Armstrong.
- That singer.

1008
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,930
He's a singer.
I couldn't remember "Neil."

1009
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,270
Joon would know, wouldn't he?

1010
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,570
(Number 4 Sae Ho goes to
the answer room with confidence.)

1011
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,510
- The first person in history...
- Yes?

1012
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,210
to step on the moon.

1013
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,580
He's doing the moonwalk.

1014
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,350
(Seizing his chance
to show off his talent)

1015
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,320
(Fascinated)

1016
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,720
(His personal talent
that's customized to the question)

1017
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,090
It looks like outer space.

1018
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,290
- Outer space.
- Look at him.

1019
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,560
What's the answer?

1020
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,090
Neil Armstrong.

1021
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,560
What did I tell you? He knows.

1022
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,630
Neil Armstrong.

1023
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,960
- For now...
- Those behind me must answer this.

1024
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,300
Here's the problem.
I think Joon knows,

1025
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,430
- but Seon Ho...
- He probably knows.

1026
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,370
Wouldn't he know this?
Isn't it Neil Armstrong?

1027
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,270
What? I'm drawing a blank
all of a sudden.

1028
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,010
He stuck the flag...

1029
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,480
This is insane.
I can't remember this?

1030
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,790
(Both of them have to get it right
to clear the mission.)

1031
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,090
(Does Seon Ho know the answer?)

1032
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,790
Suddenly, I was drawing a blank.
I thought that I'd get it wrong.

1033
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,800
Who is this person?

1034
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,960
(Seon Ho, who is this person?)

1035
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,900
(What is Seon Ho's answer?)

1036
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:25,970
Neil Armstrong.

1037
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,300
I'm sorry, Seon Ho.

1038
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,570
(Seon Ho is correct.)

1039
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,310
- I'm sorry, Seon Ho.
- For what?

1040
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,040
I remember now.

1041
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,010
Suddenly, I was drawing a blank.
I thought my heart had stopped.

1042
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,180
It's impossible that I don't know.

1043
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,590
So far, only one of us got it wrong
because he didn't know.

1044
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,520
- Everyone, he's coming.
- He's the last one.

1045
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,620
If we succeed,
we'll get to eat that too.

1046
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,160
(If Joon is correct,
they'll win clear chicken soup.)

1047
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,100
(It's hard to tell
from the look on his face.)

1048
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,530
(Desperate)

1049
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,300
- All right.
- Is it the last?

1050
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,010
- For your reference,
- Yes?

1051
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,280
I was in a movie about the moon.

1052
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,410
(No way...)

1053
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,420
- That's right.
- "The Silent Sea."

1054
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,720
He likes outer space.

1055
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,450
What's the answer?

1056
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,760
(What will be Joon's answer
who was in a movie about the moon?)

1057
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,590
Neil Armstrong.

1058
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,660
We got it.

1059
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,160
Three of you answered
"Neil Armstrong" successfully.

1060
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,470
(They cleared Round 6 successfully.)

1061
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,270
- Jong Min is definitely a musician.
- What was his answer?

1062
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,240
Louis Armstrong.

1063
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,440
As soon as he heard the question,
he thought others wouldn't get it.

1064
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,710
He decided to say the right answer.

1065
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,880
He said, "Louis Armstrong."

1066
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
(It was possible
because Jong Min got it wrong.)

1067
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,850
- All right.
- Everyone.

1068
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,620
- We defended well.
- This is good.

1069
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,280
Everyone, here's the result
of Dinner Game.

1070
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,490
Clear chicken soup
with sarcodon mushroom.

1071
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,790
Doenjang braised pork shoulder...

1072
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,060
- This is amazing.
- with sweet potatoes.

1073
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,760
You also won
soy sauce marinated crab.

1074
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,890
- We did a good job.
- Thank you.

1075
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,100
- Well done.
- Everyone, go ahead and eat.

1076
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,460
- Okay.
- Yes.

1077
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,700
Gosh, it looks great.

1078
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,700
We accomplished something very hard.

1079
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,410
We did the impossible.

1080
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,870
Since there are two thighs,

1081
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,580
shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

1082
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,680
- We should give one to Joon.
- Right.

1083
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,310
- Why?
- He didn't get to eat last time,

1084
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,450
- so give it to him.
- No.

1085
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,680
I had a lot of eggs, so I'm okay.

1086
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,120
It was like eating
one whole chicken.

1087
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,320
This is insane.

1088
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
(7 eggs at the restaurant)

1089
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,090
(1 egg while answering a question)

1090
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,960
(He's okay because he had protein
whenever he could.)

1091
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,090
Joon told us clearly
that the answer was 6:10 p.m.

1092
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,730
- One for Joon.
- He gets a part that he wants...

1093
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,670
and a crab shell.

1094
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,930
Thank you.

1095
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,030
That one is for Joon.

1096
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,970
- Yes, it's a thigh.
- Right.

1097
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,780
(Yes)

1098
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,310
You took a thigh.

1099
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,510
- A thigh?
- He picked well.

1100
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,350
Who gets the other thigh?

1101
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,580
Who wants the thigh?

1102
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,750
Let's give it to Se Yoon.

1103
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,450
- Se Yoon has been hungry.
- You should ask him.

1104
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,090
Seon Ho, can you serve me?

1105
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,860
- Give him a thigh.
- I'll give you a thigh.

1106
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,090
- Okay.
- Give him the neck too.

1107
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,230
Se Yoon starved so much today.

1108
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,490
- The thigh.
- It looks good.

1109
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,600
- Okay.
- With the skin.

1110
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,930
The skin too?

1111
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,170
Se Yoon has been hungry today.

1112
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,640
- Eat up now.
- Thank you for the food.

1113
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,170
- Enjoy, everyone.
- This is great.

1114
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,870
- May I have one?
- Take one each.

1115
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,310
Okay.

1116
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,280
The chicken soup is very rich.

1117
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,180
The chicken broth with
sarcodon mushroom is also delicious.

1118
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,050
(Taking a big bite of the thigh)

1119
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,350
Se Yoon is eating properly.

1120
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,580
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

1121
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,690
This is Se Yoon's first meal.

1122
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,020
(He was the only one who had eggs
instead of makguksu.)

1123
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,160
(The reason why
I could only eat eggs was...)

1124
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,860
(to meet this chicken thigh.)

1125
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,300
Se Yoon worked hard today.

1126
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,270
(The taste makes him forget
the difficult moment.)

1127
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,470
- Okay.
- It's sweet.

1128
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,540
(Joon who led them to win
takes a bite of the chicken thigh.)

1129
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,510
(Devouring quietly)

1130
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,080
(It's so delicious
that he could pass out.)

1131
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,920
This is good too.

1132
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,720
This one.

1133
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,990
(A combo of chewy pork shoulder
and savory sweet potatoes)

1134
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,290
This is also good with rice.

1135
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,960
The doenjang is nice and salty.

1136
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,090
There's a lot of good food.

1137
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,700
- The pork shoulder is excellent.
- Right.

1138
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,970
They bring out the best taste
in each other.

1139
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,770
(It's perfect with rice.)

1140
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,340
Look at this.

1141
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,900
(Soy sauce marinated crab is
filled with meat.)

1142
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,740
This is the meat.

1143
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,380
(Sucking)

1144
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,710
The one who takes the crab shell...

1145
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,310
- should take only one leg.
- Okay.

1146
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,180
It's not as salty as you think.

1147
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,550
(Full of plump meat inside)

1148
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,690
It's slightly sweet.

1149
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,890
You can't stop eating rice
with the marinade.

1150
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,620
This is wonderful.

1151
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,090
(This time, he eats some rice.)

1152
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,490
The rice is good too.

1153
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,060
Isn't the rice amazing?

1154
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,660
The rice is sweet and tasty.

1155
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,670
How is it different?

1156
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,270
It's different
because it's rice from Yeoju.

1157
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,300
(Topping Yeoju rice
with marinated crab)

1158
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,370
Look at this.
It's impossible to resist.

1159
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,340
My goodness.

1160
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,480
(His spoonful is
as big as a rice bowl.)

1161
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,180
There are roe and guts too.

1162
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,750
(It's tastier with rice from Yeoju.)

1163
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,790
(DinDin mixes rice
in the crab shell.)

1164
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:14,190
Rice can also make
side dishes taste better.

1165
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,730
Of course.

1166
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,960
The soy sauce marinated crab...

1167
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,430
and the rice are
so delicious together.

1168
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,430
(The combination of
soy sauce marinated crab and Yeoju rice)

1169
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,530
(The taste makes
even a picky eater eat a lot.)

1170
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,070
It's best to eat
with the whole group.

1171
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,170
(Completely satisfied
with the Yeoju set meal)

1172
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,840
(Rummaging)

1173
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,910
(An egg all of a sudden?)

1174
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,170
Se Yoon, are you eating another egg?

1175
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,780
I want to eat it with the soy sauce.

1176
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,880
(Using the remaining soy sauce)

1177
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,710
- That's fascinating.
- That's a good idea.

1178
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,120
This is so exciting.

1179
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,690
(Taking a bite)

1180
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,450
Try the soy sauce with rice.

1181
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,690
It's delicious to dip the rice in.

1182
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,520
In the soy sauce?

1183
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,560
(The second bite
after dipping in the sauce)

1184
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,000
(The third bite with pork shoulder)

1185
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,270
(Eating the egg in various ways)

1186
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,170
Se Yoon must like eggs a lot.

1187
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,800
They say that you don't gain weight
when you eat eggs.

1188
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,540
That was a great meal.

1189
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,610
- Everyone, did you enjoy your meal?
- Yes.

1190
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,710
Let's take a quick break.

1191
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,710
Then we'll continue.

1192
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,510
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1193
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,650
We need to practice "To You."

1194
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,380
I want to lie down, but...

1195
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,450
- I'll show you the dance.
- Stretch...

1196
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,890
- on the left. Stretch on the right.
- On the right.

1197
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,520
- Stretch both arms.
- Stretch both arms.

1198
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,790
- Then poke.
- Okay, let's stop there.

1199
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,430
Stretch the left arm, right arm,
and both arms.

1200
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,530
Let's try it.

1201
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,630
(Let's rehearse it together.)

1202
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,930
To the front.

1203
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,970
(They rehearse for the first time,
but they're in sync.)

1204
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,000
(Singing)

1205
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,100
- That's it.
- One more time.

1206
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,140
Do we sing too?

1207
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,540
(Rehearsing by looking at the window
instead of a mirror)

1208
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,880
(Cameraman Seon Ho appears.)

1209
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,150
(We'll introduce Team Saeri
on 2 Days and 1 Night.)

1210
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,590
(Main dancer with a hoarse voice,
Cho Sae Ho)

1211
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,020
(Director Yoo films him head-on.)

1212
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,660
- Who's next?
- It's me.

1213
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,330
Clap.

1214
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,800
(Making eye contact
like a former idol singer)

1215
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,960
You look handsome.

1216
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,900
(Main vocalist with the looks,
Lee Joon)

1217
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,800
Everyone on 2 Days and 1 Night.

1218
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Run!

1219
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,840
(At the place)

1220
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,080
(Soulful vocalist who induces reception,
Moon Se Yoon)

1221
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,110
One more time!

1222
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,810
- You just need...
- It looks clean.

1223
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,580
- to clean it up.
- How?

1224
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,090
- We should sweep things up.
- Right.

1225
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,790
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

1226
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,860
- Go forward.
- Okay.

1227
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,760
Get ready. Here we go.

1228
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,830
(Opening abruptly)

1229
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:30,830
(Screaming)

1230
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:31,990
What's going on?

1231
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,930
- What's going on?
- What is it?

1232
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,800
(The members are taken aback
by the staff's ambush.)

1233
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,510
(They can't seem to figure out
what's going on.)

1234
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,810
(He applauds for now.)

1235
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,940
Nice!

1236
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,610
Let's do this!

1237
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,610
- What's going on?
- Nice. What are you guys doing?

1238
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,620
- They set it all up so quickly.
- They finished it so fast.

1239
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,290
- I haven't seen them this fast...
- They suddenly came in...

1240
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,620
- in the last 18 years.
- and set it up so quickly.

1241
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,590
- Why did they scream?
- What's going on?

1242
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,020
Why did you all scream?
What's going on?

1243
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,160
You've never set up the cameras
this quickly. What's up?

1244
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,190
(Are we going
to be taken somewhere?)

1245
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,830
The cheers
livened up the mood, though.

1246
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,600
- The mood became livelier.
- Indeed.

1247
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,130
- I feel more energetic.
- I like this atmosphere.

1248
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,800
- Did you take some rest?
- Yes.

1249
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,000
No, we didn't rest.

1250
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,570
- We were busy rehearsing.
- They rehearsed...

1251
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,640
while we played a table tennis game
where the loser got hit.

1252
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,070
All right. That's good.

1253
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,480
It's time...

1254
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,840
- for Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.
- Yes.

1255
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,880
Today, you'll play a game as a team
to decide where you'll sleep.

1256
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,880
The game requires good teamwork.

1257
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,150
- We have good teamwork these days.
- We have great teamwork.

1258
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,150
Your opponents are...

1259
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,120
- the staff members.
- I get it.

1260
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,720
- That's why they were so energetic.
- So that's why you cheered.

1261
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,230
We have a different mindset...

1262
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,690
- for playing this game.
- Of course.

1263
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,630
We'll have to sleep outside
if we lose.

1264
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,000
- Exactly. It's life or death.
- This is crazy.

1265
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,770
- To make it fair,
- Yes?

1266
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,570
how about the staff members
sleep outside if they lose?

1267
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,640
- That's a good idea.
- Right.

1268
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,140
- That's a neat idea.
- Sounds great.

1269
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,840
- There should be a penalty for you.
- It's only right.

1270
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,980
Jong Hyun, you're the leader,
so you should decide.

1271
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,750
- You should take responsibility.
- My point, exactly.

1272
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,310
- Aren't we family?
- We're all family.

1273
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,620
You always want to see us suffer
while you're comfortable.

1274
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,780
Then we'll just enjoy ourselves
and sleep inside even if we lose.

1275
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,920
(Seon Ho seems
unusually determined today.)

1276
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,490
- What do you say? It's a good idea.
- Right.

1277
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,720
If you're not confident,
just leave so we can go to bed.

1278
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,260
- Then...
- Right. All of you can leave now.

1279
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,290
What do you say? Let's keep it fair.

1280
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,300
(Director Joo's pride is scratched.)

1281
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,760
- The players from our team...
- Let's make it clear.

1282
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,930
are motivated and enthusiastic.

1283
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,700
- Really?
- Yes.

1284
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,870
So they will sleep outside
if they lose.

1285
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,640
- Okay.
- Only the players?

1286
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,270
- Yes, they will sleep outside.
- Are you serious?

1287
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,410
It's the cast members
versus the players from our team.

1288
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,210
(Sleeping Outdoors Match:
Staff members versus cast members)

1289
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,780
(If the staff members win,
all cast will sleep outside.)

1290
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,310
(If the cast members win,
the staff will sleep outside.)

1291
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,820
(Who will sleep outside?)

1292
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,120
- From what I've seen... Yes.
- They've never slept outside.

1293
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,890
- Let's do this.
- I love the idea.

1294
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,320
Let's be sure to win.

1295
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,520
The two players in each round
will decide the game to play...

1296
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,060
- through discussion freely.
- We choose a game?

1297
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,490
- Really?
- Any game you want.

1298
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,700
You don't know
how good of teamwork we have.

1299
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,100
Right. It's time to show them
what we're capable of.

1300
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,300
The first player
from the staff is...

1301
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,430
"It's me."

1302
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,140
- It's me.
- I was right.

1303
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,340
- What?
- Oh, is it Jong Hyun?

1304
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:57,870
- Really?
- Yes.

1305
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,580
- "It's me."
- What? "It's me."

1306
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,840
- "It's me."
- "It's me."

1307
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,950
- "It's me, the leader."
- Jong Hyun will play?

1308
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,450
You guys can decide
who will compete against me.

1309
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,550
DinDin, you and Jong Hyun are like
sworn enemies.

1310
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,450
- You two can play Cham, Cham, Cham.
- Cham, Cham, Cham.

1311
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,550
This will be fun to watch.

1312
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,190
- But...
- How about Cham, Cham, Cham?

1313
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,560
(They're 2 to 0 overall
against each other.)

1314
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:21,430
(Director Joo always let DinDin
fool him.)

1315
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:25,030
(Will Director Joo accept it
and play Cham, Cham, Cham?)

1316
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,400
Let's play a game
that you want to play.

1317
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,600
(If you're scared,
you can choose another game.)

1318
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,800
(Aggravated)

1319
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,040
- What game do you want to play?
- That pose annoys me so much.

1320
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,140
He's genuinely annoyed.

1321
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,480
What game do you want to play?

1322
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,150
So you're saying it doesn't matter
what you'll play?

1323
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,510
- That's what you mean.
- No. I can play Cham, Cham, Cham.

1324
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,010
Good. You'll definitely win this.

1325
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,920
- What game do you want to play?
- Then I will choose...

1326
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,850
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1327
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,190
(Annoyed)

1328
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,390
(The cast members seem excited.)

1329
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,120
- If he wins this time...
- Really?

1330
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,930
He must be thinking inside,

1331
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,560
"I lost many times in a row,
so I'll win at least once."

1332
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,760
"I hope it'll happen today."

1333
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,200
(Laughing)

1334
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,930
I'm 100 percent sure.
He must be hopeful.

1335
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,170
- He's held on that dream until now.
- Right.

1336
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,500
- I feel bad for him already.
- Today...

1337
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,070
How about the loser gets
a forehead flick?

1338
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,610
- Why should we do that?
- A forehead flick?

1339
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,140
You just want to hit me.
Isn't that it?

1340
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,180
(He got caught.)

1341
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,440
- Why should we do that?
- Exactly.

1342
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,450
The idea just popped in my head.

1343
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,110
DinDin,
you won't get hit if you win.

1344
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,620
Or how about the loser gets hit
in the butt...

1345
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,650
with a table tennis racket?

1346
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,050
The loser gets hit in the butt.

1347
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,520
- In the butt?
- Yes.

1348
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,120
- Let's do that.
- Let's give them a hand!

1349
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,890
- The first round has been decided.
- You've got this!

1350
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,260
It's only natural
for Director Joo...

1351
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,100
to have been traumatized.

1352
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,860
- When it comes to this game,
- His record is...

1353
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,400
- he kept losing.
- He has no wins, does he?

1354
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,230
- He has no wins.
- Lim Cheol did a great job...

1355
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,640
- at playing mind games.
- All right.

1356
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,070
- Here we go.
- It's a single-round match.

1357
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,640
- It's a single-round match.
- He's good at mind games.

1358
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,270
I'll turn my head to this side.

1359
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,640
- To what side?
- To the left.

1360
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,680
- He'll turn his head to the left.
- Look at Jong Hyun.

1361
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,210
- DinDin is honest.
- You see...

1362
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,180
The director seems so nervous.

1363
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,420
Look at his face.

1364
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,950
- Because I've never defeated him.
- His face...

1365
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,090
- One move determines the winner.
- Exactly.

1366
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,920
- They have to close their eyes...
- DinDin.

1367
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,620
Aren't they supposed
to close their eyes?

1368
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,690
(His hand is raised.)

1369
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,700
- Look. His hand is shaking.
- Right.

1370
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,860
I'm ready.

1371
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,160
(The nerve-racking psychological warfare)

1372
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,930
Jong Hyun's hand is shaking.

1373
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,100
DinDin said
he'd turn his head to the left.

1374
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,700
The spectators are
holding their breath.

1375
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,870
- Who will win?
- Why is this so nerve-racking?

1376
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,240
Here I go.

1377
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:14,080
Was Cham, Cham, Cham
always this nerve-racking?

1378
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,810
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Wait.

1379
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,980
(He pauses the game.)

1380
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,080
(Grunting)

1381
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,280
Why?

1382
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,990
(Surprised)

1383
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,020
- What's wrong?
- The game began.

1384
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,360
(Jong Hyun can't do anything
about DinDin's mind game.)

1385
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,490
He suddenly paused the game.

1386
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,190
- Why?
- That must be part of his plan.

1387
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,730
It's a well-known strategy.

1388
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,660
(Impressed)

1389
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,200
He was going to move
to the same side.

1390
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,600
Since I just paused the game...

1391
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,170
His hand was shaking like crazy.

1392
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,000
(For your information,
they're playing Cham, Cham, Cham.)

1393
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,640
- Director Joo will...
- Okay.

1394
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,340
- choose an uncomfortable way.
- I've made up my mind.

1395
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:48,080
- I'm so nervous.
- "I worked hard to come this far."

1396
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,250
- I'm ready.
- He's ready. Let's begin.

1397
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,250
(Raising his arm)

1398
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,550
- They're both quiet.
- Gosh.

1399
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,750
I know I'll win.

1400
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,320
Cham, cham, cham.

1401
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,260
(It's shocking.)

1402
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,390
Cham, cham, cham.

1403
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,960
(DinDin won again!)

1404
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,570
I said I was sure I'd win.
I knew it.

1405
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,900
- He achieved one more win.
- I can't believe this.

1406
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,140
I said I was sure I'd win.

1407
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,540
Right before he started,

1408
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,540
I had the feeling that I'd win.

1409
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,610
- Now it's time...
- He won so easily.

1410
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,880
- Please come forward.
- for you to get the penalty.

1411
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,410
- We need to interview the loser.
- Come forward now.

1412
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,150
You should get hit in the butt.

1413
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:29,280
- Please get into this position.
- Like this? Okay.

1414
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,320
Many of the staff members are
shedding tears.

1415
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,990
They're wailing.

1416
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,290
Oh, dear. All right.

1417
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,720
Here I go.

1418
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,630
- All right. Go.
- This is so humiliating.

1419
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,630
(Hitting hard)

1420
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,000
(Super powerful smash)

1421
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,870
(He hit so well.)

1422
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,870
Does it hurt?
It doesn't hurt, does it?

1423
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:47,940
(He was already sad that he lost,
and he had to get hit in the butt.)

1424
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,410
Let's do it again sometime. Okay.

1425
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,240
- The score is 1 to 0. We won.
- That was amazing.

1426
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,340
(Cast members: 1, staff members: 0)

1427
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,880
- He won every round.
- This is fun!

1428
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:59,750
I'll introduce our next player.

1429
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,080
- Se Yoon.
- He's our trump card.

1430
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,550
It's Director Yu Jae Hyun.

1431
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,920
(The 2nd player:
Director Yu Jae Hyun)

1432
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,490
- He'll suggest leg wrestling again.
- Everyone.

1433
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:09,630
Jae Hyun, is there any one of us
you want to compete against?

1434
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:13,030
(We played leg wrestling
at the winter training special.)

1435
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,770
(Jae Hyun defeated
Seon Ho, Sae Ho, and Jong Min.)

1436
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,500
(And even Joon...)

1437
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,570
(lost to Jae Hyun in leg wrestling.)

1438
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,970
- If you're upset, bring it on.
- Right. Bring it on.

1439
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:25,810
Is there any one of us
you want to compete against?

1440
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,710
Joon...

1441
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,210
Have you been working out your legs?

1442
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,310
- What? That's insulting.
- Leg workouts?

1443
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,720
- What was that?
- But...

1444
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,120
- Oh, he lost before. Did you lose?
- Joon lost to him.

1445
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,820
- Look how loose his jeans are.
- Their thighs are firm.

1446
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,960
- The stronger one suggested...
- Don't do it.

1447
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,530
- I'll do it because I'm insulted.
- Okay!

1448
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,100
All right, Joon.
Can you bring us a blanket?

1449
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,760
I worked out my legs just yesterday.

1450
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,170
If we spread it like this...

1451
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,170
(He chose the game he wanted
by provoking Joon.)

1452
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,370
- He has weak side thighs.
- I see.

1453
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:53,670
But Joon has
strong side and front thighs.

1454
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,270
These are like magic glasses.

1455
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,540
I can't see anything
with these glasses.

1456
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,050
You look like a small-minded fool.

1457
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,550
Try imitating a celebrity
in those glasses.

1458
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,720
"Hello."

1459
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,260
(The exciting magic glasses play)

1460
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,460
- If I lose this time, I'll admit...
- Lie down.

1461
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,060
that my muscles are
a mere fashion item to me.

1462
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,160
Right, Joon.
You must not lose this time.

1463
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,600
You can bend your knees.
You know that, right?

1464
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,170
- Is that allowed?
- Yes.

1465
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,800
- Now, focus.
- Jae Hyun seems nervous.

1466
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,970
Jae Hyun must be nervous.

1467
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,170
Okay. Let's begin.

1468
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,840
One, two, three!

1469
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,410
Great!

1470
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,540
(They wrapped their legs
around each other's!)

1471
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,710
Great!

1472
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,180
(Pull his leg and flip him over!)

1473
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,680
Great!

1474
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:49,520
(Joon lost.)

1475
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,730
(It's hard to believe that
this is real.)

1476
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:53,930
Look at him.

1477
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,800
(Lifting up
the corner of the blanket)

1478
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,070
(Wrapping Joon with the blanket)

1479
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,870
Jae Hyun, here are your glasses.

1480
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,570
Hey, Fashion Muscle.

1481
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,540
- Yu Jae Hyun!
- Yu Jae Hyun!

1482
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,240
- It's okay.
- I mean...

1483
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,650
All these muscles are fake.

1484
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,910
He has such thick thighs,
but he lost.

1485
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,150
Did you see how Jae Hyun expressed
his excitement?

1486
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,390
(I can't believe Joon lost
to a man like him.)

1487
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,650
He seemed proud of himself.

1488
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,620
Hey, sit over there facing the wall.

1489
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,530
- The current score is 1 to 1.
- What? Gosh.

1490
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,930
Joon never works out
his leg and core muscles.

1491
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,400
- Don't even drink water.
- All right.

1492
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,560
Gather saliva
and swallow it instead.

1493
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,930
- The next player is Park Ho Shin.
- Director Park Ho Shin.

1494
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,370
I found this out recently.

1495
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,070
- He runs on a regular basis.
- He's good at running.

1496
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,110
Ho Shin, whom do you want
to compete against?

1497
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:41,610
- I'll choose Sae Ho since he asked.
- Okay. All right.

1498
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,080
But Ho Shin seems almost 40cm taller
than him. That's a big difference.

1499
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,950
- You know...
- What did you say?

1500
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,150
- Nothing.
- Okay.

1501
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,180
- Hey, you...
- What game do you want to play?

1502
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,550
Let's hear what he wants. Or...

1503
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,250
We can play any game you want.
Table tennis, for example.

1504
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,120
- Let's play table tennis.
- What?

1505
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,660
- Really?
- Let's go for table tennis.

1506
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,030
- Okay, table tennis it is.
- Is it for 3 or 5 points?

1507
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,490
- Shall we go for 5 points?
- Let's go for 5 points.

1508
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:00,630
- Great.
- That racket is nice.

1509
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,800
Pick any racket you want.

1510
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
Joon, please move to the corner.

1511
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,100
You can't be seen on the camera.

1512
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:08,640
- You need to be on the camera.
- Face that way.

1513
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,210
(Slowly gliding)

1514
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,010
Put your legs on the fridge.

1515
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,680
- Put your legs there.
- Practice there.

1516
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:17,080
- Have you learned it before?
- When I was in elementary school.

1517
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,310
Then we can't play it.

1518
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,250
(He is a table tennis master.)

1519
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,750
- Have you learned it?
- I've never learned it.

1520
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,250
Not at all? You're so untrained.

1521
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,420
He can surely beat Sae Ho.

1522
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:26,090
What did you learn in elementary school?
Were you in the team?

1523
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,260
- No, I just played with my mom.
- With your mom?

1524
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,390
- Okay.
- Does your mom happen to be...

1525
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,830
Jiao Zhimin or someone like that?

1526
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:33,930
She's not, right?

1527
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,500
- Let's go!
- Don't tell me she's professional.

1528
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,400
Ho Shin's going to serve right now.

1529
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,700
All right. Sae Ho, get it.

1530
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,270
This racket won't hit the ball.

1531
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,010
(A terrible receive from the start)

1532
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,710
(This racket won't hit the ball.)

1533
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,310
(Sensing that something is wrong)

1534
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:49,310
Hey!

1535
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,850
(It looks like
they're going to sleep indoors.)

1536
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,920
- It's 1 to 0. Ho Shin is leading.
- I'll beat him.

1537
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:55,420
Get used to it.

1538
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,150
That's long.

1539
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,620
- The rally is ongoing.
- It's working.

1540
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,320
(Focusing)

1541
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,090
- The rally is ongoing.
- It's working.

1542
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,390
(Sae Ho: 1, Ho Shin: 1)

1543
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,500
(Trying too hard to win)

1544
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,800
He was too greedy.

1545
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,330
You're getting the hang of it.
Tease him.

1546
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,800
There you go. Attack him now.

1547
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,770
Shake him up.

1548
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,200
- There you go.
- You're doing fine.

1549
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,270
(A sudden serve)

1550
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:16,570
- There you go.
- You're doing fine.

1551
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,640
(He received it well.)

1552
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,040
Okay.

1553
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,640
That's too long.

1554
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,180
(He consistently blames the racket.)

1555
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,310
That was too long.

1556
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,080
- That's 2 to 1.
- Right, 2 to 1.

1557
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,120
(Sae Ho: 1, Ho Shin: 2)

1558
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,180
Serve.

1559
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,350
You have to get it.

1560
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,720
(Stuck on the net)

1561
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,690
(Let's swap our rackets.)

1562
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:34,690
(Resuming after exchanging rackets)

1563
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:35,860
- Okay.
- All right.

1564
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,330
- That's 3 to 1.
- You can't lose this time.

1565
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:38,760
You can have a short break
to discuss your tactics.

1566
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,030
- You know...
- Joon.

1567
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,730
- This is like...
- Joon!

1568
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,900
Keep practicing. Work on your legs.

1569
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,540
It's 3 to 1.

1570
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,900
- Two more points to go.
- Sae Ho will join you if he loses.

1571
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,140
- Ho Shin, your turn.
- I'll serve.

1572
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,270
(Director Ho Shin's serve
continues.)

1573
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,210
- Don't try too hard to get a point.
- It's too long.

1574
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:54,740
(Trying too hard again)

1575
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,180
- His move was...
- I knew it was the racket.

1576
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,280
- You can turn the tables now.
- Okay, let's continue.

1577
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,480
Ho Shin wants to make a cool move.
Make use of that.

1578
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,620
He'll lose if you serve it well.

1579
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,250
He wants to show off.

1580
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,560
(They know that Director Park
wants to show off.)

1581
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,420
- Keep giving him the bait.
- Here he goes.

1582
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,690
- That's 3 to 2.
- Let him show off.

1583
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,430
(Sae Ho: 2, Ho Shin: 4)

1584
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:14,130
(All he had to do
was pass the ball.)

1585
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,500
You could have just hit the ball.
That's it.

1586
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,870
(Frustrated)

1587
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,300
(The production crew is happy.)

1588
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,870
Hold on a second.

1589
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:24,240
- This is a match point.
- Sae Ho.

1590
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,640
He's just like Joon.

1591
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:27,080
My gosh.

1592
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:28,880
Why did they want to play
table tennis all of a sudden?

1593
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,510
(Splashing water onto Sae Ho
to get a hold of himself)

1594
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,220
- That's 4 to 2.
- Okay, 4 to 2.

1595
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,850
It's a set point.
Show us what you got.

1596
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,450
Focus now. It's his match point.

1597
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:38,890
(Serving)

1598
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,290
(Sae Ho changed his tactic
to hit the ball with the back side.)

1599
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,560
Just keep hitting the ball.

1600
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,990
(They can't take their eyes off
the ball.)

1601
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:47,830
Don't get too excited.

1602
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:50,030
(The parabola looks a bit too high.)

1603
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,030
(Please)

1604
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,340
Just keep hitting the ball.

1605
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,370
- Don't get too excited.
- Keep hitting it.

1606
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,970
What was that?

1607
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:01,180
(The production crew wins
Round 3 as well.)

1608
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,150
(We saw this deja vu before.)

1609
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,820
- Director Park Ho Shin wins.
- Cho Sae Ho!

1610
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,990
(This is where losers go.)

1611
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,550
Keep training yourself.

1612
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:15,290
Just stay there and train.

1613
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,360
(All of them lost the games
except for DinDin.)

1614
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,060
Try pushing it with your foot.

1615
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,730
Push it. Keep pushing it.

1616
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,800
(Training hard)

1617
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,530
So the score is 2 to 1.

1618
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,240
- That's right.
- The production crew is leading.

1619
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,440
The three of us have to win
if we want to sleep indoors.

1620
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,240
Don't let them choose the games.

1621
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,780
- Let's be shameless.
- All right.

1622
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,810
- Why would we let them win?
- We can't let them win.

1623
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,550
The production crew
is leading the game...

1624
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,750
by a huge difference in points.

1625
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,880
That's not a huge difference at all.

1626
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,250
That offended me.

1627
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,920
- The next player.
- He's an ace.

1628
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,060
- Cho Jun Kyung.
- Director Cho Jun Kyung.

1629
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,160
This is the last shoot for him.

1630
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,230
- He'll do his best to end this.
- Go on.

1631
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,330
- Five years with us?
- Five years?

1632
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,960
And it's his last day here.

1633
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,900
(Director Generation MZ of the show)

1634
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,170
(Young blood
with a good athletic sense)

1635
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,240
We have only three players left.

1636
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,540
As long as it's not Se Yoon...

1637
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,710
(Se Yoon has beaten him before
in ssireum.)

1638
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,810
- All right.
- Okay.

1639
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,180
So you don't want to play
with Se Yoon.

1640
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,050
Everyone else was confident to play
with any of us.

1641
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,450
Just keep quiet.

1642
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:13,650
(Sae Ho has been quiet.
Joon shut his mouth.)

1643
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,280
- He just knows how to talk.
- Seriously.

1644
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,420
- Then...
- What?

1645
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,920
I'll go for a handstand...

1646
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,460
and compete against Jong Min.

1647
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:23,560
- Jong Min can't do it at all.
- You can't play this.

1648
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,460
- It's right before his wedding.
- I'm sorry.

1649
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,300
He might break his back.
So he can't play this.

1650
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,260
- I have to give birth too.
- We have to protect our player.

1651
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,170
How about other games
a pushing game behind a line?

1652
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:35,070
I saw a go board earlier.

1653
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:36,240
- Stone flicking?
- Stone flicking.

1654
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,210
- What about that?
- I'm in.

1655
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,540
- Then...
- Okay.

1656
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,740
- Let's all sit first.
- Let's play.

1657
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,340
Let's pick to see who goes first.

1658
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,350
Then let's make it neat
and have you pick one...

1659
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:45,450
- Okay.
- from the back.

1660
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:46,680
Sae Ho, when did you come here?

1661
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,950
Should I stay there?

1662
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,320
I thought we were playing together.

1663
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,420
(Joon went back to his position.)

1664
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,520
Joon, you can come and watch
if you want to.

1665
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,160
Really?

1666
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,160
Of course, Joon.

1667
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,800
(Thank you.)

1668
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,230
It's stone flicking this time.

1669
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:05,100
It's a tie even if we win.

1670
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,670
We have to win this.

1671
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,170
How about rock-paper-scissors
to decide who goes first?

1672
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:10,570
(Nervous)

1673
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,770
Rock-paper-scissors.

1674
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:13,780
(Director Cho Jun Kyung wins.)

1675
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,280
Cho Jun Kyung will go first.

1676
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,540
- Okay.
- He'll play first.

1677
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,550
His name makes us anxious.

1678
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:19,010
His name tells us
that he'll aim well.

1679
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,480
- "Cho Jun" means to aim.
- Cho Jun Kyung.

1680
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,950
It'll be bad for us
if he aims well just like his name.

1681
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,490
He'll aim to make the stone fall.

1682
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:25,850
- All right.
- Let's go now.

1683
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,890
- Ready?
- You can't touch the stone.

1684
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,920
- You can't touch the other stones.
- Flick it without touching it.

1685
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,990
His hand is pretty
like a cartoon character's.

1686
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,530
(Impressed)

1687
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,000
(He's pretty good.)

1688
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:40,240
(He flicked his stone
to get rid of the black stone.)

1689
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,100
(The white stone spun
on the edge and survived.)

1690
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,240
(Feeling proud)

1691
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,710
He aimed well just like his name.

1692
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,010
(Things are already heated
from the start.)

1693
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,810
- Jong Min, you can do this.
- I don't think I can.

1694
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,280
- You can do this.
- Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

1695
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,520
Try to aim it from the back.

1696
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,720
(Choosing his target)

1697
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,020
Oh, no.

1698
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,550
(Jong Min got it as well.)

1699
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,490
- That was neat.
- You controlled it really well.

1700
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:03,190
(He ended the match
by perfectly controlling his power.)

1701
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,590
(The number of stones left,
Jong Min: 4, Jun Kyung: 4)

1702
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,830
He could lose his stone
while trying to kill this one.

1703
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,700
- It's like the world championships.
- Let's see.

1704
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,570
Cho Jun Kyung is aiming...

1705
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,400
His hand is so pretty.

1706
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,540
You're good!

1707
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,470
(It looks like it's going to be
a tough match.)

1708
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,880
What a high-quality match
for our show!

1709
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,540
He can flick stones well.

1710
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,780
(Missing his shot)

1711
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,950
- He missed it.
- It's all right.

1712
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,650
- Jun Kyung.
- Jun Kyung is a good player.

1713
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,550
- He can aim well like his name.
- He's like a sniper.

1714
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,620
- He's so good.
- Let's see if he can beat again.

1715
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,160
I've never seen
a good player like him.

1716
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,690
- You're hitting it like that?
- If this makes it too...

1717
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:40,400
(All of his shots are accurate.)

1718
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,160
(He's absolutely flustered.)

1719
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,830
(He's so good.)

1720
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,130
Both stones are gone.

1721
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:51,670
(He gave up one of his stones
to remove the black stone.)

1722
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,470
(The number of stones left,
Jong Min: 2, Jun Kyung: 3)

1723
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,210
All right. We're losing by 1 point.
It's 3 to 2 now.

1724
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,280
- I mean...
- There you go.

1725
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,050
- Do something!
- First of all...

1726
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,050
(He's scared again.)

1727
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,180
It's okay. You did well.

1728
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:03,150
It looks like he's going to flick
the stone on the edge.

1729
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,750
- Move it closer.
- Jun Kyung. He can't aim.

1730
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,890
(The white stone is
in the black stone's territory.)

1731
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,560
(His aiming failed.)

1732
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,590
- All right.
- It's a chance.

1733
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,100
Be careful. You'll lose
if you get too excited.

1734
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,730
- There you go!
- You got this.

1735
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,670
(I'm on a roll.)

1736
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,570
(Being careful)

1737
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,840
Jong Min surely is good.

1738
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,070
- It's a tight match.
- I have my know-how.

1739
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:26,210
(Flicking lightly)

1740
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,840
- It's tricky. Jong Min.
- Should I hit it hard?

1741
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,680
It's tempting you.
Are you going to hit it hard?

1742
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,880
Come on.

1743
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,280
- You should have flicked hard.
- I think you're letting him win.

1744
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,920
(The target is right in front.)

1745
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,850
I think Jong Min gave himself in.

1746
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:40,560
(He gets in his position to attack.)

1747
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:43,090
It's here. He's going to flick.

1748
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,290
I mean this one is...

1749
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,130
He'll break down
if he makes a mistake.

1750
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,130
Will he flick it?

1751
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,770
(Shocked)

1752
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,700
(The members face
the biggest crisis.)

1753
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,040
It would be okay
if you get rid of this stone.

1754
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,970
You have to attack now.
Take the chance.

1755
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,040
I mean why...

1756
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,140
- You have to attack now.
- Why are they both so good?

1757
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:04,880
You have to attack now.
Take the chance.

1758
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,150
There you go.

1759
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,450
Take the chance.

1760
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:09,250
(Jong Min succeeds in his attack.)

1761
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:11,550
(Now it's 1 to 1.)

1762
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,660
(Attacking their opponents
whenever they're about to lose)

1763
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,620
There you go. One, two, three, four.

1764
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,490
(Will Jun Kyung
be able to stay calm?)

1765
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:18,630
All right.

1766
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:21,260
(They have 1 stone each now.)

1767
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,130
- Wait a minute.
- Will he flick it hard to end here?

1768
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,530
Or will he play safe?

1769
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:26,830
He's flicking it with his left hand.

1770
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:29,000
- He's going with his left hand.
- What a careful move.

1771
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,310
- But...
- No way. This is too far.

1772
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,740
(Will he be able to end the game?)

1773
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:35,080
This is too far.

1774
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,840
- The last moment.
- No.

1775
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,210
(Jong Min lost.)

1776
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,650
(Director Jun Kyung wins.)

1777
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:45,890
(Letting go of his camera
and clenching his fist)

1778
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,820
He's so good.

1779
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,190
(He ended the game calmly
even when it was 1 to 1.)

1780
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:52,760
There was nothing
you could do about it.

1781
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,800
(The best stone flicking match
of 2 Days and 1 Night history)

1782
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,360
Well done.

1783
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,330
Why would you go this far?

1784
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,800
(Getting dragged)

1785
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,140
Just why?
You could've gone easy on us.

1786
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,310
(Jong Min is put
in the loser zone as well.)

1787
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,240
- Bring it over there and train.
- Jong Min.

1788
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,840
Face front and keep training.

1789
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:11,450
The important thing here
is that only the main director lost.

1790
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,320
It's okay.

1791
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,620
We got fashion table tennis,
fashion muscles and fingers.

1792
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,950
(3 fashion items
are here all together.)

1793
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,620
So the result of
Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors...

1794
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,720
- What? What happened?
- This isn't the end yet.

1795
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,830
- It's not the end.
- It's a tie.

1796
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:24,930
- We still have 2 more games.
- We got 2 games.

1797
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:26,830
I'm sorry. What do we have left?

1798
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:29,130
- It's 3 to 1.
- Are you okay?

1799
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,270
- It's 3 to 1.
- Cheer up.

1800
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:32,500
I'm sorry.

1801
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,740
I should have told them
it'd be best of five.

1802
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,340
It should have ended
after winning three times.

1803
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:39,510
But you can't help it.

1804
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,640
Right, I can't.

1805
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,340
Let's do it this way.

1806
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,280
How about 2 points
for a game with 2 players?

1807
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,010
We can have a final match
if we lose.

1808
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,050
- Okay.
- Sure.

1809
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,850
- The game ends here if we win.
- Okay.

1810
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,550
- So 2 players against 2 players?
- That's right.

1811
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:52,920
Is there any game
that needs two players?

1812
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:54,460
Seon Ho is good at this.

1813
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,890
- Rice Bowl Curling.
- I thought of that too.

1814
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:57,930
Okay. Good.

1815
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,230
(A curling game where the person
who pushes the rice bowl...)

1816
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,600
(closest to the line wins.)

1817
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,330
(The bowl shouldn't go
beyond the line.)

1818
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:08,470
(The first champion, Yoo Seon Ho)

1819
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,100
- I thought of that too.
- Okay. Good.

1820
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,610
- This one.
- You throw one at a time.

1821
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,670
- Amazing.
- Good.

1822
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,710
- We can't do this.
- We have to.

1823
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,180
Just accept it.

1824
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,880
- Will you go with curling?
- Yes.

1825
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,180
- We'd like that.
- Now...

1826
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,620
- Is it a single-round match?
- Single round.

1827
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,690
- Single round.
- It's better to go second.

1828
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:27,220
- Definitely.
- Definitely.

1829
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,320
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1830
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,560
(Team Members will go second.)

1831
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:32,790
- Good.
- A single round.

1832
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,860
You should have your feet
touch the wall. All right.

1833
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,430
Jae Hyun looks like the type...

1834
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,030
who gets so proud...

1835
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:40,300
until he falls.

1836
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,940
- That's the look.
- He'll go overboard.

1837
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,910
That's because
he's in very high spirits...

1838
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,770
after winning the game
against Lee Joon.

1839
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,140
Jae Hyun.

1840
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,480
(His bowl reached
a not-too-good position.)

1841
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:56,550
(Feeling disappointed)

1842
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,190
You can just ignore this one.

1843
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,750
It's a card you can discard.

1844
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,890
- How should I...
- You should go...

1845
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:02,660
a little further than that.

1846
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,830
My heart is beating so fast.

1847
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,330
I think Jun Kyung will make it.

1848
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:07,800
- Moon Se Yoon.
- Why are you saying that?

1849
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:09,830
Moon Se Yoon.

1850
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,370
It's not the usual bowl he uses.

1851
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,400
- I think he'll do it strongly.
- I think he'll do it strongly.

1852
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,940
- Player Moon Se Yoon.
- What will it be?

1853
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,770
- It goes on.
- That's nice.

1854
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,110
- It goes on.
- That's nice.

1855
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,940
- Right.
- That's good!

1856
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,440
- That's good.
- Good.

1857
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,110
We did it. Go ahead!

1858
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,880
- That...
- Let's be safe.

1859
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,650
I'll hit our bowl and move further.
What do you say?

1860
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,650
I'll hit it and make it go further.

1861
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:32,290
Even his name is Cho Jun Kyung.

1862
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,220
- He's good at aiming.
- If Cho Jun Kyung...

1863
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,960
fails this time,
it would be pointless...

1864
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,730
to continue the game.

1865
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,930
Why are you doing it
with so much effort?

1866
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,030
I don't want to sleep outdoors.

1867
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:44,030
- Will he hit it?
- Where will you push it to?

1868
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,000
- He's going to hit it.
- He'll hit it and push it.

1869
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:47,500
(He has to aim successfully to win!)

1870
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:50,570
(We believe in you, Jun Kyung.)

1871
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:51,870
Push it.

1872
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,040
(He failed to aim.)

1873
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:56,980
- Okay! We got it.
- It's over.

1874
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,150
- It's over.
- It's over.

1875
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,520
- It's 3 to 3, right?
- Right.

1876
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,720
We have the last one left.

1877
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,220
(We almost had it.)

1878
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:06,350
What about a group curling game?

1879
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,520
But it's the same game.

1880
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,560
Let's play a different one.

1881
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,260
What other games are there?

1882
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,060
- What group games are there?
- What games are there?

1883
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,060
(What game could be played
in groups of 6?)

1884
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,030
What about a group push-up?

1885
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:17,230
Five people could line up...

1886
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:19,130
and play rock-paper-scissors.
The team with more winners wins.

1887
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:21,100
Why don't we really play
rock-paper-scissors?

1888
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,370
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Yes. It's simple.

1889
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,910
- No.
- We could do that.

1890
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:26,610
It's the most powerful one.

1891
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,340
Rock-paper-scissors. Move.

1892
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,440
Rock-paper-scissors. Okay. I lost.
I'll just move aside.

1893
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,550
We'd get a good reaction if we lose.

1894
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,980
Is it a sweeping game?
Will the winner keep playing?

1895
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,080
That's right.

1896
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,690
It ends when a hero appears.

1897
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:38,790
We just need one hero.

1898
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:40,960
We'll have
a rock-paper-scissors hero!

1899
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,360
- It's about the spirit!
- Let's do this.

1900
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,690
Let's go in order of height.

1901
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,060
Let's go in this order.

1902
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,560
I'll play scissors.
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1903
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,660
(It's not clear if practicing
would help them.)

1904
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,430
(The final game that decides
who sleeps outdoors)

1905
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:56,440
Okay. What will you play?

1906
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,740
- I...
- Start first.

1907
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,240
What will you play?

1908
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,610
(DinDin starts his game.)

1909
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,240
(He remains silent.)

1910
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,150
I'll play paper.

1911
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:06,850
Director Joo is contemplating.

1912
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:09,880
Then you'll think,
"He's not going to play paper."

1913
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,650
"I think he'll play scissors."
And you'll play rock.

1914
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,220
- Then I'll play paper.
- It's over for him.

1915
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:16,390
His eyes are shaking.

1916
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:17,760
His eyes are on the floor.

1917
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,330
(This is how dangerous a trauma is.)

1918
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,160
- My heart is beating.
- Why am I so nervous?

1919
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,070
- Sleeping outdoors if you lose.
- Sleep outdoors!

1920
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:27,170
The first opponent!

1921
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,970
- Sleep outdoors if you don't play.
- Sleep outdoors if you don't play.

1922
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,170
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1923
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,240
(Defeat, Victory)

1924
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,470
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1925
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:35,410
(What?)

1926
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,810
(Director Jong Hyun wins!)

1927
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,350
(The production crew
succeeded in getting the first win!)

1928
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:43,180
(He managed to save his face
in front of his juniors.)

1929
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,950
(It's his first time
winning against DinDin.)

1930
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:46,990
Well done.

1931
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:48,790
Okay.

1932
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,020
(He admits his defeat.
He overcomes his trauma.)

1933
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,790
- Okay.
- Moon Se Yoon versus Joo Jong Hyun.

1934
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:53,860
- I'll play fairly.
- Okay.

1935
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,860
(He provokes him from the start.)

1936
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,300
(Se Yoon
starts attacking him mentally.)

1937
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,830
(He's not looking at him.)

1938
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,170
Let's go!

1939
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,070
- Sleep outdoors if you don't play.
- Sleep outdoors if you don't play.

1940
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,240
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1941
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,610
(Defeat, Victory)

1942
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:07,510
(He won again?)

1943
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,010
(The production team won
2 times in a row.)

1944
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:11,680
My heart will explode!

1945
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,950
(Only 4 of them remain.)

1946
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,250
(They're at risk
of sleeping outdoors.)

1947
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:15,520
(Seon Ho has to stop this flow.)

1948
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,650
What's wrong with you?

1949
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,320
- The burden of the main director.
- Get it together.

1950
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,390
We have to cut the flow.

1951
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:20,920
It's only 2 to 0. Don't worry.

1952
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,360
- Next.
- We can still do it.

1953
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,360
- Jong Hyun.
- Yes?

1954
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,460
What will you play?

1955
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:25,690
Please.

1956
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,190
I'll play rock.

1957
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,830
- Then I'll play scissors.
- Okay.

1958
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:30,330
Rock and scissors.

1959
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:32,430
- Sleep outdoors if you don't play.
- Sleep outdoors if you don't play.

1960
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,800
(Does that mean
he'll lose against me?)

1961
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,140
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1962
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,740
- Okay.
- Okay.

1963
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,310
Good. We cut the flow.

1964
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:39,640
- Good.
- We got it.

1965
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,980
(The production crew
is still at an advantage.)

1966
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:45,080
- Now...
- We have Eun Ju as the next player!

1967
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,080
(Player 2: Director Eun Ju)

1968
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,380
- What will you play?
- What will you play?

1969
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,920
- I'll play scissors.
- Then I'll play paper.

1970
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,350
Okay, nice. He's saying he'll lose.

1971
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:54,620
"I'll lose for you."

1972
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:55,990
I'll lose for you.

1973
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:57,690
(A fierce psychological warfare
goes on during rock-paper-scissors.)

1974
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:58,830
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1975
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:00,560
(Seon Ho won again!)

1976
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,230
- Good!
- You think he'd lose for you?

1977
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:03,230
Good.

1978
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,700
- Good.
- Did you play what you said?

1979
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,370
- Let's end this, Seon Ho!
- Good!

1980
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,000
- Okay.
- The youngest versus the youngest.

1981
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,300
- Did you play what you said?
- No.

1982
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,340
(Both of them lost to Seon Ho.)

1983
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,410
Let's end this!

1984
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,470
- Come.
- The youngest versus the youngest.

1985
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,610
It's Gyu Bin.

1986
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,010
- What will you play?
- The youngest.

1987
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,240
I'll play paper.

1988
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,910
- I'll really play rock this time.
- I'll play paper.

1989
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,210
- I'll play rock for real.
- He's not lying.

1990
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:21,220
- Okay.
- I'm not lying.

1991
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,820
(He's relaxed.)

1992
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:23,820
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1993
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,290
(Director Gyu Bin won.)

1994
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,190
(He's shocked.)

1995
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,320
(The youngest director
stopped the flow!)

1996
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,760
- Well done.
- Good job.

1997
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,890
No...

1998
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,330
She's our third player,

1999
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:33,560
and you're the fourth player.

2000
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,260
I'm the only one here.

2001
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:36,660
You have to stop this.

2002
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,100
Stand here.

2003
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,530
Let's do it the simple way.

2004
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:40,530
You won't say what you'll play?

2005
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,600
- It would be confusing.
- Okay.

2006
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,310
(Sae Ho is getting serious.)

2007
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:45,670
- Sleep outdoors if you don't play.
- Sleep outdoors if you don't play.

2008
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,670
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

2009
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:50,380
(Sae Ho won.)

2010
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,280
- Good.
- Seriously.

2011
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:54,220
Let's make them sleep outdoors.

2012
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,480
- It's 3 to 3.
- It's 3 to 3.

2013
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,720
- Seriously.
- Well done.

2014
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,220
- Are you ready? Shall we go?
- Yes.

2015
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,320
Let's do it. Go.

2016
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,650
(Player 4: Director Jun Kyung)

2017
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:03,760
(Victory, Defeat)

2018
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:05,730
(Sae Ho won again!)

2019
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,560
Let's make them sleep outdoors!

2020
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,230
- No.
- You're crazy, Sae Ho.

2021
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,570
- I'll win you all.
- He's here.

2022
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:13,130
Take his energy.

2023
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:15,400
Good. Annoy him.
It's about the spirit.

2024
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,870
Good.

2025
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:19,210
You can do this.

2026
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,080
(Slightly annoyed)

2027
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,240
Rock-paper-scissor AI.

2028
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,350
Ready, action.

2029
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,710
- Sleep outdoors if you don't play.
- Sleep outdoors if you don't play.

2030
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:27,750
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

2031
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,620
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

2032
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,820
(I'm the rock-paper-scissors AI.)

2033
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,090
Let's go with this.

2034
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:35,760
He's the boss.

2035
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,160
(The game ends
if he beats just one more person.)

2036
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,530
(He didn't think things would end up
like this at the meeting.)

2037
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:41,230
(The rock-paper-scissors AI,
Robot Sae Ho, wins all the time.)

2038
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,960
End the game, Sae Ho.

2039
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,700
He's an AI.

2040
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,530
- What do we do?
- This is amazing!

2041
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,400
- End it.
- End it!

2042
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,240
You should end it.

2043
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,870
- Do more.
- He's annoyed.

2044
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,010
(He's not looking.)

2045
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:55,210
He's annoyed.

2046
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,240
Do it.

2047
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,480
End it, Sae Ho.

2048
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:00,680
- Get ready to sleep indoors.
- We can win.

2049
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,920
(Please win.)

2050
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,020
(Who will become...)

2051
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,090
(the hero of the game?)

2052
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:08,020
(I trust you, Sae Ho.)

2053
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:10,120
Sleep outdoors if you don't play.

2054
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,160
Rock-paper-scissors!

2055
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,660
- Yes!
- Yes!

2056
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,230
(Victory, Defeat)

2057
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,970
(The members gain final victory
with Sae Ho's 4 wins in a row.)

2058
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:21,470
(The Cham, Cham, Cham ceremony
of victory)

2059
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:23,300
(He's in tatters.)

2060
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,410
(All the members
will sleep indoors.)

2061
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:25,470
Guys.

2062
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:27,340
You did it.

2063
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:30,180
(The production crew
will sleep outdoors.)

2064
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:33,280
We will all...

2065
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:35,180
sleep indoors...

2066
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,380
thanks to Sae Ho's play!

2067
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,590
(MVP Cho Sae Ho
with 4 consecutive wins)

2068
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,620
He's good at playing
rock-paper-scissors.

2069
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,290
He's the master
of rock-paper-scissors.

2070
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,760
I didn't think you'd last
until the end.

2071
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,260
Well done.

2072
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,860
Well done.

2073
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:50,870
Well done. You did well.

2074
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:52,330
Did Sae Ho win four rounds?

2075
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:53,900
- That's...
- He won four rounds?

2076
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,270
(The chance of winning
4 consecutive times: 1 out of 16)

2077
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:57,300
This drains your energy.

2078
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,310
Your energy gets drained.

2079
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,740
It's not so easy.

2080
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,710
Get out quickly.

2081
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,550
We want to sleep.

2082
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:05,850
Don't just sleep right away.

2083
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:06,910
Talk for ten minutes
before you sleep.

2084
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,150
(Homework: Talk for 10 minutes
before sleeping.)

2085
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:09,550
- Talk for ten minutes.
- Don't just sleep.

2086
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,050
Talk about why you lost.

2087
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:12,790
Talk about what happened today...

2088
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,020
and the emotions you felt.

2089
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,160
Talk about everything
for 15 to 20 minutes.

2090
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,460
You can get ready to sleep.

2091
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:20,060
Okay.

2092
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,800
You all did a good job today.

2093
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,230
Tomorrow's morning mission...

2094
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,500
will involve the food truck
for breakfast.

2095
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,470
It will be a 3-on-3 group mission.

2096
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,310
Shall we split into those
who won and those who lost?

2097
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,310
- From earlier...
- Sure.

2098
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:34,640
Seon Ho, Se Yoon, and I won,

2099
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,140
- Okay.
- and you three lost.

2100
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,610
- Okay.
- Okay. The winning...

2101
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:40,180
For your information,
the menu on the food truck...

2102
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:41,420
is galbitang.

2103
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:44,390
- I love galbitang.
- We need some soup.

2104
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,450
(The food truck's filling galbitang
will be ready in the morning.)

2105
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:47,420
You'll have more of an advantage
if you come out early.

2106
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:49,620
We won't be able to sleep much then.
My gosh.

2107
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:50,760
Good night.

2108
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,030
Why aren't you leaving yet?

2109
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:53,090
Let's get going.

2110
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,560
We have to get ready to sleep.

2111
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,460
- Let's leave, everyone.
- All right.

2112
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:57,800
- Let's go to sleep.
- Thank you.

2113
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,230
Gosh, great work, everyone.

2114
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,370
Let's get going.

2115
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,770
There's the tent.

2116
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:06,310
- Gosh, it looks decent.
- It's nice.

2117
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:08,810
- We always used the small ones.
- Right.

2118
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:11,050
(A huge tent unlike before)

2119
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:13,850
Since when was the tent set up
on the wooden bench?

2120
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,050
- What?
- What?

2121
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,180
It should be set up here.

2122
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,420
Why is this set up here
and not on the floor?

2123
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,190
Why isn't it on the floor?

2124
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,060
(The members had no roof.)

2125
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,620
(Even when they did,
it was right about to collapse.)

2126
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,330
(They even slept on the hard floor.)

2127
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,600
This is a bed!

2128
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,230
- This is just like a bed!
- Are you serious?

2129
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,300
- How could you do this?
- Gosh.

2130
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:33,430
- Come on.
- You can't do this.

2131
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:34,870
It was already set up...

2132
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:36,000
before knowing
who was going to sleep here.

2133
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,500
Good night. Get inside.

2134
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,570
Tell each other how you feel.

2135
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:42,110
Take a selfie before you sleep too.

2136
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,280
Let's do this one more time
for winter training.

2137
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:45,850
- Right.
- How does that sound?

2138
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,310
- We should do that.
- We should do that.

2139
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:48,950
Since summer is coming,

2140
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,350
- we should do it when it's hot.
- Right.

2141
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:51,450
Let's do it when it's hot.

2142
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:53,150
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

2143
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,060
- When it's hot.
- During the rainy season.

2144
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,090
We'll include
all of our staff members.

2145
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,090
- Let's make it big.
- Right.

2146
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:00,290
- With everyone.
- Right.

2147
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:02,300
But my manager snores so much.
It could be bad.

2148
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,330
(The members dream
of including more staff members.)

2149
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,070
It's like sleeping in a hotel.
It's so comfortable.

2150
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:07,000
The weather is great too.

2151
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,600
Gosh, that was amazing.

2152
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,470
Have you experienced a game
of rock-paper-scissors this intense?

2153
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:14,680
Never.

2154
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:16,980
It was never this intense.

2155
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:19,980
To be honest, wasn't I amazing
during Cham, Cham, Cham?

2156
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:21,520
- You were amazing.
- Right.

2157
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,150
Director Joo felt really annoyed.

2158
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,150
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

2159
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:28,020
Don't play against him for a while.

2160
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,890
- This was what was scary.
- Don't tease him.

2161
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:33,360
For around three minutes
after losing to me,

2162
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:34,960
he couldn't speak.

2163
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,860
- Right.
- He said he studied your pattern...

2164
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,300
after watching you play.

2165
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:41,270
Right. He said he watched it over
seven times.

2166
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:42,600
Gosh.

2167
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,570
He even texted me at night.

2168
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:47,880
"I'm aware of your pattern now."

2169
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,880
("You're doing that late at night?")

2170
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:52,050
(I will return
after practicing more.)

2171
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:53,710
It felt so relieving.

2172
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:55,480
I wish we could see
what's going on in the tent...

2173
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,220
with a remote control.

2174
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,650
I'm curious about how they're doing.

2175
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:02,190
Let's take a selfie...

2176
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:03,890
to remember this moment.

2177
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,860
I'll take it now.

2178
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,090
One, two, three.

2179
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:08,360
(They take a picture
as their seniors have told them to.)

2180
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,460
- Gosh, it's nice.
- It's nice.

2181
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:11,630
It feels quite nice in here.

2182
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:15,070
- Gosh, I think it'll be cold.
- It's quite chilly.

2183
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:16,170
(The good feelings don't last long.)

2184
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,770
Good night.

2185
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,040
(Sneezing)

2186
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:21,940
We will be able to get up
in the morning, right?

2187
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,810
(What will happen on the second day
in Yeoju?)

2188
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,520
(Being drunk on the sweetness
of victory,)

2189
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,350
(the members are fast asleep.)

2190
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,960
(The wake-up song starts.)

2191
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:39,960
(Everyone except for Jong Min
gets up right away.)

2192
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,200
(Staying still)

2193
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:47,130
(The reason why the members
are in a hurry)

2194
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,470
(Se Yoon and Sae Ho come out first.)

2195
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,610
(Are they alive?)

2196
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,310
(I should look after myself first.)

2197
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,750
(Seon Ho,)

2198
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,050
(DinDin,)

2199
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:10,860
(Jong Min, and Joon all get up.)

2200
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:15,800
(Why are they doing this
when they're on the same team?)

2201
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:18,130
(Se Yoon and Sae Ho
are in the lead.)

2202
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,700
(Running to look for the yard
without being able to open his eyes)

2203
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,070
(Puffy)

2204
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,170
(He suddenly stops.)

2205
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:25,810
(He puts on his shoe again.)

2206
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:29,440
(Running at full speed)

2207
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,750
(He's not an office worker who is
late to work on his first day.)

2208
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:34,010
(Zooming)

2209
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,050
Gosh.

2210
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:37,220
(He manages to go past Seon Ho.)

2211
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,690
(Sae Ho enters the yard
in 1st place.)

2212
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:40,920
All right. It's Sae Ho.

2213
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:44,690
The 3-on-3 foot volleyball match
will now begin.

2214
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:47,560
You can serve when all three
of your teammates arrive.

2215
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:51,030
The first team to score three first
will be served with breakfast.

2216
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,540
You can serve when all three
of your teammates gather.

2217
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,600
(Panting)

2218
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,670
(All three have to come?)

2219
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:57,940
Hurry up.

2220
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:00,570
Let's serve.

2221
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:01,880
(They can serve
as all 3 of them have gathered.)

2222
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:04,210
(Sae Ho is still alone.)

2223
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,310
Hurry over!

2224
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,750
Go. What are you doing?

2225
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,950
(The rest are still coming
looking half asleep.)

2226
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,050
(Sae Ho is at a disadvantage
as it's 3 against 1.)

2227
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,920
(A big chance to win 1 point)

2228
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:14,290
(The important serve)

2229
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:15,690
What was that?

2230
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:20,030
(A bad serve was made
during the advantage.)

2231
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:22,260
Okay. Give it to me.

2232
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,630
- What was that?
- Get ready.

2233
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,900
How many points do we have to score?

2234
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,530
It's 1 to 0.

2235
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,400
(Jong Min and Joon arrive.)

2236
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,770
- Come here, Joon.
- It's 1 to 0.

2237
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:34,610
Gather up.

2238
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:37,680
(It has been a minute
since they woke up.)

2239
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:40,210
(Sae Ho makes his serve.)

2240
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,050
Come here.

2241
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,950
What are you doing?

2242
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,690
What was that?

2243
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,790
Out. You can't hit it twice.

2244
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,390
(Touch 1)

2245
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,390
(Touch 2)

2246
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,230
(He loses a point
after touching it twice.)

2247
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,960
It's one all.

2248
01:14:57,330 --> 01:14:58,770
Gosh, this is crazy.

2249
01:14:58,770 --> 01:14:59,770
(It's hard to play foot volleyball
right after getting up.)

2250
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:00,970
(Joon still hasn't
put on his clothes.)

2251
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:02,100
(Half asleep)

2252
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,770
It's one all.

2253
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,840
- Gosh, nice one, Joon!
- Joon!

2254
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:13,050
(Making an attack
while putting on his sweater)

2255
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,250
(He manages to defend it.)

2256
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:16,050
Why are we playing foot volleyball
in the morning?

2257
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:17,820
(He's busy getting dressed
and playing foot volleyball.)

2258
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:20,620
I can't see anything.

2259
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,420
- Joon!
- Joon!

2260
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:25,260
- Move away.
- Out!

2261
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:26,590
It's 2 to 1.

2262
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:27,790
(Team Winner: 2, Team Loser: 1)

2263
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,560
It's over with just one more point.

2264
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,160
Gosh, my throat.

2265
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,630
(They lose the food truck meal
if they lose a point.)

2266
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,400
(DinDin makes his serve.)

2267
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,570
It went in.

2268
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,470
(The sharp serve
heads toward the side.)

2269
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,740
(I'll receive it.)

2270
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,840
- What was that?
- It's out.

2271
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:45,010
It went in.

2272
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:46,480
(Missing the kick)

2273
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:49,050
(He kicks the ball out
with a bad kick.)

2274
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,420
The game is over!

2275
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,520
(Team Winner: 3, Team Loser: 1)

2276
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,290
Let's play to five
to make it more entertaining.

2277
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:54,660
You won't win even if we
play to 100.

2278
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:59,260
Se Yoon, DinDin, and Seon Ho
will be served with breakfast.

2279
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,330
You guys are amazing.

2280
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,660
You can kick the ball
right after getting up?

2281
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,530
Gosh, I can't see anything.

2282
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,470
That is why you're in Team Loser.

2283
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:07,430
(He has nothing to say.)

2284
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,900
"That is why you're in Team Loser."

2285
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:09,900
(That was a great line.)

2286
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,210
The losers will also be served
in a very small plate.

2287
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:14,410
- Really?
- How small could it be?

2288
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:16,310
- We can serve ourselves, right?
- Gosh.

2289
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,380
Gosh, check out the ribs.

2290
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,150
(They find the mouth-watering ribs.)

2291
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,950
The ribs are served just like that?

2292
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:25,050
- Gosh, look at the kkakdugi.
- Gosh.

2293
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:28,060
This was a special meal
prepared by the food truck owner.

2294
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,320
It looks amazing.

2295
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,530
Gosh, this is my favorite.

2296
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,130
This is my favorite.

2297
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,000
(Suffering)

2298
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,430
The owner said he was going to...

2299
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,340
make you galbitang last week
as you were getting married.

2300
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,400
Gosh, I should be enjoying properly.

2301
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,470
There are pieces
that don't have the bones.

2302
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:46,340
They were just too good.

2303
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,740
- That is why you lose.
- I want to win too.

2304
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,180
My gosh!

2305
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:51,610
This is amazing.

2306
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:52,780
I'm relieved to be able to
try it, at least.

2307
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:53,980
Thank you.

2308
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,380
Thank you, Jong Min.

2309
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,280
- You're eating that much?
- Right.

2310
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,790
This would be more expensive
than one from a restaurant.

2311
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:00,450
Thank you, Jong Min.
Congratulations.

2312
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:01,820
- Enjoy the food.
- Congratulations.

2313
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,420
Galbitang is served
during these occasions.

2314
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:07,190
(Drinking the soup
by picking up the bowl)

2315
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:08,530
Gosh.

2316
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,630
The soup is amazing.

2317
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:12,730
(Newlywed groom Jong Min
takes a big bite too.)

2318
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:13,870
Gosh, this is nice.

2319
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:14,940
It's so good.

2320
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,400
The soup is amazing.

2321
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,170
(Putting in the rib)

2322
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:20,810
The galbitang is great, isn't it?

2323
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,240
- Yes.
- It's great.

2324
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,580
It's so good.

2325
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:26,450
(Ribs should be eaten with hands.)

2326
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:29,720
This tastes better than the ones
served in restaurants.

2327
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:30,820
Gosh.

2328
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,420
Gosh, this is amazing.

2329
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,860
(Mesmerized by the ribs)

2330
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:37,020
The ones that slept outdoors
are coming in.

2331
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,190
- The ones that slept outdoors.
- Did you sleep well?

2332
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:41,460
- Oh, hello.
- The ones that slept outdoors.

2333
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,800
Shouldn't they be eating...

2334
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,130
after playing a game
of foot volleyball with us?

2335
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:45,870
How was sleeping outdoors,
Jun Kyung?

2336
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,700
- I couldn't sleep well.
- Why not?

2337
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,470
It felt a lot more uncomfortable
than expected.

2338
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:50,970
Of course.

2339
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:53,240
- I couldn't sleep well.
- Of course it's cold.

2340
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:55,410
- It's quite uncomfortable.
- Right.

2341
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,910
But the galbitang's soup
is really nice.

2342
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:00,380
You all remember that
you have to perform, right?

2343
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,120
Se Yoon, Sae Ho, and Joon...

2344
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,480
- We have to perform.
- Right.

2345
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,790
- Right.
- We weren't able to eat well.

2346
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:08,160
I'll be performing
after a long time.

2347
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:11,460
For your information,
the Yeoju Cherry Blossom Festival...

2348
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,460
had around 350,000 visitors
last year over 3 days.

2349
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,860
- What?
- Over three days?

2350
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:18,430
(There were 350,000 visitors?)

2351
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:20,470
We will be performing
in that big of a show?

2352
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,840
There were 100,000 visitors
each day.

2353
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,240
The stage must be really big.

2354
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,310
It must be a place like
the Gocheok Sky Dome.

2355
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:27,710
- Right.
- We'll suddenly go and...

2356
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:29,110
You have to get prepared
with your hair and all.

2357
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:30,280
There will be 350,000 visitors.

2358
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,210
This wasn't what I was expecting.

2359
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:33,980
- Gosh. He keeps bringing up...
- My heart is beating.

2360
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,150
his comeback performance.

2361
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:36,620
My heart is beating.

2362
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,850
(Losing his appetite
out of nervousness)

2363
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:44,090
(It's time to enjoy
the Yeoju Cherry Blossom Festival.)

2364
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,730
Gosh, performing in front of
350,000 people...

2365
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:50,660
isn't an easy thing to do.

2366
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:54,300
That can't be helped.
When you make a mistake,

2367
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,700
you can't make it seem obvious.

2368
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,770
- You have to be confident.
- You have to move on.

2369
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:57,870
Right. You have to be confident.

2370
01:18:57,870 --> 01:18:59,670
- As if it was part of it.
- Right.

2371
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:02,310
Isn't Jong Min the master of events?

2372
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:04,010
You must've been to
all kinds of events.

2373
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:05,050
- Right.
- Right.

2374
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,480
What must be done
at cherry blossom festivals?

2375
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,610
- At cherry blossom festivals...
- You and I have already...

2376
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:08,780
been to the cherry blossom festival
in Dongdaemun.

2377
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,550
- What must I say?
- What?

2378
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,490
The visitors are there
with a sense of excitement...

2379
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:14,690
- for the flowers.
- Right.

2380
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:17,290
You have to bring that excitement up
even more.

2381
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,390
Bring that excitement up even more.

2382
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:22,160
How is that possible?

2383
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,870
You have to bring up
their heartbeats.

2384
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,070
- What?
- Their heartbeats?

2385
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:29,900
- Their heartbeats?
- Their heart rates.

2386
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,240
I have to bring up their
heart rates?

2387
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:32,940
You have to bring up
their heart rates.

2388
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,040
You have to make them feel the beat.

2389
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,410
(Listen to the heartbeat, Joon.)

2390
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:38,980
Their hearts have to beat.

2391
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:42,220
(Keeping the beat)

2392
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:45,650
- More rhythmically.
- We still

2393
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:48,360
- Miss each other like this
- That's it. There you go.

2394
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,920
- It's exciting.
- That's it. You should do that.

2395
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,690
(Keeping the beat)

2396
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:56,660
(In time!)

2397
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:59,070
- All right.
- I want to share them with you

2398
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:00,400
(He's the gig master indeed.)

2399
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,800
Keep the beat.

2400
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,740
You should attack their hearts.

2401
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:06,740
(Keeping the gig master's teachings
in their hearts)

2402
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,180
- Gosh, what is this?
- Look at that.

2403
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,740
- My goodness.
- What?

2404
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,980
- Look at the cherry blossoms.
- I want to take a picture.

2405
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,680
- This is why they hold a festival.
- It's spring.

2406
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,020
How is this possible? My goodness.

2407
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,850
Awesome!

2408
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:22,320
- There are a lot of people.
- There's Pirate Ship.

2409
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:24,490
- Is there Pirate Ship?
- That's not good.

2410
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:25,990
- There's Pirate Ship.
- Where?

2411
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:27,090
This is a festival.

2412
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,600
Hang on. I bet
there are a lot of people.

2413
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,700
- Yes.
- It's crowded. We're in trouble.

2414
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,630
- My goodness. Look.
- There are a lot of people.

2415
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,540
- There are thousands of people.
- That's a lot.

2416
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:36,600
- There are a lot.
- There are a lot of people.

2417
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,910
(When the popcorn-like flowers
are in full bloom,)

2418
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:44,510
(the place is crowded with people
who came out to enjoy spring.)

2419
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:48,950
(During the day, it's full of love
with falling cherry blossom petals.)

2420
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:53,690
(At night, the place
is full of romance.)

2421
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:00,230
(How will Team Saeri's performance
be presented here?)

2422
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,760
The stage is so big.

2423
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:04,230
- It's huge.
- Please run in quickly.

2424
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,430
- Where?
- Please go in there.

2425
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:07,700
What is this?

2426
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:10,340
What is this thing? My gosh.

2427
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:12,310
What's this?

2428
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:14,040
- Gosh, what is this?
- This is so...

2429
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:16,340
Do we have to wear a wig
like this on stage?

2430
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:18,380
- Hang on.
- Are we dressing up here?

2431
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:19,750
- What's this?
- What are these costumes for?

2432
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:23,050
Are you giving us these costumes
for the cherry blossoms?

2433
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:26,590
(Pink costumes that resemble
cherry blossoms...)

2434
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,260
(and colorful makeover items
including glasses and wigs)

2435
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:29,860
We have a lot of items.

2436
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,560
You should be dressed up properly.

2437
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:35,260
This is nice.
I like cardigans like this.

2438
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,460
(Sae Ho picks the pink cardigan.)

2439
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,230
(Joon picks
the flower-patterned pants.)

2440
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:41,300
I don't think the top fits.

2441
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,670
(Spicing his outfit up
with a pink shawl)

2442
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:47,840
As soon as we dress up...

2443
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:49,840
Alien.

2444
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,580
I'm an alien.

2445
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:54,580
(He's excited to be at a festival.)

2446
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:57,550
The costume doesn't match
"To You" at all.

2447
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:59,990
You should pick something
that goes well with cherry blossoms.

2448
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:01,050
Match the color of cherry blossoms.

2449
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:03,220
Today's theme is cherry blossoms.

2450
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,460
This is the Cherry Blossom Festival.

2451
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,760
It should look like cherry blossoms.
Pick the pink one.

2452
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:07,930
(That's how they began
making human cherry blossoms.)

2453
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,930
I think this will look good on you.

2454
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:11,430
- No.
- It doesn't match the song.

2455
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:13,100
- No.
- Why not?

2456
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,470
- You look good in it.
- No. I'll try on other things too.

2457
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:16,870
I'll try on a few wigs.

2458
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:18,870
Sae Ho, I'm sorry,
but it looks great on you.

2459
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:20,340
You should look
like cherry blossoms.

2460
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:22,910
(The pretty grandma style
is complete with the wreath.)

2461
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,010
That's cute. Let me see.

2462
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:27,880
Doesn't he look cute?

2463
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:31,150
(He's suddenly hit by reality.)

2464
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:33,590
I thought this would be
like the Coachella Music Festival.

2465
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:35,890
Let's say this is
the Coachman Festival.

2466
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,620
I'm supposed to look cool.

2467
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,690
(He looks like a local fool
at the Coachman Festival.)

2468
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:40,490
- I don't look cool.
- You look great.

2469
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,700
Isn't this what you wear
when you work in the rice field?

2470
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:44,830
- What's happening?
- It fits you well.

2471
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:46,600
- It fits you.
- What? You're a grandma.

2472
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,470
It looks like Sae Ho is wearing
his own clothes.

2473
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:50,670
Why does he look so good?

2474
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:52,840
- It looks perfect.
- Jong Min did it.

2475
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,680
(Really? I can't lose to him.)

2476
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,010
It should be a little bigger.

2477
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,910
(Kim Jong Min, makeup artist)

2478
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,250
(Laughing)

2479
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,380
- This isn't right.
- It looks really okay.

2480
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,590
- You look good.
- This is "Run, Ha Ni."

2481
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,790
- It's "Run, Ha Ni."
- You're Go Eun Ae.

2482
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:13,830
(100 percent identical
to Go Eun Ae of "Run, Ha Ni.")

2483
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:15,600
He looks the same.

2484
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,660
(Don't I look pretty, Doo Kkae?)

2485
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:18,900
- This is amazing.
- That's his talent.

2486
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,370
Se Yoon is unbelievable.

2487
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:22,800
(Feeling happy)

2488
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,000
- My goodness.
- You're good.

2489
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,040
Cherry blossoms.

2490
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:27,270
Se Yoon is incredible.

2491
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,910
(Successfully transformed
into human cherry blossoms)

2492
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:34,210
(Meanwhile, in the audience)

2493
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:37,220
A Yeon, when the uncles sing,

2494
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:38,990
you should clap for them, okay?

2495
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:41,250
(Yes, Mom!)

2496
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:44,720
(Practicing the chant
of 2 Days and 1 Night)

2497
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:47,860
(Are we going to be on TV?)

2498
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:50,060
There are more people
than I thought.

2499
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:54,070
- We are 2 Days and 1 Night!
- We are 2 Days and 1 Night!

2500
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:56,800
(The last practice
before going on stage)

2501
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:02,610
(The place is filled with people
who gathered after hearing the news.)

2502
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:06,010
(30 seconds left
before the performance)

2503
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,820
- I can't do this.
- One, two.

2504
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:10,650
- Sae Ho, I can't do this.
- My gosh.

2505
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:12,350
- I really can't.
- Just do it. Let's do this.

2506
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:14,120
- Hello.
- I really can't do this.

2507
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,720
This is really embarrassing.

2508
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,290
- I'm really embarrassed.
- This is...

2509
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:18,360
Hello.

2510
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,990
This is driving me crazy.

2511
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:21,730
- I'm going crazy here.
- Right.

2512
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,830
Thank you all...

2513
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:25,730
for joining us here today.

2514
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:27,570
The weather is nice today.

2515
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:31,670
This is the ninth Yeoju Heungcheon
Namhangang Cherry Blossom Festival.

2516
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,310
Please send us cheers and applause
if you're ready to enjoy it.

2517
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:36,340
(Cheering)

2518
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:39,710
All right. Please let us
introduce ourselves then.

2519
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:42,180
The members
of Korea's best variety show,

2520
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,650
2 Days and 1 Night are here...

2521
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:46,190
for the festival!

2522
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:49,620
Please greet them
with a big round of applause!

2523
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,520
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello!

2524
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,290
Hello!

2525
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:55,160
Hello.

2526
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,800
- They look amazing.
- It's over.

2527
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:00,530
Hello to those
who are sitting far away.

2528
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,840
- Hello.
- Hello to those who are over there.

2529
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:03,940
(Saying hello to the people
who are sitting in the back)

2530
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,510
You must be really surprised.

2531
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:06,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

2532
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:09,440
- We're surprised too.
- We are very shocked.

2533
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:13,310
Actually, we didn't know we'd
come up on stage looking like this.

2534
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:15,380
The reason why we came here.

2535
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,980
Please watch our show...

2536
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,190
- to find out the reason.
- Yes.

2537
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:23,320
First off, we will introduce
ourselves one by one.

2538
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,190
We're from 2 Days and 1 Night.

2539
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:27,260
It's nice to meet you.
Thank you very much.

2540
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,630
I'm Cho Sae Ho.

2541
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:30,260
Yes, Sae Ho!

2542
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:32,700
I newly joined 2 Days and 1 Night...

2543
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,500
with Sae Ho.

2544
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,270
I'm Lee Joon. Nice to meet you.

2545
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:38,670
Is he Lee Joon?

2546
01:25:38,670 --> 01:25:40,910
Hello. I'm a member
of 2 Days and 1 Night...

2547
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:42,210
(Sighing)

2548
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:44,980
(Suddenly feeling shy)

2549
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,050
I'm trying to pluck up my courage.

2550
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:48,250
I'm very shy now.

2551
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,550
I will take comfort
in your loud applause.

2552
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:51,820
I'm Moon Se Yoon!

2553
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:53,490
That's right.

2554
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:55,620
- Let's shout it all together.
- Okay.

2555
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,460
- 2 Days and 1 Night!
- 2 Days and 1 Night!

2556
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,060
- Thank you.
- All right.

2557
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:01,860
You will probably know the song...

2558
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:03,930
we're going to sing today.

2559
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:05,900
- What song are we singing?
- All right.

2560
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,070
The song we are going
to sing for you...

2561
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:10,200
is "To You."

2562
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,040
- Do you know the song?
- Do you?

2563
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,380
We prepared only one song for today,

2564
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:18,480
so we'd like you to enjoy it
to the fullest for three minutes.

2565
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,950
Are you ready to enjoy it?

2566
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,150
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

2567
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:22,420
All right then.

2568
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,620
Are you ready?
I don't think you are.

2569
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,350
We're not ready yet,
but please play the music.

2570
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:27,720
- All right.
- Let's do this!

2571
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,420
Please give us a big hand!

2572
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:32,260
(Good luck, uncles!)

2573
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:34,560
("To You" by Team Saeri)

2574
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,400
My goodness. Please.

2575
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,560
Let's go, Joon!

2576
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,970
(The 9th Yeoju Heungcheon
Namhangang Cherry Blossom Festival)

2577
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,500
That's so cool.

2578
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,110
(Let's go, Sae Ho!)

2579
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:52,250
That's really cool.

2580
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:54,880
All right. Welcome...

2581
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,450
to the festival today!

2582
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:59,990
We're here to enjoy
the festival with you today.

2583
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:01,960
If you are ready to have fun,

2584
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,660
- make some noise!
- Make some noise!

2585
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:05,930
(Explosive responses)

2586
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:08,800
(Dancing powerfully
with all their might)

2587
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,400
(They look cool
as if they've never felt nervous.)

2588
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:12,800
(Singing)

2589
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,930
They're so cool.

2590
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:17,140
He's so good.

2591
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,740
He's good. That's great.

2592
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,340
There you go!

2593
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,450
There you go!

2594
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:33,920
I'm out of breath.

2595
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:36,660
(He loves it.)

2596
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:38,320
(I want to share them)

2597
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,290
(With you)

2598
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:42,760
(It's Grandma Sae Ho's turn!)

2599
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,070
(You)

2600
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,500
Clap your hands!

2601
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,610
(I can't give up on you)

2602
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,680
(This is exciting.)

2603
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:02,780
(Anywhere in this world)

2604
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,280
- There you go!
- There you go!

2605
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:08,920
(I can feel the breath of Yeoju.)

2606
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,920
(I have to watch Lee Joon.)

2607
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:14,830
(Until my life ends)

2608
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:16,700
(We love you, Moon Se Yoon!)

2609
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,330
(I will always)

2610
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:21,100
(Be by your side)

2611
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:22,800
It's time for Moon Se Yoon to dance!

2612
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,410
Moon Se Yoon!

2613
01:28:25,410 --> 01:28:27,170
(Flashy dance moves)

2614
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:28,510
(He's Dancing Fatty indeed.)

2615
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:29,510
Lee Joon!

2616
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:33,380
(Turning)

2617
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:35,210
(One more time for something cool)

2618
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:36,850
Cho Sae Ho!

2619
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:43,420
(Explosion of crazy dance)

2620
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:45,660
Clap your hands!

2621
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:48,390
(The audience is extremely excited.)

2622
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:50,600
- Make some noise!
- Shout!

2623
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,100
(This is so exciting.)

2624
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:54,570
(Even if I lose)

2625
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,940
(Everything that I love)

2626
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,070
Who?

2627
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:59,440
- Yeoju
- You

2628
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:03,340
(I can't give up)

2629
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:05,950
(I won't give up.)

2630
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:07,250
Clap your hands.

2631
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:11,320
(They felt the breath of Yeoju
for 2 days and 1 night.)

2632
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,920
Louder! Enjoy it!

2633
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,790
(With the beautiful natural scenery,)

2634
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:19,230
(they recharged their batteries.)

2635
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:22,900
- They're so good.
- This is great.

2636
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:28,200
(Though it was for a short time,
they practiced with sincerity.)

2637
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:34,210
(We will be really happy
if you enjoyed it.)

2638
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:39,580
(We'd like to thank the audience
for joining us.)

2639
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:40,580
Thank you.

2640
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:42,620
- Thank you, everyone!
- Thank you.

2641
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,150
Thank you, everyone!

2642
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:45,720
Who are we?

2643
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:48,250
- 2 Days and 1 Night!
- 2 Days and 1 Night!

2644
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,120
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

2645
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,490
I hope you all have fun.

2646
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,990
- They did so well.
- Thank you.

2647
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:55,160
(You're the best!)

2648
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,900
- Encore!
- Encore!

2649
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,730
There's no encore. Sorry.

2650
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,200
Encore!

2651
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,400
Hello.

2652
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:05,640
You have wings too.

2653
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,310
There's no encore. Sorry.

2654
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:09,780
(He gives flowers
to the dancing queen.)

2655
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:11,740
(Grinning)

2656
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:13,350
You did great.

2657
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:15,680
- You did so well.
- Did we?

2658
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,050
You did great. Well done.

2659
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:19,890
Well done. Good job.

2660
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,290
Well done, Joon.

2661
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:23,460
You were incredible.
You were so cool.

2662
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,660
- Great job.
- Yes.

2663
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:27,260
- Let's move on to the next gig.
- There's another one?

2664
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:29,630
We have another one lined up.
One, two, three.

2665
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:30,660
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2666
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,060
- Let's get into the van.
- Yes!

2667
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:36,600
How was the Yeoju trip
that 2 Days and 1 Night took you on?

2668
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:39,710
The more you know,
the more you love Yeoju.

2669
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:41,540
If you want to feel it
for yourself...

2670
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:43,240
Come to Yeoju!

2671
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:44,980
The best in Korea!

2672
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,580
The real wild road variety show.

2673
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:48,920
Who are we?

2674
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,220
2 Days...

2675
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:53,450
- and 1 Night!
- And 1 Night!

2676
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:56,520
(We thank Yeoju City
and the locals for cooperating.)

2677
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:58,760
(Next episode)

2678
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:02,130
(It began
with a letter from Chilgok.)

2679
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,800
(A family month special,
Chikgok Ever After)

2680
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:07,230
"Hello. We are..."

2681
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:10,600
(The invitation leads them
to a country village.)

2682
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:11,770
- Hello.
- "We'd like it..."

2683
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:14,440
(In that village,)

2684
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,740
(a grandma welcomes us.)

2685
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,350
Thank you for the invitation.

2686
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:23,420
(We will spend
an extra special day.)

2687
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:27,820
(They're even happier
because they're together.)

2688
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:30,590
- Are you happy?
- Yes, of course I'm happy.

2689
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:35,360
(The poems describe...)

2690
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,160
(the grannies' lives.)

2691
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,170
I'm tearing up too.

2692
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:42,870
(An extra special 2 Days and 1 Night
for Family Month.)
