00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:05,945
(Maximum enthusiasm)

3
00:00:06,655 --> 00:00:09,115
(They'll stop at nothing to go home.)

4
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:13,095
(Wrestling is a must.)

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:17,465
(Add to that, some fierce arithmetic.)

6
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:20,165
(The members completed their dice.)

7
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:21,695
(You can't stop DinDin from going home!)

8
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:23,835
(Go on home.)

9
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:26,405
(Now, it's all random.)

10
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,705
(Who will Fate smile upon?)

11
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:31,275
(As a result of the first mission, Find the Dice, )

12
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:34,945
(one group is clearly ahead of the other.)

13
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:37,815
(The 2nd mission is a 3-on-3 team challenge.)

14
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:41,455
(Se Yoon's amazing performance...)

15
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:45,985
(helps Se Yoon, Sae Ho, and Joon to victory!)

16
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:48,855
(After Round 2 of Ice Running on Knees, )

17
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:51,764
(it's currently a 1 to 1 draw.)

18
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:52,794
- Is there a problem?
- No.

19
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:55,795
(Which team will get closer to going home today?)

20
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:58,734
(2 Days 1 Night)

21

(Going Home Today Special)

22
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,675
You can catch up even from the outer lane.

23
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:05,104
- I'll do my best.
- Try going at that speed.

24
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:06,214
(Suddenly practicing)

25
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:07,445
Yes, that'll do.

26
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:10,044
(Explosive speed)

27
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:11,745
Hey. You'll clearly win.

28
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:13,185
- Hey, Seon Ho.
- There's no way...

29
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:14,754
(His sprint is intimidating.)

30
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:15,885
You're so fast.

31
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,425
- You'll definitely win.
- Hang on.

32
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:20,124
Practice a bit.

33
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,395
It's the last round.

34
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:23,764
You can win from the outer lane.

35
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:24,765
(Moving slowly)

36
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:26,334
He won't show what he can do.

37
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:27,864
(My strategy is my fist.)

38
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:29,365
He won't show what he can do.

39
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:30,805
Rock-paper-scissors.

40
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:32,264
- Please.
- Okay.

41
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:34,604
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

42
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:35,605
(Paper, Paper)

43
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:37,504
(Even the spectators are tense.)

44
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:39,305
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

45
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:41,574
You spread your fingers at the last moment.

46
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:43,115
- What?
- No.

47
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:45,445
The inner lane.

48
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:48,054
This is the final round.

49
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:49,355
(The last round at the ice rink)

50
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:51,425
The winner of this match...

51
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:53,455
takes the second round.

52
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,855
You can do it, Se Yoon.

53
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:58,994
(It's an important match for the two lagging behind.)

54
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,295
Seon Ho will obviously win.

55
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:01,695
Fatty and Slender.

56
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:03,235
Let's go, Seon Ho!

57
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:05,364
It's on you. It depends on you!

58
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:06,404
A tie is fine too.

59
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:08,575
Seon Ho, change your own destiny!

60
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,975
Seon Ho, your destiny remains as is.

61
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:12,775
You're on zero.

62
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,415
(You're on zero!)

63
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:17,545
That's harsh.

64
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:19,815
How can you be so mean when you're older?

65
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:21,354
Get ready!

66
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:22,384
(Running on Knees Game 3)

67
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:23,385
Set.

68
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:26,855
He's fast.

69
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:30,025
(Seon Ho grits his teeth and runs.)

70
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:32,964
(Se Yoon's close behind.)

71
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:34,335
(Flopping)

72
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:36,805
(Se Yoon fell down.)

73
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:38,705
- Oh, dear.
- You've got it, Seon Ho!

74
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:40,775
- Get up!
- Get up, Seon Ho!

75
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:44,504
(They both lost their balance.)

76
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:46,315
- You're both in it!
- You must get up.

77
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:48,344
- Get up!
- Get up, Seon Ho!

78
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:49,414
Get up, Seon Ho!

79
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:51,344
- Get up!
- Get up, Seon Ho!

80
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:53,414
(I can't get up.)

81
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:54,415
That's it!

82
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,285
(Oh, Paper Doll...)

83
00:02:57,155 --> 00:02:58,324
Come on, Seon Ho!

84
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:59,824
(His competitive opponent won't miss the opportunity.)

85
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:00,825
(Se Yoon's camera)

86
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:02,864
You're both in it!

87
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:03,865
(Chasing from close behind)

88
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,064
Keep going!

89
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:06,835
Keep your balance.

90
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:09,335
(Sighing)

91
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:11,504
Keep your balance.

92
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:13,435
(Grabbing)

93
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:16,034
(100 percent competitive, 0 percent energy)

94
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:17,845
- Get up!
- He can't keep up.

95
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:19,375
Don't stop!

96
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:22,175
(Victory is nigh.)

97
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:25,044
(I won't go out like this.)

98
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:27,955
(One final trick to break through)

99
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:29,385
(What...)

100
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:30,455
What's this?

101
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:32,525
(is happening?)

102
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:35,855
What's this?

103
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:38,924
(Jaywalking)

104
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:39,934
Don't stop!

105
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:41,995
(Eyes rolling back)

106
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:43,734
What's this?

107
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:45,004
(He got too competitive.)

108
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,005
Hey!

109
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,005
(Laughing)

110
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:54,174
(Team Jong Min's Seon Ho wins.)

111
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:55,315
Well done.

112
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,915
There was no way.

113
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,515
(In despair)

114
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:01,554
I should've won my race.

115
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:03,754
- In the back, my hamstring...
- The second round,

116
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:05,985
- My hamstring.
- Ice Running on Knees...

117
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:08,255
goes to Team Jong Min!

118
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:10,394
- It was like...
- Nice.

119
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:13,635
A shark was pulling me into the deep sea.

120
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,095
It was so scary.

121
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:17,735
- My body wouldn't listen.
- You went across.

122
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:20,304
You each won a round.

123
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:22,804
How about each of you...

124
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,474
throws the big and small dice?

125
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:26,845
- Okay. At the same time?
- Throw at the same time.

126
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:29,045
- We can move up to 4 places.
- Yes, 4.

127
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:30,414
If we're lucky.

128
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:32,144
Let the guys who are ahead go first.

129
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,514
- Yes.
- Let us go first.

130
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:34,654
- Here it goes!
- The leading team.

131
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:35,655
(DinDin goes first.)

132
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:38,754
(Four spaces ahead brings him closer to going home.)

133
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:41,095
- Gosh, DinDin.
- The side...

134
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:45,424
One, zero.

135
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:46,464
- Two ones.
- One, one.

136
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:47,534
- That's not bad.
- Two spaces.

137
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:49,365
- He moves 2 spaces.
- DinDin, 2 spaces!

138
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,034
That's not bad.

139
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:52,264
- What a relief.
- You did well.

140
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:53,335
What a relief.

141
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:54,634
- The next one, Joon.
- Joon.

142
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:55,905
- I want 1 and 0.
- Joon.

143
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:57,944
- Here goes.
- One, zero.

144
00:04:57,945 --> 00:05:00,715
- Come on!
- One, zero!

145
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:04,214
- What is it?
- Two.

146
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:05,484
Zero! Two, zero.

147
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:06,614
Two, zero.

148
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:07,754
- We're tied.
- It's a tie.

149
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:08,784
They're moving together.

150
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:10,355
- Joon, two spaces!
- Why are you following me?

151
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:12,755
(Joon and DinDin are both in 1st place.)

152
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:14,895
The next one. Jong Min.

153
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:16,524
I think he'll throw 3 and 1.

154
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:17,964
I want 3 and 1!

155
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:20,364
- One, zero!
- One, zero!

156
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:21,365
Mother-in-law!

157
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:22,464
Zero.

158
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:23,965
(The 1st dice: 0)

159
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:26,335
(What will the second say?)

160
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:28,135
- Three!
- Gosh.

161
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:31,774
(The 3 saved him.)

162
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,774
You're so darn lucky.

163
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:34,814
(Chuckling)

164
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:36,214
- Luck got me this far.
- One, two,

165
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:37,215
three spaces.

166
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,755
- What is happening?
- I'm in first place.

167
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:42,214
- Let's go!
- That's it.

168
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,284
(Sae Ho and Se Yoon go next.)

169
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:44,485
One, zero.

170
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,295
(They both get 1 and 1.)

171
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:49,094
(They each advance two spaces.)

172
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,465
- Two spaces.
- I'm close behind.

173
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:52,824
Let's get 0 and 0.

174
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:54,494
- Yes, for fun!
- There's no 0 and 0.

175
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:55,734
Zero, one or one, zero.

176
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,404
Seon Ho, throw a 0 and 1.

177
00:05:57,405 --> 00:05:59,634
I was a good boy. I never did anything bad.

178
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:01,374
That goes for all of us here.

179
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,405
Go!

180
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:05,004
- Please!
- Zero, one.

181
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:06,245
- Zero, one.
- Zero, one.

182
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:07,745
One.

183
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:09,844
- Three.
- Three in total.

184
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:11,284
My gosh.

185
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:12,544
I'm in last place.

186
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:15,585
This is the current standing.

187
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:17,925
Six places to go. That's not bad.

188
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:21,695
We'll move on to the next location.

189
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:23,264
- You're nearly there.
- Let's go.

190
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:25,195
- We don't get to skate?
- What?

191
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:27,895
We came to an ice rink, but we didn't skate.

192
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:29,705
I can't close the gap.

193
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:31,835
I'm not lucky with the dice today.

194
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:35,375
The next location is just 7km away,

195
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:37,144
- but it'll take an hour.
- The traffic's bad?

196
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:38,944
Is the traffic that bad?

197
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,545
Lots of people are going out.

198
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:43,114
(They rush to the next spot amid the traffic jam.)

199
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:44,344
- What do we do?
- How was it?

200
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:47,015
Those lagging behind still have a chance.

201
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:48,515
- But...
- Yes?

202
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:51,285
I have no intention of giving up.

203
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,924
Why give up when we played just two games?

204
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:55,224
- Yes.
- You know us.

205
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:56,494
There's such a huge gap.

206
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:58,194
- Even so, - Is there?

207
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,234
Some of us are closer to going home.

208
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:01,894
This is how I feel, actually.

209
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:03,665
I'm closer to winning and going home,

210
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:06,735
but I'm more anxious because I don't know what games are planned.

211
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:08,434
If I were behind,

212
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:10,374
- I'd happily say I'll play hard.
- Right.

213
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,545
My default mindset is, "I can't go home today."

214
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:17,084
The harder I try to go home, the further from me it gets.

215
00:07:17,085 --> 00:07:19,314
- I feel the same.
- DinDin's in the lead, but...

216
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:21,814
As soon as I heard the theme, I thought,

217
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:23,354
"I'm going home."

218
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,885
"I'm leaving soon" filled my head.

219
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:26,254
- Really?
- "I'm leaving soon."

220
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,454
Isn't it so disappointing if you fail?

221
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:29,524
- Yes.
- But still...

222
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,564
Even if I were allowed to go home,

223
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:32,724
I think I'd want to stay.

224
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:34,034
(Joint 2nd place, Joon, disagrees with DinDin.)

225
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:36,065
I said to Joon earlier in the bathroom,

226
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,904
"Don't try too hard."

227
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:40,304
"Why are you doing so well today?"

228
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:41,474
"Why play hard?"

229
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:42,874
He said, "I didn't play hard."

230
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,345
"I slacked off, and I still did well."

231
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,374
I said maybe, he had to slack off to do well.

232
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,815
He said, "Oh, is that it?"

233
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,344
He never did well when he tried hard,

234
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,285
but today, since he's not interested in going home early...

235
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,414
- Jong Min's in first place now.
- Yes.

236
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,824
You're one spot ahead.

237
00:07:57,825 --> 00:07:59,624
He's so lucky.

238
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,594
You said you'd go to a hotel tonight instead of going home.

239
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:04,024
I'll think of what to do once I win.

240
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,424
No, Jong Min said...

241
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:07,894
I'm more afraid of "the awful night."

242
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:10,105
An awful night is awaiting you.

243
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:11,964
- What will we do?
- What awful night...

244
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:13,204
could there be at KBS?

245
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:15,734
Do we have to be on every show that's filming right then?

246
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,204
(Appear in every KBS show that films at dawn?)

247
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,304
That would be insane.

248
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:19,574
- All night long.
- That's harsh.

249
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:22,044
Doze off, wake up, film, sleep, wake up, film.

250
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,744
That would be fun. They take you in blindfolded,

251
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:25,585
- and they're on air live.
- Yes.

252
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,815
- The traffic's crazy.
- I'm hungry.

253
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:29,054
- Se Yoon.
- Yes?

254
00:08:29,055 --> 00:08:31,185
Is there a famous restaurant nearby?

255
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,424
- In Namyangju? Here?
- There are lots.

256
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:34,955
- Here...
- This is Hanam.

257
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:36,864
There are many around Hanam.

258
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,424
- Misa-ri...
- Near Misa-ri.

259
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:40,464
There's a famous chicken soup place and an eel place too.

260
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,364
You can sing and have fun.

261
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:44,604
There's a really famous earthen pot pork belly place.

262
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:45,804
- Earthen pot pork belly?
- The region...

263
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,434
It's cooked in an earthenware pot to drain the fat.

264
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:48,535
You know the place.

265
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:51,174
Cold chicken noodle soup is good too.

266
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:52,445
There are many good places.

267
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:54,975
I see a charcoal grilled galbi restaurant. Gosh.

268
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,384
It's so good.

269
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:59,214
That restaurant looks so authentic.

270
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:00,684
- I bet their food is tasty.
- It's...

271
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:01,855
- I want to try their food.
- Galbi.

272
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:03,655
(Hunger is getting to them slowly.)

273
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:04,954
That looks really good.

274
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:07,495
I have yet to try cold chicken noodle soup this year.

275
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:10,464
The puffer fish soup restaurant is run by a master chef.

276
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:11,564
- This is the place.
- Right.

277
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:12,824
- There are many good restaurants.
- It's the Master Chef Street.

278
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:14,065
I love puffer fish soup.

279
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:15,634
(Current time, 2:30pm)

280
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:17,435
I haven't been in a traffic jam like this in a while.

281
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:19,834
- Gosh, the traffic must be so bad.
- My gosh. The traffic is crazy.

282
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:21,535
(There's an unexpected variable, the traffic jam.)

283
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:24,574
(Just like that, another 30 minutes have gone by on the road.)

284
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:28,015
(The roads are even more congested than before.)

285
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:32,085
We just need to go 3km more, but it will take 3 hours.

286
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:33,285
(It will take 3 hours to travel 3km.)

287
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,955
How about the rental situation for the rest of our day?

288
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:37,624
Did the cameramen arrive?

289
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,284
Only one group arrived.

290
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:40,325
Could you look into that?

291
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:41,654
What should we do?

292
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:44,265
(They quickly look for a way to travel faster in this emergency.)

293
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:47,634
(What's going on?)

294
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:50,265
That's why we're trying to make a detour.

295
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:51,834
What's happening?

296
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:53,575
Have we deviated from our planned route?

297
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:55,234
There wasn't a traffic accident.

298
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:57,644
Initially, the GPS said we'd arrive at 1:50pm.

299
00:09:57,645 --> 00:09:58,705
- Really?
- Yes.

300
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:00,545
But the time of arrival changed to 4:30pm.

301
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:01,744
- Really?
- Yes.

302
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:02,914
But aren't we still cutting it close?

303
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:04,284
We'll be okay with that.

304
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:05,915
- You're certain this will work?
- Let's take a detour.

305
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:09,185
Let's take a break until we arrive.

306
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:11,054
- But...
- My legs are uncomfortable.

307
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:12,154
Can I sit somewhere else?

308
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:13,494
Let's do that. Yes.

309
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:14,495
Okay.

310
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:18,094
- Let's rest until we arrive.
- My gosh.

311
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:20,134
Gosh. Did we just move about 500m?

312
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:21,235
(Jong Min is the 1st one to fall asleep.)

313
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,434
I need to use the restroom. This is bad.

314
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:24,435
(They want to use the restroom...)

315
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:26,134
- Gosh, the bread must be tasty.
- Yes.

316
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:27,205
(and are getting hungry too.)

317
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,574
If there's a noodle restaurant nearby,

318
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:30,005
I want to eat there and get back on the bus.

319
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,144
- Is there a restaurant nearby?
- That's...

320
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:34,874
Or do you have corn or something?

321
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,044
- What?
- Corn.

322
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:37,144
We don't have any.

323
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:39,484
My gosh. This is crazy.

324
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,114
(Walking there might be faster at this rate.)

325
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:43,014
I'd kill for some bread right now.

326
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:44,055
(I'd kill for some bread.)

327
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,355
I don't think I can do this.

328
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:47,894
Jong Hyun, we'll do our best.

329
00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:49,555
- So don't worry about us.
- Okay.

330
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,924
Sae Ho, are you talking on our behalf?

331
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:53,264
Or are you speaking only for yourself?

332
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:54,735
Hold on, Jong Hyun.

333
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,434
- Let's do our best. Okay?
- You should've asked us first...

334
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:58,164
- since we're on the show.
- Could you do that for me?

335
00:10:58,165 --> 00:10:59,604
Why did you make it sound like you were speaking on our behalf?

336
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:01,204
- That's a bad habit.
- Bread.

337
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:02,974
- Will you do your best or what?
- I will if I get some bread.

338
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,644
- Joon will do it for some bread.
- He wants bread.

339
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:05,904
If we don't have to film tomorrow...

340
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:08,775
and can get off work today, I'll give it my all today.

341
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:10,814
Let's say that there's a big delay.

342
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:12,544
- But to say we got off work today, - Yes.

343
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:13,714
We should get off work...

344
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,055
- around 10 or 11pm.
- Okay.

345
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:17,154
Then it would feel like we're getting off work today.

346
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:18,724
- But at 4am...
- But at 2 or 3am...

347
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:19,924
(We can't get off work in the middle of the night.)

348
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:21,925
- That's iffy then.
- Gosh, we'll try to aim for that.

349
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:23,295
- Right?
- So far...

350
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:24,625
Please.

351
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:26,665
We have to be there by 4:30pm.

352
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:27,865
Gosh, seriously.

353
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:30,034
- We're okay, Jong Hyun.
- What?

354
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:31,065
We're okay.

355
00:11:31,635 --> 00:11:33,004
Thank you for saying that.

356
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:34,434
- We'll have to hang in there.
- Right.

357
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:35,675
It's the traffic jam. You know?

358
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:42,515
Everyone, we've finally...

359
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:44,214
- My gosh.
- arrived.

360
00:11:44,215 --> 00:11:45,884
It took 3 hours and 40 minutes to get here.

361
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,954
(It took 3 hours and 40 minutes to travel 7km.)

362
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:49,015
It's so hot.

363
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:50,484
Oh, my.

364
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:52,584
- We're here.
- My gosh. Seriously.

365
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:53,654
At last.

366
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,124
- Good work, everyone.
- We've finally arrived.

367
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,455
- This is crazy.
- What's going on?

368
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,565
- It took 3.5 hours to travel 7km.
- So...

369
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:02,194
I'm sorry, but we're in Busan, right?

370
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:03,234
- Jong Min.
- What?

371
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:04,534
- We're in Busan, right?
- Where are we?

372
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:05,604
- Did it...
- Come here.

373
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,575
- Did it take 3.5 hours?
- Yes.

374
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:09,975
You slept for 3 hours and 20 minutes.

375
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:11,874
He slept so well.

376
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,674
He doesn't need to get off work today.

377
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:16,344
It's located next to the Paldang Dam in Namyangju.

378
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,514
It's a popular restaurant among cyclists.

379
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:20,454
I used to come here often when I was into cycling.

380
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:22,414
Their signature dish is the summer delicacy,

381
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:24,885
- the cold chicken noodle soup.
- Gosh.

382
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:26,255
- We ought to eat it.
- We must eat it.

383
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,854
(A pile of clean chicken meat served with cool chicken broth)

384
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:30,925
- Gosh.
- Cold chicken noodle soup.

385
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:33,734
- This place is famous.
- Cold chicken noodle soup.

386
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:36,335
(Summer delicacy, cold chicken noodle soup)

387
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:38,264
They also have the spicy and warm version.

388
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:39,334
- I want the spicy version.
- It's not that...

389
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:40,404
(There are spicy and warm versions too.)

390
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:42,274
We picked this place because it's a popular restaurant.

391
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:43,275
What's going on?

392
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:44,705
- What are they doing?
- So...

393
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:46,445
What's going on?

394
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,274
Is Insooni preparing to perform?

395
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:49,914
- What's going on?
- You know what?

396
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:51,644
They might burst out singing "Single Ladies."

397
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,645
They're going to start right away.

398
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,314
Will they turn around and start singing?

399
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,315
(Suspecting)

400
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,785
Today's Lunch Game is...

401
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:59,055
Dynamic Visual Acuity on a Wheel.

402
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,795
- They're going to spin it.
- The wheel is going to spin.

403
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,694
- Gosh.
- You have to guess...

404
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:06,524
what's on the spinning bicycle wheel.

405
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:07,864
(For this mission, they must guess various objects...)

406
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:09,265
(on the spinning bicycle wheel.)

407
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:12,264
(Correct answer: Durian)

408
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:14,735
- Every time you get it right, - One space?

409
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:17,004
You can move one space forward on the game board.

410
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,375
- This is huge.
- But...

411
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,644
However, those who answer three questions...

412
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:23,214
can't participate in the quiz anymore.

413
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:24,314
- Okay.
- Okay.

414
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:26,214
- But they will get to eat lunch?
- That's right.

415
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:27,614
Those who answer three questions...

416
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:29,284
will get a main dish of their choice,

417
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:30,524
acorn pancake rolls, and large dumplings.

418
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:31,955
We'll give them a filling meal.

419
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:34,124
- My gosh.
- A round of applause.

420
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,824
You know what? He checked...

421
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:38,694
- Let's go. This game is crucial.
- Hold on. Our seats...

422
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,795
Okay!

423
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:42,195
- Here is...
- The wheel?

424
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:44,165
- the question.
- What?

425
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:45,564
- What?
- What?

426
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:46,604
- What?
- They're getting ready.

427
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:47,605
The question.

428
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:48,605
(Raising)

429
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:51,074
- What?
- They're getting ready.

430
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:52,745
This is like a comedy show. What's going on?

431
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:54,715
- What's going on?
- No peeking.

432
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:57,144
But we don't even know what the question is about.

433
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:58,485
- We don't know.
- Should we call out our name?

434
00:13:58,585 --> 00:13:59,585
The first category is...

435
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:00,585
(The category of the first question includes...)

436
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:01,655
flags.

437
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:03,925
- I don't know much about flags.
- Gosh, what?

438
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:06,625
- I don't know much about flags.
- Gosh, what?

439
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,995
(It won't be easy.)

440
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:13,734
How many are there?

441
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:15,094
- Seon Ho.
- Go ahead.

442
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:16,235
- There are more than one.
- Mexico.

443
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:17,604
- No.
- It's not Mexico.

444
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:19,234
- Wrong. For your information, - One of them...

445
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:20,235
(Focused)

446
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:21,635
there are...

447
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:24,204
- three flags on the wheel.
- Three flags?

448
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:26,145
- What?
- Seon Ho. Vietnam.

449
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,675
Se Yoon. Poland, Spain, and Romania.

450
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:30,715
- Wrong.
- How can we guess all three?

451
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:32,745
- Should I slow down?
- Yes, slow down a bit.

452
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,515
- Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho.

453
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:36,954
Spain, Finland, and the USA.

454
00:14:36,955 --> 00:14:38,025
- Wrong.
- Joon.

455
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:40,195
Spain, Korea, and Poland.

456
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:42,155
- Wrong.
- Only we get to go now.

457
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:44,164
- I can't see them at all.
- We must guess all three?

458
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:45,894
Yes, you must guess all 3 in 1 go.

459
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:46,965
- DinDin.
- DinDin.

460
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:48,734
The USA, Vietnam,

461
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:49,764
- and Poland.
- What's that one?

462
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,765
(The USA, Vietnam, Poland)

463
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,904
DinDin correctly guessed two of the flags.

464
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:57,344
(2 of these answers are correct.)

465
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:58,705
- What did you say?
- I don't know.

466
00:14:58,845 --> 00:14:59,945
You do it.

467
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:01,415
Sae Ho.

468
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,575
- Sae Ho.
- The USA,

469
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:05,445
Vietnam, and Turkiye.

470
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:07,584
- You got two right.
- I got it.

471
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:08,654
I'll give you a hint.

472
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:09,655
- That's not it.
- The USA...

473
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:11,055
- Vietnam.
- and Vietnam are correct answers.

474
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:12,655
- The last one is Turkiye.
- What's the last one?

475
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,025
It has to be Turkiye.

476
00:15:14,695 --> 00:15:16,325
(The USA, Vietnam)

477
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,724
(The flag of the last country)

478
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:20,064
- Should I just answer the last one?
- Yes.

479
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:21,735
- That's...
- I see white.

480
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,565
- It's...
- Do we know this country well?

481
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:27,634
- DinDin.
- Sae Ho.

482
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,674
- Jong Min.
- Sae Ho.

483
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:30,545
- Jong Min. I was faster.
- DinDin.

484
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:32,245
Singapore.

485
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:34,744
- Gosh, yes. That's it.
- I was going to say that.

486
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:36,144
- He got it right.
- What? It was my turn to guess it.

487
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:37,145
- Correct.
- What?

488
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:40,385
(DinDin gets it right.)

489
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:41,915
I love Singapore.

490
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:43,285
Let's go.

491
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:45,455
Gosh, that was hard.

492
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:47,894
- Why did you pick flags?
- All right.

493
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:49,125
I don't know much about flags.

494
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:51,664
- We have other categories too.
- Okay.

495
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:52,964
- This is so hard.
- DinDin.

496
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:54,164
You'll move one space forward.

497
00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:56,464
- I could barely see anything.
- It was so hard to see them.

498
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:57,835
Gosh, he caught up with me.

499
00:15:59,065 --> 00:16:00,474
I need to keep him in check.

500
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:01,674
(DinDin and Jong Min are both in the lead.)

501
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:03,645
- Here's your next question.
- Gosh.

502
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:06,004
Here it is. Gosh, look at them moving.

503
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:08,145
- This is so hard.
- This game is fun.

504
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:09,714
I must move forward.

505
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:10,745
(The man in 4th place looks serious.)

506
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:11,944
- My gosh.
- What is it?

507
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:13,114
- I can't see them.
- Once again,

508
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:14,115
- Are those flags?
- They must be flags.

509
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:15,784
- these are flags.
- Is that a green red cross?

510
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:16,815
What's that?

511
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:18,324
- Try it.
- Joon.

512
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:19,355
- Are there three flags?
- Joon.

513
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,525
Brazil, Canada, and Switzerland.

514
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:24,324
- Right.
- Wrong. You got two right.

515
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:25,325
- Jong Min.
- Se Yoon.

516
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:27,095
- Jong Min.
- Brazil.

517
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:29,395
- Is that Canada?
- Switzerland.

518
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:31,364
The UK.

519
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,565
- Wrong. You got one right.
- DinDin.

520
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:33,835
- DinDin.
- Sae Ho.

521
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:36,475
Brazil, Canada,

522
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:38,475
and Georgia.

523
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:40,105
Georgia?

524
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,944
- Wrong. You got two right.
- Sae Ho.

525
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:42,945
Sae Ho.

526
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:45,885
Brazil, Canada, and Hong Kong.

527
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:47,885
Wrong.

528
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:50,255
(Can you make out the flags, viewers?)

529
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:53,055
(We'll reveal the answers only to the viewers.)

530
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:57,195
(Correct answers: Brazil, Canada, Italy)

531
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:59,065
Brazil, Canada, and Korea.

532
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:00,835
- Seon Ho.
- Wrong!

533
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:02,564
- Seon Ho.
- Brazil, Canada, and Italy.

534
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:03,764
- Gosh, that's it.
- Jong Min.

535
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:06,005
- Brazil, Canada...
- That's it.

536
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:07,474
- Correct.
- My gosh.

537
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:09,974
You know what? That's how the flag looks when red and green...

538
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:11,374
- get blended together.
- Right.

539
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,004
They were smart about this.

540
00:17:13,005 --> 00:17:14,444
They placed the green and red parts together.

541
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:15,514
So I couldn't tell them apart.

542
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:16,644
I saw it too.

543
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:18,114
- I got it.
- Gosh, I couldn't tell at all.

544
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:20,085
- What? Seriously, Seon Ho?
- Right?

545
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,384
- Rome is the capital of Italy.
- You can't leave me alone.

546
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:23,615
- Is Rome the capital of Italy?
- Really?

547
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:25,284
When Seon Ho called out his name,

548
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,425
- I could see it too.
- Right.

549
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:28,525
Gosh, you won't even allow us a peek.

550
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:30,895
- The setup is going smoothly.
- I guessed the flags correctly.

551
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:32,064
Yes.

552
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:33,794
Given your talent, try working at an F1 race.

553
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:35,135
- Right. Totally.
- You could do it really quickly.

554
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:36,465
- Gosh, they're good.
- My gosh.

555
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,005
- What are these?
- This time,

556
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:39,634
- Gosh, what are these?
- you must guess...

557
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:40,704
a three-syllable word.

558
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:42,905
- How can we do that?
- Are the syllables separated?

559
00:17:43,175 --> 00:17:44,275
- Yes.
- One on each paper?

560
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,074
- Joon.
- Joon.

561
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:47,115
A lethal move.

562
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:48,445
- Wrong.
- Se Yoon.

563
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:49,775
- Se Yoon.
- A random game.

564
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:51,344
- Wrong. Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho. Flip-flops.

565
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:52,345
- What?
- Flip-flops.

566
00:17:52,345 --> 00:17:53,345
- Wrong.
- What is it?

567
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:54,515
Is that a Korean word?

568
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,185
- Yes, it is.
- I'm feeling dizzy.

569
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:58,785
(Slowing down the speed...)

570
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:01,395
- It might hypnotize me.
- Se Yoon.

571
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:03,025
- Last love.
- Wrong.

572
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:04,764
- Isn't it "class?" - Are you okay spinning that?

573
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:05,824
(At that time, Joon leans back.)

574
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:07,335
Joon! Double eyelids.

575
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:09,964
- Sae Ho. Gosh, he's right.
- Joon is correct.

576
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,104
(Double eyelids)

577
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:12,134
- How...
- Wait.

578
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:13,634
He said, "Trouble eyelids."

579
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,935
Jong Min. Double eyelids.

580
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:16,475
- He said, "Trouble eyelids." - Joon got it right.

581
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:18,344
- Joon.
- Gosh, it's so hard to see them.

582
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:19,374
I'm in the lead now.

583
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,544
(Joon gets 1 point.)

584
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:21,545
(Start, Finish)

585
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:23,514
(The three of them are in the lead together.)

586
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:24,515
This is driving me crazy.

587
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:25,584
- I can't see anything.
- So...

588
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:27,044
Honey, I can't come home early again.

589
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:28,785
- I need to compete against Sae Ho.
- I'm sorry, honey.

590
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:30,385
Sorry.

591
00:18:30,386 --> 00:18:31,824
No. You never know. You still have a shot.

592
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,084
- Let's keep going.
- The thing is,

593
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:34,295
you can see them when you give up.

594
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:35,525
At the end, I gave up.

595
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:37,465
- What?
- All right.

596
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:38,965
Seon Ho. Red bean bingsu.

597
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:41,094
- You can see that?
- Correct.

598
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:42,294
(Seon Ho gets 1 point.)

599
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:43,835
- Joon.
- Asparagus.

600
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:45,564
- Joon.
- What?

601
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:47,404
It's asparagus.

602
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:48,935
- How did you see that?
- It's asparagus?

603
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,204
- Wrong.
- Sae Ho.

604
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:51,345
- Sae Ho.
- Garlic.

605
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:53,304
- What?
- That's correct.

606
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:54,845
(Sae Ho gets 1 point.)

607
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:56,345
What?

608
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:57,615
- What's this now?
- Sae Ho.

609
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:58,915
It's 56.

610
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,714
- Jong Min.
- It's 56.

611
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:01,884
- I won't play.
- It's 56.

612
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:03,114
- Jong Min.
- It's 7 times 8 which is 56.

613
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:04,154
Correct.

614
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:06,884
(His eyes open wide at the chance of getting off work.)

615
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:08,695
What's 7 times 8?

616
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:11,724
When it was spinning, I spotted 7 and 8.

617
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:14,134
All right. Sae Ho also answered two questions correctly.

618
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:15,135
Okay.

619
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:16,294
(Sae Ho, Joon, and Seon Ho got 2 points each.)

620
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:19,105
So are we playing the Dinner Game?

621
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:21,834
- No, this is for lunch.
- Lunch?

622
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:23,735
- Really?
- It's 5:10pm now.

623
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:26,605
- Okay. I forgot for a second.
- Yes.

624
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:29,245
Here's your next question.

625
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:30,914
I must go home today.

626
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:32,485
Gosh, Joon is in first place.

627
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:34,614
(Everyone focuses on the game.)

628
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:36,055
- All right.
- Gosh.

629
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,455
What's the category?

630
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,125
- It's an object.
- An object?

631
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:41,795
I can't see anything.

632
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,194
- Why is that white?
- What's...

633
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:44,625
that black thing on the bottom?

634
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:47,765
(If I spin my head with it, will I see it better?)

635
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:51,004
(Joon leans back again.)

636
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:52,005
Joon.

637
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:53,005
- Sae Ho.
- Seon Ho.

638
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,005
- Joon will go first.
- Sae Ho.

639
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:55,435
- I figured it out.
- Nunchucks.

640
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:56,534
- Wrong.
- Seon Ho.

641
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:57,575
- Seon Ho.
- I can see it.

642
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:58,905
- A compass.
- No?

643
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:00,075
- Joon.
- Wrong.

644
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:01,374
- Jong Min.
- Sae Ho will go first.

645
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,815
- What?
- Sae Ho.

646
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:04,245
- Gosh, what's wrong with you?
- Three,

647
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:06,314
- two...
- Bicycle.

648
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:07,354
- Joon.
- Wrong.

649
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:08,415
- Joon.
- The musical triangle.

650
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:11,225
Why didn't you let me answer that?

651
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:13,385
Correct.

652
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:14,794
I was going to answer that.

653
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:15,994
(Musical triangle)

654
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:16,995
- Gosh, Joon.
- Didn't you hear me?

655
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:18,064
I was going to answer it too.

656
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:20,225
- My gosh, Joon.
- Joon.

657
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:21,764
- He's done.
- You've obtained lunch.

658
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:22,765
(Joon gets to have lunch.)

659
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,135
- He's killing it, - He's so good at this.

660
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:25,704
Now that getting off work is on the table.

661
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:27,634
- Cold chicken noodle soup.
- Cold chicken noodle soup. Okay.

662
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:29,434
- Joon is crushing it, now that...
- All right.

663
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:30,675
- getting off work is on the table.
- That was tough.

664
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:32,345
He's so good. What's going on?

665
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:34,745
Did you see that?

666
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:36,674
I'm feeling down.

667
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:38,684
(I'm feeling down.)

668
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:39,685
I feel so depressed.

669
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,685
I've never been this sad while filming a show.

670
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:44,624
It made me wonder if I should take meds. This is...

671
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,354
Do you know how I'm feeling right now?

672
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:47,895
Seeing how incompetent I am...

673
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,095
No. You must avoid the awful night.

674
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:51,764
All right. Here it goes.

675
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:53,024
- Is it the same category? What?
- What?

676
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:54,034
- It's a person.
- It's a person.

677
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:55,434
- It's a person.
- Sae Ho.

678
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:56,495
- DinDin.
- DinDin.

679
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:57,735
Park Bo Gum.

680
00:20:58,135 --> 00:20:59,365
That's from "The Seasons: Cantabile of Park Bo Gum."

681
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:00,835
Wrong.

682
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,575
- It's not a man.
- It's a woman.

683
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:04,945
Sae Ho. Park Bo Young.

684
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:06,275
Wrong.

685
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:09,075
- How can we guess who that is?
- I can't see anything.

686
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:10,445
How can we know who that is?

687
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:13,714
(Viewers, do you have an idea who this is?)

688
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:14,715
- It's...
- A woman or a man?

689
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:17,055
- All right. Would you like a hint?
- Yes.

690
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:19,355
(Getting ready to step on the brake)

691
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:21,555
(Peekaboo)

692
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:23,355
- Gosh.
- What?

693
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:24,364
- DinDin.
- Seon Ho.

694
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:25,924
- I was faster than him.
- I was faster than him.

695
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:27,364
- I said it first.
- You can't suddenly stop it.

696
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:28,564
- I said it first.
- You said you'd give us a hint.

697
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:29,794
- DinDin.
- Chun Woo Hee.

698
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:30,834
Yes, it's her.

699
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:32,534
(Chun Woo Hee)

700
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:34,434
- Correct.
- I love you, Chun Woo Hee.

701
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,175
You just stopped it.

702
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:38,545
You must apologize. You startled me when you stopped it.

703
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:41,145
DinDin got two points so far.

704
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:42,845
Chun Woo Hee!

705
00:21:43,145 --> 00:21:45,414
- My gosh. I can't see anything.
- Is it another person?

706
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:46,785
Here's your next question.

707
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:48,815
It's a person again.

708
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:51,224
(Category: Person)

709
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:52,225
I don't know. Okay.

710
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:53,885
Se Yoon.

711
00:21:54,295 --> 00:21:55,655
- Song Kang Ho.
- Wrong.

712
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:57,025
It has to be a guy at one point.

713
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,325
- I got it. Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

714
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:00,735
Jong Min.

715
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:02,665
- My answer is Jong Min.
- Wrong.

716
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,335
Seon Ho. Song Kang?

717
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:06,235
Wrong.

718
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:07,934
- Seon Ho.
- He looks like an actor.

719
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:09,174
- No.
- You can't go again.

720
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:10,234
- Not consecutively.
- No.

721
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:11,344
- Should I give you a hint?
- Not right away.

722
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:12,874
- I think I know.
- Yes, give us a hint.

723
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,015
- Should I give you a hint?
- Yes.

724
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:15,775
- A hint?
- Stop it briefly.

725
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:16,975
Don't stop completely.

726
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:18,715
- DinDin.
- Se Yoon.

727
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:23,854
- DinDin.
- Leave the game now.

728
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:25,524
- Im Si Wan.
- Right.

729
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:26,585
Exactly.

730
00:22:26,785 --> 00:22:27,794
Correct.

731
00:22:27,795 --> 00:22:28,994
- All right.
- You shouldn't stop it.

732
00:22:28,995 --> 00:22:31,624
DinDin will get the cold chicken noodle soup too.

733
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,724
(DinDin will have lunch.)

734
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:33,894
DinDin will have lunch.

735
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,795
And he has moved three spaces forward in total.

736
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:37,335
Three spaces?

737
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:39,764
(They must compete for the last spot.)

738
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:41,004
- I'm nervous now.
- This...

739
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:42,804
Should we give Se Yoon the priority to answer it first?

740
00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:44,704
- I can't see anything at first.
- Okay.

741
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:45,845
- You won't spin it?
- Great.

742
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:47,145
(Laughing)

743
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:48,974
- Will you let me go first?
- All right.

744
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:49,975
- Yes, I will.
- Let's begin.

745
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:51,184
- I'll see if I can do it.
- Here's your next question.

746
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:52,384
(What is this question that will console Sad Se Yoon?)

747
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:53,484
What's that? Sky?

748
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:54,584
- Gosh, this is so easy.
- It's so easy.

749
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:55,684
- It's a landmark.
- It's so easy.

750
00:22:55,685 --> 00:22:56,854
- Can't I go?
- What?

751
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:58,054
- It's a landmark.
- Can't I go?

752
00:22:58,055 --> 00:23:00,384
(Category: Landmarks)

753
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:02,054
- No.
- This is way too easy.

754
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:03,095
All right.

755
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:04,894
- Seon Ho.
- I'll give Se Yoon ten seconds.

756
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:06,424
- Sae Ho. I know this one too.
- Seon Ho.

757
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:07,564
- I was faster.
- Me first.

758
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:09,535
- He said I got ten seconds.
- I know it too. I'm next.

759
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:11,405
- Se Yoon.
- Se Yoon.

760
00:23:11,705 --> 00:23:12,964
- It's...
- The Statue of Liberty.

761
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:14,534
- Jong Min.
- Gosh, what? He got it right.

762
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:15,934
- What?
- Correct.

763
00:23:15,935 --> 00:23:18,075
(The Statue of Liberty)

764
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:19,544
It must be easier to see from there.

765
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:20,605
Hey, it must be the seats.

766
00:23:21,345 --> 00:23:22,614
- Should we switch seats?
- Let's switch.

767
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:24,514
- Let's switch seats.
- We have to see it from the side.

768
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:25,784
- I'm quite far from it.
- This way.

769
00:23:25,785 --> 00:23:27,955
I think I have the best seat here.

770
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:30,754
This is the middle spot, in front of the TV.

771
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:32,025
- Well...
- Right in the front.

772
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:33,484
If Seon Ho and Sae Ho...

773
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:35,694
- get it right, - It's over, right?

774
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:36,825
- this game is over.
- Okay.

775
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:40,064
- One, two, three.
- Come on. What are you doing?

776
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:41,334
- Why did you all lean forward?
- Go!

777
00:23:41,335 --> 00:23:42,335
(Category: Ingredients)

778
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,394
- Jong Min.

779
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:44,665

- Wrong.
- Seon Ho. Cherry tomatoes.

783
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,635

00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,874
- Se Yoon.
- Jong Min. Tomatoes.

785
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:51,905
Dried persimmon?

786
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:53,844
- Sae Ho.
- Wrong. Sae Ho.

787
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:55,715
- Cabbage kimchi.
- Wrong.

788
00:23:56,175 --> 00:23:58,185
(Desperately trying to secure a better spot)

789
00:23:58,545 --> 00:24:01,514
(It's red and plump.)

790
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:02,554
- What?
- Jong Min.

791
00:24:02,555 --> 00:24:03,614
No.

792
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:04,724
- Hurry up, Jong Min.
- Seon Ho.

793
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:05,855
Gosh, this is crazy.

794
00:24:05,955 --> 00:24:08,524
(If Seon Ho gets it right, the mission is over.)

795
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:09,554
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho.

796
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:10,555
Sea squirt.

797
00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:11,953
(Sea squirt)

798
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:15,866
(It's red and plump.)

799
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:16,977
- Jong Min.
- No.

800
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:18,377
- Hurry up, Jong Min.
- Seon Ho.

801
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:19,537
Gosh, this is crazy.

802
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:22,276
(If Seon Ho gets it right, the mission is over.)

803
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:23,277
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho.

804
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:24,346
Sea squirt.

805
00:24:24,347 --> 00:24:26,946
(Sea squirt)

806
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:28,046
- Is it correct?
- Correct.

807
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:30,157
- What took you guys so long?
- How did you get this right?

808
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:32,087
- You could see that?
- How did you figure that out?

809
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,087
- All right.
- I couldn't make it out at all.

810
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:35,287
- Guys.
- This spot is the best.

811
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:36,957
- Gosh, really?
- All right.

812
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:39,156
(Joon, DinDin, and Seon Ho will get to have lunch.)

813
00:24:39,157 --> 00:24:41,027
We'll prepare your meal now.

814
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:44,097
I waited for three and a half hours.

815
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,407
And I only get to drink water here.

816
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:49,236
(Joon, DinDin, and Seon Ho have moved 3 spaces forward.)

817
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,606
(Sae Ho has moved 2 spaces forward.)

818
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:52,106
(Se Yoon has moved 1 space forward and Jong Min, 0 spaces.)

819
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:54,376
- It's iffy to eat in front of them.
- I'm sorry.

820
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:56,106
- I feel bad.
- Gosh, it's going to be so good.

821
00:24:56,107 --> 00:24:57,146
(He doesn't care about them.)

822
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:58,276
That's a lot of chicken meat.

823
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:00,047
- Our lunch.
- That's a lot of protein.

824
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:01,346
Gosh, this is crazy.

825
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:03,216
(The cold chicken noodle soup is served.)

826
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:04,957
Hey, there's so much chicken meat.

827
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:06,887
Yes. That's driving me crazy.

828
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:08,456
- The pancake rolls look amazing.
- It's massive.

829
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:09,526
(A summer lunch at 6pm)

830
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:10,896
This looks so lovely.

831
00:25:10,897 --> 00:25:12,027
I've never had this before.

832
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:14,726
(Beautifully plated cold chicken noodle soup)

833
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:17,296
Gosh, check out the presentation.

834
00:25:17,297 --> 00:25:18,437
Gosh, this is crazy.

835
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:20,106
This looks amazing.

836
00:25:20,107 --> 00:25:22,036
(The refreshing combo...)

837
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:24,206
(of a summer invigorating dish and ice chips)

838
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:26,137
- Let me smell it.
- Is it that good?

839
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:27,776
Don't open your mouth. You'll drool.

840
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,306
- Next.
- I want to smell it too.

841
00:25:29,307 --> 00:25:30,347
My gosh.

842
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:32,346
- They added sesame oil.
- Yes.

843
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:33,487
(A savory aroma from the cool, refreshing broth)

844
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:36,186
- Gosh, this is nice.
- It looks good.

845
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:37,616
It's so cold.

846
00:25:37,617 --> 00:25:38,717
(It's cold!)

847
00:25:38,957 --> 00:25:41,057
(Utterly envious)

848
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:44,156
(Slurping the spicy noodles)

849
00:25:44,157 --> 00:25:45,457
- Great.
- Is it sweet and sour?

850
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:47,527
Do your teeth ache?

851
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:49,167
- It's...
- Do they ache a lot?

852
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:51,767
(Blast chilling)

853
00:25:51,768 --> 00:25:53,137
- This is so cool.
- Really?

854
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:55,537
It's like eating tasty noodles from a tasty bowl...

855
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,206
of cold sashimi soup.

856
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,577
Gosh, it must be tasty.

857
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:01,446
As for the texture, since the broth is really cold,

858
00:26:01,447 --> 00:26:02,476
the noodles have a nice chew to them.

859
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,946
- They're nice and firm.
- I know.

860
00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:06,276
The broth is so cool. It's perfect for today's weather.

861
00:26:06,277 --> 00:26:07,617
- Gosh, I'm hungry.
- Isn't it slightly sour?

862
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:09,916
Can I move my piece to the start in exchange for a bowl of that?

863
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,856
- Really?
- I'm serious. I'm offering a deal.

864
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:13,956
Can you at least give us rice and kimchi?

865
00:26:13,957 --> 00:26:16,087
Se Yoon, could you lower the water bottles?

866
00:26:16,457 --> 00:26:17,757
Will you give us food if we do that?

867
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:22,867
(He starts blocking their shot.)

868
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,796
(Incredibly envious)

869
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:26,397
Gosh, that must be so tasty.

870
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,136
Gosh, I bet they taste great together.

871
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:29,606
- Gosh.
- The fresh kimchi looks good.

872
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:31,306
Dipping the dumpling in your sauce must be so good.

873
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:32,637
Gosh, dumplings. Let me have one.

874
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:34,806
This is the perfect lunch.

875
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:35,847
- Right.
- Yes.

876
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:37,446
Have the whole thing. Yes.

877
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:38,617
Dip it in the sauce.

878
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:40,517
The noodles...

879
00:26:40,847 --> 00:26:42,586
Have the noodles next. It's hot, right? Eat the noodles.

880
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:43,856
Then you'll lose all of your teeth.

881
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:46,016
(Then you'll lose all of your teeth.)

882
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:47,186
He'll lose his teeth from the hot dumpling?

883
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:48,256
- All of them.
- Really?

884
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:49,257
He'll have to wear dentures.

885
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:51,827
"Where did Jong Min get his teeth done?" Like this.

886
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:54,626
Your teeth can fall out from the big temperature difference.

887
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:55,896
(He's stuck.)

888
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:57,066
I'm so hungry. Give us some food.

889
00:26:57,067 --> 00:26:58,496
If we keep driving down, we'll be in Yangsu-ri.

890
00:26:58,497 --> 00:27:00,366
If we drive toward the back, we'll be in Yangsu-ri.

891
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:02,707
Then this is the spot you can see from there.

892
00:27:04,077 --> 00:27:05,707
Did anyone ask him about this?

893
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:08,577
We didn't ask you. Why are you talking about that?

894
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:11,376
- You guys should eat something.
- Should we order rice?

895
00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:12,377
Gosh, yes.

896
00:27:12,378 --> 00:27:14,417
- Give us kimchi and rice.
- I bet you'll make us angry again.

897
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:17,157
- We're getting rice balls.
- That's good. We got rice balls.

898
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:20,086
At least give us some kimchi. Can't we get some kimchi?

899
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:21,657
(They only get two rice balls.)

900
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:22,986
- Give us kimchi.
- This isn't on the menu.

901
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:24,027
You guys can't have this.

902
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:25,956
- Gosh, this is good.
- It's good.

903
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:27,997
- Try this. It's so good.
- Did they add sugar?

904
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:29,996
It's dry.

905
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:31,497
Have a bite after you finish yours.

906
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,667
- It tastes like cold sashimi soup.
- Yes.

907
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:35,166
- It's so good.
- It tastes like cold sashimi soup.

908
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,506
(The disparity becomes more apparent with the rice balls.)

909
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:37,806
Can you give us some kimchi?

910
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:39,176
Then bow down.

911
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:40,306
Please give us kimchi.

912
00:27:40,307 --> 00:27:41,307
(Bowing down immediately)

913
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:42,377
Give us a lot.

914
00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:45,717
- More?
- Yes, please give us more.

915
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:47,487
- Give us more.
- Yes.

916
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:49,417
Please.

917
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:51,487
We gave you a lot.

918
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:53,557
- I filled up the bowl.
- He gave us a lot.

919
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:54,786
I filled it up to the brim.

920
00:27:54,787 --> 00:27:57,427
Despite how old they are, they bowed down to me.

921
00:27:57,627 --> 00:27:58,957
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

922
00:27:59,457 --> 00:28:01,127
- I gave you a lot.
- It's very delicious.

923
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:05,636
- This much is...
- It's a big portion.

924
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:06,907
- There are a lot of noodles.
- The amount is huge.

925
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:09,606
You have a lot of noodles. DinDin, you can't finish them, can you?

926
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:11,806
- DinDin, you can never finish them.
- He'll leave them no matter what.

927
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:13,976
- He shouldn't leave any food.
- Put them aside over here.

928
00:28:13,977 --> 00:28:15,506
- I'll put them aside here.
- Okay.

929
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:17,776
- I can't eat a lot of noodles.
- That's great.

930
00:28:17,777 --> 00:28:19,446
- He won't be able to finish them.
- No way.

931
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,887
- There are a lot of noodles.
- The amount is huge.

932
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:23,017
Director Joo, think about it.

933
00:28:23,447 --> 00:28:24,456
- Director Joo.
- Yes?

934
00:28:24,457 --> 00:28:26,086
Let's say that DinDin left some food.

935
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:28,556
As time passes, the noodles will get soggy.

936
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:29,686
Then they won't taste as good.

937
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:31,556
Since we're at a popular restaurant,

938
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:33,026
why don't we do something...

939
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:35,326
so that we can eat the noodles when they taste the best?

940
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:36,827
You'll get a bowl if you go back one space.

941
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:38,566
(Disgusted)

942
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:39,636
Okay.

943
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:41,066
(Okay?)

944
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:42,067
That's fine.

945
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,466
Would you go back one space for a bowl?

946
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:45,006
Of course. Do whatever you want.

947
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:46,036
- Seriously?
- Will you be okay with it?

948
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:48,476
Let's do this instead.

949
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,517
Like the price on the menu, they can make a bet individually.

950
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:53,276
One space isn't enough for this.

951
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:55,916
If you're okay with it, you should retreat at least two spaces.

952
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:58,856
I don't think they'll allow us to retreat so easily.

953
00:28:58,857 --> 00:28:59,916
Aren't I right?

954
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:01,186
Are you willing to retreat two spaces?

955
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:02,486
- Split it.
- Seriously?

956
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:05,027
I have to push back my competitors.

957
00:29:05,227 --> 00:29:07,227
I'll split mine and push them back.

958
00:29:07,597 --> 00:29:08,627
Two spaces.

959
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:10,336
- Really?
- Two spaces.

960
00:29:10,337 --> 00:29:11,467
This will be fun.

961
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:12,867
Jong Min.

962
00:29:12,868 --> 00:29:14,466
- Ask Jong Min about it.
- Are you willing to retreat?

963
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:15,637
No, I'm not.

964
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,536
- He wants to compete.
- Right.

965
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:20,806
- I'm close to finishing it.
- He's one of the top contenders.

966
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:22,246
What about dumplings and kimchi?

967
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:23,376
- This is enough.
- This is enough.

968
00:29:23,377 --> 00:29:24,717
This is enough. I'm sorry.

969
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:26,076
What is it, Sae Ho?

970
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:28,487
If I retreat two spaces, I'll be with Se Yoon.

971
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:30,316
On top of that, I can eat cold chicken noodle soup.

972
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:31,887
I'll restrain myself.

973
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:34,587
I'm happy with eating rice right now.

974
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,257
Se Yoon.

975
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:37,956
- Director...
- For retreating one space.

976
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:39,396
No, I'll just eat it.

977
00:29:39,397 --> 00:29:40,926
(I'll just eat it.)

978
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:41,927
What?

979
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:43,197
I have no competitor at all.

980
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:45,837
If you ask me nicely, I'll eat it.

981
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:47,437
- What do you want to do?
- Goodness.

982
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:49,236
Ask me nicely.

983
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:50,407
- What?
- I can help you.

984
00:29:50,677 --> 00:29:52,037
- What's going on here?
- Bow down.

985
00:29:52,277 --> 00:29:53,576
If you bow down at me, I'll eat it for you.

986
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:55,206
- No one is willing to do it.
- Word could get out.

987
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:57,576
People might say that Lim Cheol came and left all the food.

988
00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:59,047
- Right.
- We'll eat it for you.

989
00:29:59,577 --> 00:30:01,846
- Okay, I'll retreat 1 space.
- Okay, 1 space.

990
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:03,016
- One space?
- Yes.

991
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:04,017
Go back.

992
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:05,856
- It's just 1 space.
- For retreating 1 space,

993
00:30:05,857 --> 00:30:07,586
he gets to eat some cold chicken noodle soup.

994
00:30:07,587 --> 00:30:09,487
Retreating one space won't ruin me, will it?

995
00:30:09,627 --> 00:30:12,296
Se Yoon won't be able to go home because he retreated one space.

996
00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:13,357
That's right.

997
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:15,997
(Devouring)

998
00:30:16,627 --> 00:30:21,007
(Icy)

999
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:24,307
(His wish comes true.)

1000
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:26,676
(Namyangju)

1001
00:30:26,677 --> 00:30:28,406
(Namyangju is a good place to live)

1002
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:29,876
(Come to Namyangju)

1003
00:30:29,877 --> 00:30:31,276
(To eat cold chicken noodle soup)

1004
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:32,877
Now you know how cold it makes your stomach feel.

1005
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:34,247
(Thrilled)

1006
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:37,117
(Having fun watching him in person)

1007
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:39,417
What would you like?

1008
00:30:39,957 --> 00:30:41,756
I almost didn't get to eat it this year.

1009
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,127
That would've been a disaster.

1010
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:45,157
What have you been doing?

1011
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:46,327
(Laughing)

1012
00:30:46,328 --> 00:30:47,427
I have to eat this.

1013
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:50,697
I could've done better.

1014
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:53,067
- Goodness.
- That's so funny.

1015
00:30:53,537 --> 00:30:54,707
- Oh, my.
- That's hilarious.

1016
00:30:57,837 --> 00:30:58,977
He seems to enjoy it so much.

1017
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:01,746
He's enjoying it a lot. He's spilling it everywhere.

1018
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:03,207
(Cold chicken noodle soup is the best in Namyangju.)

1019
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:04,776
If there had been a competition,

1020
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:06,547
I would've retreated three spaces back to the starting point.

1021
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:09,287
I'm serious. I was willing to go all in.

1022
00:31:10,187 --> 00:31:11,757
Do you want a refill of the broth?

1023
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:13,886
Se Yoon must love it.

1024
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:15,326
Can the three of us share it?

1025
00:31:15,327 --> 00:31:16,327
(The broth refill)

1026
00:31:16,328 --> 00:31:18,857
No. To be honest,

1027
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:20,366
only Se Yoon deserves it.

1028
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:22,696
- He was courageous.
- I agree. That was amazing.

1029
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,767
Courageous, my foot. He did it because he was in last place.

1030
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:27,966
- I would've done the same.
- All of us would do it.

1031
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:29,467
Se Yoon would've done it even if he were in first place.

1032
00:31:29,707 --> 00:31:32,736
Let's move on to the next item on our itinerary.

1033
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:34,306
- Okay!
- Go.

1034
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:36,106
Let's go, Home Sweet Home!

1035
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:37,277
(How will today's story unfold?)

1036
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:39,547
- There's no more traffic now.
- No.

1037
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:40,846
Let me ask you.

1038
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:43,287
Have we passed the midpoint?

1039
00:31:43,887 --> 00:31:44,887
Right now...

1040
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:47,256
(The board's current status)

1041
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:49,126
You've passed the midpoint.

1042
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:50,127
- Really?
- Yes.

1043
00:31:50,128 --> 00:31:51,427
Are we about 60 percent done?

1044
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:53,926
Joon and I only have five spaces left to go.

1045
00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:55,396
(DinDin and Joon are currently in the lead.)

1046
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:56,626
You don't have to give up.

1047
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:57,737
(It's too early to give up.)

1048
00:31:57,997 --> 00:31:59,136
I have a good feeling about this.

1049
00:31:59,137 --> 00:32:00,966
(Soon, they arrive at the next location.)

1050
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:01,967
Where are we?

1051
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:03,776
It's a sauna.

1052
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:04,876
- What?
- Is it a sauna?

1053
00:32:04,877 --> 00:32:05,907
Is it a sauna?

1054
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:10,616
(Sauna)

1055
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:13,647
(What will happen at a sauna in this heat?)

1056
00:32:14,117 --> 00:32:15,117
(Laughing)

1057
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:18,417
We're going home today.

1058
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:20,087
Let's go.

1059
00:32:20,627 --> 00:32:22,487
- Go ahead.
- It feels cool inside.

1060
00:32:23,727 --> 00:32:24,756
It's so refreshing.

1061
00:32:24,757 --> 00:32:26,096
(They enter the sauna.)

1062
00:32:26,097 --> 00:32:27,167
What is this?

1063
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,326
He's wearing a sheep head.

1064
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:30,497
(Laughing)

1065
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:33,436
(The sheep head grabs their attention.)

1066
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:35,706
Why did you make a sheep head like Frankenstein?

1067
00:32:35,707 --> 00:32:37,277
It's because I have a big head.

1068
00:32:37,677 --> 00:32:38,807
- You look cute.
- All right.

1069
00:32:39,277 --> 00:32:40,676
Everyone, you like saunas, right?

1070
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:41,846
- I love it.
- Me too.

1071
00:32:41,847 --> 00:32:42,877
It's one of my hobbies.

1072
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:44,176
It smells very nice in here.

1073
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:46,676
Please go and get changed first.

1074
00:32:46,677 --> 00:32:48,216
- Okay.
- What game are we going to play?

1075
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:49,916
- Is it this way?
- Please go ahead.

1076
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:51,416
I need to sweat. It's been a long time.

1077
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:52,757
(Getting changed quickly)

1078
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:54,356
Isn't it hot?

1079
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:55,457
It's really hot.

1080
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:56,786
It's quite hot.

1081
00:32:56,787 --> 00:32:57,796
This is the room.

1082
00:32:57,797 --> 00:32:58,997
This is going to make us sweat profusely.

1083
00:32:59,097 --> 00:33:00,097
(Groaning)

1084
00:33:00,297 --> 00:33:01,297
This is good.

1085
00:33:01,297 --> 00:33:02,297
- Okay.
- Please come in.

1086
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:03,667
- This is hard for Se Yoon.
- I love it.

1087
00:33:03,837 --> 00:33:05,036
Se Yoon struggles with it.

1088
00:33:05,037 --> 00:33:06,597
Gosh, it's hot in here.

1089
00:33:07,037 --> 00:33:08,206
Do you like saunas?

1090
00:33:08,207 --> 00:33:09,207
- Yes.
- I love it.

1091
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,236
I don't like it.

1092
00:33:10,237 --> 00:33:12,236
Including improving cardiovascular health,

1093
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:14,777
boosting immunity,

1094
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:16,006
relieving muscle pain,

1095
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,476
and helping eliminate heavy metals,

1096
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:20,377
saunas are said to have various benefits on our body.

1097
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:22,746
They're especially beneficial for brain health.

1098
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:24,017
My brain isn't very healthy.

1099
00:33:24,057 --> 00:33:25,216
Your brain isn't healthy?

1100
00:33:25,217 --> 00:33:27,186
With that in mind,

1101
00:33:27,187 --> 00:33:29,326
we plan to boost your brain function.

1102
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:30,496
Is this about memorizing?

1103
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:32,097
Tonight's getting-off-work game is called...

1104
00:33:32,397 --> 00:33:34,096
Burning Passion for Learning.

1105
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,126
"Burning Passion for Learning?"

1106
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:36,866
I might be bad at this. I have a bad feeling about it.

1107
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:38,067
"Passion for Learning?"

1108
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,266
- All right.
- What is it?

1109
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,536
- This is for you.
- Oh, no.

1110
00:33:40,537 --> 00:33:41,636
"The Fart Contest?"

1111
00:33:41,637 --> 00:33:42,837
- Are these children's stories?
- All right.

1112
00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:46,107
(Today's subject to memorize)

1113
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:48,007
- I'll take "The Three Little Pigs." - Pigs.

1114
00:33:48,647 --> 00:33:51,446
You'll be given five minutes to study them.

1115
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:52,647
Then you'll get a quiz.

1116
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:55,787
Once you answer correctly, go outside immediately...

1117
00:33:56,217 --> 00:33:57,816
and throw the die.

1118
00:33:57,817 --> 00:33:59,517
Then advance your token.

1119
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:03,386
When the one who answers correctly goes outside,

1120
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:06,457
the remaining members will be given one more minute to study.

1121
00:34:06,727 --> 00:34:08,427
Then the next question will be given.

1122
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:09,767
And...

1123
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:11,336
Don't read them now.

1124
00:34:11,337 --> 00:34:12,337
Put them down.

1125
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:13,366
- Really?
- That startled me.

1126
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:14,907
- Gosh, you startled me more.
- Goodness.

1127
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:16,837
You startled me.

1128
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:20,307
Also, after this game...

1129
00:34:21,107 --> 00:34:22,546
Will we get to go home?

1130
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:23,606
(What? No way.)

1131
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:25,316
The quizzes will continue...

1132
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:27,516
until one person earns the chance to go home early today.

1133
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:29,186
(From this game?)

1134
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:30,556
Then we must think carefully.

1135
00:34:30,557 --> 00:34:33,056
If we want to finish the game quickly,

1136
00:34:33,057 --> 00:34:34,226
it's best to help one person win.

1137
00:34:34,227 --> 00:34:37,026
Does the game end once there's a winner?

1138
00:34:37,027 --> 00:34:38,856
Your dinner is on the line.

1139
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:40,096
- I'm hungry.
- And so,

1140
00:34:40,097 --> 00:34:43,197
it will continue until the top three are decided.

1141
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:44,666
- Three people?
- Yes.

1142
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,837
- For dinner?
- Three people to get dinner.

1143
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:49,637
- That's right.
- It's so hot.

1144
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:51,177
Am I the only one who finds it hot?

1145
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:53,576
- Is it worse at the end?
- It's better to stand up.

1146
00:34:53,577 --> 00:34:54,976
- The floor is hot.
- Isn't it hot?

1147
00:34:54,977 --> 00:34:57,647
I'm sitting down, but it's really hot.

1148
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,146
- All right.
- Switch seats with me.

1149
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:00,177
Switch?

1150
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:02,746
- It's so hot.
- Share the book with someone else.

1151
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:03,816
- All right.
- With someone else?

1152
00:35:03,817 --> 00:35:05,287
This is so much better.

1153
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:07,957
It's healthy when it's hot.

1154
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:10,327
- Everyone, are you ready?
- Is it two each?

1155
00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:12,926
You have five minutes. Start.

1156
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:13,927
(Study time)

1157
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:14,967
All right.

1158
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:18,436
(Studying is the only way to escape.)

1159
00:35:18,437 --> 00:35:22,007
(Intensive study)

1160
00:35:22,407 --> 00:35:25,476
(You can study along with them.)

1161
00:35:25,477 --> 00:35:26,736
(The cat took the rabbit next day, and the peacock the day after that.)

1162
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:28,577
Joon, you're right. It's hot here.

1163
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:33,917
(Beads of sweat have formed in no time.)

1164
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:36,916
(Little droplets of sweat)

1165
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,916
(When the gourd seed was planted and tended with care...)

1166
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:39,917
(Grunting)

1167
00:35:40,357 --> 00:35:41,357
(Exhaling)

1168
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:45,656
(In order to go home today, )

1169
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:49,667
(their passion for learning burns.)

1170
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:52,336
(Among them, who will get to go home?)

1171
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:54,306
Everyone, your study time is...

1172
00:35:54,307 --> 00:35:55,506
- Over?
- over.

1173
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:56,536
- Okay.
- Goodness.

1174
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:57,877
- I only got to read two books.
- Everyone.

1175
00:35:57,977 --> 00:36:00,107
- Here's your first question.
- I got it.

1176
00:36:00,477 --> 00:36:02,947
- In "Puss in Boots..." - I didn't read it.

1177
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:05,517
(Of all books, it's the one that they didn't read.)

1178
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:09,116
Touched by the gift the cat had brought, the king sets out...

1179
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:12,257
with the princess to meet the Marquis of Carabas.

1180
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:17,127
(Look carefully. The answer is hidden on this page.)

1181
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:19,357
Inside the carriage,

1182
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:23,966
what dessert did they enjoy with tea?

1183
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,066
That's so difficult.

1184
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:27,236
Oh, no. I was close to reading that page.

1185
00:36:27,237 --> 00:36:29,767
- It wasn't written in the text.
- Right.

1186
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:32,937
(Inside the carriage the king was riding with the princess)

1187
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:34,407
It was in the drawing.

1188
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:35,477
- It was in the drawing.
- Sae Ho.

1189
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:37,346
- It was in the drawing.
- Sae Ho.

1190
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:38,517
- Sae Ho?
- The answer is cake.

1191
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:41,317
- Wrong.
- You have to specify the cake.

1192
00:36:41,447 --> 00:36:42,447
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho?

1193
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:44,256
- Carrot cake.
- Wrong.

1194
00:36:44,257 --> 00:36:45,257
- DinDin.
- DinDin?

1195
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:46,887
- Macaron.
- Jong Min.

1196
00:36:47,317 --> 00:36:48,627
- He must be right.
- Sorbet.

1197
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:49,957
DinDin.

1198
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:52,297
- You're correct.
- I didn't even read it.

1199
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:53,557
(Yes!)

1200
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:54,667
I'm going out.

1201
00:36:55,397 --> 00:36:57,226
(He escapes from the sauna.)

1202
00:36:57,227 --> 00:36:59,197
I didn't even read it, but I got it right.

1203
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:02,636
(Answer: Macaron)

1204
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,136
- Let's see.
- Do we get to study for a minute?

1205
00:37:04,137 --> 00:37:06,007
Everyone, you can study for one more minute.

1206
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:08,077
- Is the macaron correct?
- Where is it?

1207
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:09,677
There it is.

1208
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:11,677
Macaron is correct.

1209
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:13,616
Isn't it macaron? What is it?

1210
00:37:13,617 --> 00:37:15,117
- I saw this drawing.
- Is that correct?

1211
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:16,886
If it's macaron, are they in France?

1212
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:18,587
(They still seem at ease.)

1213
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:19,887
(Exclaiming)

1214
00:37:20,017 --> 00:37:21,857
I didn't even read it, but I got it right.

1215
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:24,026
(Lucky DinDin)

1216
00:37:24,027 --> 00:37:25,156
There's no zero, right?

1217
00:37:25,157 --> 00:37:26,927
If I get four, I'll get to go home.

1218
00:37:27,097 --> 00:37:29,397
(DinDin's current position)

1219
00:37:30,127 --> 00:37:33,036
(He has 5 spaces left before going home.)

1220
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:36,707
One, one, two, two, three, four.

1221
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:39,307
There are 2 1s and 2s. And there are 3 and 4.

1222
00:37:39,537 --> 00:37:40,577
Here I go.

1223
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:45,277
(What will be the result?)

1224
00:37:45,517 --> 00:37:46,747
It's three.

1225
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:48,847
Three. I got up to here.

1226
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:52,156
(Start, Finish)

1227
00:37:52,157 --> 00:37:54,557
(2 spaces before going home)

1228
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:57,427
I'm feeling really hot.

1229
00:37:58,097 --> 00:37:59,227
It's so hot.

1230
00:38:00,397 --> 00:38:02,226
Okay.

1231
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:04,166
- Okay, I'll get to go home.
- Which number did you throw?

1232
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:05,396
- Three.
- Really?

1233
00:38:05,397 --> 00:38:07,036
(Currently, DinDin is clearly in the lead.)

1234
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:08,066
Hey, get your things ready.

1235
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:09,067
(To his cameraman)

1236
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:10,067
Get ready to go home.

1237
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:11,136
(Mentally, he's already in his bed.)

1238
00:38:11,137 --> 00:38:12,637
Your study time is over.

1239
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:14,776
- Gosh.
- Here's your next question.

1240
00:38:14,777 --> 00:38:15,777
(It's the second question right away.)

1241
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:18,017
- This is hard.
- Gosh, this is so difficult!

1242
00:38:18,477 --> 00:38:19,516
Our study time is over.

1243
00:38:19,517 --> 00:38:20,817
It's a question on "The Fart Contest."

1244
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:23,517
- "The Fart Contest." - I didn't read that book either.

1245
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:27,017
Ms. Fart and Mr. Fart have...

1246
00:38:27,257 --> 00:38:28,827
different fart sounds.

1247
00:38:30,627 --> 00:38:33,226
How is their fart sound...

1248
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,566
different...

1249
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:36,866
- from each other's?
- Se Yoon.

1250
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:37,896
- Sae Ho.
- Se Yoon.

1251
00:38:37,897 --> 00:38:39,867
- Se Yoon?
- Boong and bbang.

1252
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,237
Wrong.

1253
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:45,737
Ms. Fart's fart is short and quick. Mr. Fart's fart is long.

1254
00:38:46,477 --> 00:38:47,576
- Really?
- That's right.

1255
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:48,577
(What's the answer?)

1256
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:50,577
(Ms. Fart farts short and quick.)

1257
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:52,416
(Mr. Fart farts long.)

1258
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,317
(His answer is accurate.)

1259
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:55,946
- Correct.
- Okay!

1260
00:38:55,947 --> 00:38:57,286
(Sae Ho's answer is correct.)

1261
00:38:57,287 --> 00:39:00,787
I read it. Ms. Fart farts short and quick, and Mr. Fart farts long.

1262
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:04,397
(Annoyed)

1263
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:05,857
That's amazing.

1264
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:09,097
All right, everyone. Please start studying again.

1265
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:11,597
Please.

1266
00:39:12,637 --> 00:39:14,206
(Making a fuss)

1267
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:15,237
Please.

1268
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:17,637
Please.

1269
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:19,607
Please. Here I go.

1270
00:39:20,607 --> 00:39:23,947
(He has to get a high number.)

1271
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:25,616
(Moving forward 2 spaces)

1272
00:39:25,617 --> 00:39:26,677
Goodness.

1273
00:39:27,017 --> 00:39:28,047
Do I go back in?

1274
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:31,816
(He returns quickly before the next question.)

1275
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:32,987
I have to hurry back in and do it quickly.

1276
00:39:34,017 --> 00:39:35,787
He has five grains of rice on his face.

1277
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:38,127
All right, everyone.

1278
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:40,126
I'm sweating so much.

1279
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,196
Let's do it well.

1280
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:42,526
All right, everyone.

1281
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:44,336
(They're getting tired.)

1282
00:39:44,337 --> 00:39:46,837
- In "The Three Little Pigs," - Okay.

1283
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:49,966
Thanks to the youngest pig's cleverness, the Three Little Pigs...

1284
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,376
defeated the wolf and went on a picnic.

1285
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:53,437
Goodness.

1286
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:56,306
(Look at the drawing carefully.)

1287
00:39:56,307 --> 00:39:58,816
Which of the following snacks...

1288
00:39:58,817 --> 00:40:02,216
did the Three Little Pigs not bring for their picnic?

1289
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:03,647
I didn't read it.

1290
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,216
I know the answer.

1291
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:06,487
(Full of confidence)

1292
00:40:06,817 --> 00:40:08,457
Number one, sandwich.

1293
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:10,657
Number two, hot dog.

1294
00:40:10,997 --> 00:40:12,596
Number three, cookies.

1295
00:40:12,597 --> 00:40:14,226
Number four, orange juice.

1296
00:40:14,227 --> 00:40:15,267
- Sae Ho.
- Joon.

1297
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:17,966
- Sae Ho?
- There was no hot dog.

1298
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:19,197
Yes, there was. I saw it.

1299
00:40:20,737 --> 00:40:21,737
There wasn't.

1300
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,236
- Hot dog is correct.
- Okay.

1301
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:26,307
- What...
- The answer is hot dog. I saw it.

1302
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:27,576
I saw the drawing.

1303
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:28,577
(Sae Ho is correct again.)

1304
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:30,177
(Why is he coming out?)

1305
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:32,317
(Many snacks that the Three Little Pigs ate)

1306
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:33,816
(Pancakes, orange juice, orange, grapes, apple, sandwich, )

1307
00:40:33,817 --> 00:40:34,817
(cupcakes, and cheesecake)

1308
00:40:34,818 --> 00:40:38,256
(There is no hot dog.)

1309
00:40:38,257 --> 00:40:39,287
(Shouting with joy)

1310
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:42,157
(Happy)

1311
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:43,387
(Exclaiming)

1312
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:45,597
DinDin only has two spaces to go.

1313
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:49,967
(Please let it be 4.)

1314
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:51,837
(It's 2 again.)

1315
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:53,267
Why is it two?

1316
00:40:54,907 --> 00:40:57,537
(Hooray!)

1317
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,436
Is there something wrong with it?

1318
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:00,636
(Will he ever get to go home at this speed?)

1319
00:41:00,637 --> 00:41:01,647
It's two.

1320
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:03,977
My T-shirt is completely soaked.

1321
00:41:04,617 --> 00:41:06,846
(Seon Ho is covered with sweat.)

1322
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:08,816
If it's too hot, you may go out.

1323
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:10,617
However, the questions will continue.

1324
00:41:12,117 --> 00:41:13,686
- How many did you get?
- Two.

1325
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:14,687
Goodness.

1326
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:17,586
The die is not helping me.

1327
00:41:17,587 --> 00:41:19,196
Why isn't there any question that I know?

1328
00:41:19,197 --> 00:41:20,397
(Frustrated)

1329
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:22,166
It will be this book next.

1330
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,167
("Heungbu and Nolbu")

1331
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:25,397
(Sae Ho and Seon Ho share the book.)

1332
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,136
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

1333
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:29,436
- What?
- What are you doing?

1334
00:41:29,437 --> 00:41:31,437
- I'm reading it.
- Let me read it too.

1335
00:41:34,207 --> 00:41:36,646
(I can't read anymore.)

1336
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:37,716
What is it? "Heungbu and Nolbu?"

1337
00:41:37,717 --> 00:41:39,917
- This is like sous vide.
- Goodness.

1338
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:42,087
I'm getting cooked slowly. It'll be delicious.

1339
00:41:42,517 --> 00:41:44,287
All right, here's the next question.

1340
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:45,987
It's so hot.

1341
00:41:47,317 --> 00:41:48,556
"Heungbu and Nolbu."

1342
00:41:48,557 --> 00:41:49,587
(The fourth question is on "Heungbu and Nolbu.")

1343
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:53,056
When Heungbu found himself in difficult circumstances, he went...

1344
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:56,096
to Nolbu asking for help, saying that his children were starving.

1345
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,097
(Heungbu went to see Nolbu and asked for help.)

1346
00:41:57,467 --> 00:42:00,166
But Nolbu's wife struck Heungbu's cheek...

1347
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,866
with a rice paddle...

1348
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:03,066
- Jong Min.
- Se Yoon.

1349
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:04,067
Okay, Se Yoon.

1350
00:42:04,068 --> 00:42:05,136
- Won't you listen to it?
- It's Jong Min.

1351
00:42:05,137 --> 00:42:06,406
- You went first.
- You did.

1352
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:07,806
- Go ahead.
- We didn't hear the question.

1353
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:08,807
Okay.

1354
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:10,677
- Se Yoon.
- Six.

1355
00:42:12,177 --> 00:42:13,446
- Se Yoon.
- This is difficult.

1356
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,447
It must be correct.

1357
00:42:15,217 --> 00:42:16,217
- Wrong.
- Seon Ho.

1358
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:17,217
- Joon.
- Jong Min.

1359
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:18,457
We didn't hear the question yet.

1360
00:42:18,557 --> 00:42:20,016
- Jong Min.
- He should go.

1361
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:21,027
Jong Min?

1362
00:42:21,487 --> 00:42:23,226
He has five grains of rice on his face.

1363
00:42:23,227 --> 00:42:24,257
(He definitely read it earlier.)

1364
00:42:24,857 --> 00:42:26,327
- Five.
- The answer is five.

1365
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:28,327
- Five grains of rice.
- There were five on his cheek.

1366
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:30,796
Jong Min.

1367
00:42:30,797 --> 00:42:31,797
(He counted wrong.)

1368
00:42:31,798 --> 00:42:32,967
- Wrong.
- Joon.

1369
00:42:33,397 --> 00:42:34,467
Four.

1370
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:36,166
- Wrong.
- Shall we listen to the question?

1371
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,306
- Here's the question.
- Okay.

1372
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:38,636
- Don't interrupt.
- All right.

1373
00:42:38,637 --> 00:42:41,306
What's the number of rice grains on the rice paddle...

1374
00:42:41,307 --> 00:42:43,176
and Heungbu's cheek?

1375
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:44,246
- Seon Ho.
- Se Yoon.

1376
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:45,516
- What's the total?
- What's the number?

1377
00:42:45,517 --> 00:42:48,187
- What's the number?
- The total?

1378
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:49,847
- Seon Ho. Nine.
- Seon Ho?

1379
00:42:49,947 --> 00:42:51,716
- Se Yoon.
- Jong Min.

1380
00:42:51,717 --> 00:42:52,717
Seon Ho is wrong.

1381
00:42:52,718 --> 00:42:53,756
Jong Min.

1382
00:42:53,757 --> 00:42:55,326
(The competition is intense for this question.)

1383
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:56,456
- Jong Min.
- Ten grains.

1384
00:42:56,457 --> 00:42:58,797
- DinDin.
- Jong Min.

1385
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,356
Correct.

1386
00:43:00,357 --> 00:43:01,467
- How many did he say?
- How many did he say?

1387
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:04,026
(6 grains of rice on Heungbu's cheek...)

1388
00:43:04,027 --> 00:43:05,466
(and 4 grains on the rice paddle)

1389
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:07,197
(A total of 10)

1390
00:43:08,037 --> 00:43:09,266
Do I just throw it?

1391
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:10,267
Please.

1392
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:11,607
(Se Yoon is currently in last place.)

1393
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:15,247
(2 spaces)

1394
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:17,246
Goodness, I'm so unlucky.

1395
00:43:17,247 --> 00:43:18,347
(Will I ever get to go home?)

1396
00:43:18,977 --> 00:43:20,477
DinDin only needs a two to finish.

1397
00:43:21,587 --> 00:43:24,456
(DinDin is still in 1st place.)

1398
00:43:24,457 --> 00:43:25,457
Here we go again.

1399
00:43:25,757 --> 00:43:27,456
The next question is on "Puss in Boots."

1400
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:28,827
I didn't even read it.

1401
00:43:29,057 --> 00:43:32,926
To win the king's favor, the cat presented a gift,

1402
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:35,496
claiming that it was from the Marquis of Carabas...

1403
00:43:35,497 --> 00:43:36,766
- DinDin.
- Joon.

1404
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:37,767
- Joon?
- I said it first.

1405
00:43:37,768 --> 00:43:38,996
- DinDin.
- DinDin?

1406
00:43:38,997 --> 00:43:41,567
Quail, rabbit,

1407
00:43:42,137 --> 00:43:43,167
and peacock.

1408
00:43:43,337 --> 00:43:44,877
- That's correct.
- I just read it.

1409
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:46,477
That's the only thing I read just now.

1410
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:47,846
The questions are...

1411
00:43:47,847 --> 00:43:49,077
Home Sweet Home

1412
00:43:51,277 --> 00:43:52,677
(He's too tired to even look at him.)

1413
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:55,386
(Celebrating his being close to going home)

1414
00:43:55,387 --> 00:43:56,946
(Three presents that the cat sent to the king)

1415
00:43:56,947 --> 00:43:58,016
(Quail, rabbit, peacock)

1416
00:43:58,017 --> 00:44:00,916
- DinDin is correct.
- He got it again.

1417
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:02,556
I also saw the peacock,

1418
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:03,686
but I couldn't remember it.

1419
00:44:03,687 --> 00:44:04,696
(Regretful)

1420
00:44:04,697 --> 00:44:06,497
Gosh, I'm going home.

1421
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:09,827
I'm going to die. Let me take a break.

1422
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,696
I'm going to die. Let me take a break.

1423
00:44:11,697 --> 00:44:14,437
- Here I go.
- Hurry up and go.

1424
00:44:14,737 --> 00:44:17,566
(2 spaces remain before he gets to go home.)

1425
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:18,676
(To be continued)

1426
00:44:18,677 --> 00:44:19,677
(If he gets a 2 or higher, he'll get to go home.)

1427
00:44:19,678 --> 00:44:21,147
- I just need a 2.
- Let it be 0 or 1.

1428
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:31,917
(Will DinDin be able to go home right away?)

1429
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,875
Hurry up and go.

1430
00:44:33,975 --> 00:44:35,405
- I just need a 2.
- Let it be 0 or 1.

1431
00:44:40,615 --> 00:44:45,995
(Will DinDin be able to go home right away?)

1432
00:44:46,955 --> 00:44:48,695
(Moving forward 1 space)

1433
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,465
My goodness.

1434
00:44:51,095 --> 00:44:52,294
- Do it 1 more time.
- Do it 1 more time.

1435
00:44:52,295 --> 00:44:54,095
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

1436
00:44:55,105 --> 00:44:56,934
- He got a 1.
- He got a 1.

1437
00:44:56,935 --> 00:44:58,104
- Really?
- This is ridiculous.

1438
00:44:58,105 --> 00:45:00,174
(Returning with regret)

1439
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:01,175
We have to start right away.

1440
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:02,344
- Before he comes back.
- Give us the question...

1441
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:03,375
now!

1442
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:05,314
Hurry up!

1443
00:45:05,315 --> 00:45:07,145
(He's already back.)

1444
00:45:07,685 --> 00:45:10,815
(Scanning mostly the drawings)

1445
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:12,684
- Give us the question now.
- Hurry.

1446
00:45:12,685 --> 00:45:13,855
(It's so hot.)

1447
00:45:14,015 --> 00:45:16,324
In "The Three Little Pigs..."

1448
00:45:16,325 --> 00:45:17,485
It's 125kg.

1449
00:45:19,225 --> 00:45:22,124
The eldest of the Three Little Pigs built...

1450
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:24,495
- a house of straw on a field.
- That's right.

1451
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:27,035
How did the eldest pig...

1452
00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:29,235
- build his house?
- DinDin.

1453
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:31,635
Carelessly.

1454
00:45:33,335 --> 00:45:34,474
- Jong Min.
- Isn't that correct?

1455
00:45:34,475 --> 00:45:36,145
- Seon Ho.
- Which number?

1456
00:45:36,905 --> 00:45:38,175
- "Which number?" - What do you mean?

1457
00:45:41,345 --> 00:45:43,785
("Carelessly" is correct.)

1458
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:45,914
It must be a multiple-choice question.

1459
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:47,014
You're in trouble.

1460
00:45:47,015 --> 00:45:48,954
- Sae Ho.
- No way.

1461
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,084
Try to guess.

1462
00:45:50,085 --> 00:45:51,095
(He has to guess the correct number.)

1463
00:45:51,925 --> 00:45:53,795
(Thinking hard)

1464
00:45:54,295 --> 00:45:55,894
Number four, carelessly.

1465
00:45:55,895 --> 00:45:56,895
- Jong Min.
- Sae Ho.

1466
00:45:56,896 --> 00:45:58,694
- Number four is wrong.
- Sae Ho.

1467
00:45:58,695 --> 00:45:59,934
- Sae Ho.
- Jong Min.

1468
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,004
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Jong Min.

1469
00:46:02,005 --> 00:46:03,704
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- What's the point?

1470
00:46:03,705 --> 00:46:04,705
We don't know which number it is.

1471
00:46:04,706 --> 00:46:05,904
If you...

1472
00:46:05,905 --> 00:46:07,474
- Number two, carelessly.
- Jong Min.

1473
00:46:07,475 --> 00:46:09,204
You can't answer yet. He has to say, "Wrong."

1474
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:10,704
- Wrong.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1475
00:46:10,705 --> 00:46:12,314
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1476
00:46:12,315 --> 00:46:13,474
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1477
00:46:13,475 --> 00:46:14,484
Okay.

1478
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:15,785
(Se Yoon gets a chance.)

1479
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:17,045
All right.

1480
00:46:17,145 --> 00:46:18,454
It's either 1, 3, or 5.

1481
00:46:18,455 --> 00:46:19,455
Hurry up and do it.

1482
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,025
Say 15.

1483
00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:23,224
How many choices are there?

1484
00:46:23,225 --> 00:46:24,625
(Don't assume that there are five choices.)

1485
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:26,124
Number three, carelessly.

1486
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,764
I bet it's correct. I almost said that too.

1487
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:29,524
Se Yoon, number three, carelessly.

1488
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:30,764
- It's correct.
- It's wrong.

1489
00:46:30,765 --> 00:46:32,035
You can tell from the look on his face.

1490
00:46:32,895 --> 00:46:33,965
Correct.

1491
00:46:34,765 --> 00:46:36,535
This is crazy. Thank you, Jong Min.

1492
00:46:37,805 --> 00:46:38,805
(Unable to endure the heat, everyone comes out.)

1493
00:46:38,806 --> 00:46:39,875
My goodness.

1494
00:46:40,335 --> 00:46:41,375
Gosh.

1495
00:46:41,505 --> 00:46:43,604
It's too hot to study.

1496
00:46:43,605 --> 00:46:45,145
(How did the eldest pig build his house?)

1497
00:46:47,415 --> 00:46:48,845
If I get a four, I'll tie with Jong Min.

1498
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:53,385
It's coming back.

1499
00:46:54,585 --> 00:46:55,655
I caught up with Jong Min. Okay.

1500
00:46:55,725 --> 00:46:56,854
Okay. I caught up with Jong Min.

1501
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,125
- I don't think I have a chance.
- I'm in the same space as him now.

1502
00:46:58,325 --> 00:46:59,724
I can't seem to move forward.

1503
00:46:59,725 --> 00:47:00,924
(Se Yoon successfully caught up with Jong Min.)

1504
00:47:00,925 --> 00:47:02,424
- You have many difficult questions.
- Let's hurry up.

1505
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:03,425
Let's do it. One minute has passed, right?

1506
00:47:03,725 --> 00:47:05,535
- Did it go well?
- Yes, I got a four.

1507
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,735
I caught up with Jong Min. Let's hurry up.

1508
00:47:09,165 --> 00:47:10,804
Okay. Time's up.

1509
00:47:10,805 --> 00:47:11,934
(Let's hurry up.)

1510
00:47:11,935 --> 00:47:13,704
In "The Fart Contest,"

1511
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,104
(The seventh question)

1512
00:47:15,105 --> 00:47:18,175
when Mr. Fart Machine from the neighboring town farted,

1513
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:20,074
the millstone rattled,

1514
00:47:20,075 --> 00:47:22,684
and the Korean A-frame and the bag of rice moved up and down.

1515
00:47:22,685 --> 00:47:23,714
- Sae Ho.
- Jong Min.

1516
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,754
- Sae Ho.
- Jong Min.

1517
00:47:24,755 --> 00:47:26,515
- I was fast. Let me answer.
- Let me answer, please!

1518
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:27,655
Sae Ho, go ahead.

1519
00:47:27,656 --> 00:47:30,355
There was a rock, and it shook.

1520
00:47:31,525 --> 00:47:32,654
So what's the answer?

1521
00:47:32,655 --> 00:47:33,655
It shook.

1522
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:36,124
- Your answer is, "It shook?" - What number is it?

1523
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,125
- Yes.
- What number?

1524
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:39,564
Sae Ho, your answer is incorrect.

1525
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,635
- Wrong?
- What?

1526
00:47:41,205 --> 00:47:42,205
But it shook.

1527
00:47:42,206 --> 00:47:43,635
(It's not the right answer?)

1528
00:47:44,735 --> 00:47:47,804
(He was right about the rock shaking.)

1529
00:47:47,805 --> 00:47:50,004
- Listen to the question.
- There's more.

1530
00:47:50,005 --> 00:47:51,314
I didn't even read the book. What's the point?

1531
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:53,175
All right. Then...

1532
00:47:55,585 --> 00:47:57,714
- what shook?
- Seon Ho.

1533
00:47:57,715 --> 00:47:59,554
- Jong Min.
- I was fast.

1534
00:47:59,555 --> 00:48:01,024
- I was really fast.
- What is it?

1535
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:02,484
- Check the video. I was fast.
- Let's check the video.

1536
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:04,054
- Do the VAR.
- But this is...

1537
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:05,224
I was faster than the other two.

1538
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:06,225
You guys should play rock-paper-scissors.

1539
00:48:06,226 --> 00:48:09,864
(In a situation like this, rock-paper-scissors is fair.)

1540
00:48:09,865 --> 00:48:11,765
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1541
00:48:11,995 --> 00:48:13,834
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1542
00:48:13,835 --> 00:48:15,104
- Okay. I won.
- No.

1543
00:48:15,105 --> 00:48:16,204
- You didn't throw it right away.
- Right, he didn't.

1544
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:17,435
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1545
00:48:17,905 --> 00:48:21,505
(Who will be the lucky man that gets to answer?)

1546
00:48:25,675 --> 00:48:27,074
(It's DinDin as expected. He's always lucky.)

1547
00:48:27,075 --> 00:48:29,385
Home sweet home!

1548
00:48:30,145 --> 00:48:32,985
(He has 1 space left to go. He'll go home regardless of the result.)

1549
00:48:33,755 --> 00:48:36,154
- Roll the die. Did you roll it?
- Home sweet home!

1550
00:48:36,155 --> 00:48:38,895
(DinDin is the first member to go home.)

1551
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:39,994
Only one of us has reached the finish line.

1552
00:48:39,995 --> 00:48:41,824
(Exploding with excitement)

1553
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:44,464
Let's go!

1554
00:48:44,465 --> 00:48:45,665
- Did he get to the finish line?
- Gosh, that little...

1555
00:48:45,995 --> 00:48:47,095
That sly punk.

1556
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:49,665
I was the one who said the correct answer.

1557
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:50,805
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

1558
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:52,704
I said the rock shook.

1559
00:48:52,705 --> 00:48:53,705
- So?
- So?

1560
00:48:54,405 --> 00:48:56,105
But you said the answer was, "It shook."

1561
00:48:56,445 --> 00:48:58,315
I think Jong Min and I will be the last two people left.

1562
00:48:58,975 --> 00:49:00,774
Wait. Now I have a chance too.

1563
00:49:00,775 --> 00:49:01,985
(Don't say such a thing.)

1564
00:49:02,345 --> 00:49:04,854
Well, I don't even know. I'll just sleep in Seoul tonight.

1565
00:49:04,855 --> 00:49:05,884
(Seon Ho has almost given up.)

1566
00:49:05,885 --> 00:49:06,984
I need to get three more questions right.

1567
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,925
Yong Han, I need to get three more questions right to go home.

1568
00:49:09,455 --> 00:49:10,884
- You should keep trying.
- I should...

1569
00:49:10,885 --> 00:49:11,995
(The cameraman filming Seon Ho says he should keep trying.)

1570
00:49:12,555 --> 00:49:13,854
(I can go home only if you go home.)

1571
00:49:13,855 --> 00:49:14,895
Then I'll keep trying.

1572
00:49:15,065 --> 00:49:16,264
I'll try my best.

1573
00:49:16,265 --> 00:49:17,934
(You've got this!)

1574
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:19,664
You're lucky to be paired with me.

1575
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,264
(The cameraman filming DinDin says, "Thank you, DinDin.")

1576
00:49:21,265 --> 00:49:23,464
Since DinDin has been chosen to be the first one to go home...

1577
00:49:23,465 --> 00:49:24,475
Can't we go home?

1578
00:49:24,705 --> 00:49:26,875
From now on, you don't get to roll the dice.

1579
00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:28,544
What then? Do we compete for food?

1580
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:29,804
- You will compete only for food.
- Then...

1581
00:49:29,805 --> 00:49:32,374
That means we still have one round left to play since he won.

1582
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:35,684
Sae Ho and Se Yoon got two questions right each.

1583
00:49:35,685 --> 00:49:38,085
- Okay.
- I'll give you three questions.

1584
00:49:38,255 --> 00:49:40,015
Can I leave if I get this one right?

1585
00:49:40,085 --> 00:49:41,124
Yes.

1586
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:43,625
Here goes the question. In "Heungbu and Nolbu,"

1587
00:49:43,925 --> 00:49:47,424
Nolbu received a gourd seed from the swallow and planted it.

1588
00:49:47,425 --> 00:49:48,924
- Yes, that's right.
- But...

1589
00:49:48,925 --> 00:49:51,394
unlike Heungbu, every time he cut open a gourd,

1590
00:49:51,395 --> 00:49:53,394
people with clubs came out of the gourd...

1591
00:49:53,395 --> 00:49:54,864
and hit Nolbu and his wife.

1592
00:49:54,865 --> 00:49:55,905
Se Yoon.

1593
00:49:56,565 --> 00:49:57,565
Goblin.

1594
00:49:58,535 --> 00:50:00,535
Wrong. Then...

1595
00:50:00,935 --> 00:50:04,145
how many people with clubs came out of the gourds?

1596
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:06,174
- Jong Min.
- Sae Ho.

1597
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:08,215
(Jong Min was slightly faster than Sae Ho.)

1598
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:09,515
Three.

1599
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:10,885
Wrong.

1600
00:50:11,285 --> 00:50:12,614
- Sae Ho.
- Go ahead.

1601
00:50:12,615 --> 00:50:13,615
Five.

1602
00:50:14,355 --> 00:50:15,755
Sae Ho's answer is correct.

1603
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:17,325
You got one question right.

1604
00:50:17,326 --> 00:50:18,625
- Can I leave and stay outside?
- Okay.

1605
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:22,924
(One of them doesn't have a club.)

1606
00:50:22,925 --> 00:50:24,025
That means...

1607
00:50:24,395 --> 00:50:25,895
we won't get to eat food even if we get all two questions right.

1608
00:50:26,935 --> 00:50:28,565
We won't get to eat food even if we get all two questions right.

1609
00:50:28,905 --> 00:50:30,205
You'll have a chance if you do.

1610
00:50:30,465 --> 00:50:32,704
- There will be another round.
- Oh, is that so? Okay.

1611
00:50:32,705 --> 00:50:33,805
(So I still have a chance.)

1612
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:35,404
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1613
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:36,574
I'm jealous.

1614
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,914
- My efforts have paid off.
- I'm jealous.

1615
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:39,414
- The answer was "rock." - Home sweet home

1616
00:50:39,415 --> 00:50:41,644
(DinDin dances to celebrate.)

1617
00:50:41,645 --> 00:50:43,184
I want you not to do that.

1618
00:50:43,185 --> 00:50:44,414
- I want you to stop dancing.
- Come on, DinDin.

1619
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:46,184
- I want you not to do that.
- I really hate the sight of it.

1620
00:50:46,185 --> 00:50:47,924
(He can't control his excitement.)

1621
00:50:47,925 --> 00:50:49,284
I really hate the sight of this.

1622
00:50:49,285 --> 00:50:51,654
(Cheeky)

1623
00:50:51,655 --> 00:50:52,724
- Give us the next one right away.
- Okay.

1624
00:50:52,725 --> 00:50:54,564
I can start anyway.

1625
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:56,264
He hasn't come back in here, so we can do it without him.

1626
00:50:56,265 --> 00:50:57,394
- Okay. This question is...
- He's given up.

1627
00:50:57,395 --> 00:50:59,695
- about "The Three Little Pigs." - Got it.

1628
00:51:00,295 --> 00:51:02,104
In "The Three Little Pigs,"

1629
00:51:02,105 --> 00:51:05,374
after the second little pig built his house out of wood,

1630
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:06,474
what did he eat, lying on the hammock?

1631
00:51:06,475 --> 00:51:07,475
- Seon Ho.
- Jong Min.

1632
00:51:07,475 --> 00:51:08,475
- Seon Ho, go ahead.
- An apple.

1633
00:51:08,476 --> 00:51:09,644
- An apple.
- Seon Ho's answer is correct.

1634
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:10,744
- Okay.
- Okay.

1635
00:51:10,745 --> 00:51:11,914
- How many questions...
- I wish you'd given this one...

1636
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:13,044
earlier when I could roll the dice?

1637
00:51:13,045 --> 00:51:14,474
Did you get one question right?

1638
00:51:14,475 --> 00:51:15,484
Here goes the last question.

1639
00:51:15,485 --> 00:51:16,885
If Jong Min gets this one right, I'll win.

1640
00:51:19,055 --> 00:51:20,914
- Why did he come back suddenly?
- He's back.

1641
00:51:20,915 --> 00:51:21,985
Keep the door open.

1642
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:23,885
- In "The Fart Contest," - I didn't read that.

1643
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:26,125
What's the color of the ribbon on the jeogori...

1644
00:51:26,555 --> 00:51:28,164
worn by Mr. Fart Machine from the neighboring town?

1645
00:51:28,165 --> 00:51:29,165
- Seon Ho.
- Joon.

1646
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:30,225
- Seon Ho, go ahead.
- Purple.

1647
00:51:31,895 --> 00:51:34,165
(If it's the correct answer, he'll tie with Se Yoon.)

1648
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:35,634
- That's correct.
- Seon Ho's answer is correct.

1649
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:37,035
- Okay. I'm off.
- It's a match between you two.

1650
00:51:37,065 --> 00:51:38,905
- You two, compete with each other.
- Why didn't I do well earlier?

1651
00:51:38,935 --> 00:51:40,335
- It's between you two.
- We'll have a final round.

1652
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:43,675
(It's amazing that he remembered the color of this.)

1653
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:45,114
- You two, compete with each other.
- Why didn't I do well earlier?

1654
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:46,374
- You two, compete with each other.
- It's between you two.

1655
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:47,645
(Those with zero points leave the room.)

1656
00:51:48,215 --> 00:51:49,684
Here goes the last question.

1657
00:51:49,685 --> 00:51:51,454
(This is the final round to decide the winner.)

1658
00:51:51,455 --> 00:51:53,654
The winner will get to eat food. Why...

1659
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:55,224
(They've never been this unmotivated when food is on the line.)

1660
00:51:55,225 --> 00:51:56,854
- I'll give you an easy question.
- Can you...

1661
00:51:56,855 --> 00:51:58,325
- give us an easy question?
- Listen carefully.

1662
00:51:58,725 --> 00:52:01,264
When Heungbu and his wife were cutting a gourd open...

1663
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:03,764
while standing facing each other, what chant did they say?

1664
00:52:03,765 --> 00:52:04,765
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho.

1665
00:52:04,766 --> 00:52:06,234
- "Let's go?" - Wrong.

1666
00:52:06,235 --> 00:52:07,765
Se Yoon. "Heave-ho."

1667
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:09,435
- Wrong.
- Se Yoon.

1668
00:52:09,905 --> 00:52:11,065
"Heave away!"

1669
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:13,174
- "Heave away." - Let's do this

1670
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:15,244
- I'll give you a hint.
- Okay.

1671
00:52:15,245 --> 00:52:17,575
(Humming)

1672
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:19,045
One-two, one-two?

1673
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:23,184
Se Yoon. "Going great."

1674
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:24,185
(Did you see the answer?)

1675
00:52:26,255 --> 00:52:28,754
(The answer is "scritch-scratch.")

1676
00:52:28,755 --> 00:52:30,254
- Shall I give you another hint?
- Sorry?

1677
00:52:30,255 --> 00:52:31,525
- Shall I give you the first letter?
- Yes.

1678
00:52:32,455 --> 00:52:34,294
- It's "S." - Se Yoon.

1679
00:52:34,295 --> 00:52:35,365
Go ahead.

1680
00:52:35,825 --> 00:52:36,994
"Screech-screech."

1681
00:52:36,995 --> 00:52:37,995
(Screech-screech)

1682
00:52:38,395 --> 00:52:40,394
- Se Yoon's answer is...
- Is it not correct?

1683
00:52:40,395 --> 00:52:41,465
- incorrect.
- What?

1684
00:52:42,235 --> 00:52:43,235
"Screechy-screechy."

1685
00:52:43,665 --> 00:52:45,575
- No. Wrong.
- But...

1686
00:52:46,175 --> 00:52:47,935
"Scritch-scratch."

1687
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:49,374
Oh, that's correct.

1688
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,214
- Se Yoon's answer is correct.
- Thank you.

1689
00:52:52,215 --> 00:52:53,515
- I can't believe it.
- Let's get out of here now.

1690
00:52:56,015 --> 00:52:57,015
Who's the winner?

1691
00:52:59,585 --> 00:53:01,754
- Really?
- Good job, my friend.

1692
00:53:01,755 --> 00:53:04,285
Seon Ho ended up getting nothing. He just sweated in there.

1693
00:53:04,455 --> 00:53:05,525
Me too.

1694
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:10,024
(The staff members escape the room as well.)

1695
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:11,294
- Oh, my goodness.
- Look how sweaty he is.

1696
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,634
Our staff members are amazing.

1697
00:53:12,635 --> 00:53:13,665
They never left the room.

1698
00:53:14,235 --> 00:53:15,465
Is that even possible? Are you all right?

1699
00:53:16,205 --> 00:53:17,904
Gosh, it's hot.

1700
00:53:17,905 --> 00:53:18,905
Hurry up. Let's go.

1701
00:53:18,906 --> 00:53:20,034
(No.)

1702
00:53:20,035 --> 00:53:21,945
- You guys did a great job.
- Great job.

1703
00:53:22,475 --> 00:53:24,104
- They stayed in there...
- That's amazing.

1704
00:53:24,105 --> 00:53:25,114
For longer than we did.

1705
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:26,374
They never left the room.

1706
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:27,415
I'm cold now that I'm out here.

1707
00:53:27,845 --> 00:53:31,115
As a result of the game, the members who will have dinner...

1708
00:53:31,415 --> 00:53:34,485
are DinDin, Se Yoon, and Sae Ho.

1709
00:53:35,185 --> 00:53:36,225
Eat with us before going home.

1710
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:38,954
Or you can pick one of us who can eat instead of you.

1711
00:53:38,955 --> 00:53:40,124
You can hand over your right to eat.

1712
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:42,194
- I see. I'll hear the rest first.
- You can do that too.

1713
00:53:42,195 --> 00:53:44,494
Since we came to a sauna,

1714
00:53:44,495 --> 00:53:46,895
we'll take a break, lying around.

1715
00:53:47,565 --> 00:53:49,705
- We need to hydrate ourselves.
- Right.

1716
00:53:50,165 --> 00:53:51,604
- Buy us something to drink.
- Right. Buy us something to drink.

1717
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:52,874
- All right.
- I'll give you something in return.

1718
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:54,134
What do you want to drink?

1719
00:53:54,135 --> 00:53:55,574
Since we're at a sauna, we should drink a cup of sikhye.

1720
00:53:55,575 --> 00:53:57,144
- I want a cup of black coffee.
- Okay.

1721
00:53:57,145 --> 00:53:58,214
Okay.

1722
00:53:58,215 --> 00:53:59,215
(Based on his pose, he wants something.)

1723
00:53:59,216 --> 00:54:02,085
- You look so cool.
- When I turn, bow your head.

1724
00:54:02,545 --> 00:54:03,844
I want sparkling water.

1725
00:54:03,845 --> 00:54:06,015
(Ta-da)

1726
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:09,025
(They bow to DinDin in 1 second.)

1727
00:54:10,355 --> 00:54:11,994
Why should we bow our heads?

1728
00:54:11,995 --> 00:54:12,995
(I have no pride as long as I can drink sikhye.)

1729
00:54:12,996 --> 00:54:14,524
You won't buy us beverages if we don't bow?

1730
00:54:14,525 --> 00:54:15,795
No, I won't buy you anything.

1731
00:54:16,865 --> 00:54:20,035
I'll dance. You guys should cheer. One, two, three.

1732
00:54:20,535 --> 00:54:22,605
(They start cheering.)

1733
00:54:23,435 --> 00:54:26,004
- Lim Cheol!
- Lim Cheol!

1734
00:54:26,005 --> 00:54:27,505
(You're so cool.)

1735
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:28,944
- Lim Cheol!
- Lim Cheol!

1736
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:30,104
(It's hard to get free sikhye.)

1737
00:54:30,105 --> 00:54:32,275
- Okay. That's enough.
- You're amazing.

1738
00:54:32,715 --> 00:54:35,115
Everyone, tell me what you want. I'll go...

1739
00:54:35,915 --> 00:54:37,844
I guess he'll buy drinks for the staff members too.

1740
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:39,485
Come forward for a second.

1741
00:54:39,785 --> 00:54:40,954
Wait. Hold on.

1742
00:54:40,955 --> 00:54:42,724
- Everyone in here, cheer!
- Hold on a second.

1743
00:54:42,725 --> 00:54:44,254
- He'll buy us beverages!
- DinDin!

1744
00:54:44,255 --> 00:54:46,294
- DinDin!
- Lim Cheol!

1745
00:54:46,295 --> 00:54:47,755
(DinDin cares so much about us.)

1746
00:54:48,295 --> 00:54:50,024
All right. It's on me.

1747
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:52,595
Wait. In return, everyone should...

1748
00:54:53,565 --> 00:54:54,764
You should all bow to me.

1749
00:54:54,765 --> 00:54:56,034
(It'll be a great gift for everyone who worked hard.)

1750
00:54:56,035 --> 00:54:57,135
It's on me.

1751
00:54:57,865 --> 00:55:00,304
(DinDin is the best.)

1752
00:55:00,305 --> 00:55:01,374
DinDin, thank you for this.

1753
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,644
- Sae Ho, what do you want to drink?
- Thank you.

1754
00:55:02,645 --> 00:55:04,175
(We all enjoyed the beverages.)

1755
00:55:04,545 --> 00:55:07,045
(Meanwhile, the sun has gone down.)

1756
00:55:08,015 --> 00:55:09,015
Where are we going now?

1757
00:55:09,016 --> 00:55:10,714
We're going to the restaurant.

1758
00:55:10,715 --> 00:55:11,785
- Really?
- Yes.

1759
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:13,284
- I'm hungry.
- Because we sweated there,

1760
00:55:13,285 --> 00:55:14,585
- we're all hungry.
- I'm hungry too.

1761
00:55:15,585 --> 00:55:16,855
The restaurant we're going to...

1762
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:19,255
has been awarded a Blue Ribbon 11 times.

1763
00:55:19,855 --> 00:55:20,995
They must serve good food.

1764
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,364
You'll have charcoal-grilled duck.

1765
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:23,864
- Nice.
- Could it be the one I know?

1766
00:55:23,865 --> 00:55:26,794
I wonder how duck tastes when it's charcoal grilled.

1767
00:55:26,795 --> 00:55:28,935
- It must be tasty.
- It's charcoal grilled.

1768
00:55:29,835 --> 00:55:31,404
- I wonder how it tastes.
- I've never tried it before.

1769
00:55:31,405 --> 00:55:33,735
- I've never tried it before either.
- We've tried it.

1770
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:35,945
DinDin, how are you feeling now?

1771
00:55:36,505 --> 00:55:38,914
Tell us about your honest feelings.

1772
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:40,774
- To be honest, it's complicated.
- Is it?

1773
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:41,784
So you're not just excited?

1774
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:44,215
I want to get off the bus and go home right now.

1775
00:55:44,685 --> 00:55:47,954
- We would get angry.
- We all knew he'd go home first.

1776
00:55:47,955 --> 00:55:49,125
- That's true.
- We all knew he'd leave first.

1777
00:55:49,455 --> 00:55:51,125
Let's have fun after he leaves.

1778
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:54,024
- Let's have fun without him.
- I'm excited.

1779
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:55,295
DinDin says he wants to come back.

1780
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:57,665
You guys have fun without me.

1781
00:55:58,065 --> 00:55:59,834
Wait. Can't he go home now? He can, can't he?

1782
00:55:59,835 --> 00:56:01,464
But it's not that simple.

1783
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:03,634
- You'd know if you had won.
- Right.

1784
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:05,834
- Of course.
- It's complicated.

1785
00:56:05,835 --> 00:56:07,634
You should stay strong and go home.

1786
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:09,104
Never doubt yourself.

1787
00:56:09,105 --> 00:56:11,445
When we played the games,

1788
00:56:11,945 --> 00:56:14,074
you did your very best to go home today.

1789
00:56:14,075 --> 00:56:15,745
- Yes, he did.
- You matched the Go stones well.

1790
00:56:16,215 --> 00:56:18,215
Go home with your head held high. Please stop the bus.

1791
00:56:19,215 --> 00:56:20,754
- That's not necessary.
- He won't leave now.

1792
00:56:20,755 --> 00:56:22,254
Just open the door, please.

1793
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:24,085
- He can jump out of the bus.
- That's right.

1794
00:56:24,425 --> 00:56:25,754
I'll have some duck before leaving.

1795
00:56:25,755 --> 00:56:27,654
- Okay. Have some before leaving.
- Even if I'm there with you...

1796
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:29,565
Or you can do this. While enjoying the food,

1797
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:30,925
leave when you've had enough.

1798
00:56:31,365 --> 00:56:32,564
I'll take off the mic by myself.

1799
00:56:32,565 --> 00:56:33,965
- Okay.
- That will do.

1800
00:56:34,935 --> 00:56:36,934
We have a little over three hours left...

1801
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,335
until we can go home today.

1802
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:41,905
I wonder how many of us will get to go home today.

1803
00:56:42,445 --> 00:56:44,875
- I think one more person will go.
- That's right.

1804
00:56:45,045 --> 00:56:46,514
I think two more people will go.

1805
00:56:46,515 --> 00:56:47,515
- Really?
- That would be great.

1806
00:56:47,516 --> 00:56:48,644
I think they'll let half of us go.

1807
00:56:48,645 --> 00:56:51,184
They should. Only then can we call this a get-off-work mission.

1808
00:56:51,185 --> 00:56:53,554
I think two of us will go home today including DinDin.

1809
00:56:53,555 --> 00:56:54,555
Right, we're using our brains to play games...

1810
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:55,785
I think four of us will go home.

1811
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:58,524
- Four of us?
- With just one person left behind?

1812
00:56:58,525 --> 00:56:59,594
Two people left behind.

1813
00:56:59,595 --> 00:57:00,595
(While dreaming of going home the same day)

1814
00:57:00,596 --> 00:57:03,164
- Is it all right?
- We're all on the same boat.

1815
00:57:03,165 --> 00:57:04,365
(Let's leave the dice behind and have dinner.)

1816
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,195
It smells amazing.

1817
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:08,135
We're getting rewarded here.

1818
00:57:08,405 --> 00:57:09,405
It's three of us.

1819
00:57:09,406 --> 00:57:10,734
(Moving to the winner's table with excitement)

1820
00:57:10,735 --> 00:57:12,174
But this is...

1821
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:14,004
DinDin should sit here, so he can go home whenever he wants to.

1822
00:57:14,005 --> 00:57:15,375
- Right.
- Let us two enjoy dinner.

1823
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:16,904
Goodness.

1824
00:57:16,905 --> 00:57:17,945
So this duck...

1825
00:57:18,315 --> 00:57:20,674
Can I even have dinner here? This is amazing.

1826
00:57:20,675 --> 00:57:21,814
Can he eat here?

1827
00:57:21,815 --> 00:57:23,415
I was going to give you some.

1828
00:57:23,885 --> 00:57:24,955
Now I feel bad.

1829
00:57:25,415 --> 00:57:27,785
This duck... I'm going to faint.

1830
00:57:27,985 --> 00:57:30,154
Gosh, this doenjang stew...

1831
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,384
It smells so good.

1832
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:33,224
- This is incredible.
- Goodness, look.

1833
00:57:33,225 --> 00:57:34,225
(Today's main dish is here.)

1834
00:57:34,226 --> 00:57:36,124
- Goodness.
- They grilled it for us.

1835
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:37,194
It's all cooked.

1836
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:38,594
We can just place it and eat.

1837
00:57:38,595 --> 00:57:39,695
They grilled it for us already.

1838
00:57:39,935 --> 00:57:43,204
(Grilling it on top of charcoal)

1839
00:57:43,205 --> 00:57:45,935
(Grilled duck filled with a smoky flavor)

1840
00:57:48,905 --> 00:57:50,844
- Can I eat it now?
- You can eat it.

1841
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:51,975
Thank you for the meal.

1842
00:57:52,275 --> 00:57:54,044
The smoky aroma is so good.

1843
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:55,515
This smells amazing.

1844
00:57:56,145 --> 00:57:57,184
- Goodness.
- Oh, my...

1845
00:57:57,185 --> 00:57:58,314
It's all cooked.

1846
00:57:58,315 --> 00:57:59,554
- We can eat it.
- Let's eat.

1847
00:57:59,555 --> 00:58:00,884
They grilled it for us.

1848
00:58:00,885 --> 00:58:04,255
(Grilling it one more time)

1849
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:06,854
This duck fat is good for our bodies.

1850
00:58:06,855 --> 00:58:08,055
Saturated fat.

1851
00:58:09,465 --> 00:58:10,495
Duck meat.

1852
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:12,894
I should come here again next week.

1853
00:58:12,895 --> 00:58:13,995
(It made Joke Box speechless.)

1854
00:58:14,895 --> 00:58:17,434
(Taking a big bite with all his heart)

1855
00:58:17,435 --> 00:58:19,835
I love this combination.

1856
00:58:20,935 --> 00:58:22,304
Those chives are amazing.

1857
00:58:22,305 --> 00:58:24,505
(The combination of chives and duck is tasty and healthy.)

1858
00:58:25,945 --> 00:58:27,814
(Making a wrap)

1859
00:58:27,815 --> 00:58:28,815
You know this, right?

1860
00:58:28,816 --> 00:58:30,285
You have to eat a lot of this.

1861
00:58:30,515 --> 00:58:31,914
Yes, eat a lot at once.

1862
00:58:31,915 --> 00:58:33,184
This is so good.

1863
00:58:33,185 --> 00:58:35,154
- You have to put a lot of meat.
- Right.

1864
00:58:35,155 --> 00:58:36,324
This is hard.

1865
00:58:36,325 --> 00:58:37,484
(A bit of chives)

1866
00:58:37,485 --> 00:58:39,494
- The duck meat is...
- Goodness.

1867
00:58:39,495 --> 00:58:41,425
(Taking a bite)

1868
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:45,634
(Everyone is impressed.)

1869
00:58:45,635 --> 00:58:49,564
(Feeling upset)

1870
00:58:49,565 --> 00:58:51,675
I'm having a serious headache. What do I do?

1871
00:58:51,835 --> 00:58:53,634
- What did you say?
- Head what?

1872
00:58:53,635 --> 00:58:54,735
I have a headache.

1873
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:58,674
- This is top-class duck meat.
- Right.

1874
00:58:58,675 --> 00:58:59,675
It's so good.

1875
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:01,345
Aren't you going home, DinDin?

1876
00:59:01,845 --> 00:59:02,944
- Sorry?
- Aren't you going home?

1877
00:59:02,945 --> 00:59:04,144
I'm one of you!

1878
00:59:04,145 --> 00:59:06,714
You can eat it next to us after you get off work.

1879
00:59:06,715 --> 00:59:07,914
You can give your seat to us.

1880
00:59:07,915 --> 00:59:09,354
Right, you pay for your meal.

1881
00:59:09,355 --> 00:59:11,055
- You can eat next to us.
- Can I do that?

1882
00:59:11,455 --> 00:59:12,495
- Right.
- I see.

1883
00:59:12,825 --> 00:59:14,254
- Who are you talking to?
- They said I can't do that.

1884
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:15,994
- He can't do that.
- We're looking at the same person.

1885
00:59:15,995 --> 00:59:18,495
- He said I can't.
- You can't?

1886
00:59:18,865 --> 00:59:21,034
Why did you set this up for us? It's just burning.

1887
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:22,104
It's too hot.

1888
00:59:22,105 --> 00:59:24,105
- My body is burning!
- My knees are hot.

1889
00:59:24,835 --> 00:59:26,135
- You are hungry, right?
- Yes.

1890
00:59:26,505 --> 00:59:29,405
You should at least taste it.

1891
00:59:30,105 --> 00:59:32,244
- I'll let you taste the duck meat.
- Really?

1892
00:59:32,245 --> 00:59:33,275
- Yes.
- What's going on?

1893
00:59:33,475 --> 00:59:36,185
(Here comes the dinner table for the losers.)

1894
00:59:36,585 --> 00:59:37,684
These are the duck eggs.

1895
00:59:37,685 --> 00:59:40,014
- You can fry them?
- We can fry these eggs?

1896
00:59:40,015 --> 00:59:42,985
- I've never had them before.
- It's so rare to eat those.

1897
00:59:43,155 --> 00:59:44,284
- Really?
- Yes.

1898
00:59:44,285 --> 00:59:46,025
It's not easy to find those eggs.

1899
00:59:46,695 --> 00:59:48,694
- Goodness.
- It's huge!

1900
00:59:48,695 --> 00:59:50,394
- The egg is huge.
- Duck eggs are delicious.

1901
00:59:50,395 --> 00:59:51,424
It's huge!

1902
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:53,394
We can add a lot of salt because we sweated a lot.

1903
00:59:53,395 --> 00:59:54,994
- Right.
- And this is...

1904
00:59:54,995 --> 00:59:56,934
more nutritious than chicken eggs.

1905
00:59:56,935 --> 00:59:57,935
(Appetizing fried duck eggs)

1906
00:59:58,435 --> 01:00:01,635
(Jong Min is tasting it first.)

1907
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:03,045
(Impressed)

1908
01:00:03,045 --> 01:00:04,045
(Speechless)

1909
01:00:06,175 --> 01:00:07,175
Protein...

1910
01:00:07,975 --> 01:00:08,984
Gosh, it's hot.

1911
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:12,285
(The other two are having a bite.)

1912
01:00:12,615 --> 01:00:14,755
How is it compared to chicken eggs?

1913
01:00:15,555 --> 01:00:17,184
It's what we usually have.

1914
01:00:17,185 --> 01:00:18,254
(It tastes like chicken eggs.)

1915
01:00:18,255 --> 01:00:20,824
I think I had a big meal. May I use the bathroom?

1916
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:21,825
Sure.

1917
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,624
Why would you leave it when you're going to the bathroom?

1918
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:27,364
I'm going to use the bathroom in Hannam-dong.

1919
01:00:27,365 --> 01:00:28,435
(I'm going to use my bathroom at home.)

1920
01:00:29,635 --> 01:00:30,635
DinDin, are you done?

1921
01:00:30,635 --> 01:00:31,635
(Are you going home?)

1922
01:00:31,636 --> 01:00:34,235
How about one of us sits there and eats?

1923
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:35,675
That's a great idea.

1924
01:00:35,805 --> 01:00:36,975
- Sure.
- That sounds nice.

1925
01:00:37,245 --> 01:00:39,474
Let's play rock-paper-scissors. If you and I play the same one,

1926
01:00:39,475 --> 01:00:41,074
- you can sit here.
- Okay.

1927
01:00:41,075 --> 01:00:42,444
You have to play the same one as DinDin's.

1928
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:43,784
(Thinking like DinDin)

1929
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:44,915
What will you play?

1930
01:00:46,255 --> 01:00:47,315
It will be a mind game.

1931
01:00:47,415 --> 01:00:48,754
I'll play a rock like a man.

1932
01:00:48,755 --> 01:00:50,225
A rock? You sure?

1933
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,425
I trust you.

1934
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:52,625
I'll stay like this.

1935
01:00:52,626 --> 01:00:54,395
(Trust me.)

1936
01:00:54,595 --> 01:00:57,824
This is all about psychology. Do you think I believe you?

1937
01:00:57,825 --> 01:00:58,865
(Getting suspicious)

1938
01:00:59,165 --> 01:01:01,064
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1939
01:01:01,065 --> 01:01:03,535
(Breaking his promise and playing paper)

1940
01:01:04,197 --> 01:01:06,327
(What will these three play?)

1941
01:01:06,344 --> 01:01:08,083
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1942
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:10,614
(Breaking his promise and playing paper)

1943
01:01:11,324 --> 01:01:13,954
(What will these three play?)

1944
01:01:14,354 --> 01:01:15,693
- Goodness.
- Yes!

1945
01:01:15,694 --> 01:01:16,694
(Rock, Paper, Rock)

1946
01:01:16,695 --> 01:01:17,823
Do you think I believe you?

1947
01:01:17,824 --> 01:01:19,063
(Quick-witted)

1948
01:01:19,064 --> 01:01:21,494
(Today's lesson: Don't trust DinDin.)

1949
01:01:22,064 --> 01:01:23,563
Jong Min is so lucky.

1950
01:01:23,564 --> 01:01:24,564
(We're just not destined to eat.)

1951
01:01:24,565 --> 01:01:25,703
You think I believe you?

1952
01:01:25,704 --> 01:01:27,163
I left a lot of duck meat for you.

1953
01:01:27,164 --> 01:01:29,774
(I lied but left a lot of meat for you.)

1954
01:01:30,174 --> 01:01:31,443
Let me dip it.

1955
01:01:31,444 --> 01:01:33,073
(Dipping it in salt)

1956
01:01:33,074 --> 01:01:35,073
(Feeling the natural flavor)

1957
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:36,243
We're all full now.

1958
01:01:36,244 --> 01:01:40,784
(Making a big wrap of duck meat)

1959
01:01:42,314 --> 01:01:44,183
(Joon is going to burst into tears.)

1960
01:01:44,184 --> 01:01:45,184
This is so good.

1961
01:01:45,185 --> 01:01:47,224
- How can Jong Min get to eat?
- It's so good.

1962
01:01:49,894 --> 01:01:50,894
Please give me some chives.

1963
01:01:51,094 --> 01:01:53,124
- Hey, you can mix it.
- Please give me some chives.

1964
01:01:53,624 --> 01:01:56,093
(DinDin started to cook for Joon to comfort him.)

1965
01:01:56,094 --> 01:01:57,333
That looks delicious.

1966
01:01:57,334 --> 01:01:58,404
This is good.

1967
01:01:58,804 --> 01:02:00,463
I'll mix it with rice.

1968
01:02:00,464 --> 01:02:02,234
Oh, come here. You guys are making a nice meal.

1969
01:02:03,404 --> 01:02:05,644
- Please add some duck meat.
- You can mix it with your rice.

1970
01:02:06,544 --> 01:02:07,544
There you go.

1971
01:02:07,545 --> 01:02:09,413
(Chopped duck meat)

1972
01:02:09,414 --> 01:02:10,414
This fat is...

1973
01:02:10,415 --> 01:02:12,014
This fat is really good for your body.

1974
01:02:12,714 --> 01:02:14,183
Can you add a spoon of doenjang stew?

1975
01:02:14,184 --> 01:02:15,484
(Adding doenjang stew to make it more savory)

1976
01:02:16,684 --> 01:02:21,253
(Pressing with the spoon to fry the rice)

1977
01:02:21,254 --> 01:02:23,694
DinDin has become a good boy right before going home.

1978
01:02:24,724 --> 01:02:26,993
He's so sweet now.

1979
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:29,494
It's the 1st time I've seen him cook in 4 years.

1980
01:02:29,794 --> 01:02:31,134
The color is beautiful.

1981
01:02:31,734 --> 01:02:32,933
- It looks good.
- It's well-coated.

1982
01:02:32,934 --> 01:02:33,964
Coat it.

1983
01:02:34,204 --> 01:02:35,674
That looks delicious.

1984
01:02:36,274 --> 01:02:37,733
I can tell that it is delicious from the looks.

1985
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:38,873
You want to have that as well?

1986
01:02:38,874 --> 01:02:40,504
(Of course.)

1987
01:02:40,744 --> 01:02:41,913
You should have it while it's hot.

1988
01:02:41,914 --> 01:02:43,744
(Moving his seat right away)

1989
01:02:44,214 --> 01:02:45,284
What? Where are you going?

1990
01:02:46,684 --> 01:02:50,884
(Jong Min is very hungry because he lost all the meal games.)

1991
01:02:51,284 --> 01:02:53,123
Gosh, it's hot. This is tasty.

1992
01:02:53,124 --> 01:02:54,483
Is it good? Let me taste it.

1993
01:02:54,484 --> 01:02:55,494
It's hot.

1994
01:02:56,154 --> 01:02:58,164
- It's very light.
- Goodness.

1995
01:02:58,594 --> 01:02:59,664
It's like Chinese fried rice.

1996
01:03:00,494 --> 01:03:02,034
- Thank you for the meal.
- Let's get going.

1997
01:03:02,294 --> 01:03:05,633
We will be going to our final destination,

1998
01:03:05,634 --> 01:03:07,734
KBS, Yeouido, Seoul.

1999
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,474
DinDin can go home now.

2000
01:03:12,474 --> 01:03:14,403
(Happy DinDin)

2001
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:16,673
You can say bye to them and the staff.

2002
01:03:16,674 --> 01:03:18,744
- Good work.
- Goodbye.

2003
01:03:19,084 --> 01:03:20,113
(After a sweet dinner)

2004
01:03:20,114 --> 01:03:21,184
Bye.

2005
01:03:21,314 --> 01:03:23,183
Check us out on TV.

2006
01:03:23,184 --> 01:03:24,184
Bye.

2007
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:26,423
- Bye.
- See you.

2008
01:03:26,424 --> 01:03:27,424
- Good night.
- Bye.

2009
01:03:27,425 --> 01:03:29,693
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

2010
01:03:29,694 --> 01:03:30,793
I'll be going home first.

2011
01:03:30,794 --> 01:03:32,163
(DinDin going home)

2012
01:03:32,164 --> 01:03:33,194
Let's go!

2013
01:03:34,024 --> 01:03:35,294
I'll be going home first.

2014
01:03:36,994 --> 01:03:39,703
(He can't stop smiling.)

2015
01:03:39,704 --> 01:03:41,704
You look so happy.

2016
01:03:42,274 --> 01:03:43,274
Thank you.

2017
01:03:43,275 --> 01:03:44,374
(He feels grateful for everything.)

2018
01:03:45,204 --> 01:03:48,944
(DinDin getting off work at 9:55pm on the same day)

2019
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:53,584
(Gosh, I'm so jealous.)

2020
01:03:54,514 --> 01:03:56,083
I just feel so down.

2021
01:03:56,084 --> 01:03:57,784
(I feel so down without DinDin.)

2022
01:03:58,724 --> 01:03:59,954
Did you tell your wife?

2023
01:04:00,684 --> 01:04:02,094
I told her about the episode. But I don't think I'm going home.

2024
01:04:03,624 --> 01:04:06,894
- Sae Ho, did you tell your wife?
- My wife just texted me.

2025
01:04:07,494 --> 01:04:08,934
This is our dog.

2026
01:04:09,094 --> 01:04:10,994
"Sae Ho, are you coming home tonight?"

2027
01:04:11,664 --> 01:04:13,033
My dog texted me.

2028
01:04:13,034 --> 01:04:14,973
(I miss her.)

2029
01:04:14,974 --> 01:04:18,104
So your marriage is between you and your dog.

2030
01:04:18,644 --> 01:04:19,804
My dog, I mean...

2031
01:04:20,044 --> 01:04:22,373
(That can't be true.)

2032
01:04:22,374 --> 01:04:24,514
- It's his dog wife.
- "Dog wife."

2033
01:04:25,944 --> 01:04:27,643
If I could go home tonight,

2034
01:04:27,644 --> 01:04:29,153
I should work out.

2035
01:04:29,154 --> 01:04:30,583
(On their way to KBS)

2036
01:04:30,584 --> 01:04:33,223
We're headed to Yeouido KBS.

2037
01:04:33,224 --> 01:04:36,323
- Right.
- Joon is...

2038
01:04:36,324 --> 01:04:37,923
- Five spaces.
- left with five spaces.

2039
01:04:37,924 --> 01:04:39,624
Sae Ho is left with six spaces.

2040
01:04:40,194 --> 01:04:42,634
Se Yoon and Jong Min are left with seven spaces.

2041
01:04:43,164 --> 01:04:45,663
And Seon Ho is left with ten spaces.

2042
01:04:45,664 --> 01:04:46,664
(Progress update)

2043
01:04:47,204 --> 01:04:48,204
(Feeling stunned)

2044
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:50,334
This is all about luck.

2045
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:52,203
We should try not to go home. Then it works.

2046
01:04:52,204 --> 01:04:53,374
That's what I was doing.

2047
01:04:54,104 --> 01:04:56,073
I started to score well when I didn't believe in myself.

2048
01:04:56,074 --> 01:04:57,313
Now you should work harder.

2049
01:04:57,314 --> 01:04:59,484
I tried my best at the sauna.

2050
01:05:00,614 --> 01:05:02,253
- No wonder.
- Right.

2051
01:05:02,254 --> 01:05:03,383
You were so close at the sauna.

2052
01:05:03,384 --> 01:05:05,083
I have to think like I'm not going home.

2053
01:05:05,084 --> 01:05:06,454
(He does better when his expectations are low.)

2054
01:05:06,724 --> 01:05:08,824
You can enjoy the awful night for a long time.

2055
01:05:09,854 --> 01:05:11,323
What kind of night is waiting for us?

2056
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,224
I think I'm the one who will be left behind.

2057
01:05:14,264 --> 01:05:15,934
- What you say comes true.
- I wish that happens.

2058
01:05:16,494 --> 01:05:17,494
All right.

2059
01:05:17,495 --> 01:05:18,504
(Hoping they will go home, )

2060
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:23,934
(They arrive at KBS where they will spend an awful night.)

2061
01:05:25,944 --> 01:05:26,944
We are here.

2062
01:05:28,204 --> 01:05:29,244
Finally...

2063
01:05:29,544 --> 01:05:31,343
- We're in Yeouido?
- We're at the final destination.

2064
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,484
We're in Yeouido.

2065
01:05:32,844 --> 01:05:33,883
(DinDin is off work.)

2066
01:05:33,884 --> 01:05:37,313
(Who's going home today?)

2067
01:05:37,314 --> 01:05:41,954
(The final game will happen at KBS.)

2068
01:05:42,594 --> 01:05:45,624
(Somebody is going home on this fun Friday.)

2069
01:05:45,664 --> 01:05:47,493
Let's go!

2070
01:05:47,494 --> 01:05:49,594
(The last gate toward going home is now opening.)

2071
01:05:49,634 --> 01:05:50,934
(Eyes blazing)

2072
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:55,373
(Soon after, Se Yoon also makes a determined exit.)

2073
01:05:55,374 --> 01:05:56,433
Let's go.

2074
01:05:56,434 --> 01:05:57,974
- Where do we go?
- There.

2075
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:00,144
- Where do we go?
- Where do we go?

2076
01:06:00,204 --> 01:06:01,543
- Where do we go?
- Where do we go?

2077
01:06:01,544 --> 01:06:03,474
(They even start running in the middle of the night.)

2078
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:05,783
Why are we running, though?

2079
01:06:05,784 --> 01:06:07,013
(But why are they running?)

2080
01:06:07,014 --> 01:06:08,044
Do we have to run?

2081
01:06:08,684 --> 01:06:10,013
(They're just trying something.)

2082
01:06:10,014 --> 01:06:11,384
A desperate heart for anything.

2083
01:06:12,584 --> 01:06:14,184
- What is this?
- What is it?

2084
01:06:16,354 --> 01:06:17,954
It was made in real life.

2085
01:06:19,064 --> 01:06:21,994
(Today's game board was made in real life like he said.)

2086
01:06:22,134 --> 01:06:24,233
(The game board they carried around the whole day...)

2087
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:25,864
What is this?

2088
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:29,504
(He's determined.)

2089
01:06:29,804 --> 01:06:31,404
It's already an awful night.

2090
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:32,974
Let's put down our bags.

2091
01:06:33,404 --> 01:06:34,603
I need to put it down.

2092
01:06:34,604 --> 01:06:35,644
(The final mission seems serious.)

2093
01:06:35,844 --> 01:06:36,874
Se Yoon?

2094
01:06:37,274 --> 01:06:38,884
- He's walking this way.
- Okay.

2095
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:41,754
They can't do anything without me anyway.

2096
01:06:42,884 --> 01:06:45,053
It's already past 11pm somehow.

2097
01:06:45,054 --> 01:06:46,224
Everyone.

2098
01:06:46,924 --> 01:06:49,223
Finally, we arrived at the final destination...

2099
01:06:49,224 --> 01:06:51,994
of Going Home Today Special, Home Sweet Home,

2100
01:06:52,224 --> 01:06:54,164
the Yeouido KBS.

2101
01:06:55,034 --> 01:06:56,664
I can get home in 25 minutes.

2102
01:06:57,564 --> 01:06:59,063
It takes eight minutes for me.

2103
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:01,133
You all worked hard to go home today the whole day.

2104
01:07:01,134 --> 01:07:02,303
How do you feel now?

2105
01:07:02,304 --> 01:07:03,404
Not that great.

2106
01:07:03,904 --> 01:07:05,503
I think the day was longer today.

2107
01:07:05,504 --> 01:07:06,974
- It was long.
- I got heatstroke.

2108
01:07:07,474 --> 01:07:08,543
I sweated too much.

2109
01:07:08,544 --> 01:07:09,913
He kept saying it was hot.

2110
01:07:09,914 --> 01:07:11,943
- It's hot. I kept sweating.
- Let me explain.

2111
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:14,513
- Is it something even I can do?
- Yes.

2112
01:07:14,514 --> 01:07:16,183
- Okay.
- It's doable for everyone.

2113
01:07:16,184 --> 01:07:17,184
Let's go.

2114
01:07:17,754 --> 01:07:19,124
In this mission,

2115
01:07:19,454 --> 01:07:21,353
you will use the die of destiny...

2116
01:07:21,354 --> 01:07:23,693
and play the game yourselves by becoming the token.

2117
01:07:23,694 --> 01:07:24,823
We'll be the pieces.

2118
01:07:24,824 --> 01:07:27,024
You will take turns to roll the die.

2119
01:07:27,164 --> 01:07:29,934
The person who gets to the finish point first...

2120
01:07:30,334 --> 01:07:31,903
(Start, Finish)

2121
01:07:31,904 --> 01:07:33,363
will go home today.

2122
01:07:33,364 --> 01:07:34,564
How many of us?

2123
01:07:34,764 --> 01:07:36,804
First take the die.

2124
01:07:36,904 --> 01:07:38,133
What is this?

2125
01:07:38,134 --> 01:07:39,203
The die...

2126
01:07:39,204 --> 01:07:41,003
(They check the die quite dramatically.)

2127
01:07:41,004 --> 01:07:43,014
- Right. Do something at least.
- Let's check.

2128
01:07:43,414 --> 01:07:44,774
It has our faces on it.

2129
01:07:45,014 --> 01:07:47,584
On the five faces of the die,

2130
01:07:47,844 --> 01:07:50,313
there are stickers of each of your faces.

2131
01:07:50,314 --> 01:07:51,653
- Yes.
- There's "reverse" as well!"

2132
01:07:51,654 --> 01:07:52,954
- There's "reverse." - I see.

2133
01:07:52,984 --> 01:07:55,153
On one side, there is the reverse sticker.

2134
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,154
- Yes.
- "Stalker?"

2135
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,193
It's important from now on.

2136
01:07:58,194 --> 01:07:59,623
(The following explanation is important.)

2137
01:07:59,624 --> 01:08:01,024
DinDin is calling me.

2138
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:02,763
- Decline it.
- Don't answer it.

2139
01:08:02,764 --> 01:08:03,764
Don't answer it.

2140
01:08:04,634 --> 01:08:06,003
- What shall we do?
- He doesn't know...

2141
01:08:06,004 --> 01:08:07,434
(Connecting the call with DinDin)

2142
01:08:09,104 --> 01:08:10,973
What is all this because of Lim Cheol?

2143
01:08:10,974 --> 01:08:12,903
- The energy was up.
- We were in the flow.

2144
01:08:12,904 --> 01:08:15,344
It was flowing, and the energy just dropped.

2145
01:08:15,574 --> 01:08:18,374
- He doesn't help at all.
- It's a call.

2146
01:08:19,884 --> 01:08:21,014
Did you get home well?

2147
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,513
Yes. I'm back well. How did it go?

2148
01:08:24,514 --> 01:08:27,683
We've come to the place of destiny now.

2149
01:08:27,684 --> 01:08:28,723
Can you see this?

2150
01:08:28,724 --> 01:08:30,354
Do you want to come? Do you want to play with us?

2151
01:08:30,954 --> 01:08:32,124
You can get here soon.

2152
01:08:32,724 --> 01:08:34,024
He really looks annoying.

2153
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:36,364
Then...

2154
01:08:37,194 --> 01:08:39,363
Could you keep this phone on...

2155
01:08:39,364 --> 01:08:41,804
- so I can watch it?
- No.

2156
01:08:41,874 --> 01:08:43,304
- That...
- That's the worst.

2157
01:08:43,434 --> 01:08:44,874
That costs money.

2158
01:08:44,974 --> 01:08:46,804
- Okay.
- All right.

2159
01:08:46,844 --> 01:08:48,303
Is he the VIP or what?

2160
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:50,874
- But...
- Just leave it there and go.

2161
01:08:51,244 --> 01:08:53,114
What's that?

2162
01:08:53,344 --> 01:08:54,914
The battery will run out.

2163
01:08:55,384 --> 01:08:56,783
What is this?

2164
01:08:56,784 --> 01:08:59,484
Is he the VIP in "Squid Game?"

2165
01:09:00,254 --> 01:09:02,123
- Let's quickly go on.
- I'll go on.

2166
01:09:02,124 --> 01:09:03,653
- Let him watch.
- Do you have to do this?

2167
01:09:03,654 --> 01:09:04,654
It's humiliating.

2168
01:09:04,655 --> 01:09:06,563
Let's go!

2169
01:09:06,564 --> 01:09:08,163
Okay.

2170
01:09:08,164 --> 01:09:10,193
There are five sides with stickers of your faces...

2171
01:09:10,194 --> 01:09:11,233
and one reverse side.

2172
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:13,403
You will take turns...

2173
01:09:13,404 --> 01:09:15,434
- to roll the die.
- Yes.

2174
01:09:15,534 --> 01:09:17,033
When the face sticker faces up,

2175
01:09:17,034 --> 01:09:19,743
that member will move three spaces.

2176
01:09:19,744 --> 01:09:21,073
- Gosh.
- What?

2177
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,613
This is fun.

2178
01:09:22,614 --> 01:09:25,043
- Be quiet.
- If the reverse sticker...

2179
01:09:25,044 --> 01:09:27,183
- We're serious.
- faces up...

2180
01:09:27,184 --> 01:09:30,014
If the reverse sticker faces up,

2181
01:09:30,614 --> 01:09:32,224
- you will go back 1 space.
- Go back 1 space.

2182
01:09:32,524 --> 01:09:35,083
If your face shows up, you'll move.

2183
01:09:35,084 --> 01:09:36,123
Okay.

2184
01:09:36,124 --> 01:09:38,563
- It will end quickly here.
- It will end quickly.

2185
01:09:38,564 --> 01:09:40,223
- This is so fun.
- You go three spaces...

2186
01:09:40,224 --> 01:09:41,834
- or you go back one space.
- Okay.

2187
01:09:42,034 --> 01:09:44,463
But what's more important now is, how many of us...

2188
01:09:44,464 --> 01:09:46,863
Do we keep...

2189
01:09:46,864 --> 01:09:49,304
How many will leave? One?

2190
01:09:49,804 --> 01:09:51,303
(DinDin is curious.)

2191
01:09:51,304 --> 01:09:52,544
I can't stop sweating.

2192
01:09:53,004 --> 01:09:54,404
Two members will go home.

2193
01:09:54,544 --> 01:09:55,973
He said two. Hang up now.

2194
01:09:55,974 --> 01:09:56,974
Two members with this game?

2195
01:09:56,975 --> 01:09:59,384
He's really annoying. What is he doing?

2196
01:10:00,214 --> 01:10:01,343
- I'll go first.
- Okay!

2197
01:10:01,344 --> 01:10:02,613
This is really about luck.

2198
01:10:02,614 --> 01:10:04,584
- Hold on.
- It's so fun!

2199
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,954
- Goodness.
- Can we hang up? It's noisy.

2200
01:10:07,454 --> 01:10:10,193
Be quiet. This is an important moment.

2201
01:10:10,194 --> 01:10:12,564
This is really about luck.

2202
01:10:12,694 --> 01:10:14,023
Two members. Please.

2203
01:10:14,024 --> 01:10:15,434
Go to your places.

2204
01:10:15,694 --> 01:10:17,033
Let's go.

2205
01:10:17,034 --> 01:10:18,733
- I'll start.
- I want to take a shower.

2206
01:10:18,734 --> 01:10:20,664
I'll start.

2207
01:10:21,064 --> 01:10:23,903
- Start.
- I'll throw. One, two, three!

2208
01:10:23,904 --> 01:10:25,104
He threw it. It's crazy.

2209
01:10:26,144 --> 01:10:27,844
- Three.
- He threw it. It's crazy.

2210
01:10:28,074 --> 01:10:29,074
Let's go!

2211
01:10:29,414 --> 01:10:30,544
It went out.

2212
01:10:31,574 --> 01:10:32,714
It went out.

2213
01:10:33,684 --> 01:10:36,353
(They're desperate.)

2214
01:10:36,354 --> 01:10:38,824
(DinDin is also very nervous.)

2215
01:10:43,124 --> 01:10:46,124
(Will it be Sae Ho's face?)

2216
01:10:47,524 --> 01:10:50,894
(Will it roll over to Jong Min's face?)

2217
01:10:51,464 --> 01:10:52,903
What is it? Who is it?

2218
01:10:52,904 --> 01:10:54,434
- Jong Min.
- It's me.

2219
01:10:55,404 --> 01:10:57,103
- Jong Min.
- Move three spaces forward.

2220
01:10:57,104 --> 01:10:58,204
Move three spaces forward.

2221
01:10:58,574 --> 01:11:00,173
This is amazing.

2222
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:02,373
- I took the lead!
- This is driving me crazy.

2223
01:11:02,374 --> 01:11:03,743
This is fun.

2224
01:11:03,744 --> 01:11:05,114
- I'll throw.
- Okay.

2225
01:11:08,654 --> 01:11:10,953
- It's me!
- This is totally about luck.

2226
01:11:10,954 --> 01:11:13,554
(This isn't a deja vu of the earlier moment.)

2227
01:11:14,184 --> 01:11:16,393
- It's me!
- This is totally about luck.

2228
01:11:16,394 --> 01:11:20,193
(The die annoyingly bounces well.)

2229
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:22,293
(Joon?)

2230
01:11:22,294 --> 01:11:25,834
(Will it be Sae Ho this time?)

2231
01:11:26,804 --> 01:11:28,464
What's that?

2232
01:11:28,804 --> 01:11:32,144
(Se Yoon's face shows up on the second throw.)

2233
01:11:32,474 --> 01:11:34,573
(Miserable)

2234
01:11:34,574 --> 01:11:36,344
This is a speedy game.

2235
01:11:36,674 --> 01:11:37,914
- This is so fun.
- Okay.

2236
01:11:38,444 --> 01:11:40,183
- Please.
- This is about luck.

2237
01:11:40,184 --> 01:11:41,184
This is about luck.

2238
01:11:41,185 --> 01:11:42,983
Our faces should face up two more times.

2239
01:11:42,984 --> 01:11:44,083
- I'll throw.
- Okay.

2240
01:11:44,084 --> 01:11:45,213
Go on.

2241
01:11:45,214 --> 01:11:47,754
(The third die is thrown.)

2242
01:11:50,354 --> 01:11:51,723
- Yoo Seon Ho.
- Yoo Seon Ho.

2243
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,293
- It got thrown well.
- Okay.

2244
01:11:53,294 --> 01:11:55,294
- I'm next.
- I'm nervous.

2245
01:11:55,764 --> 01:11:57,293
- It will face up.
- Why isn't mine facing up?

2246
01:11:57,294 --> 01:11:59,463
(Only their faces weren't shown yet.)

2247
01:11:59,464 --> 01:12:01,403
(They're all nearby.)

2248
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:02,733
I'll throw. Going home.

2249
01:12:02,734 --> 01:12:04,973
Honey! Kids!

2250
01:12:04,974 --> 01:12:06,944
Let me go home too. Please!

2251
01:12:07,274 --> 01:12:09,844
It's me. Please.

2252
01:12:11,074 --> 01:12:12,383
(Se Yoon's face shows up the second time.)

2253
01:12:12,384 --> 01:12:13,683
It's me.

2254
01:12:13,684 --> 01:12:15,143
- What?
- One, two, three.

2255
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:17,183
(He's right in front of the finish line.)

2256
01:12:17,184 --> 01:12:19,183
- Moon Se Yoon?
- What's going on, Se Yoon?

2257
01:12:19,184 --> 01:12:20,883
- Let's go.
- Please.

2258
01:12:20,884 --> 01:12:21,953
It's me!

2259
01:12:21,954 --> 01:12:24,023
How many spaces are you left with, Se Yoon?

2260
01:12:24,024 --> 01:12:25,964
Please! I have one space left.

2261
01:12:26,024 --> 01:12:28,063
- Please let me go home.
- This is amazing.

2262
01:12:28,064 --> 01:12:29,463
Let's go.

2263
01:12:29,464 --> 01:12:30,793
- I have to go home.
- Let's go.

2264
01:12:30,794 --> 01:12:33,104
Let's keep going. Hurry up.

2265
01:12:33,364 --> 01:12:34,404
Throw it.

2266
01:12:35,164 --> 01:12:36,234
Okay!

2267
01:12:38,574 --> 01:12:40,043
Please.

2268
01:12:40,044 --> 01:12:41,343
(It's Joon!)

2269
01:12:41,344 --> 01:12:42,743
One, two, three.

2270
01:12:42,744 --> 01:12:43,843
(Joon moves forward for the first time.)

2271
01:12:43,844 --> 01:12:44,914
What?

2272
01:12:45,814 --> 01:12:46,884
What?

2273
01:12:48,084 --> 01:12:50,353
(Please allow us to go home.)

2274
01:12:50,354 --> 01:12:51,853
This is crazy.

2275
01:12:51,854 --> 01:12:54,084
- Please.
- Please. Just once.

2276
01:12:54,484 --> 01:12:56,254
Mine didn't show up even once.

2277
01:12:56,994 --> 01:12:58,153
Please!

2278
01:12:58,154 --> 01:13:00,023
(Current positions on the game board)

2279
01:13:00,024 --> 01:13:01,193
Please!

2280
01:13:01,194 --> 01:13:03,033
(Seon Ho is still last.)

2281
01:13:03,034 --> 01:13:04,263
Please!

2282
01:13:04,264 --> 01:13:06,733
(Jong Min is desperate too.)

2283
01:13:06,734 --> 01:13:08,664
If you leave, the cameramen can leave too.

2284
01:13:09,004 --> 01:13:10,533
Okay.

2285
01:13:10,534 --> 01:13:13,243
- Let's go!
- I'll take off my mic.

2286
01:13:13,244 --> 01:13:15,474
- Let's go!
- I'll take off my mic.

2287
01:13:16,674 --> 01:13:22,214
(Everyone's attention is on one thing.)

2288
01:13:24,554 --> 01:13:26,223
It's me!

2289
01:13:26,224 --> 01:13:28,224
(It's Jong Min.)

2290
01:13:28,524 --> 01:13:30,554
One, two. I'm here.

2291
01:13:30,954 --> 01:13:32,624
(Jong Min has one space left too.)

2292
01:13:33,064 --> 01:13:34,263
This is driving me crazy.

2293
01:13:34,264 --> 01:13:35,294
(He's not in his right mind.)

2294
01:13:35,664 --> 01:13:39,303
(Sae Ho has been the same since earlier.)

2295
01:13:39,304 --> 01:13:42,034
This makes you so nervous.

2296
01:13:42,174 --> 01:13:43,373
- Mine.
- Please.

2297
01:13:43,374 --> 01:13:45,103
- I'll go!
- Let's go home.

2298
01:13:45,104 --> 01:13:46,543
(The staff of the members are also desperate.)

2299
01:13:46,544 --> 01:13:48,674
Please. Let's hurry.

2300
01:13:49,514 --> 01:13:50,574
(Screaming)

2301
01:13:50,744 --> 01:13:54,484
(This is what happens when there's too much dopamine.)

2302
01:13:55,044 --> 01:13:56,954
One, two, three.

2303
01:13:57,354 --> 01:13:59,223
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

2304
01:13:59,224 --> 01:14:01,854
(The die was thrown.)

2305
01:14:02,154 --> 01:14:04,424
(Will anyone go home among the three?)

2306
01:14:07,224 --> 01:14:09,064
(Focusing)

2307
01:14:09,764 --> 01:14:11,334
Move aside. Who is it?

2308
01:14:12,634 --> 01:14:13,634
What is it?

2309
01:14:14,004 --> 01:14:15,904
(Se Yoon's side comes up the third time.)

2310
01:14:16,134 --> 01:14:20,573
(He gets to go home today!)

2311
01:14:20,574 --> 01:14:22,243
(He goes back to his family before midnight.)

2312
01:14:22,244 --> 01:14:24,444
Good!

2313
01:14:25,244 --> 01:14:26,643
- Sae Ho.
- Goodness.

2314
01:14:26,644 --> 01:14:27,843
This makes no sense. I was last.

2315
01:14:27,844 --> 01:14:30,054
Moon Se Yoon...

2316
01:14:30,484 --> 01:14:31,653
- goes home!
- Goes home!

2317
01:14:31,654 --> 01:14:33,983
(Go home quickly.)

2318
01:14:33,984 --> 01:14:35,494
I need my face to show up at least once.

2319
01:14:36,124 --> 01:14:38,093
- Guys.
- Everyone, listen.

2320
01:14:38,094 --> 01:14:40,723
- Hold on.
- Se Yoon is off now.

2321
01:14:40,724 --> 01:14:41,864
It's right that I leave.

2322
01:14:42,264 --> 01:14:44,363
Place the sticker with a three on Se Yoon's face.

2323
01:14:44,364 --> 01:14:45,433
We can't get Se Yoon's face.

2324
01:14:45,434 --> 01:14:47,204
- If this comes up, we just move.
- That's right.

2325
01:14:47,604 --> 01:14:48,604
Please.

2326
01:14:48,834 --> 01:14:50,533
A miracle might really happen, Seon Ho.

2327
01:14:50,534 --> 01:14:51,704
- You just need it three times.
- Please!

2328
01:14:52,744 --> 01:14:53,774
Okay!

2329
01:14:53,974 --> 01:14:56,414
- Right.
- I have a higher chance.

2330
01:14:56,844 --> 01:14:58,343
- Right.
- Right?

2331
01:14:58,344 --> 01:14:59,683
He has a higher chance.

2332
01:14:59,684 --> 01:15:00,913
- The chances have increased.
- Right.

2333
01:15:00,914 --> 01:15:02,014
- Right?
- Yes.

2334
01:15:02,084 --> 01:15:03,353
If it's a three, I'll go home.

2335
01:15:03,354 --> 01:15:04,454
Three or my face.

2336
01:15:04,854 --> 01:15:05,854
The last one.

2337
01:15:05,924 --> 01:15:07,754
- I'll throw it.
- You'll throw it like that?

2338
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:09,254
I'll throw it.

2339
01:15:09,394 --> 01:15:11,053
One, two, three!

2340
01:15:11,054 --> 01:15:12,593
(There is only one remaining spot to go home today.)

2341
01:15:12,594 --> 01:15:13,963
It's about time mine showed up.

2342
01:15:13,964 --> 01:15:15,463
He might get his face.

2343
01:15:15,464 --> 01:15:16,534
(Will Jong Min be able to go home?)

2344
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:21,633
(Joon can't even look at it.)

2345
01:15:21,634 --> 01:15:23,733
(This might be the final throw today.)

2346
01:15:23,734 --> 01:15:25,904
(Many people's getting off work is at stake!)

2347
01:15:30,674 --> 01:15:32,614
Lee Joon!

2348
01:15:32,984 --> 01:15:35,714
(Lee Joon's face shows up.)

2349
01:15:36,584 --> 01:15:40,184
(He was chosen as the last person to go home!)

2350
01:15:41,184 --> 01:15:45,763
(Team Seon Ho, Team Sae Ho, Team Jong Min, Team Lee Joon)

2351
01:15:45,764 --> 01:15:48,724
(Team Se Yoon and Team Lee Joon, cross)

2352
01:15:51,064 --> 01:15:52,303
(I can't believe something like this can happen to me as well.)

2353
01:15:52,304 --> 01:15:53,304
He's crying.

2354
01:15:53,305 --> 01:15:55,003
(I can't believe something like this can happen to me as well.)

2355
01:15:55,004 --> 01:15:57,703
(The other three...)

2356
01:15:57,704 --> 01:15:59,874
(automatically have to spend the night.)

2357
01:16:00,374 --> 01:16:01,644
My side wasn't rolled even once.

2358
01:16:03,844 --> 01:16:05,614
(He went back to get his phone.)

2359
01:16:05,814 --> 01:16:06,884
I'll hang up.

2360
01:16:07,784 --> 01:16:09,114
Is it over?

2361
01:16:10,284 --> 01:16:12,923
(The call has ended.)

2362
01:16:12,924 --> 01:16:15,384
As the final result of the Going Home Special...

2363
01:16:15,894 --> 01:16:18,594
Congratulations to...

2364
01:16:18,894 --> 01:16:20,123
Moon Se Yoon and Lee Joon!

2365
01:16:20,124 --> 01:16:21,864
You may go home right away.

2366
01:16:23,094 --> 01:16:24,233
Thank you.

2367
01:16:24,234 --> 01:16:26,734
(They take off their mics first.)

2368
01:16:26,964 --> 01:16:29,903
(They fought not so long ago as the Defeat Fairies.)

2369
01:16:29,904 --> 01:16:32,874
Thank you. Thank you so much.

2370
01:16:33,604 --> 01:16:35,643
Can the 3 of us play 1 more time for 1 more winner?

2371
01:16:35,644 --> 01:16:37,274
All right. We will now...

2372
01:16:37,944 --> 01:16:40,044
head over to sleep.

2373
01:16:41,044 --> 01:16:42,353
Where will we go?

2374
01:16:42,354 --> 01:16:43,714
Will it be a nightmare?

2375
01:16:44,484 --> 01:16:46,723
- Well...
- Cho Sae Ho didn't appear once.

2376
01:16:46,724 --> 01:16:47,753
We will now...

2377
01:16:47,754 --> 01:16:50,194
- My wife...
- Yes?

2378
01:16:50,854 --> 01:16:53,664
Prepared a meal for me. What should I say?

2379
01:16:53,864 --> 01:16:56,163
- Tell her to clean up.
- Should I tell her that?

2380
01:16:56,164 --> 01:16:57,863
- Bye.
- Bye. I'll get going.

2381
01:16:57,864 --> 01:16:59,933
- Bye.
- I'll get going now.

2382
01:16:59,934 --> 01:17:01,304
I'll really get going with a comfortable heart.

2383
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,189
(Bitterness is left for the ones who are left behind.)

2384
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:05,959
This is so disappointing. I got so close.

2385
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,389
We're not going home in the middle of the night, are we?

2386
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,130
Do you know what his mother-in-law said?

2387
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:11,559
She said that she prepared a place for him to sleep.

2388
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,000
All he had to do was to come after being done with work.

2389
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,330
What can he say to his mother-in-law?

2390
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:17,899
- You should...
- Should I really call her?

2391
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,270
- Yes.
- You never know.

2392
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:21,739
- You should let her know.
- Will there be no chance to go?

2393
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:24,569
(You should call her quickly.)

2394
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:26,639
I felt the most nervous while filming 2 Days 1 Night.

2395
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,140
I went back one space for cold chicken noodle soup.

2396
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,349
Right. You still made it though.

2397
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:30,680
But it ended with two questions.

2398
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:32,180
Well,

2399
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,019
although we aren't able to go home,

2400
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:37,050
we let those two go before spending the night.

2401
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:38,650
So what?

2402
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,190
We sent them home before midnight as promised.

2403
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,930
I've never seen anyone with that kind of mindset before.

2404
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:45,630
Bye.

2405
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:47,629
Thank you, everyone.

2406
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,729
I'll make sure to work hard next time.

2407
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:51,070
I'll get going. Bye, Joon!

2408
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:55,339
(I'll go home first!)

2409
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:57,310
- Let's go.
- It's so hot, though.

2410
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,609
- It's so hot.
- What are you doing?

2411
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,539
- It's so hot.
- It is hot right now.

2412
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:02,749
It's so hot!

2413
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,150
You're wearing an undershirt.

2414
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,950
What will happen tomorrow?

2415
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,820
Well,

2416
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,989
you will know after spending an awful night.

2417
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:11,049
Awful night?

2418
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:12,360
You should really stop.

2419
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,190
I'm just so exhausted.

2420
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:18,960
You all went through so much today.

2421
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,560
Gosh, it's so hot.

2422
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:22,029
Let's go and get some sleep.

2423
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,070
(What will be left for them at KBS?)

2424
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,969
But where will we be sleeping?

2425
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,169
It feels like...

2426
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:29,010
In my opinion,

2427
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,340
it might be the Division Head's room.

2428
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,409
(That can't be true.)

2429
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,580
Or the president's room.

2430
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:37,079
How do we sleep in here?

2431
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,080
- How do we sleep in here?
- It was called a nightmare.

2432
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,590
What? Are we sleeping here?

2433
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:45,219
No way. This isn't a place to sleep.

2434
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,019
People walk around here.

2435
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,159
(Right in front of the entrance?)

2436
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,030
This is right in front of the entrance.

2437
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,300
You should stop now.

2438
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,500
No way. Stop messing around.

2439
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,499
Here's the last opportunity.

2440
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,500
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2441
01:18:58,970 --> 01:18:59,970
Okay.

2442
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,200
(The final round to decide one last person to go home)

2443
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:05,010
(There's one more chance left, Mother-in-law.)

2444
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:07,210
It must be there.

2445
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:10,080
The sleeping area that we prepared...

2446
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,680
can only take up to two people.

2447
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,849
This is the ultimate final round.

2448
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:19,089
Just one person will be able to go home.

2449
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:20,189
- Great.
- Go away.

2450
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,889
- I wish that it's based on luck.
- Go away.

2451
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:22,930
That would be great.

2452
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,129
- I'm the luckiest...
- Sae Ho,

2453
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:25,230
- go away.
- out of these three.

2454
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:26,500
All right, everyone.

2455
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:29,069
- Here, - What?

2456
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:30,900
- there are three passes.
- Right.

2457
01:19:31,530 --> 01:19:33,040
- Is just 1 real?
- Just 1 of them must be real.

2458
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,869
- No.
- Out of these three passes,

2459
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,640
- just one of them...
- It will let us leave?

2460
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:39,039
- will let you go outside.
- Right.

2461
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,109
- No! Don't touch them!
- I won't touch them.

2462
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,349
Don't touch them! Don't mess around!

2463
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,079
- Move away from them!
- Move away from them.

2464
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,119
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Do they look identical?

2465
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,149
They look identical.

2466
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:49,120
Why is only this one white?

2467
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,190
(They are passes that all look the same.)

2468
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,959
We don't even know which one is registered.

2469
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,689
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- So one of them is registered.

2470
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:58,229
They can be registered to be used.

2471
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:00,160
- How will you decide on the order?
- Rock-paper-scissors?

2472
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,899
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Right.

2473
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,099
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

2474
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,169
- Stop! Why are you calling it out?
- Okay.

2475
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,230
You should call it out.

2476
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:07,299
- You lost.
- No.

2477
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,639
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

2478
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,139
- Okay.
- What am I doing?

2479
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,509
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

2480
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:12,780
- Okay!
- You go first.

2481
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:15,139
- Gosh.
- Going first isn't that good.

2482
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:17,380
- Gosh.
- It's all luck. Don't touch it!

2483
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,650
It's over once you touch it.

2484
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:20,320
- This is driving me crazy.
- Are you done?

2485
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:22,719
(The moment he becomes very careful)

2486
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,219
We can't tell. It's a matter of which one is registered.

2487
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,660
This is all based on luck.

2488
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,819
This is based on luck. We don't know who will win.

2489
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:30,330
It's a game of luck.

2490
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:32,600
I have to use all of my knowledge.

2491
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:35,499
(He takes longer and longer to decide.)

2492
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,900
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2493
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,200
- Should I go first?
- No.

2494
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:42,770
- Go!
- In 3, 2, 1.

2495
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:45,070
Go!

2496
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:47,839
(Jong Min chooses the pass on the left.)

2497
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,180
- Go!
- This is driving me crazy.

2498
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:52,549
(The passes are chosen in a flash.)

2499
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:53,720
This is driving me crazy.

2500
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,320
- All right.
- This is driving me crazy.

2501
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:59,590
There is just one gate that will open.

2502
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:02,319
You may go home as soon as the gate opens.

2503
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,359
- Okay.
- Right.

2504
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,259
- All right.
- Hold on!

2505
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,399
(The time has come.)

2506
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,899
Would you like to switch?

2507
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,329
- Do you want to? Let's switch.
- I won't.

2508
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:10,730
- Let's switch passes.
- I won't switch.

2509
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:13,200
- What about you?
- Should I switch or not, Yong Han?

2510
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,699
Don't switch? I won't switch passes. I'll listen to Yong Han.

2511
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,109
(He follows the opinion of the one who shares the same fate as his.)

2512
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:19,080
Should I switch? No? Okay.

2513
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:21,609
- You should ask too.
- Should I switch?

2514
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:22,850
- Switch passes.
- Okay.

2515
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:24,450
But we won't switch passes.

2516
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,820
Is that so?

2517
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,080
You're sure about not switching, right? I won't.

2518
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:30,989
The three of you...

2519
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:32,349
(They carry on without making any switches.)

2520
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:34,860
will all try to use the pass to come out at the same time.

2521
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,390
- One, - Hold on!

2522
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,359
Two,

2523
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,629
(Who will take this chance...)

2524
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:40,630
three.

2525
01:21:40,631 --> 01:21:42,600
(and go to their family?)

2526
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:44,700
Three.

2527
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,040
(The last one to go home, Sae Ho)

2528
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,740
(His legs turn weak with the miraculous result.)

2529
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,080
(I'll be there, Mother-in-law!)

2530
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:58,150
(Silent scream)

2531
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,050
No wonder this looked white.

2532
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:02,650
(Different atmospheres in the same space)

2533
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:04,919
All right. Cho Sae Ho can go home!

2534
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,420
(Cho Sae Ho manages to go home without spending the night.)

2535
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:11,730
(Is this actually happening?)

2536
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:13,460
Are you that happy?

2537
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,029
(Why bother to ask?)

2538
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,100
Come back in.

2539
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:20,540
(He enjoys his victory.)

2540
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,410
It has to be done 30 seconds later.

2541
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:27,010
That means he can't leave.

2542
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:29,709
He can't leave.

2543
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:31,149
(We should all be together if I can't make it out.)

2544
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:33,320
- When can I go?
- Get him.

2545
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,280
Hold on!

2546
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:39,290
(Touched)

2547
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:44,029
(The thrill is felt one more time.)

2548
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:45,160
Dong Hoon!

2549
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,100
Let's go home!

2550
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,300
Let's go to our homes where our wives are waiting for us.

2551
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:52,400
- I can't believe I made it!
- Right.

2552
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,170
What did I say in the sauna?

2553
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,140
I sensed that it was going to be you and me.

2554
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,810
(It feels like it's going to me Jong Min and me.)

2555
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:00,979
(You should become a fortune teller, Seon Ho.)

2556
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:04,910
The two of you will really go to sleep.

2557
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:06,450
- Will we really go?
- Yes.

2558
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,420
Would you like to hit the slate?

2559
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,449
(You do it, Seon Ho.)

2560
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:14,060
- Do it before you go, Sae Ho.
- Right.

2561
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,990
- I'll hit the slate with joy.
- Right.

2562
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,430
Well done, everyone.

2563
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:20,330
One, two, three!

2564
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,470
Gosh, that sounded relieving.

2565
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:24,730
I'll get going.

2566
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:26,600
- Bye.
- Gosh.

2567
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:30,170
Bye. Congratulations. I'll admit my loss.

2568
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:34,579
Thank you so much, everyone. It's all thanks to your support.

2569
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:36,780
To be honest, I had already given up.

2570
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:38,610
With a heart of gratitude,

2571
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:40,679
I will make sure to work harder for 2 Days 1 Night.

2572
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,490
I didn't know that going home early felt this good.

2573
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:46,120
Well done, Dong Hoon.

2574
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,560
Congratulations.

2575
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:51,090
I will carefully take out the mic now.

2576
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,200
So this is what it feels like.

2577
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,529
Thank you.

2578
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,800
(Taking his mic off)

2579
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,030
All right, everyone.

2580
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:58,900
Thank you.

2581
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,340
I will get going now.

2582
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:03,570
2 Days 1 Night!

2583
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,010
Bye!

2584
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:12,050
(He won't stop talking until the moment he disappears.)

2585
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,380
We should move over now.

2586
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,249
No wonder it felt ominous.

2587
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:17,350
(It's time to go to bed.)

2588
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:19,859
Gosh, KBS.

2589
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:21,259
What is this place?

2590
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,030
- It has changed a lot.
- This is the editing room.

2591
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:26,029
- Our editing room?
- Is the editing done here for us?

2592
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:27,100
Will we be editing?

2593
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:29,630
What? We must be editing.

2594
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:31,400
This is your sleeping area.

2595
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,370
(Dumbfounded)

2596
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,910
- It's already hot.
- It's Ho Shin's room.

2597
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,370
Ho Shin? I see.

2598
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:39,939
Ho Shin is really neat.

2599
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:42,139
- It's really neat.
- There's normally nothing in here.

2600
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:44,849
- This must be my room.
- Jong Min!

2601
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:47,349
(The rooms are assigned with their pictures.)

2602
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:48,649
There's a separate room?

2603
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:51,220
This is Hyun Woo's room.

2604
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:52,859
- It's Producer Hyun Woo's room.
- I see.

2605
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:55,159
(Full of items)

2606
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,489
Good night, Seon Ho.

2607
01:24:56,490 --> 01:24:57,959
I'll see you tomorrow.

2608
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,360
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

2609
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:02,929
(They try to fall asleep like that, )

2610
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:06,440
(but the lights in the editing room don't turn off.)

2611
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,140
(On top of that, )

2612
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,440
(a music show is being edited in another room.)

2613
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:19,820
(The rooms aren't soundproof.)

2614
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:22,950
(The workers keep walking around all night.)

2615
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:26,660
(Tossing and turning)

2616
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:32,060
(Morning comes to this place.)

2617
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:36,770
(Jong Min managed to fall asleep.)

2618
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:39,199
(Seon Ho is fast asleep too.)

2619
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,240
(Knocking)

2620
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:45,510
(A mysterious item gets delivered to the room.)

2621
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:48,510
(Suspicious)

2622
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,980
(What is that?)

2623
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:53,450
(The mysterious thing is delivered to Jong Min's room as well.)

2624
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:57,320
(What was that?)

2625
01:25:57,890 --> 01:26:00,760
(Fried dumplings?)

2626
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,759
(Why fried dumplings in the morning?)

2627
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,830
What?

2628
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,429
(Seon Ho found the fried dumplings too.)

2629
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:09,569
(Reading the mission card)

2630
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:12,200
When the plates are retrieved after five minutes,

2631
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:14,369
if the total number of dumplings you two left...

2632
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:16,609
is three, you will get off work right away.

2633
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:17,710
(If you talk to each other, it is considered a failure.)

2634
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:20,840
(They got 6 fried dumplings each.)

2635
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,350
(There are 12 fried dumplings in total.)

2636
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:26,879
(If they have only 3 dumplings left in 5 minutes, they get off work.)

2637
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,920
(If they fail, the game will be restarted every 10 minutes.)

2638
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:33,860
(It's called Eternal Dumplings.)

2639
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,090
I know it's Jong Min,

2640
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:39,460
but would he want to eat dumplings after five hours of sleep?

2641
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,829
(He just eats well without even opening his eyes.)

2642
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:43,929
(Taking a bite)

2643
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:46,570
(All he ate yesterday was duck eggs, so he's hungry now.)

2644
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:47,840
It's delicious.

2645
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,810
Is the theme "Oldboy?"

2646
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:53,139
What if we never get to leave?

2647
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:55,109
(He should leave dumplings, expecting an optimistic future.)

2648
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:56,110
Now...

2649
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:57,779
How would I know that?

2650
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,150
(How many dumplings will Seon Ho leave?)

2651
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,479
(Bloated)

2652
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,920
I can't eat a lot in the morning.

2653
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:06,420
(He says he can't eat, but he's been eating 3.)

2654
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:08,959
Would Jong Min be able to eat dumplings?

2655
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,090
(Seon Ho is still in agony.)

2656
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:12,900
(It's frustrating that he can't talk to Jong Min.)

2657
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:16,099
I'd normally leave 1 dumpling, and Jong Min would leave 2.

2658
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:17,769
(He thinks Jong Min will probably leave 2 dumplings.)

2659
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:19,070
I should eat one anyway.

2660
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,540
It does look delicious.

2661
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,110
(He thinks while eating.)

2662
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:28,509
Jong Min probably doesn't eat at all.

2663
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:30,110
He could just move a few.

2664
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,749
Jong Min could leave three dumplings.

2665
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,880
(Thinking)

2666
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:37,450
This is driving me crazy. What do I do?

2667
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:42,289
(That's how they start eating fried dumplings 1 by 1,)

2668
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:47,100
(isolated in the small room.)

2669
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:49,199
(They look like they've been locked up for 15 years.)

2670
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,800
(Vacant)

2671
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:58,310
(While the others were crying and rejoicing at going home, )

2672
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,780
(they are still at KBS.)

2673
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:07,120
(They desperately want to go home now.)

2674
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:10,149
I think it's been almost five minutes.

2675
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:11,220
(The 5 minutes have passed.)

2676
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:14,519
(Will they be able to leave KBS this time?)

2677
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:17,290
Guys, please come to the hallway and check out the results.

2678
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:18,830
I believe in you, Jong Min.

2679
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:23,570
(Seon Ho left 1 dumpling.)

2680
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,669
(If Jong Min left 2 dumplings, they would go home right away.)

2681
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:28,139
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

2682
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:29,639
How many do you have?

2683
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,869
I can't eat.

2684
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:31,969
You can't eat, can you?

2685
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:33,209
- I know, right?
- I just got up.

2686
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:34,780
- How would I eat them?
- It's only 7:30am, right?

2687
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,109
It's 7:30am. How would I eat...

2688
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:38,380
as soon as I get up?

2689
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:40,420
- That's why I think...
- Yes?

2690
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:42,280
You left two dumplings.

2691
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:44,449
Is that right?

2692
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:45,749
(An unreadable expression)

2693
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:47,419
Right?

2694
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:48,459
(Tell me I'm right.)

2695
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:51,330
I bet you left two while saying, "I'm too full."

2696
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,199
I got goosebumps.

2697
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,899
- Really?
- I got goosebumps.

2698
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:57,200
- Did you leave one?
- Yes.

2699
01:28:57,670 --> 01:28:59,000
- Let me see.
- Look.

2700
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,469
(He checks 1 dumpling.)

2701
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:01,540
Really?

2702
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:03,869
Do you know what I said in the room?

2703
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:05,540
(He comes back to pick up his plate with a meaningful smile.)

2704
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:08,510
(Did he leave 2 dumplings as Seon Ho expected?)

2705
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:11,050
(Please let's go home, Jong Min.)

2706
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:16,420
(Jong Min left 2 dumplings!)

2707
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:17,819
I...

2708
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:19,150
This is amazing.

2709
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,260
Seon Ho eats well.

2710
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:24,789
He will leave 1, so I should leave 2.

2711
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:25,829
(He expected Seon Ho to leave 1 dumpling.)

2712
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:28,230
(That's why Jong Min left 2 dumplings.)

2713
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:30,000
This is crazy.

2714
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,670
We didn't discuss it.

2715
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,839
- This is crazy.
- I got goosebumps.

2716
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,900
You know what I said in the room?

2717
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,440
I said, "He'd leave two, saying he was too full."

2718
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:41,979
(Seon Ho correctly guessed that Jong Min would leave 2.)

2719
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:44,149
This is how much I care about you.

2720
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:46,150
My gosh. He's a genius.

2721
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:48,949
- How did we get it right away?
- I can't believe this.

2722
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:52,689
- This is unbelievable.
- Jong Min, we're amazing.

2723
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:54,760
Congratulations on your escape.

2724
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,329
This is crazy.

2725
01:29:57,330 --> 01:29:58,659
You may go home now.

2726
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,099
Let's go home, Jong Min.

2727
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,359
My gosh. This is really...

2728
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,500
I don't think you expected us to succeed right away.

2729
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:05,699
You didn't see this coming, did you?

2730
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,069
This isn't what we expected at all.

2731
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:09,599
This is not easy.

2732
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,340
What would have happened if we had failed?

2733
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:12,869
If you failed,

2734
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:15,410
you'd get more dumplings every ten minutes until you succeed.

2735
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:17,209
We had 80 fried dumplings ready.

2736
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:18,480
- My goodness.
- Really?

2737
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,080
Is this "Oldboy?"

2738
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:22,989
You may leave now.

2739
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:24,849
- This is amazing.
- It really is.

2740
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:26,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2741
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:28,220
I still can't believe this.

2742
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,989
Our teamwork worked.

2743
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:31,730
- We did a great job.
- Jong Min.

2744
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:32,860
Good job.

2745
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:34,830
You did well too.

2746
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:36,669
It was hard, right?

2747
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:38,270
- It was really difficult.
- I know.

2748
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,000
The odds were so slim.

2749
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,440
(Next episode)

2750
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:45,170
(Something catches the members' eyes.)

2751
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:52,850
(A feast of gourmet cuisine)

2752
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,320
(If you want a luxurious dinner)

2753
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:58,050
(Today's trip, It's War of Money)

2754
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:00,659
(Shaking)

2755
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:02,220
(Rough)

2756
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:06,500
(War of Money)

2757
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,470
(The fierce war of money continues.)

2758
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,600
(I want to stop.)

2759
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,540
(Teary)

2760
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:22,539
(Who will win the War of Money and take the gourmet meal?)

2761
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:26,850
(See you on Sunday night at 6:10pm.)
