1
00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:03,023
(Autumn has come in all its glory.)

2
00:00:03,123 --> 00:00:04,382
A season-core trip.

3
00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:06,753
(In This Autumn Moment)

4
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:10,963
(A trip full of autumnal romance...)

5
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:14,693
(is what they expected.)

6
00:00:15,763 --> 00:00:18,633
(A random chair game begins without warning.)

7
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:19,803
Cho Sae Ho.

8
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:22,673
(Cho Sae Ho is chosen.)

9
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:25,743
(He's chosen to go paragliding?)

10
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:31,213
(Sae Ho flies.)

11
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:32,312
Look at his legs.

12
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:36,923
(The members relax and watch, not knowing what the future holds.)

13
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:41,423
(They're given a hidden mission.)

14
00:00:42,423 --> 00:00:43,992
(Watch what you say...)

15
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:45,633
(or you get to join in the fun.)

16
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:48,063
(That looks like fun.)

17
00:00:48,393 --> 00:00:51,303
(You're to watch what you say!)

18
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:52,673
Lee Joon.

19
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:56,443
(Joon is the other chosen one.)

20
00:00:56,603 --> 00:00:57,803
What's going on?

21
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:00,073
What's happening?

22
00:01:00,313 --> 00:01:04,142
(2 Days 1 Night)

23
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:06,152
- He wanted to have a go all along.
- Yes.

24
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:09,053
But why... There must be a reason.

25
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:10,682
- "It looks like fun."
- Yes.

26
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:13,093
You said that, and so just for you,

27
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:14,922
we arranged one more ride.

28
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:17,662
(If it looks like fun, have a go.)

29
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:19,433
I told you to watch what you said!

30
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:23,562
Even now, it could be...

31
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:26,333
Are we still not allowed to say anything fun-related?

32
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:28,732
- We'd arranged for two rides.
- What's this?

33
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:30,772
How many more have to go?

34
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:31,902
- Right now...
- Who...

35
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:32,972
you're the last one.

36
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,043
- Okay.
- Okay.

37
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:35,613
- What?
- Get going.

38
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:37,612
- Why...
- Joon!

39
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:39,353
Didn't someone else say it looked like fun?

40
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:41,013
I'd never say that.

41
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:42,983
Leave your drink.

42
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:44,622
You did pretend to be brave and what not.

43
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:45,652
- Yes.
- You did.

44
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:48,553
I don't get... Do our wishes come true right away?

45
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:49,892
(Laughing)

46
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:50,922
This is unbelievable.

47
00:01:50,923 --> 00:01:52,462
It's the first time I get what I want.

48
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:53,992
- It's not that.
- Your wish comes true.

49
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:55,432
Do I get what I want right away?

50
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:56,703
Good luck, Joon!

51
00:01:57,363 --> 00:01:59,102
Now you can really relax and enjoy your drinks.

52
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:00,332
- Can we?
- There's nothing else?

53
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,472
- Really?
- No.

54
00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:02,842
(Lucky guys)

55
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:04,343
Let's clink cups!

56
00:02:05,403 --> 00:02:06,642
Did you really want a go?

57
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:08,672
(Did you really want a go?)

58
00:02:08,673 --> 00:02:10,243
- Because of you...
- Well...

59
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:12,552
I wouldn't mind taking a ride,

60
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:13,913
but I didn't have to.

61
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:15,683
Why did they break the rules?

62
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,622
I don't get it.

63
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:19,583
This was a rule from the start? I don't think so.

64
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,892
It feels made-up.

65
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:22,763
I feel nothing on rides like this.

66
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:26,233
I can sleep on the way down.

67
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:27,962
I went skydiving too.

68
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:28,963
Hello.

69
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:30,463
I have some sad news.

70
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:32,532
- We'll land soon.
- Okay.

71
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:34,433
When landing, keep your feet together...

72
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,773
- and hold them up.
- Like this?

73
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:39,843
- Here goes.
- Okay.

74
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:41,772
You did great.

75
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:43,213
- Sit down.
- Okay.

76
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,742
You did amazingly well.

77
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:46,913
Stay seated until I unstrap you.

78
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,022
- Was it a nice experience?
- It was quite...

79
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:51,423
(Still dazed)

80
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,592
- High-five! Thank you.
- Thank you.

81
00:02:53,593 --> 00:02:54,622
2 Days...

82
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:55,823
- 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

83
00:02:55,923 --> 00:02:57,323
- Good job.
- Thank you.

84
00:02:58,123 --> 00:03:00,163
It was insane. It was...

85
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:03,333
I last did this about ten years ago.

86
00:03:05,403 --> 00:03:06,533
It was almost mysterious.

87
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,702
This is the landing zone.

88
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:10,443
- Shall we wait here?
- Really?

89
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:12,303
I wonder who has to fly.

90
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:15,983
Listen carefully to the instructions.

91
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:18,742
I will count to 3. On 3,

92
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:20,882
- you must drag me along.
- Okay.

93
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:22,482
- I won't push you.
- Why are you here?

94
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:23,783
How do you feel?

95
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:26,323
I'm glad you have to pay for being cheeky.

96
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,653
- The twist looked fun.
- Joon said...

97
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:31,522
he wanted to go really high up.

98
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:33,463
- I'll do my very best.
- Yes!

99
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:36,102
- Good luck.
- He enjoyed going skydiving,

100
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:37,863
but he looked down on paragliding.

101
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:42,172
I'll see if we can go down at the speed you'd reach...

102
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:44,142
- if you were skydiving.
- What for?

103
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:45,983
- We don't have to do that.
- Good luck, Joon.

104
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,182
(A photo to remember the disgrace by)

105
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:50,812
(Pale-faced, happy friends)

106
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,182
- Okay.
- Sae Ho landed.

107
00:03:52,183 --> 00:03:53,682
I see.

108
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:55,783
How about letting out a loud shout?

109
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:56,982
(Shouting)

110
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:58,153
Louder.

111
00:03:58,423 --> 00:04:00,192
(Shouting)

112
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:01,422
One, two, three.

113
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:02,922
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

114
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:04,792
- Shout louder.
- We're ready.

115
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,132
Safety check. Helmet, shoulder straps,

116
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,863
- waist belt, all fastened.
- Okay.

117
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:10,302
- They're setting off.
- Why the sudden gust of wind?

118
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:11,363
What's going on?

119
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,633
- The wind's too strong.
- Standby.

120
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,843
- Kappa is ready to lift off.
- He's off!

121
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,512
(However...)

122
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:23,143
The wind is blowing from behind us.

123
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:24,283
Yes.

124
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:26,753
Is today a good day to do this?

125
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:28,983
It's better if the wind blows toward us.

126
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,982
- Now run!
- Run.

127
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:34,253
(A crosswind helps open up the wings...)

128
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:37,123
(ensuring a safe takeoff.)

129
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:38,593
- We can't go now?
- No.

130
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:40,492
We must wait.

131
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:41,833
The wind is bad for us.

132
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:44,639
- Is that why we're waiting?
- It goes from good to bad.

133
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:46,223
Who decides if the wind is good or bad?

134
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,303
Do you have a loved one?

135
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,002
I don't.

136
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:51,963
- You don't love your mom?
- What about your mom?

137
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:53,273
I love my mom.

138
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:56,582
It's fine. I think you can go.

139
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,713
(10 minutes later)

140
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,682
We've been waiting too long.

141
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:01,053
We can't delay things. Just go.

142
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:03,553
Just jump, Joon.

143
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:04,723
What for?

144
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:08,153
Don't give up. Keep your energy up, Joon.

145
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:10,193
We'll film us seeing you off.

146
00:05:10,663 --> 00:05:12,663
(Exclaiming loudly)

147
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:13,792
(Bye, Joon!)

148
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:14,833
Bye!

149
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:17,333
- Let's wait for him down there.
- Let's go.

150
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,672
- Joon's so fearless.
- He is.

151
00:05:20,673 --> 00:05:21,873
He keeps his word.

152
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:24,672
Cheer up. You can't be so droopy.

153
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:26,312
Let's practice the run up.

154
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:28,013
Run up to here. Get the pose right.

155
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:30,142
You must run up then lift your feet.

156
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:31,413
That's it. Yes.

157
00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:32,883
Well done.

158
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,253
What is Sae Ho doing?

159
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:36,922
Seriously? Still more time?

160
00:05:36,923 --> 00:05:40,423
(It's the sixth time he was told they'd jump.)

161
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:44,863
(35 minutes later)

162
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,862
Let's go higher up.

163
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:48,493
- How about we move?
- Let's do that!

164
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:51,132
Gosh. This is exhausting.

165
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,732
(They move to another take-off point.)

166
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,032
You're tired, aren't you?

167
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,832
- The wind isn't helping.
- No.

168
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,753
(Keeping the backpack on in case he has to jump)

169
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:00,542
(The previous flier managed to set off.)

170
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:01,642
What's this?

171
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:04,043
- Good luck!
- I thought that was Joon.

172
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:08,453
(At this rate, Joon can go pretty soon!)

173
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:10,953
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

174
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,752
(Pulling himself together once again)

175
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:13,952
Come on, and just go for it.

176
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,669
- If you do that, it's dangerous.
- It's the speed.

177
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:16,792
Gosh, it's loose again.

178
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,023
(It's been 45 minutes.)

179
00:06:19,563 --> 00:06:20,763
This feels like a penalty.

180
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,332
(It's been 60 minutes.)

181
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,563
This is a penalty.

182
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:26,832
All right. Get up now.

183
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,833
- Joon.
- Yes.

184
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:28,902
- Get up quickly.
- Okay.

185
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:30,302
If you miss this window again, you can't do it then.

186
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:32,373
- Give him a round of applause.
- Let's go!

187
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,972
- Why are we clapping for him?
- Why?

188
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:37,042
(They start cheering for Joon as if they were under a spell.)

189
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:39,453
- You can do this!
- Let's go!

190
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,729
- What? They're watching me.
- You can do it.

191
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:43,382
It feels like I won a medal at the Summer Games.

192
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:44,853
Hey, hurry up.

193
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:46,592
- It's windy.
- I want to stand next to him...

194
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:47,833
and blow some wind if it helps.

195
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:50,462
Go over there. They're...

196
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:51,922
- They're your juniors.
- He can't go for it now.

197
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:52,992
Your buddies are all there.

198
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:54,032
- Go and cheer with them.
- Listen.

199
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,633
- Joon can't go yet.
- Let's go, DinDin.

200
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:57,432
- He can't do it yet.
- A lot of your friends are here.

201
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,233
- They're his friends. Yes, my gosh.
- Hello.

202
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:00,972
- When I raise my right hand, - Hey.

203
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:02,003
Say, "Lee Joon."

204
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:03,572
When I raise my left hand, say, "You can do it!"

205
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:04,643
Lee Joon.

206
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:05,842
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

207
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,513
(The cheerleader of the kids)

208
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:09,942
(Lee Joon, )

209
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:10,943
(you can do it!)

210
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:12,783
- Join us, everyone. Go!
- Lee...

211
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:15,012
- Lee Joon, you can do it.
- Lee Joon, you can do it.

212
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:17,229
- Lee Joon, you can do it.
- He's the captain of the kids.

213
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,993
Gosh, this is so embarrassing. What are they doing?

214
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,422
- Can you record the screen?
- Record the screen.

215
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:23,823
- Who? Sae Ho?
- Yes.

216
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:26,133
What's Sae Ho doing now?

217
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:27,732
(Looking dirty)

218
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:28,933
- What?
- What are you doing?

219
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:30,433
What are you doing?

220
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:33,472
I've been squatting down here for an hour and a half.

221
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:34,903
For an hour and a half.

222
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:38,073
Look what he's been doing for an hour and a half.

223
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:40,573
Right. Gosh, that must be tiring.

224
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:42,543
I found 6 4-leaf clovers.

225
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,182
- He found 6 4-leaf clovers.
- He found 4-leaf clovers.

226
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:46,583
(He shares an unbelievable story.)

227
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,152
Sae Ho, here's a four-leaf clover.

228
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:50,183
Really?

229
00:07:51,223 --> 00:07:52,483
How did you find it?

230
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,053
I've seen them too.

231
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,363
I should see if I can find some too.

232
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,162
I found one right away. Look.

233
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:00,893
(Then...)

234
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:03,403
Isn't this a four-leaf clover?

235
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,932
(he finds one right away.)

236
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:07,003
Right?

237
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,103
I found another one.

238
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:11,549
Why are there so many four-leaf clovers here?

239
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:12,712
(He looks like a survivor in a war movie.)

240
00:08:12,713 --> 00:08:13,993
Gosh, there are so many of them.

241
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:15,553
I guess my life will be full of luck.

242
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:19,213
This one is beautiful.

243
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:20,983
I found a beautiful one.

244
00:08:21,383 --> 00:08:23,182
(The prettiest-looking four-leaf clover...)

245
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:24,543
- Right? Yes.
- It's so beautiful.

246
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,493
- I did it.
- Show it to me.

247
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:29,692
- That's beautiful.
- It's so pretty.

248
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:30,893
It's so pretty.

249
00:08:31,263 --> 00:08:32,892
(Sae Ho found 6 4-leaf clovers while waiting for Joon.)

250
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:34,292
- It went in nicely too.
- Yes.

251
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:35,839
(Sae Ho found 6 4-leaf clovers while waiting for Joon.)

252
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:38,933
I saw two. But the clovers withered away.

253
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:40,532
They're dying. We must get down fast.

254
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,802
- Hurry up.
- We'll be there soon.

255
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:43,072
We'll wait for five more minutes.

256
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:44,302
If Joon still can't go then, we'll head down.

257
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:45,342
Okay.

258
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:46,513
- Okay.
- Okay.

259
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:50,242
It's okay. Don't worry about me. I'm really fine.

260
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:51,243
Seriously.

261
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:53,324
It must be tough on Joon. He's fully dressed for it.

262
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:56,182
Here's the thing. You get so nervous right before you take off.

263
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,823
He's been feeling anxious the whole time.

264
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:00,483
I guess you need more than just good weather.

265
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,923
- Right. It's also the wind.
- Exactly.

266
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:05,492
All right. Get up.

267
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:06,932
(It's the final moment of the truth.)

268
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:08,573
- He can do it. Here he goes.
- Let's go.

269
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,132
I guess it's a green light.

270
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,893
- I think he can do it.
- Let's wave at him.

271
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:14,703
- Give him a big round of applause.
- Yes.

272
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:17,372
- The wind is getting weaker.
- Go!

273
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:19,273
- All right.
- It's almost 4pm now.

274
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:21,312
- Let's go!
- We'll face that way and run.

275
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:23,142
- You said the wind was weak.
- You can do it!

276
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:24,412
Could you lift the wing?

277
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,583
- The weather couldn't be worse now!
- You can do it.

278
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:28,582
- You said it was dangerous.
- At 4pm...

279
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,952
- Is he just going to jump?
- Will it be safe?

280
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:32,033
- Is it safe for him to do it?
- He'll run that way?

281
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:33,152
What? What's going on?

282
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:35,229
I guess they're going to turn after getting it to fly up.

283
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:36,523
I won't run straight down.

284
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:38,903
I'll probably have to run diagonally.

285
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:42,332
They're going to run like this? To get the parachute to fly up.

286
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,333
The wind...

287
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,862
We'll face and run toward the flag in the middle.

288
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:47,903
- Have you done it in this weather?
- Yes.

289
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:49,802
Run confidently.

290
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:51,043
All right. Look over there.

291
00:09:51,403 --> 00:09:52,403
Okay.

292
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:53,812
- One, two, three. Run.
- They'll create some wind.

293
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:56,582
- Run harder.
- There he goes!

294
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,882
(Will they be able to fly up?)

295
00:09:57,883 --> 00:10:00,152
- Run harder.
- There he goes!

296
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:02,853
(Please!)

297
00:10:03,023 --> 00:10:04,853
Gosh, I can see the wing.

298
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:06,992
(Please!)

299
00:10:06,993 --> 00:10:08,823
- There he goes.
- Run harder.

300
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:10,792
- Run harder.
- Go for it!

301
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:12,762
(The wing starts to spread.)

302
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:14,462
Why isn't it working? Is it going to work?

303
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:15,939
- No. It's not working.
- It's not working.

304
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,262
- Should I stop running?
- Stop.

305
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:18,463
(The timing is a cruel thing.)

306
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:22,132
You can do it!

307
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,043
(Feeling disappointed)

308
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:25,773
- I can't do it?
- No.

309
00:10:25,873 --> 00:10:29,073
It doesn't look doable today. We can't risk our safety.

310
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:31,683
It's unfortunate, but let's try it another time.

311
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:33,853
- He'll come back on his own.
- Let's get going.

312
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,012
He'll come back on his own.

313
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:37,152
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

314
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,182
Gosh, thank you.

315
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:39,623
You were cool, Joon. That was great.

316
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,293
- Let's go!
- Nice try, Joon.

317
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:43,522
Joon in a different outfit!

318
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:44,962
(They got to see Joon in a different outfit.)

319
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:46,122
This is embarrassing.

320
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:47,532
(Joon approaches the crowd whom he's the most grateful for.)

321
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:48,963
It's okay!

322
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:51,502
(They still think he couldn't do it because he was scared.)

323
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:54,232
They told me I couldn't do it because of the wind.

324
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:56,773
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do it.

325
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,913
- Thank you for waiting.
- Sure.

326
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:02,542
- Thank you.
- Come here.

327
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:04,382
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

328
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:06,912
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

329
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:08,153
Have a nice day!

330
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:10,252
The weather is amazing today.

331
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,459
(They head out to pick up Sae Ho despite the disappointment.)

332
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:15,023
That was the most tiring activity today.

333
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:16,323
(Laughing)

334
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:18,822
That drained my energy completely.

335
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:20,362
(Waiting is the hardest thing.)

336
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,032
- We were feeling great before.
- By the way...

337
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:24,003
- Right.
- That was surprisingly tiring.

338
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:25,933
I'm just worried about Sae Ho.

339
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,072
Joon.

340
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:29,409
Do you realize how important it is to do things in the right season?

341
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,343
- It wasn't the right season.
- Right.

342
00:11:31,643 --> 00:11:33,472
- Right.
- Not the season for paragliding.

343
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:36,913
Exactly. It just shows how precious it is to be season appropriate.

344
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:39,312
- Or use some CGI for it.
- All of us did it.

345
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:40,853
- You can use AI these days.
- Right.

346
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:42,923
Make an AI-generated image of Joon,

347
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:45,552
enjoying his paragliding activity.

348
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:47,653
Make it look like he's doing it with AI.

349
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:49,252
Hey, that's funny.

350
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:51,693
(And we did exactly what you asked.)

351
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:53,493
That's the place. I guess he's there.

352
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:55,832
- Nice try.
- Good job.

353
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,462
- Good work.
- Good job.

354
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:59,462
- You really found 4-leaf clovers?
- I found 6.

355
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:00,972
- But they all withered away.
- Really?

356
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:02,732
You really found them. You weren't lying.

357
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:03,972
- I was telling the truth.
- Are they really four-leaf clovers?

358
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,803
- Check them.
- You didn't make them?

359
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:08,013
- Sit down.
- They're real four-leaf clovers?

360
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:09,682
- They're real.
- You really found them?

361
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:10,713
Yes.

362
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,982
- You didn't rip 3-leaf ones for it?
- These are real 4-leaf clovers.

363
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,412
- They're real.
- Did you rip...

364
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:15,452
Look at this too.

365
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:16,723
This is so touching.

366
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:19,059
- They really have four leaves?
- I haven't seen them in a while.

367
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,322
I found one and put it in my phone case.

368
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,063
(Everyone is hooked on the four-leaf clovers.)

369
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,022
You really found four-leaf clovers?

370
00:12:26,023 --> 00:12:28,393
I found them, so I can give them to you.

371
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:31,902
(A therapeutic city of nature)

372
00:12:31,903 --> 00:12:34,733
(Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province)

373
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:37,602
(A beautifully scenic town...)

374
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:40,043
(that captures the beauty of all four seasons)

375
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:44,613
(A scenic spot that represents Jecheon)

376
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:49,112
(Uirimji Reservoir)

377
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:50,522
(When King Jinheung of Silla reigned, )

378
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:51,882
(Ureuk built a bank to block the stream, )

379
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:53,599
(and 700 years later, Magistrate Park Ui Rim expanded it.)

380
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:55,222
(Uirimji Reservoir)

381
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:57,222
(The oldest-existing reservoir in Korea)

382
00:12:57,223 --> 00:13:00,792
(The name, Jecheon, was derived from the Uirimji Reservoir as well.)

383
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:02,962
It sounds like a cliche. But Korea has many beautiful places.

384
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:04,203
Yes, indeed.

385
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:06,032
Korea has so many beautiful places.

386
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:07,702
(In this beautiful Uirimji Reservoir...)

387
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,732
- Uirimji Reservoir.
- Gosh.

388
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,442
- It feels like autumn now.
- You know?

389
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:12,102
I wonder how it feels...

390
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:14,073
to be looking at such scenery as a foreigner.

391
00:13:14,213 --> 00:13:15,312
How beautiful and wonderful.

392
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:17,083
- I'd think it's beautiful.
- Of course.

393
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,343
- My gosh. You know what?
- This place is beautiful.

394
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:21,012
The view is stunning.

395
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:23,359
What a great spot for a walk. This is the perfect season for it.

396
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:25,653
The weather and fall foliage are perfect.

397
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:28,222
I wonder what we'll do once the sun sets later.

398
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:29,352
(What's next on their itinerary?)

399
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:30,623
We'll probably do something.

400
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:32,392
- A team match.
- Is it a team match?

401
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,793
- Team Jong Cho Joon.
- Yes, it is.

402
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:35,662
- This is the perfect season.
- Team Jong Cho Joon.

403
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:36,702
All right, everyone.

404
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:38,962
Let me tell you the score for the slots on the wheel.

405
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:40,332
- It's 11 to 7.
- That's right.

406
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,373
Team Choi Baek-core has seven slots.

407
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:43,642
- And...
- Team Choi Baek-core.

408
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:45,142
Team Jong Cho Joon has 11 slots.

409
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:46,472
- We're winning.
- Okay.

410
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:48,772
But that's not important. Spinning it right matters.

411
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:50,913
- After this round, - Will it be decided?

412
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:52,413
You'll spin the wheel.

413
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:54,812
- Great.
- You'll tell us what we'll do too?

414
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:56,052
- Pardon?
- You'll tell us what we'll do too?

415
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:57,573
Yes, I will once the result comes out.

416
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,382
This is the highlight of today's trip.

417
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:00,423
- Right.
- Yes.

418
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:03,993
(Coming up next)

419
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:08,093
(The dopamine-filled show will decide their fate.)

420
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:09,332
- No.
- Yes!

421
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,062
(Which team will face the final penalty?)

422
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:14,203
Here's the next season-core mission.

423
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:16,703
It's Find Mr. Kim in Jecheon.

424
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:18,749
- We have to find Mr. Kim?
- That's the mission.

425
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:20,743
You all have to invite...

426
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,482
a guest to our show.

427
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:25,513
- What?
- It's more advantageous...

428
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,282
- What?
- for your team...

429
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,652
to find someone with a high step count for the day.

430
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:31,359
- How will we know that?
- How will we know?

431
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:34,152
You can check their phone or smartwatches...

432
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,722
- before inviting them to our show.
- Really?

433
00:14:36,723 --> 00:14:38,362
Will the team...

434
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:41,093
with a higher combined step count of the guests win?

435
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:42,992
We'll have to see.

436
00:14:42,993 --> 00:14:44,263
- My gosh.
- First of all...

437
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,473
- Okay. Sorry.
- Okay.

438
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:48,302
- I'll give you five minutes.
- Okay.

439
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:49,433
- Five?
- Yes.

440
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:50,672
- It won't take long.
- Let's go.

441
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:52,903
- All right. Get ready...
- Let's go.

442
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:54,873
(Let's go!)

443
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:57,113
- Great. Ask them.
- Let's ask them.

444
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:02,183
Did anyone here walk a lot today?

445
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:04,353
Hello.

446
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:06,722
- Gosh, no.
- I see.

447
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:08,192
If you don't mind,

448
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:09,892
would you like to participate in an interview?

449
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:10,893
(They spread out and look for people to invite.)

450
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:11,893
Sir.

451
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,363
What?

452
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:17,003
Are you on a date?

453
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,333
They seem quite fit. You guys walked all day, right?

454
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:21,672
Could you show us your step count for today?

455
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:23,472
- Could you show it to us?
- My gosh.

456
00:15:23,473 --> 00:15:24,702
- You guys are married.
- Yes.

457
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:26,512
You're her husband. Right?

458
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:28,242
- But I'm wearing flip-flops.
- I see.

459
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:29,942
- It's fine. Show us the step count.
- Just...

460
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:31,582
How long have you been married? Are you newlyweds?

461
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,742
- We...
- We've been married for six months.

462
00:15:32,743 --> 00:15:34,012
Six months? I could tell you were newlyweds.

463
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:36,052
Newlyweds walk to a lot of places.

464
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:37,699
- And they look at beautiful views.
- Yes. Exactly.

465
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:38,852
I'll see you later.

466
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:39,952
- I'll go.
- Hurry up.

467
00:15:39,953 --> 00:15:41,952
Just by looking at your face, I know you're a runner.

468
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:43,313
Right? Aren't you good at running?

469
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:46,022
Where did you start walking to have walked this much?

470
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:47,369
Is this your first time coming here?

471
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:49,592
- Every day, we...
- Yes. Do you go for a walk?

472
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:52,503
Yes. We love to walk and walk all the time. So our step count...

473
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:54,632
I wonder if this is considered high, though.

474
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:55,953
- I'm sure it is.
- You think so?

475
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:57,143
Joon!

476
00:15:58,103 --> 00:15:59,743
You walked 5,735 steps.

477
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,272
- You walked 5,735 steps.
- Someone with a high step count...

478
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:04,743
(It could be a bit higher.)

479
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:07,312
- Someone walked 10,000 steps.
- Really?

480
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,653
- Who?
- There.

481
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:09,953
Thank you, ma'am.

482
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:11,352
- Hello.
- Hey.

483
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:12,982
Could you show me your step count for today?

484
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:14,022
Okay. My gosh.

485
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:15,052
(10,587 steps)

486
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:16,152
Okay. My gosh.

487
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:17,662
(I hit the jackpot with 10,000 steps!)

488
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,533
Could you come with me for a moment?

489
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:23,202
- It's for 2 Days 1 Night.
- Sure. I'll go with you.

490
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:24,609
Thank you. Gosh, he walked 10,000 steps.

491
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:25,963
I secured a high number.

492
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:28,503
I can observe their shoes.

493
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:31,073
It's more likely that people with walking shoes...

494
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:33,313
walked more than other people.

495
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,413
(Actively scanning their shoes)

496
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:38,383
Hello.

497
00:16:39,443 --> 00:16:42,783
Were you guys on a walk? Or are you here to take a break?

498
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:44,252
I'm traveling with my son.

499
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,322
- You're traveling?
- Yes.

500
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:47,392
- Did you walk a lot today?
- I did.

501
00:16:47,393 --> 00:16:50,563
If you don't mind being on TV,

502
00:16:50,663 --> 00:16:52,723
could I ask to see your step count?

503
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:54,332
- I see. This is...
- Yes.

504
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,893
(Sae Ho checks the count on his phone.)

505
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:58,232
(Surprised)

506
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:59,602
(The step count amazes him.)

507
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,633
What is it?

508
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,233
Could you help me out?

509
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:05,003
- Our fate is at stake.
- Okay.

510
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:07,212
Could you be so kind and appear on my show?

511
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:08,472
Please help me out.

512
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:12,343
(What's all this fuss about? What's his step count?)

513
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:14,552
- Then...
- Yes?

514
00:17:14,553 --> 00:17:16,622
- can I get an autograph?
- I'll do everything you want.

515
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:18,553
The three of us can take pictures too.

516
00:17:18,753 --> 00:17:20,952
If there's a special occasion for you or your friends,

517
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:22,452
- I can even film a video for you.
- Gosh, no.

518
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:24,222
Please come with me.

519
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,562
- Where are you from?
- Chuncheon.

520
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:27,633
Chuncheon.

521
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:29,933
I was the first one to invite a guest.

522
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:33,802
I have a good feeling about this.

523
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,033
You do?

524
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:36,803
I'm feeling great.

525
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:38,943
All right. Come here. This is No Gwang Woo.

526
00:17:39,603 --> 00:17:41,243
- Hello.
- Hello.

527
00:17:41,713 --> 00:17:43,012
- You found someone fast.
- I did.

528
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:44,212
- Go to your side.
- Okay.

529
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:45,842
- This way.
- Come here. This is our side.

530
00:17:45,843 --> 00:17:47,312
(Remaining time)

531
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:48,752
(DinDin)

532
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:50,953
(The 2 of them haven't found a partner yet.)

533
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:53,352
- Hello.
- Hello.

534
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:55,253
- Can we film you?
- Sure.

535
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:58,693
Can I check your step count for today?

536
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:01,793
Sir. Hold on.

537
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:04,332
- Could you come with us?
- Sure.

538
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,403
Thank you, sir.

539
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:07,733
He walked 9,800 steps.

540
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:09,703
Thank you, sir.

541
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:13,642
(DinDin is at the entrance of the Uirimji Reservoir.)

542
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:15,142
- Go ahead.
- Did you walk a lot today?

543
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:18,243
Can I check your phone, sir?

544
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:20,752
That's good. It's high enough.

545
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:22,212
- Please come with me.
- What?

546
00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:23,783
- You walked a lot today.
- Yes.

547
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:25,183
Thank you.

548
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:27,022
- What brings you here?
- Can we tag along?

549
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,252
Of course, come with us.

550
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:29,393
What brings you here?

551
00:18:29,553 --> 00:18:31,892
I had a school reunion today.

552
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:33,362
- They're your school friends?
- Yes.

553
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,209
(The people behind them are his school friends.)

554
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:37,063
Here comes the thoughtful celebrity.

555
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:39,733
Gosh, everyone on our team has a presence.

556
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:41,802
Mr. Hyun Man is here.

557
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:43,542
- Hello.
- Hello.

558
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:44,703
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

559
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,402
- Welcome.
- Hello.

560
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:47,712
- Stand right here.
- Welcome.

561
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:49,443
He's got a great presence.

562
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:51,712
So everyone is here.

563
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,953
Why don't we ask our partners to introduce themselves?

564
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,183
My family and I are traveling to Jecheon from Chuncheon.

565
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:59,382
My name is Hyun Byung Sik.

566
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:01,123
- My gosh. Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

567
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:03,092
- Welcome.
- Yes.

568
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:05,892
Hello. I'm a Jecheon resident.

569
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:08,373
I was invited to come here when I was walking with my husband.

570
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:10,732
I'm from Gunpo.

571
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,063
I heard you were filming here, so I was just watching.

572
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,803
- I see.
- You were watching us.

573
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:18,672
Hello. I live in Jecheon.

574
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:20,012
My name is No Gwang Woo.

575
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:21,372
Let me say just this.

576
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:23,482
- He has such a respected career.
- Yes.

577
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:25,743
Could you tell them what you do for a living?

578
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:29,252
I work at Danyang Fire Station as a member of the rescue squad.

579
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:30,622
My name is No Gwang Woo.

580
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:32,099
- Gosh, amazing.
- He's with the rescue squad.

581
00:19:32,123 --> 00:19:34,692
- He's so cool. He keeps us safe.
- You always work to keep us safe.

582
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:35,892
He doesn't need any gear.

583
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:37,862
- He can walk even in these shoes.
- I see. That's why?

584
00:19:37,863 --> 00:19:39,563
- Of course.
- He can do anything.

585
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:40,862
Let me introduce my partner. Say hello.

586
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,033
Hello.

587
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:45,432
I'm from Seoul. I came down here for a school reunion for three days.

588
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:48,833
I was walking around here with my school friends.

589
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:50,713
- They're from his middle school.
- Gosh.

590
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,102
- It's one of our regular meetings.
- Oh, my.

591
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:55,042
- Did you come here with your wife?
- No. Only my friends are here.

592
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,142
- Only your friends?
- Yes.

593
00:19:56,143 --> 00:19:57,382
- And you're here for three days?
- Yes.

594
00:19:57,383 --> 00:19:58,983
- Tell me your secret.
- Then...

595
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:01,689
I didn't know husbands could go on a three-day trip with their friends.

596
00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:03,723
I want his secret. There must be a secret.

597
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:05,883
- All right, sir.
- Hello.

598
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:07,953
I live in Jecheon. My name is Won Chang Sik.

599
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:09,552
- Won Chang Sik.
- Won Chang Sik.

600
00:20:09,553 --> 00:20:11,592
- You know what? I can tell...
- Yes.

601
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:13,492
- you're a runner at a glance.
- He is.

602
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:15,633
- He runs 3 to 4 times a week.
- He's a runner.

603
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:17,332
(From their introductions, the results might be close.)

604
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,013
- It might come close.
- We need to check.

605
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:20,502
- All right. What's...
- Let's battle it out.

606
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:21,932
- What should we do?
- Let's begin.

607
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:25,473
I'll tell you the pair with the lowest step count.

608
00:20:25,743 --> 00:20:26,743
Okay.

609
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:28,504
- From each tea?
- From Team Choi Baek-core,

610
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:30,612
Se Yoon's partner has the lowest step count.

611
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:34,013
(Se Yoon's partner has the lowest step count.)

612
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:36,712
(Betrayed by the firefighter whom he felt pretty sure about)

613
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,252
What is this? Mr. Firefighter.

614
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:39,422
(Embarrassed)

615
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:42,353
Se Yoon, come on. He's wearing flip-flops.

616
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:44,222
(It's clear that he came out for a short walk.)

617
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:46,062
- But...
- I'll do my best.

618
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:47,732
(Flustered)

619
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:49,392
But our step count wasn't that low.

620
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:51,663
- Right.
- I think they just walked a lot.

621
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:53,062
- It's the lowest of our team.
- Right.

622
00:20:53,063 --> 00:20:55,272
- The difference might not be huge.
- Right.

623
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:56,513
- All right.
- What about them?

624
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:58,043
From Team Jong Cho Joon,

625
00:20:58,503 --> 00:21:00,272
- Jong Min's partner has...
- Really?

626
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:02,812
The lowest step count for now.

627
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:03,843
"For now?"

628
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,482
(Team Jong Cho Joon: Joon, 10,587 steps)

629
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:06,982
(Team Choi Baek-core: 10,405 steps)

630
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:08,412
(Jong Min and Se Yoon, the lowest step count)

631
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:11,583
Then I'll now explain the mission.

632
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:13,852
All right. Bring it in.

633
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:15,352
- Come on.
- What?

634
00:21:15,353 --> 00:21:16,423
Don't do that.

635
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:19,693
All right. They are for the members.

636
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:21,093
This is a pedometer.

637
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,032
I have a bad feeling about this.

638
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:25,179
- DinDin is shaking it.
- Why are they doing this to us?

639
00:21:25,203 --> 00:21:27,633
I will give you three minutes.

640
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:29,672
The team with...

641
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:32,072
the lowest combined step count...

642
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:34,472
from you and your partner...

643
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:36,272
will lose.

644
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:37,712
(The match is about the combined step count.)

645
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,182
- But...
- The team with the lowest number...

646
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:40,253
will lose, right?

647
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:42,583
The team with the lowest step count will lose.

648
00:21:42,713 --> 00:21:44,659
- Then what will my partner do?
- You'll do a better job.

649
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:46,322
He should try to increase his step count.

650
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:47,422
I see. By walking now?

651
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:49,623
It will be advantageous if they can increase the count.

652
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:51,722
- We should just jog.
- How?

653
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:53,322
Like this? Is it working?

654
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:56,362
You'll start now. Exactly after three minutes,

655
00:21:56,363 --> 00:21:58,362
- Three minutes?
- you must stop.

656
00:21:58,363 --> 00:21:59,462
- We have to do it together.
- Together?

657
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:00,472
(Sae Ho flinches.)

658
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:02,933
Sae Ho is moving.

659
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:04,242
Hey, Sae Ho.

660
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:05,243
- He's moving.
- No.

661
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:06,502
- What will our partner do?
- Here.

662
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:08,372
(His hand is moving fast.)

663
00:22:08,373 --> 00:22:09,972
DinDin is tapping on it.

664
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:11,813
- Can't we just do this?
- He's tapping on it.

665
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:13,182
- Come on.
- We have to jog?

666
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:15,012
- What? No. Let's do this.
- Why did you walk?

667
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:16,682
Let's gather around and reset each other's.

668
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:18,152
- Let's reset each other's.
- My gosh.

669
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:19,382
- Let's do that.
- You can't trust us?

670
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:21,122
- So you don't trust us at all?
- Yours is at seven.

671
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:22,803
I thought you were a thoughtful celebrity.

672
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:25,022
Gosh, our partners are here.

673
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:26,939
- What's this?
- When he says, "Go," we can start.

674
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:28,032
Mine is at zero.

675
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:29,962
I trust you. Let's do it now.

676
00:22:29,963 --> 00:22:31,303
We'll start now. Get ready...

677
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,032
(Go!)

678
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,902
Sir, just shake it like this. It's faster.

679
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:38,183
- No need to run.
- Let's do it.

680
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:42,342
(Jogging at full speed on the same spot)

681
00:22:42,343 --> 00:22:43,813
You must stop when I tell you.

682
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:47,882
- So do this for three minutes?
- What?

683
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:49,352
What is this?

684
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:50,353
(He can't believe what he's doing.)

685
00:22:50,354 --> 00:22:51,552
He came down here for a school reunion.

686
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:52,682
What are you making him do?

687
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:55,453
(Everyone from the school reunion is jumping.)

688
00:22:55,593 --> 00:22:57,122
- Is it going up?
- Se Yoon and his partner's count...

689
00:22:57,123 --> 00:22:59,022
matters more than ours right now.

690
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:00,762
Put your hands on that and shake it.

691
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:03,203
- Our numbers don't matter.
- Put your hands on it and shake.

692
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:05,162
- You have a minute left.
- Keep going.

693
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:06,702
(The lowest step count)

694
00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:08,132
(They will decide the winning and losing teams.)

695
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,533
- This isn't easy.
- Look.

696
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:12,373
I can't see it.

697
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:15,173
(A step can decide the winners and losers.)

698
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:17,783
This is no joke. I'm so tired.

699
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:20,212
This is so exhausting.

700
00:23:20,213 --> 00:23:22,382
(Squeeze in a step more.)

701
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:23,453
I'm so tired.

702
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:28,292
(We just have to make sure we don't have the lowest count.)

703
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:30,022
Five, four,

704
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:31,462
- You can't check it.
- three,

705
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:33,062
- two, one.
- Seon Ho, change it.

706
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:34,562
- Stop.
- Stop.

707
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:35,862
- Stop.
- All right. Okay.

708
00:23:35,863 --> 00:23:37,062
- Give it to me.
- Stop.

709
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:38,063
- Don't look.
- Okay.

710
00:23:38,064 --> 00:23:39,302
Freeze!

711
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:40,702
- Hurry.
- Check what?

712
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:42,872
- Take them.
- You can stop it now.

713
00:23:42,873 --> 00:23:44,602
(I gave it my all.)

714
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:46,602
It will only increase 1 or 2 steps. Don't do it. Don't cheat.

715
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:48,112
- Stop that.
- I'm dying here.

716
00:23:48,113 --> 00:23:49,412
It will only increase 1 or 2 steps.

717
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:51,513
- What?
- I thought I was going to die.

718
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:53,112
I guess mine didn't detect a lot of steps.

719
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:54,513
- How many more steps?
- About 110.

720
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:56,183
Mine went up a lot.

721
00:23:58,053 --> 00:23:59,222
Gosh, your step count went up a lot.

722
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:01,292
- Right. It's higher than yours.
- She's amazing.

723
00:24:01,293 --> 00:24:03,052
- It went up a lot.
- Right.

724
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:04,469
(Jong Min's partner's step count must have gone up a lot.)

725
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:06,623
The firefighter's step count will matter.

726
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,162
He's our hero. I believe in him.

727
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:11,009
(Which pair has the lowest step count of them all?)

728
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,602
Should I start with the highest step count?

729
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:13,902
- Tell us the highest count.
- I bet it's DinDin.

730
00:24:13,903 --> 00:24:15,002
- The highest step count...
- It must be DinDin.

731
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:17,003
- Isn't it my partner?
- What's the step count?

732
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:19,002
It goes to Sae Ho and his partner.

733
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:22,142
(Sae Ho and his partner takes 1st place.)

734
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:23,642
- He must have walked a lot.
- Gosh, no way.

735
00:24:23,643 --> 00:24:25,042
- That's crazy.
- My partner...

736
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:26,383
It's anyone's game then.

737
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,753
He walked 18,700 steps today.

738
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:32,683
- He walked 18,700 steps.
- See? You never know.

739
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:35,693
He started with 18,000 steps.

740
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:37,392
By far, he had the highest step count.

741
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,692
- Look at his family.
- We got this!

742
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:40,162
(His family also walked 18,700 steps with him.)

743
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:43,032
- He...
- He had to go for a meal.

744
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:44,763
I begged him to help me out.

745
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:46,603
I asked him to spare me just ten minutes.

746
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:49,272
The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-highest step counts came close.

747
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:51,019
- Really?
- The second-highest step count...

748
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:53,372
went to DinDin and his partner.

749
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:54,712
- It's my partner.
- I see.

750
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:56,713
- Yes.
- He walked 8km today.

751
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:59,542
- Joon and his partner were next.
- Okay!

752
00:24:59,543 --> 00:25:00,582
- Really?
- Yes.

753
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,153
- What?
- The fourth place...

754
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:03,952
went to Seon Ho and his partner.

755
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:05,423
My partner walked a lot too.

756
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:07,192
That's the ranking so far.

757
00:25:07,193 --> 00:25:09,293
- Then it's between these two.
- So...

758
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,122
It's up to Jong Min, Se Yoon,

759
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:13,962
and their partners' step counts.

760
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:16,063
The results of the mission will be decided by them.

761
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:18,233
Se Yoon, I believe in you.

762
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:21,773
Here's their partner's step count when they brought them to the show.

763
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:25,743
Se Yoon's partner had walked 7,719 steps by then.

764
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:27,242
He walked 7,719 steps.

765
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:30,843
Jong Min's partner had walked 6,837 steps.

766
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:33,043
- They're close. My gosh.
- They're neck and neck.

767
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:34,983
- They're neck and neck.
- My gosh.

768
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:38,282
- Okay.
- There's a 400-step difference.

769
00:25:38,283 --> 00:25:39,582
- My gosh.
- Hey, this is...

770
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,392
- Right?
- It won't be easy to beat that.

771
00:25:41,393 --> 00:25:42,852
- I'll give you...
- Please!

772
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:45,292
The final total of their combined steps.

773
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,593
It's like watching the World Cup.

774
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:48,893
Please.

775
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:50,062
Se Yoon jogged quite a lot.

776
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:51,863
Surprisingly, yes. He almost hit 300 steps.

777
00:25:51,963 --> 00:25:56,273
(Se Yoon and his partner jogged until their cheek fat jiggled.)

778
00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:58,943
(How many more steps did he add to the total number?)

779
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:02,513
The combined step count for Se Yoon and his partner is 7,842.

780
00:26:02,673 --> 00:26:03,882
Our count is 7,842?

781
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:05,282
- It was around 7,100 steps earlier.
- Okay.

782
00:26:05,283 --> 00:26:06,482
- That's a big difference.
- Okay.

783
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:07,789
- It was around 7,100 steps earlier.
- Yes.

784
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:08,882
We still have a chance.

785
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:10,112
The chance is...

786
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:11,882
(Team Se Yoon: 7,179 to 7,842 steps, Team Jong Min: 6,837 steps)

787
00:26:11,883 --> 00:26:13,522
(The gap is over 1,000 steps now.)

788
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:15,053
I'm sure we won. I'm sure of it.

789
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:16,392
There's no way Jong Min took 10,000 steps...

790
00:26:16,393 --> 00:26:17,592
since we all recorded the show together at the same time.

791
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:19,823
(Nervous)

792
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:23,033
(Jong Min and his partner gave their all just like the other team.)

793
00:26:23,763 --> 00:26:25,732
- Team Se Yoon's record...
- Tell us now. Come on.

794
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,132
Is 7,842 steps, right?

795
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:28,202
I think we have a chance.

796
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:29,272
Team Jong Min's record...

797
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:31,241
(Jong Min's partner's friends are waiting for the result nervously.)

798
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:35,601
(What could be Team Jong Min's record?)

799
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:37,108
(Team Se Yoon: 7,179 to 7,842 steps)

800
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,408
(Team Jong Min: 6,837 steps)

801
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:39,638
It's 8,447 steps.

802
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,008
(Team Se Yoon: 7,179 to 7,842 steps, Team Jong Min: 6,837 to 8,447 steps)

803
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:42,308
We won.

804
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,978
(Team Jong Cho Joon wins.)

805
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,419
(We won.)

806
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,048
It's 8,447 steps.

807
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:51,488
(The tables were turned only in 3 minutes.)

808
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:53,189
That doesn't make sense. How?

809
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:57,458
- She shook her body like crazy.
- She was so fast.

810
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:59,128
- She was amazing.
- She was incredible.

811
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:00,898
(She turned out to be the dancing machine of Uirimji Reservoir.)

812
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:02,629
She was really fast.

813
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:06,398
It is what it is. You did a great job though.

814
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:07,939
You did well too.

815
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:10,339
You did a wonderful job. Thank you so much.

816
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:12,269
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Don't mention it.

817
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,278
2 Days!

818
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,539
- 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

819
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:17,678
One, two...

820
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,778
(They take photos with the fans as they promised.)

821
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:20,978
Now I'll announce...

822
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:23,288
the total number of slots that each team gained...

823
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:24,989
through today's missions.

824
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:27,519
Team Jong Cho Joon gained 17 slots.

825
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,019
- Team Choi Baek-core got seven.
- We might win eventually.

826
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:32,329
- You never know.
- You're right.

827
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:34,698
So the other team gets to fill 17 slots...

828
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:36,168
- while we get to fill seven slots.
- That's correct.

829
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:37,169
- Okay.
- Oh, I see.

830
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,328
- But today...
- Can't we do that?

831
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:40,238
You can just write "Jong." Fill one more slot.

832
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:44,139
(They take turns filling the spinning wheel.)

833
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:48,908
(The spinning wheel is ready.)

834
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:50,448
I'll tell you what the losing team...

835
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:51,729
- will do tomorrow.
- All right.

836
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:54,518
We enjoyed the season-core trip...

837
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,519
In This Autumn Moment today.

838
00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:59,188
One day is too short to try all the seasonal activities.

839
00:27:59,189 --> 00:28:00,189
- It's too short, indeed.
- Yes.

840
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,458
- The season of harvest.
- So...

841
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,499
we'll spin the wheel, and the team that's chosen...

842
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:05,589
- will have to wake up at dawn.
- At dawn?

843
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:08,259
And they will climb up Mount Worak...

844
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:10,169
that's called the Alps of the East.

845
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:12,738
They will enjoy...

846
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:14,138
- the beautiful autumn scenery...
- Mount Worak?

847
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:15,738
And finish up the trip.

848
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:17,338
(Terrified)

849
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:19,138
(The very mountain that's famous for its rough trails)

850
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:20,908
(It's way tougher than Mount Sobaek and Mount Taebaek.)

851
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,778
(Mount Worak is like the final boss in a game.)

852
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:24,648
(Only Mount Seorak and Mount Jiri are tougher than Mount Worak.)

853
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:26,348
- Mountains with "ak" are tough.
- "Ak."

854
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:27,418
Mount Worak has "ak" in it.

855
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:28,955
(It's a match where the losing team will hike up the tough mountain.)

856
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:30,088
I've been nice lately.

857
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:31,418
- We could avoid going there.
- Right.

858
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,058
- I've been really nice.
- Right.

859
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,088
(The thoughtful celebrity is confident.)

860
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,188
- Byung Jin, please spin the wheel.
- One day isn't enough.

861
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:38,528
Why do you decide that?

862
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:39,998
Then who do you want to spin it?

863
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:42,158
- Tae Hee.
- Good. Anyone will do.

864
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,328
Our writer Tae Hee...

865
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:44,845
used to work on the "Steel Troops" team.

866
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:47,468
- Give her a round of applause.
- She's very strong-minded.

867
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:48,798
She ran around Mount Halla.

868
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,839
- She's as strong as steel.
- She is, indeed.

869
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:52,778
Please spin it hard in this direction.

870
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:53,838
- In the direction toward you.
- Spin it hard.

871
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,639
- Spin it really hard.
- Spin it really hard.

872
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,748
- Let's stay up all night tonight.
- Let's go, Venomous Spider.

873
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:58,985
- Spin it hard.
- Spin it really hard.

874
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:00,318
(She spun it.)

875
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,749
- That's good.
- Pull it harder.

876
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:04,418
- Move back. Move!
- Right. Move back.

877
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:05,748
- Hey, don't blow on it.
- Don't move.

878
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:07,218
(The 70 to 30 odds will determine the members' fate.)

879
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:09,188
Get ready to jump up and down.

880
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:10,528
Get ready to jump up and down with joy.

881
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:12,388
I've been good. I've been really good.

882
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:14,698
- Jong!
- Baek!

883
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:15,905
- Baek!
- It's going to be Baek.

884
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:18,329
(Who will see the autumn sunrise at a high spot?)

885
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:20,438
- It's going to be Baek.
- Baek!

886
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:22,969
- No. That won't happen.
- It'll spin around again.

887
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:24,908
- It'll spin around again.
- It passed us.

888
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:26,079
- See?
- No.

889
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:27,878
- It passed us.
- No.

890
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:30,208
It's slowing down. It's stopping.

891
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:31,649
(The wheel is slowing down.)

892
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:33,618
It's slowing down. It's stopping.

893
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:35,448
(Which team will be chosen?)

894
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:37,948
It's slowing down. It's stopping.

895
00:29:37,949 --> 00:29:39,048
(Baek)

896
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:40,188
- Oh, yes!
- Baek!

897
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:46,099
(Team Choi Baek-core will go hiking.)

898
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:50,098
(Pretending to shoot to celebrate)

899
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:53,299
(Happy, sad)

900
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:56,338
(They couldn't beat the odds after all.)

901
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:58,039
Our team is doing crazy good.

902
00:29:58,209 --> 00:29:59,579
We have such good teamwork.

903
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:01,138
- We did a great job.
- This is crazy.

904
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:02,478
It's a shame that we lost here.

905
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:03,779
It's a shame that we got picked.

906
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:05,678
(Bitter)

907
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,078
- We did a great job.
- This is crazy.

908
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,625
(The thoughtful celebrity hides behind the spinning wheel.)

909
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:10,088
I thought "Baek" was us for a moment.

910
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:11,925
Thoughtful celebrity, what are you doing there?

911
00:30:11,949 --> 00:30:13,219
Thoughtful celebrity...

912
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,758
(The thoughtful celebrity explodes.)

913
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,388
What's with the thoughtful celebrity?

914
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:20,398
(The thoughtful celebrity explodes.)

915
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,698
A lot of viewers are watching this.

916
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:23,699
You're a thoughtful celebrity.

917
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,468
(He swallows his anger quietly.)

918
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:28,598
Now we'll move to the base camp.

919
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,468
Okay!

920
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:31,539
Let's go!

921
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:38,309
Mount Worak.

922
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:41,179
We'll go up to a peak in Mount Worak.

923
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:45,549
I heard it didn't take much time to go up there and come back down.

924
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,689
- Then you go.
- You go.

925
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:51,589
Jong Min, please go there for your dear younger members.

926
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:54,299
And don't bring that gun next week.

927
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:56,269
It makes me upset for no reason.

928
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:59,598
He was swinging it excitedly on his way to the restroom.

929
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,068
(He's been acting like a cowboy all day.)

930
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,768
I couldn't be happier.

931
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:04,068
- Of course.
- We played a game with the locals.

932
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:06,678
I'm not kidding. I feel like I'm flying.

933
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:07,739
Really?

934
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,719
I feel like I'm floating in the air.

935
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:13,448
The spinning wheel doesn't know how to make a variety show fun.

936
00:31:13,449 --> 00:31:14,479
Exactly.

937
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,289
(They arrived at the base camp already.)

938
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:19,919
This must be our room.

939
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:21,489
My, it's nice.

940
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,658
- It's really nice.
- This is it.

941
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:25,888
Isn't this our first break time of the day?

942
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:26,929
That's right.

943
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:29,075
In autumn, the sky is high, and horses get fat.

944
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:30,529
Autumn is the season of reading.

945
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:31,968
- Since it's autumn...
- Since it's autumn,

946
00:31:31,969 --> 00:31:33,899
Jong Min, recommend us a book.

947
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,499
- You're the oldest member.
- Right. He's the oldest member.

948
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:38,369
Well...

949
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:40,409
What book have I read?

950
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:42,308
(Was there any book I read?)

951
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:43,379
What book have you read?

952
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:46,248
I recently read a book by Nietzsche.

953
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:49,118
I like reading books by philosophers to learn about life.

954
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:51,025
- Nietzsche?
- I read "Umenbersch" by Nietzsche.

955
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,448
I liked the book...

956
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:53,988
- What? Wimenbush?
- Wimenbeosh?

957
00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:55,219
"Umenbersch."

958
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:57,888
- Did you say "umeboshi?"
- Umeboshi...

959
00:31:57,889 --> 00:31:59,458
- is a side dish.
- George Bush?

960
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,659
- He's a former president of the US.
- Not George Bush?

961
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,228
- And...
- "Whiplash?"

962
00:32:03,229 --> 00:32:04,798
"Whiplash" is... As you know,

963
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,699
it's a song by aespa.

964
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:08,945
- This book is...
- "From the moon, by the sea?"

965
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,409
"From the moon, by the sea..."

966
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:13,439
is a part of the lyrics of a song by FLY TO THE SKY.

967
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:15,038
For the moon, by the sea

968
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,839
The title of the book I read is "Umenbersch."

969
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:20,849
- Thank you.
- That's all.

970
00:32:20,949 --> 00:32:22,519
(He's proud for some reason.)

971
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:25,249
- What's the book title?
- "Umenbersch."

972
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:28,019
- "Umenbersch?"
- Here's what the book says.

973
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:30,528
It says that you just have to hold out...

974
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:32,699
- for two years in your life.
- I see.

975
00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:36,329
If you hold out for 2 years, the next 10 years will be different.

976
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:38,469
- For 2 years...
- For 2 years?

977
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,369
It's a good book.

978
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,239
So is it "Umenbush?"

979
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:44,039
(Chuckling)

980
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:46,008
I said, "Umenbersch."

981
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,439
- I didn't catch the title.
- It's "Umenbersch."

982
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:50,348
(Sae Ho looks up the book title.)

983
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:52,448
- It's actually "Ubermensch."
- What?

984
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:54,618
- Right. It's "Ubermensch."
- My gosh.

985
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:55,678
What did I say?

986
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,565
- You kept saying "Umenbersch."
- What did I say again?

987
00:32:57,589 --> 00:32:59,288
- "Ubermensch."
- It's "Ubermensch."

988
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:00,858
He thought you were talking about George W. Bush.

989
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:02,858
Didn't he say "Yoon Eun Hye?"

990
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:05,105
(Still, Sae Ho remembered the book. We praise you, Sae Ho.)

991
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:07,058
- Exactly. It's already 8:40pm.
- Yes.

992
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,535
- We're going to have late dinner.
- Right.

993
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,699
- Joon, sit next to me.
- What? Why?

994
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,238
- I'll give you my negative energy.
- Should we sit with our teams?

995
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:14,769
No, I don't want that.

996
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,608
- Let's sit with our teams.
- Okay.

997
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:17,968
- Let's sit with our teams.
- Right.

998
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:19,339
- Right.
- I love my team.

999
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,508
Things have never gone this well for us.

1000
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:22,509
- Right?
- Yes.

1001
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,748
- Being on the right team matters.
- Joon.

1002
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:25,248
Let's not give them any food.

1003
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:27,609
All right. The dishes you'll have for today's dinner are...

1004
00:33:27,849 --> 00:33:29,719
(In This Autumn Moment)

1005
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:31,918
- What?
- You can enjoy them only in autumn.

1006
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:32,988
Gizzard shads and shrimps.

1007
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:34,988
(The food that you can enjoy only in this autumn moment)

1008
00:33:34,989 --> 00:33:36,989
It's the meal of autumn food.

1009
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:38,758
- You mean, a set meal?
- Yes.

1010
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:39,759
The meal of autumn food.

1011
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,059
Will the food come in first?

1012
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:44,369
I really need to eat something. I'm starving.

1013
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:46,339
- Look at that.
- Oh, my.

1014
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,919
- Is this eobokjaengban?
- I see steamed blue crabs.

1015
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:52,109
Beef shank and mushroom hot pot with herbs.

1016
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:53,409
Oh, beef shank.

1017
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:55,579
Steamed blue crabs.

1018
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:00,779
Tteokgalbi with garlic.

1019
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:04,019
Braised mussel, scallops, and garlic.

1020
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:07,059
Shrimp jeon.

1021
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:10,829
Steamed eggs with pine mushroom.

1022
00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:12,129
That looks so tasty.

1023
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:13,899
Oyster kkakdugi.

1024
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:17,098
This is a proper set meal.

1025
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,599
I want to have these dishes even if I can't have them here.

1026
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:21,398
Which one do you want the most?

1027
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:22,668
- Blue crab!
- Blue crab!

1028
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:24,508
- I want this dish.
- Mushroom hot pot.

1029
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,378
- I want mushroom hot pot too.
- I need something with soup.

1030
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:28,438
When I saw the steamed blue crabs, I lost my reason.

1031
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,578
- Really?
- I love it.

1032
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:30,778
I love crustaceans.

1033
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:31,979
Let's begin already.

1034
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,818
The game you will play...

1035
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:35,449
to have the meal of autumn food is...

1036
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:38,249
Guess to Protect.

1037
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:40,759
- You'll play the game as a team.
- Okay.

1038
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,418
- We've got this.
- It's a quiz mission.

1039
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:43,488
- It's been a long time.
- Let's do a chant.

1040
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,769
- Let's do a chant.
- All right.

1041
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,129
- One, two, three. Let's go!
- Let's go!

1042
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:49,699
There will be only seven rounds.

1043
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,498
All members must get the right answer, and if you fail to do so,

1044
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:54,139
we'll take out one of the dishes.

1045
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:57,168
The more times you succeed,

1046
00:34:57,169 --> 00:34:58,909
the more food you can enjoy.

1047
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,378
I hope you get a lot of food.

1048
00:35:00,379 --> 00:35:02,108
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

1049
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:03,978
It'd be awesome if we could just keep three dishes.

1050
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:04,979
Right.

1051
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,418
You need to stay focused and do your utmost.

1052
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:10,019
There are many people who want me to be fair and square.

1053
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:12,369
I don't see any people like that.

1054
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,458
- I know.
- Who are those people?

1055
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,258
- I saw some comments too.
- I should look into it.

1056
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:17,928
- Who told you that?
- Name me five people.

1057
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:19,089
Then I would understand.

1058
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,529
First, we have Joo Jong Hyun.

1059
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,498
- I mean these people here...
- You mean your people there?

1060
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:25,198
- You mean our staff members.
- Right.

1061
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,998
But they are right. You have to be strict about it.

1062
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,068
- Okay.
- Let's start.

1063
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:29,939
Should we go for a practice game?

1064
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,638
Can't you count it if we get...

1065
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,938
the practice game right?

1066
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:34,538
- Let's do that and be fair.
- Let's do that.

1067
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:36,278
- That's what I'm saying.
- You should count it...

1068
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:37,608
if we get the practice game right.

1069
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:39,478
If we don't get the practice game right, then it's a practice game.

1070
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:41,359
- That's right.
- This is what our people want.

1071
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,388
We have our own people who think like that too.

1072
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:45,489
Why is it that only your opinion matters?

1073
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:47,288
(Stop)

1074
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:50,259
This is the game we are playing.

1075
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:52,128
It's A Times Table Game Minus One.

1076
00:35:52,129 --> 00:35:54,428
- Times Table Game Minus One?
- What is that?

1077
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:55,429
So this is how the game works.

1078
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,298
- If 4 times by 9 is 36...
- Then it's 35.

1079
00:35:57,299 --> 00:35:58,928
- The answer is 35.
- Okay.

1080
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:01,268
We can't even play the actual one. Isn't this too hard for us?

1081
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:02,699
You don't want us to eat!

1082
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,959
You can't just let us play the normal game?

1083
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:07,338
- Joon...
- It's not as hard as you think.

1084
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,238
- What's 4 times 8?
- That's 31.

1085
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,578
- That's right.
- It's not bad.

1086
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:12,948
- We should focus hard.
- I think we can play this.

1087
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:14,378
- It's not as hard as you think.
- We can do this.

1088
00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:15,919
- Let's go!
- All right.

1089
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,188
- Let's rock this game.
- Watch out 9 times 8.

1090
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:20,719
- Let's focus.
- We'll start the game now.

1091
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,259
What's 9 times 4?

1092
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,489
That's 35.

1093
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:26,798
- What's 4 times 8?
- What did you say?

1094
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:28,099
His pronunciation was so bad.

1095
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:29,728
You didn't say it properly.

1096
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,528
I couldn't understand what you said.

1097
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:32,828
I couldn't catch him at all.

1098
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:33,898
Hold on a second.

1099
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:35,338
- But this is...
- I couldn't hear him.

1100
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,308
I mean it! "3 times 4 or 4 times 8?" I couldn't hear you at all.

1101
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:39,838
He could have gotten the answer because 4 times 8 is easy.

1102
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,208
But Sae Ho asking you this...

1103
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:42,638
- Your pronunciation was horrible.
- That was an easy one.

1104
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,508
Can you change the person to Hee Sung?

1105
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:46,555
(Now they want a different person for the question setter.)

1106
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,848
Let me try it again.

1107
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:49,019
- Okay.
- Sure.

1108
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:51,388
- Let's start.
- That would hurt his pride.

1109
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:53,488
- Goodness.
- Don't forget to minus one.

1110
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:54,589
Okay.

1111
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:56,859
- What's 5 times 8?
- That's 39.

1112
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:58,659
What's 9 times 6?

1113
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,129
- That's 35.
- What are you doing?

1114
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:02,859
- That's 35.
- Goodness.

1115
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,169
(They are shocked.)

1116
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:07,439
- This is so annoying.
- What's wrong with you?

1117
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,069
This is frustrating.

1118
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:12,438
- I mean...
- He's just so annoying.

1119
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,408
He pretended like he couldn't hear you just now.

1120
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:16,289
- He pretended like...
- What's wrong with you?

1121
00:37:16,449 --> 00:37:19,279
I'll be honest with you. I could hear 4 times 8 really well.

1122
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:22,179
This is so annoying! Goodness!

1123
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:24,989
(Anger boiling up)

1124
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:26,288
(Zoning out)

1125
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:27,989
- I'm sorry.
- He's back.

1126
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:30,028
All right, I'm sorry.

1127
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:31,628
- This is annoying.
- He's back.

1128
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:33,159
It's driving me nuts!

1129
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:36,929
(Getting angry)

1130
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:39,638
His pent-up anger has exploded.

1131
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:40,998
This is too much!

1132
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:42,568
- Give me another chance.
- DinDin getting mad...

1133
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:44,108
It was a practice game...

1134
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:45,638
and I have a bad headache. Give me another chance.

1135
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,838
- Sae Ho.
- I mean it.

1136
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:47,839
You should start.

1137
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,148
- Wait. Give me another chance.
- You should be the first one.

1138
00:37:50,149 --> 00:37:52,025
- No, just trust me.
- Be the first one to play.

1139
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:53,489
Which menu would you like to remove?

1140
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,419
Remove what? Remove one!

1141
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:57,218
(Please...)

1142
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:59,248
I'm sorry. We just have one mussel per person.

1143
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:02,188
- He's right.
- We can have kimchi all the way.

1144
00:38:02,189 --> 00:38:04,228
I'm sorry, see you next time. Okay.

1145
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:05,229
(Braised mussel, scallops, and garlic removed)

1146
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,828
Is this even right? How can we get this wrong?

1147
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:08,998
I'm so sorry. Give me one more chance.

1148
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:11,328
- We'll play another round.
- Okay.

1149
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:12,828
Sae Ho, will you be okay in that order?

1150
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:14,268
I can do this. I'll go first.

1151
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:15,475
- Okay, you should go first.
- I'll go first.

1152
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:17,368
- It's better if Sae Ho plays first.
- Right.

1153
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:19,008
If you get this wrong again...

1154
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:20,579
- All right.
- We'll be in big trouble.

1155
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:22,538
- We'll start now.
- Don't get nervous.

1156
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:23,849
I'm so nervous.

1157
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:25,508
One, two, three.

1158
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:26,548
What's 5 times 6?

1159
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:27,719
That's 29.

1160
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:29,448
What's 3 times 6?

1161
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:30,589
That's 17.

1162
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:31,818
What's 7 times 3?

1163
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:32,819
That's 20.

1164
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:34,689
What's 9 times 6?

1165
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:35,689
That's 53.

1166
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:37,689
What's 3 times 3?

1167
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:38,759
That's eight.

1168
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:41,498
- My heart is pounding...
- Be quiet.

1169
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:43,799
(Will Se Yoon get this one right?)

1170
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:45,998
What's 6 times 3?

1171
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:46,999
That's 17.

1172
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:49,368
That's 17.

1173
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,668
(They succeeded in Round 2.)

1174
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:53,178
- See? You can do this.
- I'm sorry.

1175
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:54,578
- I told you it would work.
- See? You can play.

1176
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:55,908
- We told you.
- I'm sorry.

1177
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:57,048
- It's okay.
- We got this.

1178
00:38:57,049 --> 00:38:59,048
(The lingering bitterness from earlier melted away like snow.)

1179
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:00,169
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

1180
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:02,678
- Let's not get mad.
- See? You can do this.

1181
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,618
We should keep the beef shank and mushroom hot pot with herbs.

1182
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,435
- Let's keep the mushroom hot pot.
- Mushroom hot pot.

1183
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:08,218
It's fine as long as we have the mushroom hot pot.

1184
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:09,219
Yes, we're fine as long as we have that.

1185
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,358
I want the steamed blue crabs too.

1186
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:11,359
We should keep the crabs.

1187
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,789
We've got great momentum.

1188
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:15,298
All right, everyone. This time...

1189
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:17,228
We're playing this back and forth.

1190
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,528
- What?
- Back and forth?

1191
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:20,168
- Let's switch seats.
- Come on.

1192
00:39:20,169 --> 00:39:22,098
- You have to start anyway.
- Okay.

1193
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:23,238
Let's hear the game.

1194
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,739
- This is...
- Back and forth...

1195
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,578
It's a Proverb Chain Game.

1196
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,378
- It's a Proverb Chain Game.
- I say the first part...

1197
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:30,478
- Even a worm...
- Will turn.

1198
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:32,348
- He doesn't know...
- The simplest things.

1199
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:34,078
Stop giving us samples.

1200
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,649
- We'll play the game now.
- Okay, let's play.

1201
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:38,749
A thirsty deer...

1202
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:40,489
Digs its own well.

1203
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:42,218
When my cousin buys land...

1204
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:43,328
It makes me envious.

1205
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:44,489
Going to the well...

1206
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:46,029
You die.

1207
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:49,099
You die.

1208
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,628
(A throwaway answer)

1209
00:39:50,629 --> 00:39:53,539
- Hold on. Going to the well?
- Wrong. You failed.

1210
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:55,739
- Wait!
- I don't know this one.

1211
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,069
Going to the well...

1212
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:58,808
- See? They don't know!
- Going to the well.

1213
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:00,308
- See?
- What is "Going to the well?"

1214
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:03,008
- Going to the well...
- Wait a second.

1215
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:04,549
- Ask him.
- Going to the well...

1216
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:06,408
Going to the well...

1217
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,649
See? How would we know?

1218
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:10,665
- What's wrong with these people?
- See? Nobody knows.

1219
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:12,388
- Hold on.
- What's going on?

1220
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:13,895
- What is this?
- Going to the well...

1221
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:16,688
Gosh! Who can get this one right? Nobody knows the answer.

1222
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:17,689
Going to the well?

1223
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,899
- Raise your hand if you know.
- Nobody knows this.

1224
00:40:20,229 --> 00:40:21,999
- Going to the well...
- Nobody would know.

1225
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:23,228
Nobody knows.

1226
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:24,745
Going to the well, looking for the scorched rice water.

1227
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:25,868
- Is that correct?
- Is that right?

1228
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:27,199
But you...

1229
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:30,108
- You actually know...
- You're old enough.

1230
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:31,168
Come on.

1231
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:32,908
- You know this kind of game.
- You've done this for a long time.

1232
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:35,379
You are old enough to know these proverbs.

1233
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:37,048
What are you talking about?

1234
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:38,449
- Come on.
- My goodness.

1235
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:40,779
You overestimated us.

1236
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,048
- Let's get back.
- We didn't know this one.

1237
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:45,249
He's not unreasonable. So let's talk with him.

1238
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:47,218
- You want to talk about it?
- Yes, let's talk.

1239
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:48,958
- I know we can talk about this.
- Going to the well...

1240
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:50,528
- I've never heard of this proverb.
- I know, me too.

1241
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:52,435
- This is my first time hearing it.
- I thought it was a part of lyrics.

1242
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:54,859
You should ask Chang Hee.

1243
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,198
You want me to call him and ask?

1244
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,528
Ask Chang Hee if he knows this.

1245
00:40:57,529 --> 00:40:58,928
- I don't think he would know.
- If he doesn't know,

1246
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:00,545
- we will play this round again.
- Let's play it again.

1247
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:02,168
(A chance given out of sympathy for their poor understanding)

1248
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,869
- Okay, let's do that.
- Sorry, Chang Hee.

1249
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,038
Instead, just shout at him. "Going to the well!"

1250
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,579
No, you can't do that.

1251
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:09,278
(Ungrateful)

1252
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:10,378
Going to the well...

1253
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:12,079
(Calling Chang Hee)

1254
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:13,778
- Sae Ho.
- Hey, Chang Hee.

1255
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:15,549
Now I'm shooting the show with the guys.

1256
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:18,049
- Right.
- Answer me if you know the proverb.

1257
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,858
- Okay.
- It's a chain game.

1258
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:21,019
It's a Proverb Chain Game.

1259
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:22,688
- Okay.
- Complete the proverb.

1260
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:23,689
Going to the well...

1261
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,828
(On the call with Chang Hee)

1262
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:26,529
- What? Going to the well?
- Yes.

1263
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,729
(On the call with Chang Hee)

1264
00:41:28,249 --> 00:41:29,979
- What? Going to the well?
- Yes.

1265
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:32,495
Looking for the scorched rice water.

1266
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,518
No, he didn't say it right.

1267
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:36,858
- Going to the well?
- He didn't complete it properly.

1268
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:38,788
- What do you have to look for?
- His reception isn't working.

1269
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:40,505
- What do you have to look for?
- Scorched rice water.

1270
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:42,458
- He's smart.
- Why would we even look for that?

1271
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:44,498
I mean why would he...

1272
00:41:44,499 --> 00:41:45,969
You knew about this?

1273
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:48,698
- We have the hot pot.
- Let's get rid of steamed eggs.

1274
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:50,045
(Steamed eggs with pine mushroom removed)

1275
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:51,908
Let's try this one, it's hard.

1276
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,168
We'll skip the hard one for you.

1277
00:41:53,169 --> 00:41:54,409
- Okay.
- Give us an easy one.

1278
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:56,515
We're here because we didn't study when we were students.

1279
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:58,309
- All right, let's start.
- Okay.

1280
00:41:58,709 --> 00:41:59,709
Let's start.

1281
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:01,579
One, two, three.

1282
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,778
There is no grave...

1283
00:42:03,779 --> 00:42:07,218
(There is no grave...)

1284
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:09,058
- Let's switch seats.
- No.

1285
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,189
There is no grave...

1286
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:12,188
This one is good.

1287
00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:13,459
This is too easy.

1288
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,228
- Let's switch seats.
- No.

1289
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:17,459
You just offended me.

1290
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:19,698
- Let me explain.
- What happened?

1291
00:42:19,699 --> 00:42:21,198
It's not that I don't know. Of course, I know.

1292
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,698
- Why were you offended?
- Of course, you know.

1293
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:23,699
You know this?

1294
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,369
There is no grave that can go far.

1295
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:26,908
- No, that's not correct.
- You really don't know this?

1296
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:27,909
Wrong!

1297
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:29,078
An excuse...

1298
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,538
- I'll go first.
- Without something...

1299
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:33,208
I know the proverb. There is no grave without an excuse.

1300
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:35,349
- Who told you?
- Someone told me.

1301
00:42:35,949 --> 00:42:37,979
See? This is the problem.

1302
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:40,218
- When you were asking questions, - Yes?

1303
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:43,058
Jong Hyun was very aggressive...

1304
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:44,379
when he was reading the question.

1305
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:46,628
- There is no grave...
- He was pointing his finger at me.

1306
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:48,699
I didn't know what to do.

1307
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,398
I think you got offended.

1308
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:51,428
A bit...

1309
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:52,668
(Feeling upset)

1310
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:53,769
He's very offended.

1311
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:55,028
- He's crying.
- My goodness.

1312
00:42:55,029 --> 00:42:57,138
- I was very shocked.
- Hold on.

1313
00:42:57,139 --> 00:43:00,208
Jong Hyun, don't be too aggressive.

1314
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:02,178
You can do it softly.

1315
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,208
I was going to complete the proverb when he said the first part.

1316
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,579
But he pointed that thing at me.

1317
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,108
"There is no grave..."

1318
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:08,408
(Offended)

1319
00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:10,225
I thought to myself, "Did I do something wrong?"

1320
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:11,779
That's how I felt.

1321
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,148
Let's get rid of oyster kkakdugi.

1322
00:43:13,149 --> 00:43:14,519
(Oyster kkakdugi removed)

1323
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:17,888
This was the last question I was going to give you.

1324
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:19,029
A naughty calf...

1325
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:20,488
What is this?

1326
00:43:20,489 --> 00:43:22,429
Grows its bottoms?

1327
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:23,698
My goodness.

1328
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:24,959
How can its bottoms go up?

1329
00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:26,869
Where would it go up? It's not a cat.

1330
00:43:27,629 --> 00:43:29,069
To be slapped in Jongno...

1331
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:32,508
You have to go somewhere to find it.

1332
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:34,669
It's like you take it out in this area, where is that?

1333
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:37,139
Is it Yeongdong Avenue?

1334
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:38,238
How far would we go?

1335
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:40,008
To be slapped in Jongno and take it out on the Han River.

1336
00:43:40,009 --> 00:43:41,308
I know, it's the Han River.

1337
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:42,949
This one was easy.

1338
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:46,319
This would create regional conflicts for sure.

1339
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:47,919
(Laughing)

1340
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:49,618
People living by the Han River...

1341
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,789
They would ask why they would come to the Han River.

1342
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,569
How long do we have to go on to eat what we want to eat?

1343
00:43:55,129 --> 00:43:56,759
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

1344
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:59,399
How long do we have to do this to have a meal?

1345
00:43:59,529 --> 00:44:01,768
- All right. Let's play.
- Let's go.

1346
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:03,338
- Let's stay focused.
- Let's go.

1347
00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:04,399
Just keep the four dishes.

1348
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,038
- Hey, we can do it.
- Yes.

1349
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:08,038
- Let's go.
- In that case,

1350
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:10,478
why don't you make a round trip of giving an answer...

1351
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:12,108
that fits the theme?

1352
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:13,479
Making a round trip won't be easy.

1353
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:15,778
Whenever we do this, we're asked to name an idol group...

1354
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,049
- or a movie.
- That's right.

1355
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,149
- A celebrity, singer, or actor.
- An actor or singer.

1356
00:44:20,689 --> 00:44:22,088
Joon, will you be okay?

1357
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:23,688
- I'll be okay.
- Joon is good at it.

1358
00:44:23,689 --> 00:44:25,218
- Jong Min is bad at it.
- Switch places with Jong Min.

1359
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:27,558
Same here. You know that I'm bad with names.

1360
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:28,998
Other people will answer twice anyway.

1361
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,358
- Then...
- Come on.

1362
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:31,575
- Jong Min is the worst at it.
- Okay.

1363
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,899
Give a name in a certain category.

1364
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:36,098
- Okay.
- Okay.

1365
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:37,269
Let's begin.

1366
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:39,768
Focus. Now isn't the time to do that.

1367
00:44:39,769 --> 00:44:41,238
- Let's begin.
- Let's go.

1368
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:43,159
- Use up the time before answering.
- All right.

1369
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:44,379
Let's begin.

1370
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,485
Give a person's name that has four syllables in Korean.

1371
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:48,819
- One, two, three.
- King Sejong.

1372
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,449
- One, two, three.
- Shin Saimdang.

1373
00:44:51,779 --> 00:44:53,718
- One, two, three.
- Dokgo Young Jae.

1374
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:55,859
- One, two, three.
- Ulchi Mundok.

1375
00:44:56,189 --> 00:44:58,758
- One, two, three.
- Sunwoo Yong Yeo.

1376
00:44:58,759 --> 00:44:59,828
One...

1377
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:02,309
(Up next is the member who is the worst with names, Jong Min!)

1378
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:05,669
(Will Jong Min be able to succeed in it?)

1379
00:45:05,729 --> 00:45:07,529
- One, two...
- Sunwoo Jae Deok.

1380
00:45:07,899 --> 00:45:10,199
- One, two, three.
- U-Know Yunho.

1381
00:45:10,439 --> 00:45:12,539
- One, two, three.
- Xia Jun Su.

1382
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,438
- One, two...
- Max Chang Min.

1383
00:45:14,439 --> 00:45:15,509
(Grinning)

1384
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:17,879
(We're set!)

1385
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:19,949
- One, two...
- Hwangseung Ho Je.

1386
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:21,548
- He exists.
- He exists.

1387
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:23,718
- Hwangseung Ho Je.
- One, two...

1388
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:25,079
Hero Jae Joong.

1389
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:26,318
(Round 5 is a success.)

1390
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,389
- TVXQ!
- We did it.

1391
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:31,489
- TVXQ!
- Thank you.

1392
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,728
- Hwangseung Ho Je exists.
- He exists.

1393
00:45:33,729 --> 00:45:36,028
I began giving the old stage names of the TVXQ members.

1394
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:38,868
- I began the trend.
- Well done.

1395
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,369
Toegye Yi Hwang would've been incorrect, right?

1396
00:45:41,429 --> 00:45:42,438
It would've been correct.

1397
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:43,668
- Really?
- We accepted King Sejong too.

1398
00:45:43,669 --> 00:45:46,268
I was going to say Yulgok Yi I. but suddenly...

1399
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:48,008
I was afraid that you'd say Hero Jae Joong.

1400
00:45:48,009 --> 00:45:49,378
- No.
- I was so anxious.

1401
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,379
I suddenly heard the old stage names...

1402
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,548
of the TVXQ members like Max Chang Min and U-Know Yunho.

1403
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,408
(He thought Seon Ho wouldn't know other people.)

1404
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:56,378
I prepared to say Hwangseung Ho Je.

1405
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,379
That was great.

1406
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,988
- Who is Hwangseung Ho Je?
- He's famous.

1407
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,049
He's very famous.

1408
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,318
(Hwangseung Ho Je is a singer with incredible singing skills...)

1409
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:05,528
(who debuted in 1993. His hit songs include...)

1410
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,029
("I Feel Only You," "Sad Love," and "You Grow Distant.")

1411
00:46:08,189 --> 00:46:11,699
- Steamed blue crabs.
- Get the steamed blue crabs.

1412
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:13,268
We're set. We have blue crabs.

1413
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:14,328
We just need rice.

1414
00:46:14,329 --> 00:46:17,068
This time, it'll be a one-way trip.

1415
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:19,068
- Okay. It'll be neat.
- A one-way trip.

1416
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:21,139
- The oldest one should wrap it up.
- Okay.

1417
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:23,038
It'll be a round trip.

1418
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:24,478
Is it the same as before?

1419
00:46:24,479 --> 00:46:25,879
This one...

1420
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:28,548
- is related to the media industry.
- Okay.

1421
00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:29,948
- Media industry?
- A movie.

1422
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:32,719
- A movie, drama, album, song...
- Something like a drama.

1423
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:34,819
- I don't know many movies.
- All right.

1424
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:37,019
Would you switch places with me?

1425
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:38,618
I'm nervous.

1426
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:40,188
- I need time to think.
- Where do you want to go?

1427
00:46:40,189 --> 00:46:41,328
To the end. It'll be better.

1428
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:42,658
- Okay.
- It'll be better.

1429
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:44,999
- I'm nervous.
- Will you be okay with going last?

1430
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:46,999
I don't think it'll come this far.

1431
00:46:48,429 --> 00:46:49,599
All right.

1432
00:46:49,939 --> 00:46:52,308
If all of us succeed in it, you'll be very nervous.

1433
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,269
- All right. Let's begin.
- Okay.

1434
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:57,139
Name a Korean movie that had ten million views.

1435
00:46:57,339 --> 00:46:59,708
One, two, three.

1436
00:46:59,709 --> 00:47:01,008
"Ode to My Father."

1437
00:47:01,009 --> 00:47:02,295
- One...
- "The Admiral: Roaring Currents."

1438
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,548
Please slow down.

1439
00:47:03,549 --> 00:47:05,378
- Okay.
- One, two...

1440
00:47:05,379 --> 00:47:07,049
- Okay.
- One, two,

1441
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:08,389
- three.
- "Veteran."

1442
00:47:08,989 --> 00:47:10,758
One, two...

1443
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:12,205
"Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time."

1444
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,628
- It didn't get ten million views.
- Didn't it?

1445
00:47:14,629 --> 00:47:16,298
- Wrong.
- Didn't it get ten million views?

1446
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:17,729
It got 7 or 9 million views.

1447
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:19,298
(4,720,000 views)

1448
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:20,898
Ha Jung Woo and... Didn't it get ten million views?

1449
00:47:20,899 --> 00:47:22,339
(He can't believe it.)

1450
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,699
Didn't it?

1451
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:31,708
Why did you laugh after asking, "Didn't it get ten million views?"

1452
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:33,208
- Do you find it funny?
- Yes.

1453
00:47:33,209 --> 00:47:34,278
"Didn't it?"

1454
00:47:34,279 --> 00:47:36,678
- We'll give you a list.
- This is driving me crazy.

1455
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:39,118
- "Exhuma," "12.12: The Day,"
- That's right.

1456
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,048
"The Roundup," "Parasite,"

1457
00:47:41,049 --> 00:47:42,818
"Taegukgi," and "Silmido."

1458
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,035
How about "Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time?"

1459
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:45,388
- It didn't get ten million views.
- No.

1460
00:47:45,389 --> 00:47:46,728
- Why not?
- Why not?

1461
00:47:46,729 --> 00:47:47,928
- Why not?
- Still...

1462
00:47:47,929 --> 00:47:49,329
Why not? Didn't you guys watch it?

1463
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:52,769
- Didn't you guys watch it?
- Why not?

1464
00:47:52,929 --> 00:47:54,929
- Shrimp jeon is out.
- Shrimp jeon is out.

1465
00:47:55,169 --> 00:47:56,368
I'm sorry.

1466
00:47:56,369 --> 00:47:57,568
How about "Tazza: The High Rollers?"

1467
00:47:57,569 --> 00:47:58,598
Didn't it get ten million views?

1468
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:01,269
R-rated movies rarely hit ten million views.

1469
00:48:01,439 --> 00:48:02,878
- Really?
- Yes.

1470
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,138
(Steamed blue crabs and beef shank and mushroom hot pot with herbs)

1471
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:07,479
(The only remaining dish is tteokgalbi with garlic.)

1472
00:48:07,709 --> 00:48:10,478
All right, everyone. This time...

1473
00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:11,848
We must have that dish.

1474
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:13,188
We must eat it.

1475
00:48:13,189 --> 00:48:14,218
(We must eat tteokgalbi.)

1476
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:16,918
Name the partner of the figure I give you.

1477
00:48:16,919 --> 00:48:18,188
- Partner?
- For example,

1478
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:19,458
if I say Choi Soo Jong, the answer is Ha Hee Ra.

1479
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:20,589
- Okay.
- Let's begin.

1480
00:48:20,929 --> 00:48:22,358
Is it a round trip or a one-way trip?

1481
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:23,928
- A 1-way trip.
- It's a 1-way trip.

1482
00:48:23,929 --> 00:48:25,868
- I don't know this.
- It's okay. Give it a go.

1483
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,599
All right. Let's begin.

1484
00:48:29,169 --> 00:48:30,238
Lee Min Jung.

1485
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:31,498
- One, two...
- Lee Byung Hun.

1486
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:33,068
Please don't answer quickly.

1487
00:48:33,069 --> 00:48:34,268
We need time.

1488
00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:35,678
- Please.
- How frustrating.

1489
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,508
- Let's resume.
- It doesn't matter for this one.

1490
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:39,008
- Be considerate.
- Be considerate.

1491
00:48:39,009 --> 00:48:40,108
- It doesn't matter for this one.
- Focus.

1492
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:41,279
- Okay.
- All right.

1493
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:44,618
Cho Jung Seok. One, two...

1494
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:45,849
- Gummy.
- There you go.

1495
00:48:46,949 --> 00:48:48,958
- She sang at your wedding.
- Of course.

1496
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,259
I answered slowly on purpose.

1497
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:51,859
Let's go.

1498
00:48:51,889 --> 00:48:53,788
Sean. One, two,

1499
00:48:53,789 --> 00:48:54,989
- three.
- Jung Hye Young.

1500
00:48:55,289 --> 00:48:56,528
Good job.

1501
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:59,828
- We're doing great.
- Calm down.

1502
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:01,068
- Calm down. Focus.
- Well done.

1503
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:02,868
Hold on! Can I switch places?

1504
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:03,968
No.

1505
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:05,968
- Calm down.
- Seriously.

1506
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:07,239
You need to be serious.

1507
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:11,138
Kim Yu Na. One, two, three.

1508
00:49:11,139 --> 00:49:13,379
Ko... Ko Woo Ri.

1509
00:49:14,649 --> 00:49:15,819
Ko Woo Ri.

1510
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,678
- Ko Woo Ri.
- Wrong.

1511
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:18,679
(Jong Min is unbelievable.)

1512
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,989
It was such an easy one.

1513
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:24,589
(It's Ko Woo Rim, not Ko Woo Ri. Tteokgalbi with garlic is out.)

1514
00:49:24,689 --> 00:49:26,649
- Producer Park.
- Yong Han, take the tteokgalbi.

1515
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:28,958
I feel so bad for the members.

1516
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:32,098
Hey, you're in the camera team.

1517
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:33,169
(Upset)

1518
00:49:34,129 --> 00:49:36,268
We did very well.

1519
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:37,369
I feel so bad.

1520
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,138
(They won beef shank and mushroom hot pot with herbs...)

1521
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:42,579
(and steamed blue crabs after much struggle.)

1522
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:45,178
(And...)

1523
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:46,985
(for the chilly autumn, a special dish has been prepared.)

1524
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:48,848
(Thistle rice)

1525
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:50,918
- Let's eat first.
- What did they say?

1526
00:49:50,919 --> 00:49:52,489
- They'll do it in the middle.
- I see.

1527
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:54,789
Let's go.

1528
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:56,458
- Let's eat.
- Divide it.

1529
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:58,018
- I'll divide it evenly.
- That sounds good.

1530
00:49:58,019 --> 00:49:59,328
- Okay.
- You need to cut it.

1531
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,805
- Cut the mushrooms.
- Cut the mushrooms.

1532
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:02,729
I'll try it. It's thistle rice.

1533
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:04,228
Jong Min, that's...

1534
00:50:04,229 --> 00:50:06,268
beef shank and mushroom hot pot with herbs.

1535
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,299
Is it tasty?

1536
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:12,139
(The aroma of thistle spreads in his mouth.)

1537
00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:14,768
- It's so tasty.
- Is the thistle rice tasty?

1538
00:50:14,769 --> 00:50:16,339
The sauce is a work of art.

1539
00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:18,439
- The sauce is tasty.
- Yes.

1540
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:20,378
Thistle rice is really tasty.

1541
00:50:20,379 --> 00:50:21,499
I love the aroma of thistle.

1542
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,989
(Savory and fragrant thistle rice)

1543
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:27,988
This rice is so tasty.

1544
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:29,058
(Even the rice tastes amazing.)

1545
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,219
This rice is so tasty.

1546
00:50:30,289 --> 00:50:31,319
Thank you for the food.

1547
00:50:31,489 --> 00:50:33,188
- Enjoy it.
- I forgot to give you some.

1548
00:50:33,189 --> 00:50:34,729
- It's okay.
- Enjoy the food.

1549
00:50:35,529 --> 00:50:36,999
Jong Min, did you take some soup?

1550
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:39,568
The mushrooms are insane.

1551
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,369
The mushrooms...

1552
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:42,669
What should I call it?

1553
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:45,068
- The mushrooms' fragrance.
- The fragrance...

1554
00:50:45,069 --> 00:50:46,709
hits the nose.

1555
00:50:47,069 --> 00:50:48,139
It's an invigorating dish.

1556
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:50,108
- Seriously.
- It's a work of art.

1557
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:51,338
The taste is so clean.

1558
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:54,249
It's because of the napa cabbage. Because of it,

1559
00:50:54,449 --> 00:50:55,548
the taste is clean.

1560
00:50:55,549 --> 00:50:57,709
- The soup is to die for.
- The soup is a work of art.

1561
00:50:58,349 --> 00:50:59,718
The food wakes me up.

1562
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:02,149
(The taste of soup is a work of art.)

1563
00:51:03,489 --> 00:51:04,859
The meat is so tender.

1564
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:09,899
(Beef shank looks amazing next to the mushroom.)

1565
00:51:10,229 --> 00:51:11,429
Is this the sauce?

1566
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:12,868
(He dips the beef shank in soy sauce.)

1567
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,098
The vegetables are very tasty too.

1568
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:16,139
The taste of the vegetable broth...

1569
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:18,379
and the aroma of the mushrooms are great.

1570
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:21,338
- The meat is so tender.
- Yes, the meat is tasty.

1571
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:22,838
The chef has incredible skills.

1572
00:51:22,839 --> 00:51:23,959
(The tenderness is amazing.)

1573
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:25,379
I'll eat napa cabbage.

1574
00:51:25,479 --> 00:51:26,708
- Napa cabbage too.
- I love it.

1575
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,429
You get the aroma of the vegetable broth...

1576
00:51:28,849 --> 00:51:30,019
as well as mushrooms.

1577
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,888
This mushroom hot pot is one of the best dishes I've had...

1578
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,348
on 2 Days 1 Night.

1579
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:35,759
- Really?
- That's what I think.

1580
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:37,235
I think blue crabs are the tastiest.

1581
00:51:37,259 --> 00:51:38,458
- Blue crabs?
- Really?

1582
00:51:38,459 --> 00:51:39,789
There's so much meat.

1583
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:42,358
Most of the time, it's spicy.

1584
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:44,158
- Steamed blue crabs?
- But...

1585
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:46,598
it's so tasty without being spicy.

1586
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:47,599
(The taste is clean without being spicy.)

1587
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,200
- It's refreshing.
- The taste is clean.

1588
00:51:51,769 --> 00:51:53,108
He's eating with gusto.

1589
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,009
(Even the sound is delicious.)

1590
00:51:55,069 --> 00:51:56,939
The crabmeat is so soft.

1591
00:51:57,609 --> 00:52:00,048
The crabmeat is like a milkshake.

1592
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:01,489
- It disappears in the mouth.
- Yes.

1593
00:52:01,709 --> 00:52:03,029
Please give me more napa cabbage.

1594
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:05,918
Thank you. That's perfect.

1595
00:52:05,919 --> 00:52:06,948
The soup is tasty.

1596
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:08,088
(DinDin gives him a lot of food.)

1597
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:09,988
I'm sorry that I scolded you earlier.

1598
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:11,819
I'm sorry. I was no good.

1599
00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:13,488
I shouldn't have done that to a younger man at this age.

1600
00:52:13,489 --> 00:52:14,489
(No, I'm sorry.)

1601
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:15,959
I was... How should I say it?

1602
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,198
I had a bad headache.

1603
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:19,568
It happens when you concentrate.

1604
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,368
- It happens.
- So I didn't hear a sound.

1605
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:23,199
- We gave it our all.
- That's right.

1606
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:24,598
It was the most disappointing situation...

1607
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,809
in Season Four.

1608
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:28,845
- I had never seen such a thing...
- I'm sorry.

1609
00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:29,878
In the past six years.

1610
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:32,399
(They have a heart-warming dinner as they exchange nice words.)

1611
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,018
(Meanwhile, )

1612
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:39,219
(people outside are quite busy.)

1613
00:52:41,089 --> 00:52:43,119
(Practicing cheering)

1614
00:52:43,919 --> 00:52:45,588
(Why are the staff members excited?)

1615
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:46,689
Let's go!

1616
00:52:49,129 --> 00:52:51,598
(It's the perfect autumn day for an outdoor activity...)

1617
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,269
(although the sky has turned dark.)

1618
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,369
(Thus, everyone will enjoy the autumn excursion.)

1619
00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:01,509
- What's this?
- What?

1620
00:53:01,669 --> 00:53:02,939
- What?
- What?

1621
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:04,379
What?

1622
00:53:05,009 --> 00:53:06,009
Let's go.

1623
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:07,579
Let's go.

1624
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:10,979
(What's this?)

1625
00:53:11,249 --> 00:53:12,518
There you go.

1626
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:13,648
(The cheers are heated already.)

1627
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:14,749
All right.

1628
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:18,089
- Autumn excursion?
- What's the autumn excursion?

1629
00:53:18,459 --> 00:53:21,358
This is the perfect autumn night,

1630
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,398
- so we can't waste it.
- Of course not.

1631
00:53:23,399 --> 00:53:24,528
- Right.
- We can't waste it.

1632
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:25,828
- It's the perfect season.
- Yes.

1633
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:27,775
You have to come outside when the weather is nice.

1634
00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:29,439
For today's Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors,

1635
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:31,468
the members and the staff members...

1636
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:33,938
will have the One Heart Autumn Excursion.

1637
00:53:33,939 --> 00:53:35,069
That sounds great.

1638
00:53:35,669 --> 00:53:36,979
(Cheering)

1639
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:39,039
(Let's win.)

1640
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,649
Who are they rooting for?

1641
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:42,148
- All right.
- Us?

1642
00:53:42,149 --> 00:53:44,549
Will we team up with the staff members?

1643
00:53:44,749 --> 00:53:46,089
- That's right.
- What?

1644
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,348
Listen.

1645
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,465
(Will we team up with the staff members?)

1646
00:53:48,489 --> 00:53:51,188
For today's excursion, you'll have a 3-on-3 team competition...

1647
00:53:51,189 --> 00:53:53,189
that consists of three rounds.

1648
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:56,358
Currently, there are Team Choi Baek-core and...

1649
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:58,128
- Team Jong Cho Joon.
- Team Jong Cho Joon.

1650
00:53:58,129 --> 00:53:59,729
- Yes.
- Those are the two teams.

1651
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:02,969
We'll have a total of three rounds.

1652
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:06,039
- We're enough for them.
- Each time a team loses in a round,

1653
00:54:06,339 --> 00:54:08,639
you must choose one member who will sleep outdoors.

1654
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:09,978
- In the losing team?
- Yes.

1655
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:13,808
Every time your team loses, one member will sleep outdoors.

1656
00:54:13,809 --> 00:54:15,308
(The atmosphere suddenly turns into that of a survival show.)

1657
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:18,418
- The staff members will join you.
- Okay.

1658
00:54:18,419 --> 00:54:20,688
Then they should have a reward as well, right?

1659
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:21,689
Right.

1660
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,359
The staff members who are a part of the winning team...

1661
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,858
will receive fried chicken as a late-night snack...

1662
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:28,689
so that their autumn night will be plentiful.

1663
00:54:28,929 --> 00:54:30,058
- How about us?
- How about us?

1664
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:32,498
You'll work hard to sleep indoors.

1665
00:54:32,499 --> 00:54:34,268
(Cheering)

1666
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:35,568
- They love it.
- I'm sorry,

1667
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:37,299
but the sounds will get mixed up.

1668
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:39,738
They weren't cheering with the pureness of their hearts.

1669
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:40,739
(They were cheering for fried chicken.)

1670
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,169
Now,

1671
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:45,339
you'll pick the staff members who will join your team.

1672
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:48,249
We divided the staff members...

1673
00:54:48,949 --> 00:54:50,619
into six parts.

1674
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,688
So please pick one card per person.

1675
00:54:53,689 --> 00:54:55,419
Is there a dud?

1676
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:56,819
- Of course.
- No.

1677
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:58,189
One card per person?

1678
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:00,128
I'm sure you're curious about all the staff members.

1679
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:01,488
I don't think there are many good cards.

1680
00:55:01,489 --> 00:55:02,489
(Don't be disappointed after opening the card.)

1681
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,159
Let's start from this end.

1682
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,259
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1683
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,599
All right. I'll open it.

1684
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:09,339
All right. I'll announce the result.

1685
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,738
Team Production One. Producers and writers.

1686
00:55:11,739 --> 00:55:13,109
A round of applause.

1687
00:55:13,169 --> 00:55:14,169
That's good.

1688
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:15,309
Team Production One.

1689
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,478
(They command the shoot...)

1690
00:55:18,479 --> 00:55:20,779
(as the head of Team 2 Days 1 Night.)

1691
00:55:21,879 --> 00:55:24,419
(They have quick judgment and leadership.)

1692
00:55:24,849 --> 00:55:29,459
(They have good stamina to withstand the shoot of 2 Days 1 Night.)

1693
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:32,489
For your information, there are Team Production 1 and 2.

1694
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:35,029
Team Production One, let's go!

1695
00:55:35,629 --> 00:55:37,759
That's good.

1696
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:40,329
- I'll go next.
- Okay.

1697
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:43,499
The next one is Team Preparations and Lighting.

1698
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,199
- Okay.
- Lighting.

1699
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:46,369
It's a strong team.

1700
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:51,339
(They make sure the shoot goes smoothly.)

1701
00:55:51,909 --> 00:55:54,249
(Team Preparations is the pillar of Team 2 Days 1 Night.)

1702
00:55:56,279 --> 00:55:58,749
(They go anywhere the light is needed.)

1703
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,849
(Team Lighting is as fast as light.)

1704
00:56:02,019 --> 00:56:03,159
It's a strong team.

1705
00:56:03,419 --> 00:56:04,419
It's a strong team.

1706
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,589
(Reassured)

1707
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,858
I picked incredible people.

1708
00:56:09,859 --> 00:56:11,099
Which team is it?

1709
00:56:11,299 --> 00:56:14,199
- Team Security and Audio.
- Okay.

1710
00:56:14,769 --> 00:56:18,139
(They're in charge of dragging out the members by force.)

1711
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:22,009
(Team Security is the guardian of 2 Days 1 Night.)

1712
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:24,339
- Okay.
- No. Team Audio is weak.

1713
00:56:24,879 --> 00:56:25,908
(He brings down another team.)

1714
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:27,049
Team Audio is weak.

1715
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:29,449
(Speak for yourself.)

1716
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:31,879
Up next is Lim Cheol.

1717
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:33,349
I picked...

1718
00:56:34,149 --> 00:56:36,018
Team Camera Two.

1719
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:37,088
(Team Camera 2)

1720
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:38,889
Team Camera 1 and 2.

1721
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:40,588
- That's good.
- That's good.

1722
00:56:40,589 --> 00:56:42,059
Cameramen are strong.

1723
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:46,269
(Team Camera)

1724
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,409
(They're used to carrying things around.)

1725
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:58,139
(Team Camera does the stamina training every week.)

1726
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:01,709
(Team Camera is above average in any event.)

1727
00:57:01,879 --> 00:57:04,578
I picked Team Production Two.

1728
00:57:04,579 --> 00:57:06,318
- Team Production 2.
- Team Production 2.

1729
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:07,765
(Team Choi Baek-core: Camera 2, Camera 1, Production 2)

1730
00:57:07,789 --> 00:57:09,419
(Oh, no...)

1731
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:11,159
(Team Production 2)

1732
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,218
They look a bit weak.

1733
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:16,629
(They look shabby after Team Camera.)

1734
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:19,368
- Seriously.
- Look at the members.

1735
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:20,729
- I think we'll win easily.
- Yes.

1736
00:57:21,669 --> 00:57:25,239
(Does Team Production 2 look the weakest?)

1737
00:57:26,769 --> 00:57:27,909
There you go.

1738
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:32,279
A win by one full point.

1739
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:34,548
(Team Jong Cho Joon:)

1740
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:35,878
(Production 1, Preparations and Lighting. Security and Audio)

1741
00:57:35,879 --> 00:57:38,319
(Team Choi Baek-core: Camera 2, Camera 1, Production 2)

1742
00:57:38,419 --> 00:57:42,688
Now, please pick one member from each division...

1743
00:57:42,689 --> 00:57:45,689
- to enjoy the excursion together.
- One member?

1744
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:47,539
We don't know what the games will be.

1745
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,529
(The games are still a mystery.)

1746
00:57:49,729 --> 00:57:52,869
You need three people in total.

1747
00:57:52,929 --> 00:57:53,929
I pick Dong Hoon.

1748
00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:55,399
Cameraman Dong Hoon.

1749
00:57:56,499 --> 00:57:58,398
Dong Hoon, hand over the camera and join us.

1750
00:57:58,399 --> 00:57:59,485
(Team Choi Baek-core picks a cameraman from Team Camera.)

1751
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:00,809
I pick you.

1752
00:58:01,339 --> 00:58:03,378
But I...

1753
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:04,639
- Jimmy Jib.
- Hold on.

1754
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:06,649
Can no one operate the Jimmy Jib?

1755
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:08,578
- Hold on.
- I'll operate it then.

1756
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:10,019
Hold on.

1757
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,049
Raise your hand if you're strong.

1758
00:58:12,919 --> 00:58:14,548
Was anyone an athlete? Did anyone do judo?

1759
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:15,549
(We have a former athlete!)

1760
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:16,559
Did anyone play soccer?

1761
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:18,718
Come on out.

1762
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:21,289
(A strong woman suddenly appears.)

1763
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:23,998
(Meanwhile, Team Jong Cho Joon)

1764
00:58:23,999 --> 00:58:25,628
Geun Hee.

1765
00:58:25,629 --> 00:58:26,629
Will you do it?

1766
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,798
Geun Hee, let's do it.

1767
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:29,715
(They pick a writer who probably made the games.)

1768
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:31,639
Jae Hoon. Okay?

1769
00:58:32,539 --> 00:58:33,539
Okay.

1770
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,045
(Team Production's quick man, Jae Hoon)

1771
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:37,138
Where is Team Security?

1772
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:39,478
Here it is. Hello. Everyone is here.

1773
00:58:39,479 --> 00:58:40,608
(Team Jong Cho Joon picks a member of Team Security.)

1774
00:58:40,609 --> 00:58:42,608
Will you be okay? All right.

1775
00:58:42,609 --> 00:58:43,895
(They finish choosing the teammates.)

1776
00:58:43,919 --> 00:58:45,879
- Do it properly.
- Let's go.

1777
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:48,289
Jae Hoon, let's win. Let's eat fried chicken.

1778
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:51,189
- One, two, three.
- Let's go, Team Production Two.

1779
00:58:52,089 --> 00:58:54,028
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1780
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:56,429
(The competition will be fierce.)

1781
00:58:56,859 --> 00:58:58,198
(It's time to introduce the players of each team.)

1782
00:58:58,199 --> 00:58:59,475
Please introduce the players first.

1783
00:58:59,499 --> 00:59:02,269
When it comes to ideas...

1784
00:59:02,299 --> 00:59:03,439
and writing,

1785
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:05,139
she's the best.

1786
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:08,068
- Jang Geun Hee.
- Jang Geun Hee.

1787
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:10,509
(Writer of Team Production 1, Jang Geun Hee)

1788
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:12,679
(Seo Jang Hoon of 2 Days 1 Night, Giant Jang Geun Hee)

1789
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,008
Writer Jang Geun Hee.

1790
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,748
The next one is the master of preparations...

1791
00:59:16,749 --> 00:59:18,678
and the flying squirrel of 2 Days 1 Night,

1792
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:20,348
Kim Jae Hoon.

1793
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:21,989
(Team Preparations, Kim Jae Hoon)

1794
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:23,889
He's so fast.

1795
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:25,888
He's so fast.

1796
00:59:25,889 --> 00:59:27,858
He's in charge of everyone's safety...

1797
00:59:27,859 --> 00:59:30,398
when we film 2 Days 1 Night.

1798
00:59:30,399 --> 00:59:32,999
He's Security Son Hyun Woo.

1799
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:34,668
There we go.

1800
00:59:34,669 --> 00:59:35,829
(Team Security, Son Hyun Woo)

1801
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:38,769
All right. It's time to introduce...

1802
00:59:38,869 --> 00:59:41,969
the new members of Team Choi Baek-core.

1803
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:45,308
The Jimmy Jib operator, Yu Kyung Soo.

1804
00:59:45,309 --> 00:59:47,269
(Jimmy Jib operator of Team Camera, Yu Kyung Soo)

1805
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:49,619
(That Jimmy Jib is mine.)

1806
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:51,848
(Laughing)

1807
00:59:51,849 --> 00:59:54,688
He has the strength, power, as well as passion.

1808
00:59:54,689 --> 00:59:58,559
He's Cameraman Lim Dong Hoon.

1809
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:01,359
Let's go.

1810
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:03,698
The last one is someone great.

1811
01:00:03,699 --> 01:00:06,499
Is she a producer or a judoka?

1812
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,938
Shin Sung Eun!

1813
01:00:10,939 --> 01:00:12,909
(Producer of Team Production 2, Shin Sung Eun)

1814
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,969
(Fans of Producer Sung Eun)

1815
01:00:15,409 --> 01:00:16,578
She did judo in the past.

1816
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:17,815
(Producer Sung Eun has a master grade in judo.)

1817
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,339
(A master grade in judo?)

1818
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:23,118
Judoka Shin Sung Eun will show us a shoulder throw with DinDin.

1819
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,039
(She'll show them a shoulder throw with DinDin.)

1820
01:00:25,379 --> 01:00:27,948
Go ahead. A shoulder throw with DinDin.

1821
01:00:27,949 --> 01:00:30,258
- Excuse me?
- Take him down gently.

1822
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,658
- Come on.
- Let's begin.

1823
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:34,459
Let's see a shoulder throw.

1824
01:00:38,499 --> 01:00:39,499
It's good.

1825
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,099
How was it?

1826
01:00:41,869 --> 01:00:43,269
It was like an amusement park ride.

1827
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:46,308
- Before the competition begins, - Okay.

1828
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,308
Remember that the teammates may change in the next round.

1829
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:51,878
- That's right.
- The One Heart Autumn Excursion...

1830
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:54,249
for the late night snack, fried chicken, will begin now.

1831
01:00:55,449 --> 01:00:58,679
(Fried chicken is ours.)

1832
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:02,548
For the first round, we'll play a popular game for the excursion...

1833
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:04,619
- that tests the teamwork.
- Okay.

1834
01:01:05,319 --> 01:01:06,329
What is it?

1835
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,029
It's Group Tug of War.

1836
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,458
- Not bad.
- Not bad, but...

1837
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,729
Se Yoon is a bit strong, but...

1838
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:16,668
- Okay.
- Hey, we'll surely win.

1839
01:01:16,669 --> 01:01:17,798
(The opposing team has Moon Se Yoon.)

1840
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,709
But Seon Ho and DinDin are...

1841
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,239
as strong as Geun Hee.

1842
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:26,108
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

1843
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:27,548
Geun Hee is as strong as a man.

1844
01:01:27,549 --> 01:01:28,829
- Really?
- What are you saying?

1845
01:01:29,049 --> 01:01:30,148
She's practically a man.

1846
01:01:30,149 --> 01:01:31,278
(He corrects himself.)

1847
01:01:31,279 --> 01:01:32,949
Geun Hee is as strong as a man.

1848
01:01:33,849 --> 01:01:36,919
(Team Choi Baek-core receives the unfortunate news.)

1849
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:39,519
Let's strategize. What should we do?

1850
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:42,228
- When you have a tug of war, - It's better to lie down.

1851
01:01:42,229 --> 01:01:44,998
- you should lie down...
- You should lie down.

1852
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:46,158
And pull with your arms.

1853
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:48,228
When it begins, don't go, "1, 2."

1854
01:01:48,229 --> 01:01:51,469
- When it begins, just lie down.
- Okay.

1855
01:01:51,669 --> 01:01:52,868
It won't work.

1856
01:01:52,869 --> 01:01:54,569
- Right?
- Listen.

1857
01:01:54,709 --> 01:01:55,908
- Listen.
- One, two.

1858
01:01:55,909 --> 01:01:57,578
- Lie down.
- Listen.

1859
01:01:57,579 --> 01:01:59,078
Take a saddle stance and lie down.

1860
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:00,948
- Don't hold the rope like this.
- Hold it tight.

1861
01:02:00,949 --> 01:02:02,278
Take a saddle stance and lie down.

1862
01:02:02,279 --> 01:02:04,379
- One, two.
- There you go.

1863
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:06,348
(They have the same strategy.)

1864
01:02:06,349 --> 01:02:07,349
We'll pull this much.

1865
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,988
Pull it to the center, lie down,

1866
01:02:08,989 --> 01:02:10,358
and pull like this.

1867
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:11,419
Okay.

1868
01:02:12,089 --> 01:02:13,529
Seriously, this is...

1869
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:17,299
We're more than enough. It's because of that fatty.

1870
01:02:18,959 --> 01:02:19,968
That fatty.

1871
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,969
(Who will win the first match?)

1872
01:02:22,229 --> 01:02:23,568
Let's take position.

1873
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:25,139
(Both teams are ready for the game.)

1874
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:28,269
Are the cameras ready? It's a single-round match.

1875
01:02:28,709 --> 01:02:31,208
- Team Jong Cho Joon, let's go!
- Team Jong Cho Joon, let's go!

1876
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:32,309
Let's go!

1877
01:02:32,609 --> 01:02:35,209
- Team Choi Baek-core, let's go!
- Team Choi Baek-core, let's go!

1878
01:02:35,479 --> 01:02:36,679
Let's go!

1879
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:41,519
(This match will decide one person who'll sleep outdoors.)

1880
01:02:42,289 --> 01:02:45,289
(There's tension in the air.)

1881
01:02:45,419 --> 01:02:48,359
Get ready. Set...

1882
01:02:49,229 --> 01:02:50,258
(The match begins.)

1883
01:02:50,259 --> 01:02:50,402
Lie down!

1884
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:52,900
Get ready. Set...

1885
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,598
(The match begins.)

1886
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:57,099
Lie down!

1887
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:01,509
(Both teams are lying down as they've strategized.)

1888
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:04,478
Lie down!

1889
01:03:04,479 --> 01:03:06,849
(It's neck and neck.)

1890
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:11,479
(The rope is tight.)

1891
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:17,019
(With the teams in a close match, the cheering grows too.)

1892
01:03:18,759 --> 01:03:25,469
(They're all pulling with all their strength.)

1893
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,169
(That moment)

1894
01:03:28,399 --> 01:03:29,998
- Lie down.
- Lie down.

1895
01:03:29,999 --> 01:03:31,768
Don't fall down.

1896
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:34,709
(Team Choi Baek-core's members are slowly losing their strength.)

1897
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:37,939
(Team Choi Baek-core is in trouble.)

1898
01:03:38,109 --> 01:03:40,279
Don't fall down.

1899
01:03:40,309 --> 01:03:41,848
- Lie down.
- Lie down.

1900
01:03:41,849 --> 01:03:43,378
Don't fall down.

1901
01:03:43,379 --> 01:03:48,359
(Kyung Soo, the Jimmy Jib operator, is carrying the team.)

1902
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:51,259
(Team Security's Hyun Woo tries his best, but...)

1903
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,529
(They're getting dragged.)

1904
01:03:54,659 --> 01:03:56,858
(Putting in all his strength)

1905
01:03:56,859 --> 01:03:59,569
- It's coming.
- We won.

1906
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,869
It came over!

1907
01:04:02,169 --> 01:04:04,339
- Okay!
- Okay!

1908
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:06,469
- Okay!
- Okay!

1909
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:07,809
- Okay!
- We won!

1910
01:04:07,809 --> 01:04:08,809
They have to overlap.

1911
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:10,409
I did nothing but lie down.

1912
01:04:12,109 --> 01:04:13,178
It won't work.

1913
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:14,249
Okay!

1914
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:16,878
We have to lie down and stay like that.

1915
01:04:16,879 --> 01:04:18,589
Hyun Woo pulled with so much strength.

1916
01:04:19,249 --> 01:04:21,619
I saw it.

1917
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:24,165
After seeing that they were about to lose, Jong Min just stood.

1918
01:04:24,189 --> 01:04:25,729
He just said, "Watch out!"

1919
01:04:26,189 --> 01:04:27,289
No.

1920
01:04:28,089 --> 01:04:30,659
Jong Min was just standing?

1921
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:33,699
(He's the one who told them to lie down.)

1922
01:04:33,929 --> 01:04:36,269
No. I was holding my ground.

1923
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:39,269
(Standing still)

1924
01:04:39,739 --> 01:04:42,839
(His words and actions don't match.)

1925
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,638
The blue team wins the first round...

1926
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:45,648
They have to lose one person.

1927
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:46,949
- of tug-of-war.
- Thank you.

1928
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:48,248
Let's go!

1929
01:04:48,249 --> 01:04:50,419
(Team Choi Baek-core wins.)

1930
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:53,589
The orange team will have one member sleeping outdoors.

1931
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:55,858
- We'll decide the person later.
- Okay.

1932
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:58,118
Before we begin the second round,

1933
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:00,058
you need to add more team members.

1934
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:01,188
- More members?
- Yes.

1935
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,398
- Let's stay like this.
- We need to pick more?

1936
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:05,799
This time, each team needs five production team members...

1937
01:05:06,029 --> 01:05:08,268
who are quick-witted and quick.

1938
01:05:08,269 --> 01:05:10,469
- Okay.
- They have to be quick-witted?

1939
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:12,638
(Approaching)

1940
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:15,039
I think you know all about the games.

1941
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:17,039
You know all the answers, don't you?

1942
01:05:18,109 --> 01:05:19,779
You know all about the game.

1943
01:05:20,779 --> 01:05:21,978
You have to substitute me...

1944
01:05:21,979 --> 01:05:22,979
- in this game.
- Why?

1945
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,848
- We got this new equipment...
- You have to film us?

1946
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:26,588
- You have to film us?
- I have to do this.

1947
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,949
It's okay. Just stay here.

1948
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:31,618
- Then...
- It's new equipment we brought.

1949
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:33,858
You should leave after recommending a player.

1950
01:05:33,859 --> 01:05:35,899
- No.
- You can't leave so easily.

1951
01:05:36,229 --> 01:05:39,299
The new male producer.

1952
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:40,668
Okay.

1953
01:05:40,669 --> 01:05:41,938
(Team Jong Cho Joon decides to increase the strength stat.)

1954
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:44,739
Jo Young Jin!

1955
01:05:45,939 --> 01:05:48,068
- He does CrossFit.
- That's nice.

1956
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,779
He's also good at swimming.

1957
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:51,379
- He does sports.
- He's good.

1958
01:05:51,439 --> 01:05:52,509
Young Jin.

1959
01:05:52,649 --> 01:05:53,878
What's that? I thought this was about agility.

1960
01:05:53,879 --> 01:05:54,949
Why are they doing that?

1961
01:05:56,279 --> 01:05:58,419
(A large mat is spread out across the field.)

1962
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:00,588
(Both teams have added more members.)

1963
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,189
What is this?

1964
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:05,119
Okay!

1965
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:08,629
(Let's eat fried chicken!)

1966
01:06:09,029 --> 01:06:11,109
I'll give a brief introduction and start right away.

1967
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:12,898
(Team Audio's Han Sang Hoon, Team Preparations' Lee Byung Jin, )

1968
01:06:12,899 --> 01:06:14,575
(Team Production 1's Producer Jo Young Jin)

1969
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:17,045
(Team Production 2's Writer Kim Myung Kwan, Producer Lee Joon Woo)

1970
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:19,445
(Camera Engineer Seo Seung Hyun, Camera Operator Kim Tae Hoon)

1971
01:06:19,469 --> 01:06:22,109
- Let's beat them again!
- Let's do that!

1972
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:23,699
What is it going to be this time?

1973
01:06:24,209 --> 01:06:25,878
- I'll introduce the second round.
- What is it?

1974
01:06:25,879 --> 01:06:29,279
The second round is Color Board Flipping.

1975
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:32,919
In 100 seconds, the team that flips...

1976
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:34,918
more of the color boards with people inside...

1977
01:06:34,919 --> 01:06:37,159
to show their team's color on top wins.

1978
01:06:37,759 --> 01:06:39,929
The orange can flip them to be red,

1979
01:06:40,289 --> 01:06:42,029
and the blue team blue.

1980
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:45,129
Five members of each team will go inside the color board,

1981
01:06:45,429 --> 01:06:47,128
and three members will flip them.

1982
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:48,698
Three members have to flip them?

1983
01:06:48,699 --> 01:06:51,169
- Get ready.
- We got it.

1984
01:06:51,439 --> 01:06:53,038
Three strong members can be the ones flipping.

1985
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,269
- Right.
- We'll flip.

1986
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:55,939
Three people will be flipping?

1987
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:58,008
We have 100 seconds. We just have to last 100 seconds.

1988
01:06:58,009 --> 01:07:00,548
I think it's better if I lie down. I'm good at enduring.

1989
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:02,678
Those who are agile should flip. The strong and agile people.

1990
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:04,119
- These three...
- I...

1991
01:07:04,349 --> 01:07:05,688
- The three of us?
- The three.

1992
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:06,969
The rest can stay on the ground.

1993
01:07:07,049 --> 01:07:08,888
Okay. We'll stay flat.

1994
01:07:08,889 --> 01:07:10,118
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1995
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:12,059
You have 100 seconds!

1996
01:07:12,889 --> 01:07:14,889
Let's start. Get ready!

1997
01:07:15,929 --> 01:07:17,959
Go!

1998
01:07:18,669 --> 01:07:20,669
(The game starts.)

1999
01:07:20,899 --> 01:07:22,569
(Feeling nervous)

2000
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,408
(It took 1 second.)

2001
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:26,739
What is this?

2002
01:07:31,879 --> 01:07:34,179
(Team Jong Cho Joon quickly flips the boards.)

2003
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:36,849
(Lifting)

2004
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,688
- He flipped.
- Hurry!

2005
01:07:38,689 --> 01:07:40,349
There's Jong Min behind you.

2006
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:43,019
(Lifting with one hand)

2007
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,459
There's Jong Min.

2008
01:07:45,589 --> 01:07:46,958
(Color boards, Red: 5, Blue: 5)

2009
01:07:46,959 --> 01:07:48,399
(It's a close match from the start.)

2010
01:07:48,489 --> 01:07:51,729
(It's interesting.)

2011
01:07:51,969 --> 01:07:53,929
(Joon quickly flips the boards.)

2012
01:07:54,169 --> 01:07:55,969
(We can't lose 2 times in a row.)

2013
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:00,169
(Rushing)

2014
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:02,779
(Using his strength)

2015
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:06,779
(He flips the color boards nonstop.)

2016
01:08:07,409 --> 01:08:09,749
(Team Jong Cho Joon takes the lead.)

2017
01:08:09,979 --> 01:08:11,279
You have to hurry!

2018
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:13,688
(Getting out of breath)

2019
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:14,989
(He seems to be getting tired.)

2020
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:16,489
(He found Jong Min.)

2021
01:08:16,489 --> 01:08:17,489
It's no joke.

2022
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:18,930
(He desperately tries to stay flat.)

2023
01:08:19,189 --> 01:08:20,788
You have to hurry!

2024
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:22,235
(He gives up on the good prey because he's tired.)

2025
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:24,299
(Producer Seung Hyun approaches Jong Min.)

2026
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,369
(Try to flip me if you can.)

2027
01:08:28,269 --> 01:08:30,239
(Lifting)

2028
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:32,409
He's really strong. Flip me back.

2029
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,939
(Overflowing power and stamina)

2030
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:38,439
Lift.

2031
01:08:42,019 --> 01:08:43,878
Okay. Hurry up!

2032
01:08:43,879 --> 01:08:45,889
The last 30 seconds!

2033
01:08:46,519 --> 01:08:49,359
You have to hurry!

2034
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:52,729
(There's a fierce battle.)

2035
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:56,599
(What would be the result?)

2036
01:08:57,159 --> 01:08:58,998
- Five, four...
- Help me.

2037
01:08:58,999 --> 01:09:00,268
- Help me.
- Lift him.

2038
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,099
- two, one.
- Turn.

2039
01:09:02,369 --> 01:09:03,438
(The game ends.)

2040
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,439
Stop!

2041
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:05,868
- Are you tired?
- Just don't tie.

2042
01:09:05,869 --> 01:09:06,939
I'm about to die.

2043
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,129
- I don't want it to be a tie.
- I'm tired.

2044
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:10,639
I'm really tired.

2045
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,379
I think we won.

2046
01:09:12,809 --> 01:09:15,078
- Please don't be a tie.
- Don't be a tie.

2047
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:16,549
I'm so tired.

2048
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,818
- Don't be a tie.
- We won.

2049
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:19,919
I'm red.

2050
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:22,989
That's blue.

2051
01:09:23,089 --> 01:09:24,919
That's blue.

2052
01:09:25,289 --> 01:09:26,589
This is red.

2053
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:28,088
It's red.

2054
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:29,159
Blue!

2055
01:09:29,459 --> 01:09:30,828
As for the audio producer's board,

2056
01:09:30,829 --> 01:09:33,099
it's half-half, so it doesn't count.

2057
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:34,268
- So?
- Is it a tie?

2058
01:09:34,269 --> 01:09:35,769
- Blue has five.
- Okay.

2059
01:09:35,869 --> 01:09:37,668
- Red has four.
- Okay!

2060
01:09:37,669 --> 01:09:38,868
The blue team wins!

2061
01:09:38,869 --> 01:09:40,109
- Okay!
- Nice.

2062
01:09:40,339 --> 01:09:42,008
- Nice.
- Nice. Blue!

2063
01:09:42,009 --> 01:09:43,938
- Blue! Nice.
- Okay.

2064
01:09:43,939 --> 01:09:45,679
- Nice.
- Okay.

2065
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:49,649
(Our team is the best.)

2066
01:09:49,779 --> 01:09:51,448
Well done.

2067
01:09:51,449 --> 01:09:52,649
Nice, Team Blue!

2068
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:55,519
- Well done.
- This is so tiresome.

2069
01:09:56,219 --> 01:09:58,559
Goodness. It's so tiring.

2070
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:02,059
You're left with one more round.

2071
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:04,059
Please prepare for the next game.

2072
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,969
(Cones are placed around the field.)

2073
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,399
Is it a relay race?

2074
01:10:10,869 --> 01:10:12,538
The final third round...

2075
01:10:12,539 --> 01:10:14,508
of One Heart Autumn Excursion...

2076
01:10:14,509 --> 01:10:16,439
is Obstacle Relay Race.

2077
01:10:17,109 --> 01:10:19,208
The first runners will wear a vest...

2078
01:10:19,209 --> 01:10:22,678
connecting two people back-to-back,

2079
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:24,348
run half a lap,

2080
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:26,388
pass under the paint limbo,

2081
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,919
and then hand off the baton.

2082
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:31,418
The second runners will run half a lap in a four-legged race.

2083
01:10:31,419 --> 01:10:34,128
Everyone must eat the snacks hanging from the pull-up bar...

2084
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:36,299
before they can pass the baton.

2085
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,198
From the third runner onward,

2086
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:39,899
you will run one full lap.

2087
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,928
- Without doing anything?
- At full speed.

2088
01:10:41,929 --> 01:10:44,798
Then, the fourth and last runner...

2089
01:10:44,799 --> 01:10:47,839
will get the baton, and run a full lap.

2090
01:10:47,939 --> 01:10:51,008
The first person to cross the finish line wins.

2091
01:10:51,009 --> 01:10:52,925
(The team of the person who crosses the finish line first wins.)

2092
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:55,049
(Each team starts selecting their runners.)

2093
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,649
- You run well, don't you?
- I don't.

2094
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:59,349
I haven't run in a long time.

2095
01:10:59,749 --> 01:11:01,118
Do you want to race with me?

2096
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,688
Here?

2097
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:05,089
(They suddenly start the internal tryouts.)

2098
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:07,829
(They're about the same.)

2099
01:11:07,929 --> 01:11:09,829
- We're similar.
- Watch me.

2100
01:11:10,259 --> 01:11:12,168
(Running)

2101
01:11:12,169 --> 01:11:13,399
Sae Ho is fast.

2102
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:16,099
- Should I go?
- Go last. You're faster than us.

2103
01:11:16,139 --> 01:11:17,139
The third runner.

2104
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,968
Which of you is faster?

2105
01:11:18,969 --> 01:11:20,638
I want to be the third runner.

2106
01:11:20,639 --> 01:11:21,668
- The last one?
- Yes.

2107
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:22,878
That would be better. He'd be fast.

2108
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,938
I'm Lim Hyun Wook.

2109
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:25,478
- Hyun Wook.
- I'm in Team Production.

2110
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:27,109
Our runners are fast.

2111
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:29,978
- Dong Hoon...
- At full speed.

2112
01:11:29,979 --> 01:11:32,388
Dong Hoon and Seon Ho can run.

2113
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:34,588
Seon Ho can run last,

2114
01:11:34,589 --> 01:11:35,935
- and I'll...
- We have to run two laps?

2115
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,689
I run 100m in 12.9 seconds.

2116
01:11:38,019 --> 01:11:39,459
Okay.

2117
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:41,729
- Good.
- I feel reassured.

2118
01:11:41,829 --> 01:11:43,099
Let's win all the rounds.

2119
01:11:43,259 --> 01:11:45,129
This is the third and final round!

2120
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,429
Let's begin.

2121
01:11:46,499 --> 01:11:49,768
(Let's go!)

2122
01:11:49,769 --> 01:11:51,669
- Let's go, Team Jong Cho Joon!
- Let's go!

2123
01:11:51,769 --> 01:11:53,209
Okay. Let's go!

2124
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:55,168
- Let's go!
- On your mark,

2125
01:11:55,169 --> 01:11:57,455
(If Team Jong Cho Joon loses here, the whole team will sleep outdoors.)

2126
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:00,449
(If Team Choi Baek-core wins, the whole team will sleep indoors.)

2127
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:01,979
- Let's go!
- get set...

2128
01:12:02,749 --> 01:12:03,849
- Okay.
- Go.

2129
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:08,489
(The 1st runners of each team start running.)

2130
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:13,788
(They run really quickly.)

2131
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:16,999
It's okay.

2132
01:12:17,029 --> 01:12:18,358
- They're fast.
- Turn.

2133
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:19,445
(They reach the limbo almost at the same time.)

2134
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:20,498
Turn.

2135
01:12:20,499 --> 01:12:22,199
(They attempt going through the limbo.)

2136
01:12:22,599 --> 01:12:24,298
(Struggling)

2137
01:12:24,299 --> 01:12:25,569
(Going backward)

2138
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:27,969
(It's not so easy.)

2139
01:12:28,739 --> 01:12:30,809
(On the other hand, they boldly move forward.)

2140
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:36,879
(They go through it in one go.)

2141
01:12:38,519 --> 01:12:39,549
What are you doing?

2142
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,248
- They're fast.
- Slow down.

2143
01:12:41,249 --> 01:12:42,289
Hurry up!

2144
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:44,289
(Joon is amazing.)

2145
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:48,659
(He's still struggling because of his weak legs.)

2146
01:12:49,329 --> 01:12:52,769
(They finally go through it and quickly follow them.)

2147
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:53,869
Take it.

2148
01:12:54,499 --> 01:12:55,668
- Let's go.
- Go.

2149
01:12:55,669 --> 01:12:57,068
- One, two.
- One, two.

2150
01:12:57,069 --> 01:12:59,909
(The 2nd runners of Team Jong Cho Joon start.)

2151
01:13:02,069 --> 01:13:04,439
Go! One, two.

2152
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:07,409
(Quickly chasing after them)

2153
01:13:07,579 --> 01:13:09,699
(There isn't that much of a difference between them.)

2154
01:13:09,879 --> 01:13:12,319
(Team Jong Cho Joon reaches the snack-eating spot.)

2155
01:13:12,519 --> 01:13:14,248
(All 3 must eat the snack to pass.)

2156
01:13:14,249 --> 01:13:15,689
(One member eats it.)

2157
01:13:15,889 --> 01:13:17,789
(Team Choi Baek-core arrives as well.)

2158
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:19,228
I ate it.

2159
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:20,229
(Two members make it.)

2160
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,429
Did you eat it? One, two, three.

2161
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:24,729
- To the right. Go!
- Go!

2162
01:13:24,999 --> 01:13:26,769
(Using all his might)

2163
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:29,145
(They get flustered by the snack that's a bit too high up.)

2164
01:13:29,169 --> 01:13:30,169
Two, three.

2165
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,509
Nice one.

2166
01:13:32,569 --> 01:13:34,569
(He's very close.)

2167
01:13:35,809 --> 01:13:37,279
- To the right. Go!
- Go!

2168
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:38,578
(Both teams have 1 member left.)

2169
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:40,248
You just ate one.

2170
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,209
(Be quick, Jong Min!)

2171
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:43,778
You'll get it.

2172
01:13:43,779 --> 01:13:45,119
(He's very close.)

2173
01:13:45,949 --> 01:13:47,688
There we go. Start.

2174
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,018
One, two.

2175
01:13:49,019 --> 01:13:52,159
(They head toward the 3rd runner before the other team.)

2176
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:54,029
Lift him up.

2177
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:56,575
(Team Choi Baek-core decides to lift up a member as well.)

2178
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,199
(He's very close.)

2179
01:13:58,799 --> 01:14:00,728
(They finally made it.)

2180
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:02,068
- We did it!
- Let's go.

2181
01:14:02,069 --> 01:14:03,169
- One, two.
- One, two.

2182
01:14:05,969 --> 01:14:08,769
- One, two. Go!
- One, two.

2183
01:14:09,139 --> 01:14:10,408
Gosh, he's so fast.

2184
01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:13,079
(He runs at an intense speed.)

2185
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,218
(They are certain about their win.)

2186
01:14:16,219 --> 01:14:17,378
We did it. One, two.

2187
01:14:17,379 --> 01:14:20,149
(He outruns them in a flash.)

2188
01:14:20,219 --> 01:14:21,219
(Zooming past)

2189
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:23,619
(What just went by?)

2190
01:14:23,819 --> 01:14:25,979
(Sae Ho sets off as Team Jong Cho Joon's last runner.)

2191
01:14:26,389 --> 01:14:27,788
(Dong Hoon sets off as well for Team Choi Baek-core.)

2192
01:14:27,789 --> 01:14:28,959
Sae Ho!

2193
01:14:29,429 --> 01:14:30,529
Leave him.

2194
01:14:31,029 --> 01:14:32,728
Run until the end!

2195
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:34,769
(He does his best even though the race is decided.)

2196
01:14:38,299 --> 01:14:41,509
(Sae Ho comes in first by a massive difference.)

2197
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:43,838
- We won!
- We won!

2198
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,678
- Well done!
- Gosh.

2199
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:48,248
- Gosh.
- We made no mistakes.

2200
01:14:48,249 --> 01:14:50,178
Gosh, it was perfect.

2201
01:14:50,179 --> 01:14:51,478
- We did really well.
- We did well.

2202
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:53,949
That was insane. We were like the Dream Team.

2203
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,658
- Great work. What's with your face?
- You feel dispirited, don't you?

2204
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,229
- What's with your face?
- Great job, Hyun Jin.

2205
01:14:59,289 --> 01:15:01,888
For Round Three, the Obstacle Relay Race,

2206
01:15:01,889 --> 01:15:03,698
the orange team takes the win.

2207
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,429
(Team Jong Cho Joon wins.)

2208
01:15:05,729 --> 01:15:07,368
Let's go!

2209
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:08,398
(We still got a point.)

2210
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:10,738
This is the final result for One Heart Autumn Excursion.

2211
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,908
The blue team wins by 2 to 1.

2212
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:14,968
Yes!

2213
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:16,655
(Team Choi Baek-core is the final winner by 2 to 1.)

2214
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:19,448
- Just to the winning staff, - Fried chicken.

2215
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:20,948
Fried chicken will be provided as a late-night snack.

2216
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,308
(The Team Choi Baek-core members will be given fried chicken.)

2217
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:23,749
(We're getting fried chicken!)

2218
01:15:23,879 --> 01:15:26,289
(Disappointed)

2219
01:15:26,619 --> 01:15:28,248
Thank you.

2220
01:15:28,249 --> 01:15:31,959
(The winning team members enjoyed the fried chicken together.)

2221
01:15:32,119 --> 01:15:34,188
And there's something we have to clear up.

2222
01:15:34,189 --> 01:15:35,858
You were all told that...

2223
01:15:35,859 --> 01:15:38,398
each round lost will set a member to sleep outdoors.

2224
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:40,428
Two members from the orange team...

2225
01:15:40,429 --> 01:15:43,138
and one member from the blue team.

2226
01:15:43,139 --> 01:15:45,598
We will decide on who will sleep outdoors.

2227
01:15:45,599 --> 01:15:46,968
Let's begin with the orange team.

2228
01:15:46,969 --> 01:15:48,538
There are two people who have to sleep outdoors.

2229
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:50,708
Are those what we have to draw?

2230
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:51,778
Yes.

2231
01:15:51,779 --> 01:15:53,419
- We have to pick one each.
- Don't look!

2232
01:15:53,709 --> 01:15:55,649
What? What was that?

2233
01:15:55,779 --> 01:15:56,818
I have no idea as well.

2234
01:15:56,819 --> 01:15:58,448
How does this work?

2235
01:15:58,449 --> 01:16:00,048
One person will pick the one that says "sleep indoors."

2236
01:16:00,049 --> 01:16:01,889
- I see.
- I'll go first.

2237
01:16:02,519 --> 01:16:04,589
One, two, three!

2238
01:16:05,419 --> 01:16:06,729
I have a good feeling, Sae Ho.

2239
01:16:07,459 --> 01:16:08,489
Three! Go!

2240
01:16:08,529 --> 01:16:12,299
(Sae Ho will sleep outdoors.)

2241
01:16:12,629 --> 01:16:16,199
(Okay. There's a chance.)

2242
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:19,569
(He loses it by the shock.)

2243
01:16:20,439 --> 01:16:22,839
- Will you two open it together?
- We will open it together.

2244
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:25,408
Who was the one that picked the one that was left?

2245
01:16:25,409 --> 01:16:26,409
Will you switch?

2246
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:27,948
- Will you switch?
- I won't make a switch.

2247
01:16:27,949 --> 01:16:29,378
Aren't variety shows all about making switches?

2248
01:16:29,379 --> 01:16:31,048
But I don't want to make a switch.

2249
01:16:31,049 --> 01:16:32,488
It's a variety show!

2250
01:16:32,489 --> 01:16:34,449
I already saw what's inside. Why make the switch?

2251
01:16:35,389 --> 01:16:37,518
What? No way!

2252
01:16:37,519 --> 01:16:39,888
One, two, three!

2253
01:16:39,889 --> 01:16:40,889
Are you serious?

2254
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:41,929
- What?
- What?

2255
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:45,429
(He will sleep outdoors.)

2256
01:16:45,499 --> 01:16:46,539
- I read it wrong.
- What?

2257
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,568
How did you read it wrong?

2258
01:16:48,569 --> 01:16:50,368
- Did you only see "sleep?"
- Yes.

2259
01:16:50,369 --> 01:16:51,439
- Is that so?
- What?

2260
01:16:51,939 --> 01:16:53,538
- I read it wrong.
- Why?

2261
01:16:53,539 --> 01:16:55,538
He read it wrong!

2262
01:16:55,539 --> 01:16:56,708
I only saw "sleep."

2263
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:57,709
How do you read that wrong?

2264
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:59,055
- What was that?
- It was like this.

2265
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:01,609
"Make the change in variety shows when you are told to."

2266
01:17:01,879 --> 01:17:03,078
Jong Min learned a lesson.

2267
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:04,549
- He read it wrong.
- Right.

2268
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:05,618
Unbelievable.

2269
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:07,118
Kim Jong Min and Cho Sae Ho,

2270
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:08,419
you two will sleep outdoors.

2271
01:17:08,549 --> 01:17:09,818
Gosh, Joon is sleeping indoors again.

2272
01:17:09,819 --> 01:17:10,888
(Joon will sleep indoors.)

2273
01:17:10,889 --> 01:17:13,828
- It's one person for the blue team.
- Right.

2274
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:14,958
You younger ones should choose first.

2275
01:17:14,959 --> 01:17:16,599
I will sleep outdoors.

2276
01:17:17,129 --> 01:17:18,158
Make your choice.

2277
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:19,168
(They carefully choose one each.)

2278
01:17:19,169 --> 01:17:20,768
- I got the leftover one.
- I didn't open it.

2279
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:21,799
- Same here.
- Same here.

2280
01:17:22,129 --> 01:17:23,969
- I didn't open it.
- Same here.

2281
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,398
Should we open them all at the same time?

2282
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:26,868
- Let's do that.
- All three of us?

2283
01:17:26,869 --> 01:17:28,008
Don't feel bad for the one that sleeps outside.

2284
01:17:28,009 --> 01:17:29,338
- Okay.
- I won't feel that way.

2285
01:17:29,339 --> 01:17:31,439
One, two, three!

2286
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:33,748
- Okay!
- What?

2287
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:34,809
- Gosh!
- What?

2288
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,778
(Se Yoon will sleep outdoors.)

2289
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,148
Oh, come on.

2290
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:41,418
You said you were going to sleep outdoors.

2291
01:17:41,419 --> 01:17:43,718
It was a lie!

2292
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:44,889
It was just a lie!

2293
01:17:45,159 --> 01:17:47,159
- Nice one.
- Nice.

2294
01:17:47,589 --> 01:17:49,458
- So as a result, - Gosh, that's the worst.

2295
01:17:49,459 --> 01:17:51,628
Jong Min, Sae Ho, and Se Yoon...

2296
01:17:51,629 --> 01:17:52,928
- will sleep outdoors.
- Hold on.

2297
01:17:52,929 --> 01:17:54,429
Joon has something to say.

2298
01:17:54,499 --> 01:17:56,499
- He has to hike without much sleep.
- Right.

2299
01:17:56,599 --> 01:17:58,838
I'll sleep outdoors instead for you.

2300
01:17:58,839 --> 01:18:00,508
This was mentioned before.

2301
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,209
While he's asleep,

2302
01:18:02,439 --> 01:18:03,838
he doesn't like hearing another member rustling around...

2303
01:18:03,839 --> 01:18:05,678
to go for a hike in the morning.

2304
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,439
- Joon said that?
- He said that he would...

2305
01:18:07,509 --> 01:18:10,218
rather sleep soundly outside.

2306
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:11,248
Is there no condition though?

2307
01:18:11,249 --> 01:18:12,518
- There will be no condition.
- No.

2308
01:18:12,519 --> 01:18:15,289
- We went to Mount Halla before.
- Right.

2309
01:18:15,619 --> 01:18:17,288
I almost died. It was really tough.

2310
01:18:17,289 --> 01:18:18,969
You'll be hiking a tough mountain as well.

2311
01:18:19,159 --> 01:18:21,158
You all will suffer tomorrow.

2312
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,398
- We'll especially let that happen.
- What a great heart.

2313
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:25,968
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

2314
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:28,068
We'll see you all in the morning tomorrow.

2315
01:18:28,069 --> 01:18:31,398
(Bedtime has come after a big struggle.)

2316
01:18:31,399 --> 01:18:33,509
- What time is it?
- It's 1:32am.

2317
01:18:33,839 --> 01:18:36,278
Gosh, we have to get up at 5:30am?

2318
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:37,778
We have to be ready by 6am.

2319
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:39,179
Get up at 6am?

2320
01:18:39,349 --> 01:18:40,749
We have to be ready by 6am.

2321
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:44,579
(I don't want to go hiking.)

2322
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:47,148
I've never lost so miserably like this before.

2323
01:18:47,149 --> 01:18:49,048
- Right.
- That never happened recently.

2324
01:18:49,049 --> 01:18:50,688
It's my first time seeing you lose like that.

2325
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:52,689
- Helicopter!
- It's a peach!

2326
01:18:52,889 --> 01:18:54,129
(He lost Round 1.)

2327
01:18:54,189 --> 01:18:55,259
Okay!

2328
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:57,299
(He failed to win lunch.)

2329
01:18:57,359 --> 01:18:58,959
Team Jong Min has won.

2330
01:18:59,059 --> 01:19:00,569
(He had to go hiking.)

2331
01:19:02,899 --> 01:19:04,539
I learned this.

2332
01:19:04,999 --> 01:19:07,069
You can't try to be in season.

2333
01:19:07,569 --> 01:19:10,778
The right season will come as you're living life.

2334
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:13,509
If you force yourself to be in season,

2335
01:19:13,779 --> 01:19:15,548
- nothing will work out.
- Right.

2336
01:19:15,549 --> 01:19:18,148
The right season will find you.

2337
01:19:18,149 --> 01:19:20,618
- Right.
- We have to enjoy that.

2338
01:19:20,619 --> 01:19:23,018
- Right.
- If you force yourself,

2339
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:25,019
- this is how you end up.
- Right.

2340
01:19:25,819 --> 01:19:26,889
Look at me.

2341
01:19:27,059 --> 01:19:28,758
I just lived life as it is.

2342
01:19:28,759 --> 01:19:30,135
(DinDin, turns out to be a thoughtful celebrity)

2343
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,658
(Not interested)

2344
01:19:31,659 --> 01:19:33,699
- I'll end it here.
- You should change now.

2345
01:19:34,929 --> 01:19:38,238
(Team Choi Baek-core goes to sleep for their hike.)

2346
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,668
- It's okay.
- Isn't it a bit too small?

2347
01:19:39,669 --> 01:19:41,068
Even still,

2348
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:42,468
- I'll try to go inside.
- it'll be fine for tonight.

2349
01:19:42,469 --> 01:19:44,678
While being on 2 Days 1 Night,

2350
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:45,778
it's the first time for the three of us to be together.

2351
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:46,848
- Right.
- Right.

2352
01:19:46,849 --> 01:19:48,308
I love this group though.

2353
01:19:48,309 --> 01:19:49,918
- It's a nice group.
- Right?

2354
01:19:49,919 --> 01:19:50,978
We've been great together.

2355
01:19:50,979 --> 01:19:52,659
Team Jong Cho Joon is surely a great team.

2356
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:54,018
- Why though?
- We have great teamwork.

2357
01:19:54,019 --> 01:19:55,419
This is what I think.

2358
01:19:55,449 --> 01:19:57,688
- We each have our own strengths.
- Right.

2359
01:19:57,689 --> 01:19:59,929
The best of our strengths...

2360
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:01,528
- were brought out well.
- Right.

2361
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:02,898
We won the most important one.

2362
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:04,358
We just have to wake up...

2363
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:05,928
- and enjoy our meal.
- Right.

2364
01:20:05,929 --> 01:20:07,998
- Let us sleep.
- Right.

2365
01:20:07,999 --> 01:20:10,599
(Team Jong Cho Joon falls asleep while thinking about their win.)

2366
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:13,639
(After spending a fall day in season...)

2367
01:20:18,139 --> 01:20:20,709
(The 3 members of the Mount Worak hike are still asleep.)

2368
01:20:23,379 --> 01:20:26,289
(The human alarm arrives to wake them up.)

2369
01:20:26,419 --> 01:20:28,819
We will get ready to set off now.

2370
01:20:29,819 --> 01:20:31,389
I'm hungry.

2371
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:35,888
You will get some gimbap in the car.

2372
01:20:35,889 --> 01:20:37,299
- Really?
- Yes.

2373
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,969
- You can't hike feeling hungry.
- Right.

2374
01:20:42,269 --> 01:20:44,368
(Let's move quickly as we'll have to go anyway.)

2375
01:20:44,369 --> 01:20:45,439
Gosh, my back.

2376
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,308
(They head to Mount Worak when it's still dark.)

2377
01:20:48,309 --> 01:20:49,609
Good dawn.

2378
01:20:50,339 --> 01:20:53,949
(They head there while having some gimbap.)

2379
01:20:54,849 --> 01:20:57,369
If we're given trekking poles, it means it's going to be tough.

2380
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:01,089
(These fellows keep getting their attention.)

2381
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:02,959
What was the name of the mountain again?

2382
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:10,029
(Mount Worak)

2383
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:13,069
(Altitude above sea level, 1,097m)

2384
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:16,438
It's quite a difficult course with a steep trail.

2385
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:17,999
(A difficult course with a steep trail)

2386
01:21:18,369 --> 01:21:20,068
This person says it lives up to its name...

2387
01:21:20,069 --> 01:21:21,809
with its rough and delicate trail.

2388
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:23,969
It's known to be a tough mountain.

2389
01:21:24,609 --> 01:21:26,548
The trail is delicate,

2390
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:28,779
so it's hard to pick up the pace while coming down.

2391
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:30,578
We're up for the worst.

2392
01:21:30,579 --> 01:21:32,149
Can we not learn teleportation?

2393
01:21:32,349 --> 01:21:33,889
It does look tough.

2394
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:37,618
But why must we hike?

2395
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:39,529
(The sky brightens up as they shake in fear.)

2396
01:21:40,129 --> 01:21:42,729
We will be heading to Akeo Peak of Mount Worak.

2397
01:21:42,999 --> 01:21:44,029
Akeo Peak.

2398
01:21:44,799 --> 01:21:46,028
Let's go.

2399
01:21:46,029 --> 01:21:47,229
(Let's go to Akeo Peak.)

2400
01:21:48,829 --> 01:21:50,698
So this is Crocodile Overpass.

2401
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:51,899
(Course 1, Crocodile Overpass)

2402
01:21:52,299 --> 01:21:55,809
We're going into the crocodile's mouth.

2403
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,649
(This is the start of the hike.)

2404
01:22:01,409 --> 01:22:03,019
I already feel exhausted.

2405
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:06,189
(It hasn't even been 1 minute.)

2406
01:22:07,549 --> 01:22:10,089
(A staircase unfolds after crossing the overpass.)

2407
01:22:11,989 --> 01:22:13,028
This is exhausting.

2408
01:22:13,029 --> 01:22:16,599
(His terrible stamina gets revealed after only just a while.)

2409
01:22:17,459 --> 01:22:18,499
Hold on.

2410
01:22:18,699 --> 01:22:19,729
Have we arrived?

2411
01:22:20,499 --> 01:22:21,598
(Do you really think so?)

2412
01:22:21,599 --> 01:22:24,069
- We're at the top.
- All right, everyone.

2413
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:25,268
- Gosh.
- What?

2414
01:22:25,269 --> 01:22:27,568
The trail to Akeo Peak is quite steep and tight.

2415
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:28,608
What?

2416
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:30,778
A chance for one person to go back down will be given.

2417
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,039
(One person will go back down.)

2418
01:22:33,209 --> 01:22:34,948
Are you going to be like that? Guys, we should stick together!

2419
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:37,249
- How?
- Let's make it quick.

2420
01:22:37,879 --> 01:22:38,948
Since we'll be heading to Akeo Peak,

2421
01:22:38,949 --> 01:22:40,019
The Crocodile Game?

2422
01:22:40,219 --> 01:22:42,539
Just one person who doesn't get bitten by the crocodile...

2423
01:22:42,819 --> 01:22:44,099
will head back to the base camp.

2424
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:48,688
I see. So that's how it is.

2425
01:22:48,689 --> 01:22:50,729
- All right.
- Desperation will reward you.

2426
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:53,168
- I was always desperate.
- Younger ones.

2427
01:22:53,169 --> 01:22:54,228
Let's decide on the order.

2428
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:56,198
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2429
01:22:56,199 --> 01:22:57,539
(Seon Ho, DinDin, Se Yoon)

2430
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,338
Gosh, I'm scared.

2431
01:22:59,339 --> 01:23:00,538
(It starts with Seon Ho.)

2432
01:23:00,539 --> 01:23:01,899
You never get caught at the start.

2433
01:23:03,409 --> 01:23:06,138
(The crocodile has 12 teeth.)

2434
01:23:06,139 --> 01:23:09,009
(Only one of them makes the crocodile close its mouth.)

2435
01:23:09,349 --> 01:23:10,789
It won't close on the first attempt.

2436
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:14,519
(One shot, one kill)

2437
01:23:16,049 --> 01:23:18,689
(How is this possible?)

2438
01:23:18,819 --> 01:23:19,958
What?

2439
01:23:19,959 --> 01:23:21,359
(What's with him?)

2440
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:24,498
(Monkey DinDin is happy.)

2441
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:26,399
What is going on?

2442
01:23:26,529 --> 01:23:27,798
- Seon Ho is going.
- That can't be true.

2443
01:23:27,799 --> 01:23:29,699
- Is that it?
- It must be a lie.

2444
01:23:29,899 --> 01:23:32,908
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho, this is unbelievable.

2445
01:23:32,909 --> 01:23:34,168
How unlucky you are.

2446
01:23:34,169 --> 01:23:36,379
You're destined to go today.

2447
01:23:36,839 --> 01:23:38,638
- By the way...
- Hurry and do it.

2448
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,448
If you could choose, who would you like to go with?

2449
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:41,578
The grouchy or the fatty?

2450
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:43,919
- I want to go with the fatty.
- Right.

2451
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:45,149
Hang on.

2452
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,689
My legs are itching to go up.

2453
01:23:47,719 --> 01:23:49,618
- This is crazy.
- Please, Crocodile.

2454
01:23:49,619 --> 01:23:50,818
Do me a favor, Crocodile.

2455
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:52,789
- Crocodile.
- Please, Crocodile.

2456
01:23:53,059 --> 01:23:54,228
Please.

2457
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:55,989
- Please, Crocodile.
- Bite him!

2458
01:23:56,089 --> 01:23:57,098
Okay.

2459
01:23:57,099 --> 01:23:58,229
(DinDin passes.)

2460
01:24:00,629 --> 01:24:03,299
- Okay. I got it.
- Bite him, Crocodile!

2461
01:24:03,399 --> 01:24:04,669
Bite him!

2462
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:07,739
Okay.

2463
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:10,039
(Se Yoon passes.)

2464
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,078
- I have nothing to say.
- Please, Crocodile.

2465
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:14,109
- Teeth for teeth.
- Please.

2466
01:24:15,409 --> 01:24:19,419
(The odds of winning is rapidly increasing.)

2467
01:24:20,749 --> 01:24:21,819
(Breathless)

2468
01:24:22,489 --> 01:24:23,489
We have five teeth left.

2469
01:24:23,989 --> 01:24:26,529
Crocodile, I'm begging you.

2470
01:24:26,929 --> 01:24:28,089
Please, Crocodile!

2471
01:24:28,789 --> 01:24:30,759
(Biting)

2472
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:31,929
Please.

2473
01:24:32,559 --> 01:24:36,129
(Explosion of anger)

2474
01:24:37,169 --> 01:24:38,239
Everyone.

2475
01:24:38,469 --> 01:24:41,739
I'll guide DinDin, the thoughtful celebrity.

2476
01:24:41,909 --> 01:24:45,709
A lot of you have been disappointed by his thoughtless behavior.

2477
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:47,078
It's me.

2478
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:49,149
I will change him completely.

2479
01:24:49,509 --> 01:24:51,018
From a thoughtless celebrity to a thoughtful one.

2480
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:52,619
I'm sorry, but will you hurry and leave?

2481
01:24:52,679 --> 01:24:54,849
I'm sorry. I'm slow because I'm fat.

2482
01:24:55,419 --> 01:24:57,358
All right. DinDin, you're going up.

2483
01:24:57,359 --> 01:24:58,789
(DinDin wins the hiking.)

2484
01:24:59,459 --> 01:25:01,789
Hey!

2485
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,529
The teeth got the teeth.

2486
01:25:04,059 --> 01:25:05,728
It got him with its front tooth.

2487
01:25:05,729 --> 01:25:07,369
(The crocodile didn't do anything wrong.)

2488
01:25:07,799 --> 01:25:10,299
(Akeo Peak Expedition)

2489
01:25:10,769 --> 01:25:12,268
- Bye, Se Yoon.
- See you.

2490
01:25:12,269 --> 01:25:13,339
Bye.

2491
01:25:14,839 --> 01:25:18,839
(Let's crawl up Mount Worak)

2492
01:25:19,979 --> 01:25:22,879
(A cheering song for the younger members)

2493
01:25:23,549 --> 01:25:26,519
(If you climb until you are sweating and exhausted, )

2494
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,619
(you'll see Akeo Peak.)

2495
01:25:29,759 --> 01:25:31,118
My goodness!

2496
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:33,688
Why aren't you biting me?

2497
01:25:33,689 --> 01:25:34,788
(Actually, it's a song to mock them.)

2498
01:25:34,789 --> 01:25:36,058
(Crocodile Overpass, steep slope)

2499
01:25:36,059 --> 01:25:37,128
(The Akeo Peak Expedition starts hiking.)

2500
01:25:37,129 --> 01:25:38,359
This is steep.

2501
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:40,898
- It's steep from the beginning.
- It's steep from the beginning.

2502
01:25:40,899 --> 01:25:42,129
- It will be tough.
- I know.

2503
01:25:42,669 --> 01:25:45,399
Seriously, it feels good now that I started hiking.

2504
01:25:46,369 --> 01:25:47,609
It feels refreshing.

2505
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:53,949
(The relaxing moment from nature is the charm of hiking.)

2506
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:57,378
(Between green and red, a feeling you can experience at this moment)

2507
01:25:57,379 --> 01:25:58,819
The mountain is...

2508
01:25:59,549 --> 01:26:01,248
surely tough to climb.

2509
01:26:01,249 --> 01:26:03,558
- The trail is so...
- Yes, it's rough.

2510
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:04,958
(The path becomes rougher the higher they climb.)

2511
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:06,959
And there are no stairs.

2512
01:26:08,729 --> 01:26:10,328
(Steep slope)

2513
01:26:10,329 --> 01:26:11,329
(Course 2, a steep slope)

2514
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,599
It's rough.

2515
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:16,468
This is dangerous.

2516
01:26:16,469 --> 01:26:18,569
(A rough path entangled with rocks and tree roots)

2517
01:26:20,269 --> 01:26:23,439
(It's difficult from the beginning.)

2518
01:26:24,839 --> 01:26:26,309
The path is too rough.

2519
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:28,348
It doesn't feel like a hiking trail.

2520
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,469
I know. It doesn't feel like we're on a hiking trail.

2521
01:26:30,979 --> 01:26:32,448
It feels like we're just going up randomly.

2522
01:26:32,449 --> 01:26:35,149
Right. It's like going up a hill without a hiking trail.

2523
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:37,658
- This is...
- This is a rugged mountain.

2524
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:38,989
Is this a hiking trail?

2525
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:42,288
How do the rocks look like this?

2526
01:26:42,289 --> 01:26:44,499
I know. They look unique.

2527
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:49,429
(It's 8am at the base camp.)

2528
01:26:51,569 --> 01:26:54,209
(Team Team Jong Cho Joon spent the night in the tent.)

2529
01:26:54,939 --> 01:26:58,409
(They are still sound asleep.)

2530
01:26:58,479 --> 01:26:59,538
(One Heart Autumn Excursion)

2531
01:26:59,539 --> 01:27:03,049
(The wake-up song to shake up the dreamland plays.)

2532
01:27:04,549 --> 01:27:07,349
(Wriggling)

2533
01:27:09,319 --> 01:27:11,859
(Sae Ho gets up first.)

2534
01:27:14,059 --> 01:27:15,629
(Sae Ho is surprised to see something.)

2535
01:27:16,129 --> 01:27:18,559
(Someone is at our table.)

2536
01:27:18,759 --> 01:27:19,799
Did you not go hiking?

2537
01:27:20,629 --> 01:27:22,469
(Is someone here?)

2538
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:27,009
- Se Yoon.
- No, I'm not going!

2539
01:27:28,469 --> 01:27:29,569
Did you not go hiking?

2540
01:27:29,609 --> 01:27:30,709
Friend.

2541
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:32,208
- My gosh.
- My friend.

2542
01:27:32,209 --> 01:27:34,979
(It's good to see you, my friend.)

2543
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:36,918
- My friend.
- Joon let you sleep indoors,

2544
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:38,248
- but you didn't go.
- No.

2545
01:27:38,249 --> 01:27:39,479
(Befuddled)

2546
01:27:39,849 --> 01:27:41,189
Come here. I'm hungry.

2547
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:43,019
Hurry. Let's eat.

2548
01:27:43,489 --> 01:27:46,588
You should eat when the food is still warm.

2549
01:27:46,589 --> 01:27:48,888
We don't go to a restaurant? Will you give us food here?

2550
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:49,929
Of course.

2551
01:27:50,299 --> 01:27:51,328
Delivery service?

2552
01:27:51,329 --> 01:27:53,568
- I took care of it.
- Really?

2553
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:55,828
Yes! Good!

2554
01:27:55,829 --> 01:27:58,168
It's chilly today,

2555
01:27:58,169 --> 01:28:00,669
- so it's marsh snail hangover soup.
- Marsh snail!

2556
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:02,268
Marsh snail!

2557
01:28:02,269 --> 01:28:03,578
Kimchi!

2558
01:28:03,579 --> 01:28:04,908
(A hearty meal in the morning)

2559
01:28:04,909 --> 01:28:06,108
What?

2560
01:28:06,109 --> 01:28:07,708
Can we put the eggs in the soup?

2561
01:28:07,709 --> 01:28:10,278
What are these eggs for? Are they raw eggs?

2562
01:28:10,279 --> 01:28:11,318
- What?
- What is this?

2563
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:13,388
You can put them in when the soup is warm.

2564
01:28:13,389 --> 01:28:14,589
Are they raw eggs?

2565
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:15,988
But the soup isn't so warm.

2566
01:28:15,989 --> 01:28:17,119
You can still add it.

2567
01:28:17,559 --> 01:28:19,465
- Let's see how his soup turns out.
- Just put it in.

2568
01:28:19,489 --> 01:28:20,828
- It's like...
- This should be boiling.

2569
01:28:20,829 --> 01:28:23,029
The bean sprout hangover soup. You just put it in.

2570
01:28:23,329 --> 01:28:24,609
I don't think it will be cooked.

2571
01:28:25,229 --> 01:28:26,669
Yours is still transparent.

2572
01:28:26,869 --> 01:28:27,929
(Laughing)

2573
01:28:28,529 --> 01:28:30,369
- This is...
- It's just a raw egg.

2574
01:28:30,499 --> 01:28:32,699
It's floating like the moon.

2575
01:28:33,069 --> 01:28:34,308
I will eat it without an egg.

2576
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:35,629
- Me too.
- I should just eat it.

2577
01:28:35,969 --> 01:28:37,008
It's chilly.

2578
01:28:37,009 --> 01:28:39,409
I like raw eggs, so it's fine.

2579
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,448
- This is good.
- It is.

2580
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:42,608
The soup is refreshing.

2581
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:43,679
(Jong Min loves the food.)

2582
01:28:44,049 --> 01:28:45,779
What was it? Marsh snail?

2583
01:28:45,949 --> 01:28:48,019
- Marsh snail.
- It's marsh snail.

2584
01:28:48,689 --> 01:28:52,458
Marsh snail is good for liver function.

2585
01:28:52,459 --> 01:28:53,459
Right.

2586
01:28:53,659 --> 01:28:55,258
It's made with doenjang,

2587
01:28:55,259 --> 01:28:56,759
so it's light.

2588
01:28:57,359 --> 01:28:59,098
We got it from a local restaurant.

2589
01:28:59,099 --> 01:29:00,529
I knew it.

2590
01:29:00,999 --> 01:29:03,639
It's really good. It's refreshing and light.

2591
01:29:04,499 --> 01:29:06,059
- This is perfect for breakfast.
- Yes.

2592
01:29:06,469 --> 01:29:07,569
It's so nice.

2593
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:10,879
(Meanwhile, DinDin and Seon Ho...)

2594
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:16,309
(They're struggling in real time.)

2595
01:29:17,619 --> 01:29:21,989
(The path gets steeper and rougher the higher they go.)

2596
01:29:30,129 --> 01:29:34,669
(The only sound you can hear is their heavy breathing.)

2597
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:38,399
- We're there.
- Are we there?

2598
01:29:39,599 --> 01:29:41,608
(Akeo Peak)

2599
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:44,079
(Arrived)

2600
01:29:45,009 --> 01:29:46,109
Oh, dear.

2601
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:49,379
- What is this?
- My gosh.

2602
01:29:50,579 --> 01:29:53,849
(The sight unfolds before their eyes as soon as they reach the top.)

2603
01:29:55,749 --> 01:29:57,289
It looks like the Amazon.

2604
01:29:57,389 --> 01:29:58,719
Is this really Korea?

2605
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:00,589
This is amazing.

2606
01:30:02,589 --> 01:30:05,128
The protruding parts seen from above...

2607
01:30:05,129 --> 01:30:06,828
resemble crocodiles,

2608
01:30:06,829 --> 01:30:07,928
- so this is called Akeo Peak.
- I see.

2609
01:30:07,929 --> 01:30:08,998
They do look like crocodiles.

2610
01:30:08,999 --> 01:30:11,169
This looks like a chicken nugget.

2611
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:15,039
This is actually magnificent.

2612
01:30:15,909 --> 01:30:18,478
The mountains in Chungcheong Province look different.

2613
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:21,359
(The breathtaking view of Akeo Peak makes them forget the arduous hike.)

2614
01:30:21,649 --> 01:30:26,819
(They take in the crocodiles of Chungju Lake with their eyes.)

2615
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:29,718
Do you know the CORTIS Challenge?

2616
01:30:29,719 --> 01:30:31,788
- What is CORTIS?
- Go!

2617
01:30:31,789 --> 01:30:32,859
- Is this it?
- Yes.

2618
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:38,959
(We included this dance in the closing.)

2619
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:42,529
Want to enjoy the autumn season like 2 Days 1 Night?

2620
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:44,239
To Danyang and Jecheon.

2621
01:30:44,469 --> 01:30:47,639
- Go!
- Go!

2622
01:30:48,169 --> 01:30:50,479
(Is this the right dance?)

2623
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:53,179
Experience autumn wherever you go!

2624
01:30:53,509 --> 01:30:57,319
- 2 Days 1 Night!
- 2 Days 1 Night!

2625
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:59,518
(Let's meet again in the deeper autumn.)

2626
01:30:59,519 --> 01:31:01,049
Go home!

2627
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:03,249
(Next episode)

2628
01:31:03,919 --> 01:31:06,459
(A pleasant trip with perfect weather)

2629
01:31:06,689 --> 01:31:09,929
(Or so they thought.)

2630
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:11,459
(Flustered)

2631
01:31:11,529 --> 01:31:12,829
(Sensitive)

2632
01:31:12,859 --> 01:31:14,928
(Hungry Lupin, who stole their food, )

2633
01:31:14,929 --> 01:31:17,699
(is hiding among them.)

2634
01:31:18,599 --> 01:31:19,939
(Suspicion)

2635
01:31:20,069 --> 01:31:22,268
(Distrust)

2636
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:24,178
(Something feels off about his behavior today.)

2637
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:26,439
(Something doesn't feel right.)

2638
01:31:26,779 --> 01:31:28,979
(I won't get caught.)

2639
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:33,149
(Suspicion is growing.)

2640
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:35,348
(To keep their dinner safe, )

2641
01:31:35,349 --> 01:31:38,819
(they must catch Hungry Lupin.)

2642
01:31:39,419 --> 01:31:41,658
(Between suspicion and distrust, )

2643
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:45,659
(a time of choice approaches.)

2644
01:31:45,729 --> 01:31:47,429
(Who on earth is Hungry Lupin?)

2645
01:31:47,499 --> 01:31:48,668
- Left.
- Left.

2646
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:51,439
(See you next week.)
