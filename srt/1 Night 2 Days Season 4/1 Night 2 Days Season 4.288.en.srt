1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:02,116
(It feels like today will be filled with luck.)

2
00:00:02,117 --> 00:00:03,722
- Gosh, it's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

3
00:00:03,747 --> 00:00:04,947
This is...

4
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:06,877
- Gangwon Province.
- Gangwon Province.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,270
- What is this place?
- It's no joke.

6
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,593
(Amazed)

7
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:12,663
This place is beautiful.

8
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:14,862
- It's like a work of art.
- It really is.

9
00:00:14,863 --> 00:00:15,932
- What's this?
- It's so pretty.

10
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,433
- Hello.
- Hello.

11
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,132
(What awaits the members here?)

12
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:22,773
- Hello.
- How beautiful.

13
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,802
Have you been well?

14
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:25,803
- Yes.
- Yes.

15
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:28,442
We've been doing well, but Jong Min is a bit...

16
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:30,083
- He bled a little.
- He had a problem.

17
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:32,753
You can tell from the area under his nose.

18
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:34,359
- While shaving...
- While shaving, he...

19
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:35,782
- It's a lot more than...
- Aren't you past the age...

20
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:37,282
to cut yourself while shaving?

21
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:38,622
It's nice. He's like Charlie Chaplin.

22
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:40,392
That's not what's important.

23
00:00:40,393 --> 00:00:41,852
- Then what's important?
- Everyone.

24
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:43,892
I got a text from Bo Gum...

25
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,463
- exactly two minutes ago.
- Really?

26
00:00:45,563 --> 00:00:47,723
- He gets up early.
- I didn't contact him separately.

27
00:00:47,863 --> 00:00:49,562
"Good morning."

28
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:52,103
"Good luck with the 2 Days 1 Night shoot today."

29
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:55,273
"Have a great first day of August."

30
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:56,972
- What is this?
- Why did he...

31
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,002
suddenly send a text to you like that?

32
00:00:58,003 --> 00:00:59,443
I didn't send one first.

33
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:02,073
He sent me one, knowing we have a shoot today.

34
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:03,542
He sent one to you quite late.

35
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:04,882
He sent me a text at 6:30am.

36
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:06,852
- Bo Gum did?
- Yes. I was surprised in the car.

37
00:01:06,853 --> 00:01:08,382
- Really?
- I thought it was a spam text.

38
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:09,882
"What is this?" I checked it like that.

39
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:11,552
- You got one too?
- He sent me one!

40
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:13,122
- He really got a text.
- He sent me one at 8:15am.

41
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:14,892
- He sent me one at 8:15am.
- Yes! This is how Bo Gum is.

42
00:01:14,893 --> 00:01:16,123
That's Bo Gum.

43
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:18,362
- Bo Gum!
- Hi, Bo Gum.

44
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,292
- Hello.
- Hey, Bo Gum.

45
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:21,762
- Today...
- We, who got a text from you,

46
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:23,639
- are doing our best with the shoot.
- Thanks to you,

47
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:25,932
we could start the opening with excitement.

48
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,303
- Bo Gum, thank you.
- Bo Gum!

49
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,372
- Thank you.
- Stay healthy!

50
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:29,672
When will you be back?

51
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,142
- I love you!
- Be on our show again.

52
00:01:31,143 --> 00:01:32,742
- It's really fascinating.
- Of course, I'm grateful.

53
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:34,343
- How did he text us first?
- Seriously.

54
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:35,812
He must've texted us...

55
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:36,942
- because he liked us.
- That's right.

56
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:38,112
- Of course.
- Seriously, this year...

57
00:01:38,113 --> 00:01:40,313
Jong Min has special news.

58
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:41,752
- What is it?
- I read an article about you.

59
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:42,822
There was an article about him?

60
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:44,552
Apparently, it said KOYOTE was having a concert...

61
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:46,422
- in Australia on Sunday.
- Right.

62
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:49,253
So I thought Jong Min wouldn't be here for the shoot.

63
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:51,269
- How will he perform on Sunday?
- But he was here, bleeding.

64
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:52,562
Seriously, what...

65
00:01:52,563 --> 00:01:54,263
- You'll go to Australia tomorrow?
- Yes.

66
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:56,432
As soon as I land there,

67
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,532
- I have to perform right away.
- But...

68
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,773
- That's crazy.
- But...

69
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,933
We're okay, so you can leave today.

70
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,373
(Flustered)

71
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,803
We're okay. I feel like Bo Gum will come if we ask him.

72
00:02:06,073 --> 00:02:07,612
- Bo Gum?
- Yes, Bo Gum.

73
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:08,772
I should finish the shoot, then.

74
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:09,813
(A survival instinct)

75
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:10,943
You're going to Australia...

76
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:12,389
like you're going to a different city in Korea.

77
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:14,013
There are so many people who want them.

78
00:02:14,313 --> 00:02:16,052
And their new song is doing so well.

79
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,252
"Call me, call me." It goes like this.

80
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:18,573
- What's that?
- Are you dancing?

81
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:20,953
(Flustered by his sudden dance)

82
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:22,392
(And he's quite good!)

83
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,763
- He's good.
- You're good.

84
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:25,762
- Oh, it's you on the phone?
- Yes. "Call me."

85
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:27,162
(Working hard so he won't lose his spot to Bo Gum)

86
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:29,162
Anyway, where are we?

87
00:02:29,163 --> 00:02:32,562
Today's destination is Korea's popular summer vacation spot.

88
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:34,803
It's Donghae and Samcheok of Gangwon Province.

89
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,073
- That's great.
- Samcheok.

90
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:41,242
This is a tourist site developed from a former limestone mine.

91
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:42,272
(Mureung Byeolyucheonji)

92
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:43,789
(A tourist site recreated from a former limestone mine)

93
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:47,113
(It's famous for its lavender festival held every June.)

94
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:49,683
Before we begin our trip, let me tell you this.

95
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:51,122
- Before?
- Today, it's really important...

96
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:52,153
to meet a good team.

97
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,222
Let's divide you into teams first.

98
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:55,392
- Through a simple mission.
- Yes.

99
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:57,069
- Sounds good.
- A mission to decide your team...

100
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,593
is Youth Song Quiz, which suits the verdant summer.

101
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,063
- Youth Song?
- Youth Song?

102
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,163
- Youth Song?
- I love youth songs.

103
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:04,732
The one who answers...

104
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,772
the singer and the title the most after listening to a song...

105
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:08,632
will get to decide his team however he wants.

106
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:09,642
- All right.
- So he'll be a team leader.

107
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:11,003
The one who gets the most answers.

108
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:13,073
- Are you ready? The first question.
- Yes.

109
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:14,843
Play the song.

110
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:16,173
Wait. What?

111
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,583
- I got it.
- I got it.

112
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:19,143
- I got it.
- I got it.

113
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:20,552
- What? I couldn't hear it.
- I got it.

114
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:21,712
- What is it?
- Did you play something?

115
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:22,782
"Barefooted Youth."

116
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:24,052
("Barefooted Youth")

117
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:25,053
Bucks.

118
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,223
- I got it! What?
- I got it.

119
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:27,393
- What is it?
- Se Yoon.

120
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:28,892
"Barefooted Youth" by Buck.

121
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:29,922
Buck?

122
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:31,823
Se Yoon, correct.

123
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:33,363
- Isn't it Bucks?
- Bucks is...

124
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,093
(Let's just dance.)

125
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:36,563
(Barefooted youth)

126
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,233
(Vocalizing)

127
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,772
- This is a youth song?
- Yes.

128
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:40,803
(In a trance)

129
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:42,502
(Here we go!)

130
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:43,773
(Zoom)

131
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,242
(The youth song from the old days gets you excited right away.)

132
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:47,643
- In a club...
- This is fun.

133
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:49,043
It's a club song.

134
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:50,782
It's not Bucks?

135
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:52,213
- Wait, who?
- This time,

136
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:54,482
we'll play a song for the youngsters since we have Seon Ho.

137
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:55,952
- Okay.
- Let's play for the youngsters.

138
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:57,583
Play the song.

139
00:03:58,953 --> 00:04:00,053
- DinDin!
- Seon Ho!

140
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:01,953
(- DinDin!
- Seon Ho!)

141
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:03,593
- Who said it first?
- DinDin.

142
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:04,762
DinDin.

143
00:04:04,763 --> 00:04:05,792
- DAY6.
- That's right.

144
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:07,192
- That's right.
- "Time of Our Life."

145
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:08,492
- He's right.
- He got it.

146
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:09,653
- I knew it too.
- He got it.

147
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:12,203
(A beautiful page of youth)

148
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,772
(They suddenly sing together without any accompaniment)

149
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:16,573
(Bass, keyboard, guitar)

150
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:18,102
(Immersed)

151
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:19,423
- This song is famous.
- Come on!

152
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:21,713
(The song is played for them.)

153
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:25,613
(Beautiful)

154
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,083
(A beautiful page of youth)

155
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:30,023
What?

156
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:31,983
What is this?

157
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:34,193
- What is this?
- What is this?

158
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:35,893
- What is this?
- What is this?

159
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:38,593
- What is this?
- What is this?

160
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:44,103
(Introducing today's surprise guests)

161
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,903
(A beautiful page of youth)

162
00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:52,573
(The singer of this song)

163
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:57,443
(All the members of DAY6 are here.)

164
00:04:57,743 --> 00:04:59,613
(They haven't grasped the situation.)

165
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:01,383
- What?
- What are they doing?

166
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,052
What? Is it DAY6?

167
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,653
- What?
- Let's party for now. Come on!

168
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:07,052
(Let's just jump.)

169
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:08,093
What?

170
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:10,322
(DAY6 sings "Time of Our Life" live.)

171
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:11,522
- What?
- Gosh, it's DAY6.

172
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:12,663
- Gosh.
- What?

173
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:15,933
(Fascinated)

174
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,533
(DAY6 gets closer to them.)

175
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:20,972
Sing together!

(Singing along)

178
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:24,942
(Singing along)

179
00:05:24,943 --> 00:05:27,043

181
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:33,583
(DAY6 has come to 2 Days 1 Night.)

182
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:35,183
- Is it DAY6?
- What is this?

183
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:37,082
- Thank you.
- It's DAY6. What is this?

184
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,122
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

185
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:40,252
- Have you been well?
- What's going on?

186
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,252
- I'm a huge fan.
- Hello.

187
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:43,422
- What is this?
- Good to see you.

188
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,463
Hello.

189
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:48,563
(DAY6, a band that's guaranteed to deliver)

190
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:52,103
(They honed their skills through busking and live performances.)

191
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:56,372
(They grew into an all-round band that can write their own songs.)

192
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:57,373
("Time of Our Life," "You Were Beautiful")

193
00:05:57,374 --> 00:06:00,242
(The band that created a reverse-chart success story)

194
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:03,843
(1st place on a public TV music show 9 years after their debut)

195
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:05,282
(Whenever they hold a concert, )

196
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,013
(they sell out.)

197
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,752
(They had a solo concert at Gocheok Sky Dome...)

198
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:13,193
(for the first time for a band.)

199
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:16,892
(They captured both popularity and artistry.)

200

("DAY6 and aespa, the Best Singers of 2024")

201
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:21,093

202
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:25,463

208
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:39,823
- Hello, we're DAY6.
- Hello, we're DAY6.

209
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:41,253
Welcome!

210
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:43,882
- Yes.
- It's youth today.

211
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:46,182
- I was really surprised.
- I know.

212
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:47,552
DAY6 is the busiest these days.

213
00:06:47,553 --> 00:06:49,592
- That's right. They go abroad too.
- We had a hard time inviting them.

214
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:50,763
- I know.
- Really?

215
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,893
You were on the bus too?

216
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:54,162
- Yes.
- Really?

217
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,192
- Ta-da.
- They were on the bus with us?

218
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:56,292
What? Were you on the upper deck?

219
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:58,563
No, we came just now.

220
00:06:58,733 --> 00:06:59,932
- Oh, after they dropped us off?
- Yes.

221
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:01,149
Oh, because it's a shuttle bus...

222
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:02,832
Let's get off now.

223
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,173
Let's start the shoot.

224
00:07:04,243 --> 00:07:05,372
We need to get off quickly.

225
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:07,373
(The members who were on standby got off the bus.)

226
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:09,312
(DAY6 got on the bus.)

227
00:07:09,313 --> 00:07:10,783
- Are the cameras rolling?
- Yes.

228
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:12,783
Hi.

229
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,713
DAY6 is here.

230
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,723
The members have no idea.

231
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:20,393
(Peeking)

232
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:23,492
(What are they talking about?)

233
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:24,823
Passion!

234
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:27,563
- I'll do my very best.
- Okay.

235
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:28,733
In 1, 2, 3.

236
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:30,662
- Let's... No.
- DAY6.

237
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,079
(DAY6 waited after shouting their team cheer.)

238
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,902
I see. That's why the writers kept on kicking us.

239
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:35,032
- To get us to leave.
- They rushed us.

240
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:36,202
- "Go already."
- "Go."

241
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:37,342
- "Get off the bus."
- "Hurry."

242
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:38,372
They'll join us...

243
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:39,373
- for the entire trip.
- They'll stay with us?

244
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:40,973
- Really?
- Is that true?

245
00:07:41,513 --> 00:07:42,672
(They will stay with the members until tomorrow.)

246
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:44,982
- They'll even stay for the night?
- It's an honor.

247
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:46,082
- They'll stay for the night?
- Yes.

248
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,112
- Gosh.
- Yes.

249
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:48,513
- Why?
- Are you serious?

250
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:50,823
Well,

251
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,552
- September 7...
- Is there an event to promote?

252
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:54,122
- will be our tenth anniversary.
- Right!

253
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:55,222
- Right.
- Already?

254
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:56,862
After performing for ten years,

255
00:07:56,863 --> 00:07:59,992
we'd like to show other sides of ourselves to the viewers.

256
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:03,962
The staff invited us to join your show for this episode.

257
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:05,062
- Our show has a long history too.
- So we decided...

258
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:06,102
- Right.
- to join you.

259
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:07,132
- It's a prestigious show too.
- This is great for us.

260
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,972
- What a sweet thing to say.
- They have a similar vibe to ours.

261
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:11,902
Have you watched our show before?

262
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:13,443
- We love it.
- Of course.

263
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,743
- I noticed this about Joon.
- Yes?

264
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:17,483
- He was...
- What about him?

265
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:18,942
- Have you crossed paths with him?
- Have you?

266
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,412
He was really bad at games.

267
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:23,012
- So you watched our show.
- You watched our show.

268
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:24,883
That left a strong impression on me.

269
00:08:24,983 --> 00:08:27,692
Really? Well, it's also part of my character on this show.

270
00:08:27,693 --> 00:08:29,222
- It is, isn't it?
- It's a TV show, after all.

271
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:31,822
Actually, I'm pretty... I mean, yes.

272
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:32,993
He can't even speak well.

273
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,153
He's bad at everything, including speaking.

274
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:36,633
It was entertaining to watch.

275
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,102
SungJin. You know what?

276
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:39,439
- The eojuk place from Hapjeong...
- Yes.

277
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:40,772
- You know the eojuk restaurant?
- Eojuk?

278
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:42,679
- Yes. The fish noodle soup?
- The fish noodle soup.

279
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:44,142
- Jirisan Fish Noodle Soup.
- I went there to film a TV show.

280
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:46,672
When I was filming the show, I looked over and saw him there.

281
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:47,872
He told me it was his regular spot.

282
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:49,612
- Their food is really good.
- I see.

283
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,642
I really enjoyed the food.

284
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,483
- You have different connections.
- Of course.

285
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:54,182
- The eojuk connection.
- The eojuk connection.

286
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:55,752
- We both love fish noodle soup.
- Of course, we love it.

287
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:57,152
It's hard to find that dish in Seoul.

288
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,852
- We crossed paths with them.
- Yes.

289
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:00,522
But Seon Ho seems a bit shy to meet them.

290
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:02,292
- You punk.
- Why don't you say hello?

291
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:03,392
I'm a huge fan. I'm serious.

292
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:04,492
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

293
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:05,892
I listen to all the songs listed in your album.

294
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,062
- Really?
- Name one.

295
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,362
Like what? Name one song in their album.

296
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:09,902
- I like "I Loved You."
- Gosh.

297
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:11,502
- That's a popular title.
- "Love Me or Leave Me." "Upgrade."

298
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:12,533
I like all of your songs.

299
00:09:12,663 --> 00:09:13,672
- He's a real fan.
- Thank you.

300
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:15,472
- Seon Ho is a true fan.
- Let's switch spots.

301
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:16,702
- Come here.
- Let him stand next to them.

302
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:18,042
- Seeing how much he loves them...
- Seriously. Seon Ho...

303
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:20,213
- often said he was your fan.
- I mentioned it often.

304
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:21,672
- Thank you.
- I'm a huge fan.

305
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:22,673
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

306
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,012
- He's so shy.
- All right.

307
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:26,213
We'll have to start our trip now.

308
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:29,113
The theme of our trip, with DAY6 joining us...

309
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:32,053
is Welcome to the Real Variety Show.

310
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:34,123
Great!

311
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,493
(That's a great title.)

312
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:38,693
(They start singing in sync again.)

313
00:09:38,993 --> 00:09:41,862
(At this point, they're addicted to sing-alongs.)

314
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:44,663
(Hopping)

315
00:09:44,763 --> 00:09:45,832
It looks like a spirit possessed you.

316
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,003
(Laughing)

317
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,632
Yes!

318
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:51,772
As it's DAY6's 1st time starring in a real wild variety show,

319
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:54,173
we prepared a trip with various and fun activities.

320
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,742
Today, you will divide into 2 teams of 5.

321
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:59,383
- Great.
- Each time you win a mission...

322
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:01,083
until lunchtime,

323
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:03,823
you will receive a meal ticket that will allow you to eat...

324
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:05,452
at a local restaurant in Samcheok.

325
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:06,523
- That's great.
- Nice.

326
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:08,622
What happens if we don't win any meal tickets?

327
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:09,962
- We can't eat at all?
- Really?

328
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:12,293
You might regret joining our show. I'm serious.

329
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:13,692
(Gasping)

330
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:14,932
- You'll be really hungry.
- I think...

331
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:17,562
You might think, "Must I do this just for some food?"

332
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:20,372
- I hear Young K is a big eater.
- Right. You eat a lot.

333
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:21,432
- Right.
- He's a big eater.

334
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:22,732
That's why I had breakfast.

335
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:24,142
- Just in case.
- That was good thinking.

336
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:25,402
- You have the right attitude.
- Just in case?

337
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:26,712
Is Young K the only big eater?

338
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:27,912
- What about you?
- I also eat a lot.

339
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:28,942
- Right.
- Yes.

340
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:31,182
- He and I are the eating buddies.
- Right.

341
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:35,982
(They'll show us a proper eating show.)

342
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:37,982
- Right.
- Do you eat less in comparison?

343
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:39,422
- Yes. Dowoon and I don't eat a lot.
- The two of them...

344
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:40,783
- You don't eat a lot.
- We don't.

345
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:43,392
Eating with company is more fun. But the two of you don't eat much.

346
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,673
- We're grateful to them.
- Yes.

347
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:47,763
- They're great at get-togethers.
- They leave some food for you.

348
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:49,533
- We split the tab.
- Right.

349
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:51,362
Since your meal is at stake,

350
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:53,262
your choice of teammate will matter a lot.

351
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:54,303
- Yes.
- Right.

352
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:57,372
To balance out the portions among the members of DAY6,

353
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:59,743
we've paired up a big eater and a light eater together.

354
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:01,912
Young K and Wonpil will be a pair.

355
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:03,012
- Okay.
- Really?

356
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:05,112
SungJin and Dowoon will be a pair.

357
00:11:05,113 --> 00:11:06,212
- Okay.
- Okay.

358
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:08,352
- Big and light eaters.
- You guys can play...

359
00:11:08,353 --> 00:11:10,383
rock-paper-scissors or another game...

360
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,783
to pick a member of our show.

361
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:14,422
- Gosh, this is too much.
- My goodness.

362
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,052
- This is too hard for me.
- Gosh, this will be tough.

363
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:17,522
Being chosen last will hurt my pride.

364
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:18,822
So it's okay as long as I avoid that.

365
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:21,762
I think I know who will be chosen last.

366
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:22,932
(He knows a lot about the show.)

367
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,032
- We probably know who it is too.
- Right.

368
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,353
Does his name have two syllables?

369
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:28,202
- That's a possibility.
- Is it?

370
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:29,372
Young K. To be honest,

371
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:31,502
I was trying to be funny. It's a TV show, after all.

372
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:32,542
- I'll play for real this time.
- Okay.

373
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:33,912
I never said it would be you.

374
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:35,442
- I know.
- It's just an example.

375
00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:36,642
- I'm saying this just in case.
- Okay.

376
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:38,512
- So you won't be entertaining?
- I won't be funny at all.

377
00:11:38,513 --> 00:11:39,542
- Okay.
- Okay.

378
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:41,652
SungJin, Young K. Why don't you play first?

379
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:42,683
- Sure.
- Okay.

380
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:45,052
(Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors)

381
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:46,229
What was that? The rhythm was nice.

382
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:48,129
- He sang it like a song.
- Rock-paper-scissors

383
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:49,692
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

384
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:50,862
(SungJin wins, and Young K loses.)

385
00:11:50,863 --> 00:11:51,992
- Ready or not - Let's see.

386
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:53,162
- Rock-paper-scissors - I will choose...

387
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:54,632
- Okay.
- I'm getting a feeling.

388
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:55,733
Se Yoon.

389
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:59,463
Gosh, when it comes to food...

390
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:01,332
- Of course, it's him.
- Why Se Yoon?

391
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,602
I'm pretty sure he's going to give it his all...

392
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,242
- to win the meal.
- That's right.

393
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:06,812
- Let's do this.
- You're a good judge of character.

394
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,242
- That's the feeling.
- He just eats a lot.

395
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:09,972
- He's not good at anything.
- Listen.

396
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:11,653
- Let me give you an analogy.
- Seriously.

397
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:14,283
- Of course.
- This is great.

398
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:15,682
- Great, Dowoon.
- Great.

399
00:12:15,683 --> 00:12:17,163
Thank you for having a small portion.

400
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:20,793
- I will choose...
- Gosh, they chose me.

401
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:23,053
- DinDin.
- Nice.

402
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:25,193
- Gosh. Now...
- Why him?

403
00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:26,592
- Can you tell us why you chose him?
- Why?

404
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:27,832
Let's hear your reason.

405
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,462
- He's very knowledgeable.
- Right.

406
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:31,902
- He's good with strategies.
- Yes.

407
00:12:31,903 --> 00:12:34,073
- He did study abroad.
- I chose him solely to win.

408
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:36,332
- This is the Canadian connection.
- Right.

409
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,642
- You've both lived in Canada?
- Really?

410
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:39,003
- Canada.
- He's from Toronto,

411
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:40,912
- Toronto.
- I'm from Vancouver.

412
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:42,543
- You're from Vancouver.
- Vancouver.

413
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:44,583
Rock-paper-scissors.

414
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:46,142
- Gosh.
- His low voice is awesome.

415
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:48,159
- "Rock-paper-scissors."
- You seem way too excited.

416
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,353
I'll pick my role model, Jong Min.

417
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:51,852
- Okay.
- Really?

418
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:52,882
- He's your role model?
- Yes!

419
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:54,792
- You said it.
- Should he talk about it now?

420
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:56,253
I've actually been keeping quiet.

421
00:12:56,353 --> 00:12:57,993
- What?
- He...

422
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:00,262
- Why is he your role model?
- Tell us.

423
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:01,432
What are you talking about, Jong Min?

424
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:03,032
He's been saying that ever since he made his debut.

425
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,473
- It started a long time ago.
- Why?

426
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,762
(He's been Jong Min's fan for 10 years since his debut.)

427
00:13:06,763 --> 00:13:09,372
(I just want to have a meal with Jong Min.)

428
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,043
(I don't need anything else. I want to get to know him.)

429
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:13,442
- It started a long time ago.
- Why?

430
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:15,072
You knew you were his role model, but didn't say anything?

431
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:16,112
- Yes.
- When...

432
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:18,183
- I should've mentioned that first.
- But...

433
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:20,252
- I missed my window.
- Right.

434
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:22,353
What? You sound just like him when you talk.

435
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:24,782
I didn't know because he's been quiet.

436
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,082
- When you started to talk, - Don't they have a similar smile?

437
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,292
- you sounded just like him.
- Right.

438
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:29,192
He looks like Jong Min when he smiles.

439
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:30,193
- Right.
- Yes.

440
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:31,592
(His silly smile resembles Jong Min's silly smile.)

441
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:33,022
Can you guys stand next to each other?

442
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:34,032
What's going on?

443
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,192
(They're more curious to see the two together.)

444
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:36,903
He said I was his role model.

445
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,302
- Let's hear why.
- I mean,

446
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:39,632
he looks like Jong Min's cousin.

447
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:41,172
Why is he your role model?

448
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:42,502
Oh, right. A long time ago,

449
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:45,442
my mom told me to pick a role model.

450
00:13:45,443 --> 00:13:46,572
- When I was young, - His mother?

451
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:48,173
I guess I seemed hopeless to her.

452
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:49,912
She told me to pick a role model.

453
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,983
That's when I saw Jong Min on 2 Days 1 Night.

454
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:55,253
He had such an innocent smile.

455
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,022
- I wanted to be like him.
- Really?

456
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:59,082
- Seriously.
- Really?

457
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,292
- How old were you then?
- That was a long time ago.

458
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:02,492
I was in elementary or middle school.

459
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,192
- You're meeting Jong Min...
- Yes.

460
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:05,722
- as a celebrity now.
- Right.

461
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:06,992
- How do you feel?
- I realized that...

462
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,713
his smile wasn't all sunshine and rainbows.

463
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:12,533
You saw the reality behind it.

464
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:14,533
You thought I was so happy...

465
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:15,774
- when you were a kid.
- Right.

466
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,302
It must be fun...

467
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:18,303
- to be with your group.
- Right.

468
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:20,073
I dig your personality.

469
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,613
He looks like a regular member of our show.

470
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:25,642
- He keeps smiling innocently.
- He's a good fit here.

471
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:27,882
I've been waiting for this moment for ten years.

472
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:28,982
He's so funny.

473
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:31,423
- I wanted to see them together.
- He's perfect for our show.

474
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:33,022
(A real fan whose dream came true)

475
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:34,992
- All right. We should pick too.
- Then...

476
00:14:34,993 --> 00:14:36,092
- Wonpil, let's go.
- Who...

477
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:38,422
- Wonpil, pick any member you want.
- Right.

478
00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:39,423
- Really?
- No pressure.

479
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,909
- Well, the rest of them...
- No pressure.

480
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,093
Are about the same.

481
00:14:42,963 --> 00:14:44,262
(They're about the same.)

482
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:45,623
- So you can pick anyone.
- I see.

483
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,432
- His gaze...
- I...

484
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,472
- His gaze...
- No.

485
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:49,872
(Sae Ho silently pressures him with his gaze.)

486
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:51,473
- His gaze...
- No.

487
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:53,543
- You don't have to pick me.
- He's...

488
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:56,842
- This is really hard for me.
- Okay.

489
00:14:56,843 --> 00:14:59,043
- It's hard, but go on.
- Tell me who you want to pick.

490
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:01,183
You're so kind.

491
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:03,212
- He'll pick Sae Ho.
- Really?

492
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:04,382
(He chooses Sae Ho.)

493
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,453
- Really?
- Gosh.

494
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,892
Is it okay to give them a pitiful look?

495
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:09,853
- This is what he told me.
- Okay.

496
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:12,683
"How can I not pick him when he's looking at me like that?"

497
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:14,692
(The victim of exaggeration)

498
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:17,262
- "I'll pick Sae Ho."
- I am Wonpil's pick.

499
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:18,463
- Yes.
- Right.

500
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:20,472
- Okay.
- They must've prepared that.

501
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:22,472
- This will determine the outcome.
- It's the last round.

502
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:24,002
- Right. It's the worst now.
- Yes.

503
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:25,242
Rock-paper-scissors..

504
00:15:25,243 --> 00:15:26,472
- Yes, Wonpil!
- Okay.

505
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:27,772
- Really?
- I don't want to be the last one.

506
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:28,842
(Desperate)

507
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:29,912
- I'll do it.
- Hold on.

508
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:31,559
- I'm sorry.
- Just don't be the last one.

509
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,913
I'm sorry.

510
00:15:33,113 --> 00:15:34,152
- Please join us.
- Okay.

511
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:36,052
(He picks Seon Ho.)

512
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:37,759
- We're going to win.
- What? What's going on?

513
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:39,252
- What do you think?
- We got the call.

514
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:41,053
- What's going on?
- You'll go over there.

515
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:42,153
What?

516
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:44,062
- I wanted to pick you.
- You wanted Joon?

517
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:46,092
- Really?
- Of course.

518
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:47,562
- We have the perfect team.
- Great.

519
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:48,732
(SungJin wanted Joon all along.)

520
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,503
- By the way...
- You'll regret this.

521
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,232
- Our team is super strong.
- Of course.

522
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:53,633
- It's crazy.
- Seriously.

523
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,132
Our team looks pretty powerful.

524
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,932
- We look like a powerful bunch.
- Seriously.

525
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:57,942
Right.

526
00:15:57,943 --> 00:15:59,863
- They're strong, indeed.
- That's all they are.

527
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:02,413
- You know, we're strong and all.
- They're powerful.

528
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:04,043
But none of us is smart.

529
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:05,642
- It's okay. Let's do our best.
- I'll try to take that role.

530
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:06,742
- Okay. You're on your own.
- I'll try.

531
00:16:06,743 --> 00:16:07,983
The rest of us only have power.

532
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,083
(Power, Power, Power, Power, Brain)

533
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:10,924
- I'm sorry.
- The rest of us only have power?

534
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,752
- We're teamed up.
- Okay.

535
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:15,852
So you've divided into two teams.

536
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:16,892
- Okay.
- Okay.

537
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:17,992
Let's get going.

538
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:18,993
- Great.
- Okay. Let's go.

539
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:20,022
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

540
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:21,332
- I love doing missions.
- Welcome.

541
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,992
- It's fun.
- I like games.

542
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:24,002
Great.

543
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:27,073
(2 Days 1 Night with DAY6 begins now.)

544
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:29,532
- It's hot.
- Gosh, you're here on a hot day.

545
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:31,003
- Right.
- Thanks for coming.

546
00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:33,379
- He's sweating a lot.
- Do you film this early every time?

547
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:34,642
- Wipe off your sweat.
- Yes, we do.

548
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:36,313
- Wipe off your sweat.
- Okay.

549
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:38,042
- Young K, wipe off your sweat.
- It's okay.

550
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:39,183
You're sweating so much.

551
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:40,952
- You're not sweating.
- No.

552
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:42,712
- I don't sweat much either.
- Me neither.

553
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:44,429
- You're not sweating. I envy you.
- I don't sweat much either.

554
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:45,522
- You guys are similar, indeed.
- Young K...

555
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:46,622
- Yes.
- You don't sweat like Jong Min.

556
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:47,892
(Even their sweat glands function in a similar way.)

557
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:49,722
You seemed super charismatic when you played the drums.

558
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:50,962
But you sound like one of us when you speak.

559
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:52,022
- Yes.
- I love that.

560
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:53,792
- Your fans must love that twist.
- It's great.

561
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:54,933
Dowoon is the best.

562
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:59,863
(Preview clips of DAY6)

563
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:03,502
(They will laugh...)

564
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:06,843
(and have a blast.)

565
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,013
(Our youngest is carrying our team.)

566
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:15,882
(They will dance...)

567
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:20,323
(and sing.)

568
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,623
(He'll play air drums too.)

569
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:26,163
(Is it okay for me to be this happy here?)

570
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:27,863
My gosh.

571
00:17:28,193 --> 00:17:30,162
(Cool sides of them)

572
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:33,363
(Unexpected sides of them)

573
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:37,943
(We'll show you every side of them.)

574
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:40,573
(This is going to be a fun ride.)

575
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,473
(So please...)

576
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:44,083
We're joined by DAY6.

577
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:46,143
This is Korea's best...

578
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:48,483
Real wild road variety show.

579
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,483
Who are we?

580
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:52,253
2 Days...

581
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:54,492
- 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

582
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:56,152
(2 Days 1 Night)

583
00:17:56,153 --> 00:18:00,433
(Stay tuned!)

584
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:02,492
(2 Days 1 Night)

585
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:05,263
(Welcome to the Real Variety Show with DAY6)

586
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:08,503
(A double-decker bus awaits the members.)

587
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:10,702
Gosh, the second floor was spacious.

588
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:11,942
(They get on the double-decker bus, one at a time.)

589
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:13,143
The second floor was spacious.

590
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:15,072
Where should we sit?

591
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,572
- We can sit with our team.
- With our team?

592
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:17,743
We can sit together.

593
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:20,083
- I hope we can get along.
- Sure.

594
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:22,352
- You're younger than him, right?
- Yes.

595
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:24,253
- You were born in 2002.
- Right.

596
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:25,483
I was born in 1994.

597
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,192
Can we sit together? We're on different teams.

598
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:28,952
- Can I call you by your name?
- Sure.

599
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:30,792
- You can speak casually to me.
- Sure.

600
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:31,863
- Okay.
- Today,

601
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,033
we have a large workforce.

602
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,262
Right.

603
00:18:35,263 --> 00:18:36,392
- So many people are working today.
- You know?

604
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:38,262
We've got important workers today.

605
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:40,332
We've got important workers, indeed.

606
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,032
(Important guests are joining the workforce.)

607
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:44,003
What's this? Isn't this a lake?

608
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:46,319
- I'm seeing life jackets.
- What? Why are we going in there?

609
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:48,312
What? Why are we going in there?

610
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:49,772
- Life jackets?
- I don't see anything here.

611
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:51,053
We'll already go into the water?

612
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:52,383
Why are there life jackets?

613
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,183
- What?
- Everyone.

614
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:56,313
We've arrived?

615
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:58,252
- Se Yoon.
- What?

616
00:18:58,253 --> 00:18:59,773
- You'll get off the bus here.
- What?

617
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:02,092
(Only Se Yoon is going to get off?)

618
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:03,453
He'll be dropping out of the show?

619
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:05,963
Why are you forcing me out?

620
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,632
Why?

621
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,362
- Se Yoon, it's been fun. Thanks.
- Good work.

622
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:11,663
And someone...

623
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,332
from the opposing team must get off too.

624
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,172
- From our team?
- Pick someone who will get off.

625
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:18,773
How come they get to choose when you picked for our team?

626
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:21,542
- Why? We should get to choose too.
- Listen.

627
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,342
I took a look at it. If you weigh over 100kg,

628
00:19:23,343 --> 00:19:24,682
you can't be on many of the rides.

629
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:25,713
Be quiet.

630
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:29,112
Se Yoon is getting off here.

631
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:30,622
To balance out the looks, we'll pick Sae Ho.

632
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:32,253
(Sae Ho will get off the bus.)

633
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:33,782
(Why is it Sae Ho again?)

634
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:35,092
I don't know what this is, but good luck.

635
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:36,093
- Here we go.
- Good luck.

636
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:38,392
I don't know what this is, but here I go.

637
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:40,022
- We got this.
- We got this.

638
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:42,033
- Good luck.
- Let's go.

639
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:43,332
You should stick with your peer.

640
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,839
(The guys born in 1982 get off the bus together.)

641
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:45,933
(Glancing over)

642
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:47,502
I think they'll get on a duck boat.

643
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:50,303
I see cameras installed on the duck boats.

644
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:52,043
Yes, there are cameras.

645
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:53,972
But they're making Se Yoon ride the duck boat?

646
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:55,572
They wouldn't make him play a game that requires speed.

647
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:57,373
But he can't do a lot of the activities here.

648
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,882
- What?
- He's right.

649
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,042
But he can't do a lot of the activities here.

650
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:01,583
- I took a look earlier.
- I see.

651
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,629
You couldn't do a lot of them if you weighed over 100kg.

652
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,523
- Other people...
- Yes?

653
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:07,623
Will ride a luge.

654
00:20:08,153 --> 00:20:10,392
Due to the weight limit, Se Yoon can't ride...

655
00:20:10,393 --> 00:20:11,792
the luge.

656
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,992
I can't ride the luge?

657
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:15,363
- I want to ride the luge.
- I'm sorry.

658
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:17,162
Through this mission, you can earn an allowance...

659
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:19,363
to buy cool refreshments and snacks...

660
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:21,473
to share with your team.

661
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,573
Why don't you take a look at the lake?

662
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,703
Look at the lake?

663
00:20:25,803 --> 00:20:27,403
Do you see them way off in the distance?

664
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:29,989
- What are we supposed to look at?
- Some things are floating there.

665
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,343
- The yellow things? Okay.
- Yes.

666
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,243
They are rubber ducks.

667
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,652
We'll give you the amount of money written on the bottom...

668
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:37,359
of the rubber duck for your snack allowance.

669
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,522
We get along very well. Our friendship is strong.

670
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:42,023
So let's not fight over them.

671
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:44,922
- Let's go half and half.
- We can split them in half.

672
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:46,893
- Who will drive then?
- I'll drive.

673
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,863
I'll do it.

674
00:20:49,193 --> 00:20:50,433
- I like driving.
- Listen.

675
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:51,632
I'm a safe driver.

676
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:52,939
What kind of driver's license do you have?

677
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:54,502
- Why are you asking me that?
- Tell me which one you have.

678
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,943
I have a regular license. Class Two.

679
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:57,773
- Come on.
- What about you?

680
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:00,279
I have the Heavy Vehicle Driver's License, Class One.

681
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:01,472
I'm better-suited for this.

682
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:03,513
How about rock-paper-scissors? It's fair that way.

683
00:21:03,673 --> 00:21:05,542
Let's do rock-paper-scissors, minus one. What do you say?

684
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:07,042
Okay. Let's play that game to keep it fair.

685
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:08,312
- Yes, let's do that.
- Go.

686
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:13,122
- Rock-paper-scissors, minus 1.
- Rock-paper-scissors, minus 1.

687
00:21:13,123 --> 00:21:16,122
- Rock-paper-scissors, minus 1.
- Rock-paper-scissors, minus 1.

688
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:17,192
Okay!

689
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,022
(Se Yoon wins!)

690
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:21,162
- Se Yoon will drive the boat.
- My gosh.

691
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:22,192
- That was a good game.
- Great.

692
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,733
Okay. I'll drive.

693
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:26,533
Hey, you. You know, don't you?

694
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,833
Only 1 or 2 rubber ducks will have numbers written on them.

695
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,302
There's no point in taking a lot of them.

696
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:32,602
- Why wouldn't I know?
- Right.

697
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:33,642
Let's just take it easy...

698
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:35,512
- and enjoy ourselves.
- Let's enjoy it.

699
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:36,542
Let's have fun...

700
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:37,842
- until they tell us to come back.
- Right.

701
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:39,043
When will we have this chance?

702
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:41,252
We're going to abandon our teammate here...

703
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:42,482
after we personally handpicked them?

704
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:43,552
Of course.

705
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,899
- Is this normal on this show?
- Yes.

706
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:47,822
And you don't want to feel a lot of pressure when playing.

707
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:49,223
So picture yourself losing.

708
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:51,173
When you picture that, it gets easier.

709
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,192
- This is a travel show, so...
- But when he does that,

710
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:54,639
- he ends up losing.
- Didn't I tell you?

711
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,662
Getting ten questions wrong consecutively was legendary.

712
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:58,702
- Getting ten questions wrong?
- Yes.

713
00:21:58,703 --> 00:21:59,703
(It's the Zero Point Man Incident.)

714
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:02,132
Did you try to answer them as you watched the show?

715
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:03,473
I got eight questions wrong.

716
00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:05,202
(Young K gives off a similar vibe to Joon's.)

717
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:06,542
See? There's not a huge difference.

718
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:08,172
- They were difficult questions.
- Right.

719
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:10,173
- The quizzes were quite hard.
- Right.

720
00:22:10,443 --> 00:22:12,112
I'd like to go up against Young K later.

721
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:13,612
- Let's do a 1-on-1 match.
- Of course.

722
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:14,653
Nice.

723
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,113
Great.

724
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:18,222
Where are we going this time?

725
00:22:18,223 --> 00:22:20,122
(The bus continues on the road.)

726
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:21,322
- Oh, this?
- We're getting on a luge.

727
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:22,392
(They arrive at the top that overlooks a beautiful view.)

728
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:23,852
- This is fun.
- All of us will get off here.

729
00:22:23,853 --> 00:22:25,362
- I see.
- Okay.

730
00:22:25,363 --> 00:22:27,593
This is so fun. Everything is a surprise for us.

731
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:29,933
- They don't tell us anything.
- I see.

732
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:31,433
Let's go, everyone!

733
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:34,532
I love the song, "Like a Flowing Wind."

734
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:35,572
- Really?
- Yes.

735
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:36,573
- Let's go.
- Yes.

736
00:22:36,574 --> 00:22:37,803
- Thank you.
- Sure.

737
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:39,543
- Come on out.
- Right.

738
00:22:39,573 --> 00:22:40,573
Let's go.

739
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:41,772
- Jong Min.
- Let's go.

740
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:43,473
(He sweetly checks on Jong Min too.)

741
00:22:43,873 --> 00:22:46,583
(Everyone gets off the bus together.)

742
00:22:46,943 --> 00:22:51,522
(They arrive at the luge station.)

743
00:22:51,523 --> 00:22:53,883
- Let's go and win some money.
- Let's go, my friend.

744
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:55,822
My goodness.

745
00:22:55,823 --> 00:22:57,092
(Se Yoon takes the inner seat.)

746
00:22:57,093 --> 00:22:58,792
Are you all right?

747
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:01,393
(Sae Ho is the only one looking out for Se Yoon.)

748
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:04,503
It might tilt to one side, though.

749
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:07,702
- All right.
- Okay.

750
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:08,903
(They safely get on the boat.)

751
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,542
This is nice.

752
00:23:11,543 --> 00:23:13,902
(They're off to earn the snack allowance.)

753
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:16,313
I see. Like this. Hey, it's breezy.

754
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:19,443
- The riverside breeze is cool.
- Right. Usually, by the river...

755
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:22,953
Gosh, the water is great.

756
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:25,683
It's so clean.

757
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:27,722
- The water is emerald.
- Yes, it's clean.

758
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:29,752
- It's clean.
- It's so cold and refreshing.

759
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,113
(The emerald water is refreshing.)

760
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:33,323
Can you see the rubber ducks?

761
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:34,493
Yes.

762
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:35,933
All right.

763
00:23:36,063 --> 00:23:38,433
We're going to start now.

764
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:40,033
Ready,

765
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,403
set, go!

766
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:45,993
(Se Yoon turns the boat toward the ducks as soon as they begin.)

767
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:47,973
Okay.

768
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:51,143
(Se Yoon is off to a smooth start.)

769
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:52,812
(Se Yoon steers the boat more to his side.)

770
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:54,529
(There aren't any rubber ducks on Sae Ho's side.)

771
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:55,812
Come on. What are you doing?

772
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,183
(Empty)

773
00:23:57,983 --> 00:23:59,023
Okay.

774
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:00,299
- Okay. That's mine.
- Gosh, come on.

775
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:01,592
(Filming was done safely with the site manager's cooperation.)

776
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:02,593
(Tilting)

777
00:24:02,594 --> 00:24:03,922
- The boat is tilting.
- Hey.

778
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:05,862
- The boat is tilting.
- Let me pick some up too.

779
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,469
You punk. There aren't any rubber ducks left.

780
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:08,862
Come on. Turn it that way.

781
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:10,439
- Why won't you do it?
- Wait. Don't do anything.

782
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:12,932
- I'm supposed to steer the boat.
- Let's go that way.

783
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:15,103
- I won the game.
- Let's go that way.

784
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:16,772
Come on. You're being selfish.

785
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:18,649
We must steer the boat to that side and do this together.

786
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:19,953
Okay. Fine. I'll steer the boat.

787
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:22,742
(But the boat turns toward Se Yoon's side again.)

788
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:24,543
I'll do it.

789
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:25,843
(I can't put up with this anymore.)

790
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:27,142
Hey, what are you doing? This is bad.

791
00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:28,953
- You can't do that.
- You...

792
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:30,712
- What are you doing?
- No, it's dangerous.

793
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:31,922
- Let me pick up some ducks too.
- It's dangerous.

794
00:24:31,923 --> 00:24:32,178
(The cameraman stops Sae Ho.)

795
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:32,688
(I can't put up with this anymore.)

796
00:24:32,713 --> 00:24:33,951
Hey, what are you doing? This is bad.

797
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:35,852
- You can't do that.
- You...

798
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:37,551
- What are you doing?
- No, it's dangerous.

799
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:39,128
- Let me pick up some ducks too.
- It's dangerous.

800
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:41,621
- It's dangerous, you punk.
- Steer the boat to my side too!

801
00:24:41,622 --> 00:24:43,932
- It's dangerous.
- He must be out of his mind.

802
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:47,032
- Just steer it to his side.
- What do you mean?

803
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:49,832
Why would I do that?

804
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:51,502
What's wrong with you?

805
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:54,502
- Let's go that way!
- Okay, we will. I got it.

806
00:24:55,072 --> 00:24:56,611
- All right. Look.
- You're steering it...

807
00:24:56,612 --> 00:24:57,711
only to your side.

808
00:24:57,712 --> 00:24:58,941
Gosh, no. What are you talking about?

809
00:24:58,942 --> 00:25:01,242
Even if I did that, you still got more rubber ducks.

810
00:25:01,512 --> 00:25:03,851
- What are you, a thug?
- What do you mean?

811
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,552
Don't get me worked up now!

812
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,621
- Let go of that.
- We played a game to pick seats.

813
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:09,021
- You would've done the same.
- Come on.

814
00:25:09,022 --> 00:25:10,751
- Why are you steering the boat?
- You're being unreasonable!

815
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:12,822
- Seriously.
- You're being absurd.

816
00:25:12,962 --> 00:25:14,261
Look. Let me loosen it.

817
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,021
Hold on. We're in the middle. Happy now?

818
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:17,732
Let's try to pick up the ducks together.

819
00:25:18,132 --> 00:25:19,362
Let's go and get a big one.

820
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,322
Let me pick up a big one. I'm just curious.

821
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,831
The amounts aren't that big.

822
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:26,071
(Meanwhile, Se Yoon checks the amounts on his ducks.)

823
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:27,542
I'm just curious. Okay?

824
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:29,872
Let me just pick up a big one. I'm curious.

825
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:31,571
- Okay. Get a big one.
- Let me just get this one.

826
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:32,741
(He generously lets Sae Ho pick up the big duck.)

827
00:25:32,742 --> 00:25:34,842
- My gosh. Over there. Hold on.
- Where?

828
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:36,451
- You do it. What is it?
- Wait.

829
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,388
(While Sae Ho is distracted by the big rubber duck, )

830
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,082
(he tosses his rubber duck.)

831
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:43,222
(What's the secret behind the duck Se Yoon tossed?)

832
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:44,791
- You got it, right?
- Gosh.

833
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,591
- You got your wish.
- Gosh, this is big.

834
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:49,321
You know what? That's enough. That one is mine.

835
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:50,762
- This is crazy.
- That one is mine.

836
00:25:50,862 --> 00:25:52,161
That was only five cents.

837
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:53,561
- I'll take that one.
- That was only five cents.

838
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:55,462
- I'll take one too.
- Okay.

839
00:25:56,302 --> 00:25:57,772
- Yes.
- Let's go.

840
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:00,041
- Go where?
- We'll put on protective gear.

841
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:01,278
(They arrive at the spot for their first mission.)

842
00:26:01,302 --> 00:26:02,972
Gosh, it's hot. It's cool inside.

843
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:05,172
Hey, it's so hot today.

844
00:26:05,872 --> 00:26:07,581
Don't you think today is the hottest day of the year?

845
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:09,018
- Out of all the days we filmed?
- Yes.

846
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:11,851
It will be really hot if we have to sleep outdoors today.

847
00:26:11,852 --> 00:26:13,281
How do you deal with that in summer?

848
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:16,022
- Sleeping outdoors...
- You sweat like crazy.

849
00:26:16,152 --> 00:26:17,351
If you lose the game,

850
00:26:17,352 --> 00:26:18,691
- you really have to sleep outdoors?
- Yes.

851
00:26:18,692 --> 00:26:20,921
They don't just film a short clip of you sleeping outdoors?

852
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:21,961
- No.
- You sleep outdoors for real?

853
00:26:21,962 --> 00:26:23,638
We really have to sleep outdoors. And it's so hot.

854
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:24,991
You'll be dead in the morning.

855
00:26:24,992 --> 00:26:26,091
Right. Once the sun comes up,

856
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:27,561
- Right.
- you're bound to wake up.

857
00:26:27,562 --> 00:26:28,901
You just have to get up.

858
00:26:28,902 --> 00:26:30,901
- Everyone, are you ready?
- Yes.

859
00:26:30,902 --> 00:26:32,302
- Let's get going.
- Vroom, vroom.

860
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:34,941
(Let's go for the refreshing luge ride.)

861
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:35,942
It's hot!

862
00:26:36,342 --> 00:26:37,771
But it's still beautiful.

863
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:40,282
This is where you will play the first game.

864
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:41,841
- Okay.
- This time,

865
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:43,352
two meal tickets are at stake.

866
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:46,321
This mission is called O-X Quiz Race.

867
00:26:46,322 --> 00:26:47,821
- What? Really?
- "O-X?"

868
00:26:47,822 --> 00:26:49,568
- This place is...
- We won't just be sledding down.

869
00:26:49,592 --> 00:26:53,362
You will see questions while you descend on the luge.

870
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:54,991
Read the question.

871
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:56,121
(It's possible to take out and eat a flea's liver.)

872
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:58,462
Pick either O or X and continue your route.

873
00:26:58,592 --> 00:27:00,402
Will there be a crossroads?

874
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:01,631
There will be a crossroads.

875
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:04,371
You may go either left or right.

876
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,831
- Depending on your answer.
- I see.

877
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,972
That sounds fun.

878
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:08,242
(Exclaiming)

879
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:10,388
- You have to answer well.
- There's a total of five questions.

880
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:12,512
If you fail the O-X quiz,

881
00:27:12,842 --> 00:27:15,782
ten seconds per question will be added to your record.

882
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:17,981
- It must be an individual game.
- The team...

883
00:27:17,982 --> 00:27:19,481
with the fastest total time wins.

884
00:27:19,482 --> 00:27:20,482
- Okay.
- Yes.

885
00:27:20,483 --> 00:27:22,251
In my opinion, it's better to be fast.

886
00:27:22,252 --> 00:27:23,252
Right.

887
00:27:23,253 --> 00:27:24,791
If you think, you'll take too long.

888
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:25,851
- That's worse.
- Exactly.

889
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,461
- Just keep moving.
- Of course.

890
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:28,691
- Just get it wrong?
- Don't try to understand.

891
00:27:28,692 --> 00:27:30,562
Don't try to understand. Keep moving.

892
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:32,561
Group One, please start.

893
00:27:32,562 --> 00:27:33,861
(Group 1 Match)

894
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,231
(Team A: Joon, SungJin versus Team B: DinDin, Wonpil)

895
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:36,431
Be careful. Don't get injured.

896
00:27:36,432 --> 00:27:37,771
- Right, don't get injured.
- Of course.

897
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:38,802
Wonpil.

898
00:27:39,102 --> 00:27:41,372
DAY6 members, whatever you do, don't hurt your throat.

899
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:42,671
Why?

900
00:27:42,672 --> 00:27:44,218
- They have to sing.
- Because we have to sing.

901
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:45,672
Dowoon says that all the time.

902
00:27:45,842 --> 00:27:47,411
Because we have to sing.

903
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:48,541
(We have to sing, so don't hurt your throat.)

904
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,681
That's very cruel.

905
00:27:49,682 --> 00:27:51,151
(DAY6's guardian of vocal cords)

906
00:27:51,152 --> 00:27:52,452
Here we go.

907
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:54,282
Get ready,

908
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:56,451
set...

909
00:27:56,452 --> 00:27:59,091
(Joon and SungJin versus DinDin and Wonpil)

910
00:27:59,092 --> 00:28:00,122
Okay.

911
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:02,162
Okay.

912
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:03,932
Let's go!

913
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,062
Hey, that's dangerous. Are you insane?

914
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:07,432
Let me go.

915
00:28:07,762 --> 00:28:09,032
Wonpil, what are you doing?

916
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:13,372
Why is it so slow?

917
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:16,572
Wonpil, why aren't you moving?

918
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,241
What is Wonpil doing?

919
00:28:18,242 --> 00:28:19,612
Wonpil gets scared easily.

920
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:23,381
(Wonpil, the slow starter, is currently in last place.)

921
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:25,681
(SungJin, DinDin, Joon, Wonpil)

922
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:26,782
Let's go.

923
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:30,691
(On the other hand, SungJin is in the lead.)

924
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:31,792
It feels refreshing.

925
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,762
(Thumbs-up)

926
00:28:34,762 --> 00:28:35,821
Go!

927
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:37,232
(This is fun.)

928
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:39,562
It's fast.

929
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:42,361
(Speed Racer SungJin is coming out strong from the start.)

930
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:44,402
(1st, SungJin, 2nd, Joon, 3rd, DinDin, 4th, Wonpil)

931
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,642
(The freshness makes them forget the heat.)

932
00:28:48,242 --> 00:28:49,371
Hey, Wonpil.

933
00:28:49,372 --> 00:28:50,641
(Wonpil, hurry up.)

934
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:51,711
(The 1st 3 players)

935
00:28:51,712 --> 00:28:53,541
- I'm going to block you.
- That's dangerous.

936
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:55,512
(They pass through the initial straight section.)

937
00:28:57,012 --> 00:28:58,012
My goodness.

938
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:01,281
(Shaking)

939
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:03,391
(Wonpil is the only one who's laid-back.)

940
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:07,892
(They approach the first sharp turn.)

941
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:12,532
(Drifting right behind Joon)

942
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:15,962
(SungJin notices the first question.)

943
00:29:16,302 --> 00:29:20,972
(It's possible to take out and eat a flea's liver.)

944
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:22,771
"It's possible to take out and eat a flea's liver."

945
00:29:22,772 --> 00:29:24,042
What does that mean?

946
00:29:24,272 --> 00:29:25,871
What does it mean? I'll just pick O.

947
00:29:25,872 --> 00:29:27,141
(It's possible to take out and eat a flea's liver.)

948
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:29,111
(Joon picks O for no reason.)

949
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:30,352
(Joon)

950
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:32,181
I don't know.

951
00:29:32,182 --> 00:29:35,221
(SungJin and DinDin pick X.)

952
00:29:35,222 --> 00:29:39,351
(Joon is the only one who picked O. He's currently in the lead.)

953
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:43,532
(SungJin is chasing right behind.)

954
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:49,231
(Even though we're on the same team, I won't lose.)

955
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:51,871
(Approaching the second turn)

956
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:55,872
(SungJin takes a drift on the inner line.)

957
00:29:56,102 --> 00:30:00,412
(SungJin overtakes Joon and takes the lead.)

958
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,151
(The second question appears.)

959
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:07,021
(The inventor of the air conditioner was called Carrier.)

960
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:11,021
(The inventor of the air conditioner was called Carrier.)

961
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:13,461
(SungJin picks O immediately.)

962
00:30:13,462 --> 00:30:14,891
"Carrier?"

963
00:30:14,892 --> 00:30:18,792
Isn't a carrier something you use for traveling?

964
00:30:19,232 --> 00:30:20,701
(Joon's Camera)

965
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:21,931
(Despite SungJin's beckoning, )

966
00:30:21,932 --> 00:30:24,071
(Joon picks X.)

967
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,432
(1st, SungJin, 2nd, Joon, 3rd, DinDin, 4th, Wonpil)

968
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:30,172
(Chasing right behind SungJin)

969
00:30:30,442 --> 00:30:33,942
(Currently in 2nd and 3rd places)

970
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,081
(The third question also appears.)

971
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:43,991
(This is Wonpil.)

972
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:46,392
(SungJin, the leader of DAY6, picks O right away.)

973
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:48,568
What was the question? I couldn't see it.

974
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:50,562
I don't know. What was the question?

975
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,162
Whatever. I'll pick X.

976
00:30:52,262 --> 00:30:55,102
(He's funny.)

977
00:30:56,132 --> 00:30:58,271
(By the way, where is Wonpil?)

978
00:30:58,272 --> 00:30:59,302
What's that?

979
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:01,941
"The inventor of the air conditioner was called Carrier."

980
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:04,412
This is correct.

981
00:31:05,512 --> 00:31:07,041
(Soon, he faces the third question.)

982
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,082
What is it?

983
00:31:08,382 --> 00:31:09,411
What?

984
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:10,611
(This is Wonpil.)

985
00:31:10,612 --> 00:31:11,812
Yes, that's me.

986
00:31:12,682 --> 00:31:15,521
(The answer is Dowoon.)

987
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:18,452
(We expect a lot of endearing goofiness.)

988
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:21,561
(We expect a 3-way battle in Group 1's match.)

989
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:23,191
(SungJin, DinDin, Joon)

990
00:31:23,192 --> 00:31:25,491
(The fourth question appears.)

991
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:29,332
(A snake appears when you whistle at night.)

992
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:31,632
This sounds like nonsense.

993
00:31:32,332 --> 00:31:33,402
Okay.

994
00:31:34,402 --> 00:31:35,602
Why did you pick O?

995
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:38,142
Are they stupid? The answer is definitely X.

996
00:31:38,972 --> 00:31:40,411
Why did they pick O?

997
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:42,781
(Will he be Zero Point Man again?)

998
00:31:42,782 --> 00:31:43,981
(A small octopus has 3 hearts.)

999
00:31:43,982 --> 00:31:45,382
"A small octopus has three hearts?"

1000
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:49,351
(Indecisive)

1001
00:31:49,352 --> 00:31:50,491
I don't know.

1002
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,251
(He picks O.)

1003
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:53,562
It's definitely X.

1004
00:31:53,962 --> 00:31:55,122
There's always one heart.

1005
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:58,532
(Only Joon picks X again.)

1006
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:01,301
(DinDin)

1007
00:32:01,302 --> 00:32:03,031
(Joon gets ahead of DinDin in the acceleration zone.)

1008
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:06,232
(1st, SungJin, 2nd, Joon, 3rd, DinDin, 4th, Wonpil)

1009
00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:08,171
Okay.

1010
00:32:08,172 --> 00:32:09,941
(Joon and SungJin are in 1st and 2nd places.)

1011
00:32:09,942 --> 00:32:11,442
Our team is doing well.

1012
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:14,181
(A storming race toward the finishing line)

1013
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,381
This is good!

1014
00:32:15,382 --> 00:32:17,582
(A storming race toward the finishing line)

1015
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:23,221
This is good!

1016
00:32:23,222 --> 00:32:24,522
(Very excited)

1017
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:28,992
(The speed is so fast that the camera drops.)

1018
00:32:29,392 --> 00:32:32,861
(The finish line is right in front of them.)

1019
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:34,001
Nice.

1020
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:35,301
(1st, SungJin, 3 minutes 48 seconds)

1021
00:32:35,302 --> 00:32:38,201
(2nd, Joon, 3 minutes 49 seconds)

1022
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:39,202
We won.

1023
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:40,501
(Did Team A dominate Group 1's match?)

1024
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:43,471
By the way, most of our answers were different.

1025
00:32:43,472 --> 00:32:45,741
What's more important is that Wonpil isn't coming.

1026
00:32:45,742 --> 00:32:47,241
Wonpil is usually slow.

1027
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:48,411
- Really?
- He tends to be a bit slow.

1028
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:49,412
He's very slow.

1029
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:51,352
- He's probably pondering.
- Really?

1030
00:32:51,782 --> 00:32:53,081
He's wondering if a small octopus has three hearts.

1031
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:54,252
But he's very late.

1032
00:32:55,282 --> 00:32:57,491
"A small octopus has three hearts?"

1033
00:32:57,492 --> 00:33:00,291
(As SungJin said, Wonpil tends to be slow.)

1034
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:01,292
No.

1035
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:03,631
There can't be three hearts.

1036
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:05,462
(Wonpil is fighting alone.)

1037
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:08,962
Why isn't anyone in front of me?

1038
00:33:11,272 --> 00:33:12,402
I'm the only one here.

1039
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:14,301
I'm too slow.

1040
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:16,472
(The lonely racer in the area)

1041
00:33:19,012 --> 00:33:20,912
(Even if he's in last place, he's still happy.)

1042
00:33:21,442 --> 00:33:23,681
I don't think Wonpil understood the game.

1043
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:24,782
I don't think so either.

1044
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:26,482
I mean...

1045
00:33:28,552 --> 00:33:32,952
(Without knowing how DinDin feels, he appears looking carefree.)

1046
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:35,122
This isn't how you play it.

1047
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:37,691
(3rd, DinDin, 3 minutes 54 seconds)

1048
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:39,961
(He arrives 1 minute later.)

1049
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:42,062
Wonpil, this isn't how you play this game.

1050
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:44,902
- Right?
- Everyone else was so fast.

1051
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,102
How did you go so fast? It was scary for me.

1052
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:48,402
It's supposed to be scary.

1053
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:51,072
What were you doing?

1054
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:53,241
- You have to take the risk.
- Right.

1055
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:56,142
Even if you got all the questions correct,

1056
00:33:56,612 --> 00:33:58,172
- It wouldn't work?
- it wouldn't work.

1057
00:33:58,312 --> 00:34:00,082
- He was being very careful.
- Right?

1058
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:02,582
While we're racing,

1059
00:34:02,922 --> 00:34:06,291
what are Se Yoon and Sae Ho up to?

1060
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:07,491
(They get curious about the other two.)

1061
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:09,721
You're a jerk. You turned the wheel toward yourself at the last moment.

1062
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:12,032
Of course. I did it instinctively.

1063
00:34:12,432 --> 00:34:13,802
He's a piece of trash.

1064
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:15,731
Moon Se Yoon is horrible.

1065
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:17,271
You got more rubber ducks than me.

1066
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:18,601
That's not true. Look.

1067
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:20,682
What's wrong with you? Do you owe something to DAY6?

1068
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,641
We have to eat, at least.

1069
00:34:22,642 --> 00:34:23,912
And I don't?

1070
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:26,742
- Goodness.
- Ten, nine,

1071
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:28,712
eight, seven,

1072
00:34:29,712 --> 00:34:31,451
- Hey, I couldn't reach it.
- six, five,

1073
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:32,652
- Darn it!
- four,

1074
00:34:33,152 --> 00:34:34,281
- three, - I got it.

1075
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:36,281
- This is my last chance.
- two, one.

1076
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,992
- It's my last chance.
- Time is up.

1077
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:41,362
We'll calculate when you get off the boat.

1078
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:43,968
There are negative amounts, and you can't take them out.

1079
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:45,261
- Of course not.
- Okay.

1080
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:47,202
(Sae Ho checks inside his basket.)

1081
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:50,101
Let's go back.

1082
00:34:50,102 --> 00:34:51,622
(He takes out a rubber duck secretly.)

1083
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,042
No.

1084
00:34:57,112 --> 00:34:58,372
This is worth a dollar.

1085
00:34:58,772 --> 00:35:01,142
What's wrong? Does the amount bother you?

1086
00:35:01,982 --> 00:35:03,551
(He fails to dump the negative amount.)

1087
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,382
That's life.

1088
00:35:05,512 --> 00:35:06,822
We made it through, my friend.

1089
00:35:07,282 --> 00:35:11,322
(They return on good terms.)

1090
00:35:11,992 --> 00:35:15,662
(Who earned more money to buy snacks?)

1091
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:17,731
- Se Yoon has no manners.
- Gosh.

1092
00:35:17,732 --> 00:35:18,791
I haven't seen such a jerk...

1093
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,301
- in a long time.
- He turned the wheel...

1094
00:35:20,302 --> 00:35:21,402
for his own good.

1095
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,471
You had no right to turn the wheel.

1096
00:35:23,472 --> 00:35:25,731
- We could've done it together.
- But we played a game!

1097
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:27,271
After the game, you said that I could also control the wheel!

1098
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:29,712
- You can't behave like this.
- You said I could, didn't you?

1099
00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:32,072
Let's go and calculate the total.

1100
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:35,411
Could each of you count the total?

1101
00:35:35,412 --> 00:35:36,812
- Okay.
- Let's count individually.

1102
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:38,782
- Fifty cents.
- You go first.

1103
00:35:39,582 --> 00:35:40,982
Another 50 cents, so it's a dollar.

1104
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:42,322
It's 1.5 dollars.

1105
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:44,092
Two dollars.

1106
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:45,852
Three dollars.

1107
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:47,292
Negative one dollar.

1108
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:48,921
So it's two dollars.

1109
00:35:48,922 --> 00:35:49,991
(Total: 2 dollars)

1110
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:51,552
- It's 2.5 dollars.
- It's 2.5 dollars.

1111
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:52,792
You got a lot.

1112
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:54,301
One more dollar.

1113
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:55,831
(Total: 3.5 dollars)

1114
00:35:55,832 --> 00:35:57,352
- It's 50 cents.
- You have 4 dollars.

1115
00:35:57,802 --> 00:35:59,702
- It's 5 dollars.
- You have 9 dollars.

1116
00:36:00,402 --> 00:36:01,702
Negative five dollars.

1117
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:03,912
- You have four dollars.
- Gosh.

1118
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:05,512
Sae Ho has...

1119
00:36:05,612 --> 00:36:07,441
a total of four dollars.

1120
00:36:07,442 --> 00:36:09,812
Don't take it off.

1121
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:11,811
You aren't allowed to do that.

1122
00:36:11,812 --> 00:36:14,381
- When did I take it off?
- You were trying to take it off.

1123
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:16,622
- Is it off or on?
- Look at this.

1124
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:18,951
- Stop it. I'll count.
- Let me go.

1125
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:20,021
- Go.
- I will.

1126
00:36:20,022 --> 00:36:21,022
Negative five dollars.

1127
00:36:21,023 --> 00:36:22,903
- It's 50 cents.
- You have negative 5 dollars.

1128
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:24,292
Negative five dollars.

1129
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:26,173
- Negative 4.5 dollars.
- Negative 4.5 dollars.

1130
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:28,232
- Four dollars.
- Give it to me.

1131
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:30,602
It's 3.5 dollars.

1132
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,532
- Negative...
- Three dollars.

1133
00:36:33,072 --> 00:36:34,671
Two dollars. Two dollars.

1134
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:35,901
(Total: Negative 2 dollars)

1135
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,911
- A dollar.
- Negative one dollar.

1136
00:36:36,912 --> 00:36:37,972
Negative one dollar.

1137
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,311
- Now it's zero.
- Zero.

1138
00:36:40,312 --> 00:36:41,382
It's starting now.

1139
00:36:41,842 --> 00:36:42,941
- It's 50 cents.
- It's 50 cents.

1140
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:45,081
(Total: 50 cents)

1141
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:46,111
- It's 50 cents.
- You have a dollar.

1142
00:36:46,112 --> 00:36:47,581
(Total: 1 dollar)

1143
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:48,781
- It's 50 cents.
- It's 1.5 dollars.

1144
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:49,782
(Total: 1.5 dollars)

1145
00:36:49,783 --> 00:36:50,791
Five dollars.

1146
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:51,891
- You have 6.5 dollars.
- You have 6.5 dollars.

1147
00:36:51,892 --> 00:36:52,922
It's 6.5 dollars.

1148
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:54,591
(Did Se Yoon earn 6.5 dollars?)

1149
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:55,692
Stay still.

1150
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:58,862
We have to make sure. Stay still.

1151
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:01,662
- Stop it. Don't play dirty.
- Look at this.

1152
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:04,372
- Don't touch me.
- I've been suspicious...

1153
00:37:04,732 --> 00:37:06,272
of your right hand for a while.

1154
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:08,702
(Squeaking)

1155
00:37:09,072 --> 00:37:10,372
What's this sound?

1156
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,071
Hold on. He earned 6.5 dollars?

1157
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:14,112
Yes, 6.5 dollars.

1158
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:15,782
(You're killing the duck.)

1159
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:18,111
It's negative ten dollars.

1160
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:19,782
(Destroying evidence)

1161
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:25,121
It's negative ten dollars.

1162
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:26,321
(Negative 10 dollars)

1163
00:37:26,322 --> 00:37:28,721
- It's negative 10 dollars.
- The total is negative 3.5 dollars.

1164
00:37:28,722 --> 00:37:30,731
(Se Yoon's total: Negative 3.5 dollars)

1165
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:32,532
We put out 100 rubber ducks.

1166
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:34,901
There was only 1 negative 10 dollars.

1167
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:36,871
(Se Yoon pulled off the 1 percent chance.)

1168
00:37:36,872 --> 00:37:39,132
Now, let's go to the cafe.

1169
00:37:39,472 --> 00:37:40,502
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1170
00:37:40,602 --> 00:37:42,501
(Hoya is excited after earning money for snacks.)

1171
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:43,542
You punk.

1172
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,971
We should get snacks together.

1173
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,372
Why are you being so selfish today?

1174
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:51,752
(Se Yoon also gets it.)

1175
00:37:52,052 --> 00:37:53,682
(Let's go and get snacks.)

1176
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:56,152
(After you, my friend.)

1177
00:37:56,422 --> 00:38:00,522
(Let's go and have some snacks.)

1178
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:02,491
(Glancing)

1179
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:04,762
I put negative one dollar in his basket.

1180
00:38:05,732 --> 00:38:06,761
(Actually, Sae Ho earned 5 dollars for snacks.)

1181
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:07,802
What did you say?

1182
00:38:08,232 --> 00:38:09,831
I'd like to feel some breeze now.

1183
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:11,171
I'm starting to sweat.

1184
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:12,332
- Are you?
- Yes.

1185
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:14,572
Is it possible to know the current ranking?

1186
00:38:15,572 --> 00:38:16,641
- Are you anxious?
- The current ranking?

1187
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:17,841
- Yes.
- He won't tell us.

1188
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,272
You'd better hear it from them.

1189
00:38:19,412 --> 00:38:21,111
It means that our team...

1190
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:22,741
(He's reminded of his younger member.)

1191
00:38:22,742 --> 00:38:25,081
- No.
- DinDin is sly, so he's good.

1192
00:38:25,082 --> 00:38:26,711
- He's sly?
- What I mean is...

1193
00:38:26,712 --> 00:38:28,181
that he's clever.

1194
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:29,851
(My role model talks about someone behind his back.)

1195
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,491
As soon as DinDin set out,

1196
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:32,492
he got grabbed.

1197
00:38:33,392 --> 00:38:35,661
- Right.
- Joon pulled him back immediately.

1198
00:38:35,662 --> 00:38:37,168
(He's always sly and clever when playing games.)

1199
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:39,562
Wonpil was away in the back.

1200
00:38:40,962 --> 00:38:42,662
- That's true.
- Wonpil is sweet.

1201
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:43,901
When I met DinDin...

1202
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:47,402
(Will Seon Ho and Young K overcome Wonpil's record?)

1203
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:49,801
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1204
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:52,212
(Team A: Jong Min, Dowoon versus Team B: Seon Ho, Young K)

1205
00:38:52,342 --> 00:38:53,782
Here we go. Get ready...

1206
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:55,511
Go slowly. Don't get injured.

1207
00:38:55,512 --> 00:38:56,811
- Let's not get injured.
- Set...

1208
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:58,611
- Don't cheat or get injured.
- Go.

1209
00:38:58,612 --> 00:39:00,581
- Let's go.
- Take your time.

1210
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:02,781
(Group 2's match starts.)

1211
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:04,191
Okay, don't get hurt.

1212
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,651
Everyone, stay out of the inner lane.

1213
00:39:06,652 --> 00:39:07,661
(Charging through the inside lane from the start)

1214
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:08,662
It feels cool.

1215
00:39:09,262 --> 00:39:11,182
- It feels really refreshing.
- It's refreshing.

1216
00:39:12,032 --> 00:39:13,061
It feels cool.

1217
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:18,371
(Young K takes the lead on the straight road.)

1218
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:19,401
This is fun.

1219
00:39:19,402 --> 00:39:22,702
(So far, there's no huge gap among the four.)

1220
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:24,312
This feels cool.

1221
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:27,882
Wait for me.

1222
00:39:30,812 --> 00:39:32,781
(My goodness)

1223
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:35,981
(1st, Young K, 2nd, Seon Ho, 3rd, Dowoon, 4th, Jong Min)

1224
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:37,221
(Suddenly, Jong Min stops.)

1225
00:39:37,222 --> 00:39:38,752
You dropped something.

1226
00:39:42,262 --> 00:39:43,262
Why isn't it moving?

1227
00:39:43,263 --> 00:39:45,703
(There's Wonpil in Group 1, and there's Jong Min in Group 2.)

1228
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:50,061
(Will he be in last place from the start?)

1229
00:39:50,062 --> 00:39:54,802
(The gap in the distance is significant already.)

1230
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:56,671
(Young K is the 1st to arrive at the 1st question.)

1231
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,111
(It's possible to take out and eat a flea's liver.)

1232
00:39:58,112 --> 00:39:59,142
"A flea's liver?"

1233
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:02,842
Is it possible or not?

1234
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:05,082
Is it possible or not?

1235
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,612
I have no idea.

1236
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,052
(He guesses and picks O.)

1237
00:40:08,882 --> 00:40:11,152
(Dowoon, who's chasing after him, picks X.)

1238
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:15,162
It's moving so fast.

1239
00:40:15,462 --> 00:40:20,032
(Little Jong Min is struggling on his own.)

1240
00:40:20,702 --> 00:40:23,971
(Shaking)

1241
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:29,001
(Turtle Racer Jong Min is as slow as Wonpil.)

1242
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:30,241
(Young K, Seon Ho)

1243
00:40:30,242 --> 00:40:36,811
(On the other hand, Young K and Seon Ho are cruising.)

1244
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:39,381
(Young K)

1245
00:40:39,382 --> 00:40:43,222
(At this rate, they could make up for Wonpil's record.)

1246
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:48,761
(Dowoon is right behind them.)

1247
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:50,161
(1st, Young K, 2nd, Seon Ho, 3rd, Dowoon, 4th, Jong Min)

1248
00:40:50,162 --> 00:40:55,261
(Seon Ho is right in front of him.)

1249
00:40:55,262 --> 00:41:00,371
(This team's only hope is Dowoon.)

1250
00:41:00,372 --> 00:41:01,542
Why isn't it moving?

1251
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:07,241
(Dowoon's luge suddenly stopped.)

1252
00:41:07,242 --> 00:41:08,481
(Dowoon)

1253
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:12,082
(He's getting farther away.)

1254
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:17,821
(He tries everything.)

1255
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:18,952
Goodness.

1256
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:24,062
(His luge doesn't budge at all.)

1257
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:30,231
(Dowoon's role model appears.)

1258
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:32,631
(Checking the third question)

1259
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:33,802
"This is Wonpil?"

1260
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:35,702
Wonpil...

1261
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:38,872
What does "This is Wonpil" mean?

1262
00:41:40,342 --> 00:41:41,642
What does "This is Wonpil" mean?

1263
00:41:44,982 --> 00:41:46,352
My team is doomed.

1264
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:49,881
(Jong Min also stops.)

1265
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,192
Why isn't it moving? How did they advance?

1266
00:41:54,462 --> 00:41:55,522
Is it Wonpil?

1267
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:57,692
- What?
- Is it the back of Wonpil?

1268
00:41:57,762 --> 00:41:58,832
I don't know.

1269
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:00,238
- Is it Wonpil from the back?
- Is it...

1270
00:42:00,262 --> 00:42:01,332
"Wonpil from the back?"

1271
00:42:01,862 --> 00:42:03,778
- You didn't see it?
- I didn't read the question.

1272
00:42:03,802 --> 00:42:05,322
Is it a photo of Wonpil from the back?

1273
00:42:05,972 --> 00:42:07,671
- I didn't get to see it.
- I don't think so.

1274
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:08,741
(This is Wonpil.)

1275
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:09,871
It looks like you.

1276
00:42:09,872 --> 00:42:12,541
(He's got a good eye.)

1277
00:42:12,542 --> 00:42:16,641
(Is Jong Min picking O while thinking that it's Dowoon?)

1278
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:17,712
Goodness.

1279
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:23,852
(Dumb and Dumber, Jong Min and Dowoon)

1280
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:28,122
(In the end, both of them are wrong.)

1281
00:42:30,222 --> 00:42:31,732
When you lean forward,

1282
00:42:32,232 --> 00:42:33,432
it descends.

1283
00:42:33,962 --> 00:42:35,001
Lean forward?

1284
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:36,762
(Okay, Jong Min.)

1285
00:42:37,332 --> 00:42:38,731
(Exclaiming)

1286
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:41,341
(1st, Young K, 2nd, Seon Ho, 3rd, Jong Min, 4th, Dowoon)

1287
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:44,042
(This is definitely a race.)

1288
00:42:44,472 --> 00:42:45,512
My gosh.

1289
00:42:46,072 --> 00:42:47,211
It's finally moving.

1290
00:42:47,212 --> 00:42:50,182
(This team seems doomed.)

1291
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:55,182
(Young K is racing forward.)

1292
00:42:55,982 --> 00:42:58,891
(Turning)

1293
00:42:58,892 --> 00:42:59,992
Everyone is slow.

1294
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:02,991
The color of the water is beautiful.

1295
00:43:02,992 --> 00:43:04,738
(Seon Ho is relaxed enough to enjoy the view.)

1296
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:08,401
(Team Young K widened the gap completely.)

1297
00:43:08,402 --> 00:43:12,032
(Team Young K widened the gap completely.)

1298
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:16,941
Nice.

1299
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:18,171
(1st, Young K, 4 minutes 2 seconds)

1300
00:43:18,172 --> 00:43:19,212
It's Seon Ho.

1301
00:43:19,442 --> 00:43:20,542
Nice.

1302
00:43:21,612 --> 00:43:22,642
Okay.

1303
00:43:22,942 --> 00:43:24,011
Nice.

1304
00:43:24,012 --> 00:43:25,151
(DinDin and Wonpil welcome them enthusiastically.)

1305
00:43:25,152 --> 00:43:26,651
Where are the others?

1306
00:43:26,652 --> 00:43:27,982
They're very late.

1307
00:43:28,452 --> 00:43:29,652
Why is the gap so big?

1308
00:43:30,822 --> 00:43:37,161
(1st, Young K, 2nd, Seon Ho, 3rd, Jong Min, 4th, Dowoon)

1309
00:43:37,162 --> 00:43:39,132
Jong Min, lean forward.

1310
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:47,071
(He's doing his best to lean forward.)

1311
00:43:47,072 --> 00:43:49,102
- It's Dowoon.
- Did they stop in the middle?

1312
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:50,302
Okay.

1313
00:43:50,972 --> 00:43:52,542
- What are you doing?
- Okay.

1314
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,911
Were you on a date with Jong Min?

1315
00:43:55,912 --> 00:43:57,852
Jong Min, this isn't the time to celebrate.

1316
00:43:58,182 --> 00:43:59,211
I'm sorry,

1317
00:43:59,212 --> 00:44:01,222
but are you on a family trip together?

1318
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:04,991
- Right.
- You could be Dowoon's dad.

1319
00:44:04,992 --> 00:44:06,452
Look at them.

1320
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:08,421
I did my best. This is good.

1321
00:44:08,422 --> 00:44:09,461
(The remaining factor is the number of correct answers.)

1322
00:44:09,462 --> 00:44:10,522
Please get up.

1323
00:44:11,532 --> 00:44:12,891
- Everyone.
- Is the difference big?

1324
00:44:12,892 --> 00:44:15,438
- I need my answers to be correct.
- The difference is reasonable.

1325
00:44:15,462 --> 00:44:17,422
- Is it reasonable?
- There must be a difference.

1326
00:44:17,472 --> 00:44:20,001
- I'll announce the answers.
- Okay.

1327
00:44:20,002 --> 00:44:21,401
- What about the small octopus?
- It's possible to take out...

1328
00:44:21,402 --> 00:44:22,402
and eat a flea's liver.

1329
00:44:22,403 --> 00:44:23,971
- Of course, it's possible.
- No, it's not.

1330
00:44:23,972 --> 00:44:25,371
- It's not edible, is it?
- But it's the liver.

1331
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:27,041
- The answer is X.
- It's X.

1332
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:28,141
- Right.
- It's impossible.

1333
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:29,981
- Why?
- It has no liver.

1334
00:44:29,982 --> 00:44:31,112
A flea doesn't have a liver.

1335
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,558
Because a flea doesn't have a liver.

1336
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:34,252
I thought the liver would be tiny.

1337
00:44:34,582 --> 00:44:36,481
- Next is...
- A flea can't detoxicate itself?

1338
00:44:36,482 --> 00:44:39,091
- Who invented the air conditioner?
- It's Carrier.

1339
00:44:39,092 --> 00:44:40,551
- It's correct.
- It's correct.

1340
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,862
- Right.
- Carrier is correct.

1341
00:44:42,062 --> 00:44:43,222
Carrier air conditioner.

1342
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:46,091
How would I know who Carrier is?

1343
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:47,508
(Everyone got it right except Seon Ho and Joon.)

1344
00:44:47,532 --> 00:44:49,102
Who was that from behind?

1345
00:44:49,232 --> 00:44:50,801
- From the back.
- Was it Wonpil?

1346
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:51,872
Wasn't it me?

1347
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:54,042
- Did you pick O?
- I picked O.

1348
00:44:55,102 --> 00:44:57,041
- This person from the back.
- It's Dowoon.

1349
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:58,412
- Exactly.
- Really?

1350
00:44:58,812 --> 00:45:00,371
- I said that it's Dowoon.
- You're right.

1351
00:45:00,372 --> 00:45:02,382
- I thought that it was me.
- But it's Dowoon.

1352
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:03,911
- It's Dowoon.
- Exactly.

1353
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:04,912
Seriously?

1354
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:06,581
(Jong Min, you got it wrong.)

1355
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:08,551
(Dowoon also got it wrong.)

1356
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:10,791
A snake appears when you whistle at night.

1357
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:11,991
- Of course.
- It's X.

1358
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:14,021
When you whistle in an apartment, it doesn't come out.

1359
00:45:14,022 --> 00:45:16,542
That's because there's no snake. If there is, it will come out.

1360
00:45:16,622 --> 00:45:19,292
It's asking whether snakes respond to whistling.

1361
00:45:19,962 --> 00:45:21,162
Right. The answer is O.

1362
00:45:21,902 --> 00:45:23,331
The answer is X.

1363
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:26,231
- Snakes detect sound...
- The sound of a flute.

1364
00:45:26,232 --> 00:45:27,501
By sensing vibrations in the ground.

1365
00:45:27,502 --> 00:45:28,541
The answer is X.

1366
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:30,341
They're bad at hearing actual sounds.

1367
00:45:30,342 --> 00:45:32,041
(Snakes cannot hear sounds.)

1368
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:34,011
Here's the last one. A small octopus has three hearts.

1369
00:45:34,012 --> 00:45:35,111
- It's X.
- It has three hearts.

1370
00:45:35,112 --> 00:45:36,341
This question was the hardest.

1371
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:37,581
- Does it have three?
- It's correct.

1372
00:45:37,582 --> 00:45:38,881
(The answer is O.)

1373
00:45:38,882 --> 00:45:39,882
A small octopus?

1374
00:45:39,883 --> 00:45:41,151
- A small octopus has...
- Really?

1375
00:45:41,152 --> 00:45:42,181
One systematic heart.

1376
00:45:42,182 --> 00:45:43,881
And it has two branchial hearts.

1377
00:45:43,882 --> 00:45:45,521
- It has a total of three hearts.
- Of course.

1378
00:45:45,522 --> 00:45:46,652
It's needless to say.

1379
00:45:47,462 --> 00:45:49,891
The person in 1st place among the 8 of you is...

1380
00:45:49,892 --> 00:45:51,231
(As a result, the 1st place among the 8 of them is...)

1381
00:45:51,232 --> 00:45:52,491
- The person in first place?
- It must be SungJin.

1382
00:45:52,492 --> 00:45:53,691
- SungJin?
- I think it's SungJin.

1383
00:45:53,692 --> 00:45:54,925
The first place among all of you is...

1384
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,027
The person in 1st place among the 8 of you is...

1385
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:57,651
(As a result, the 1st place among the 8 of them is...)

1386
00:45:57,652 --> 00:45:58,851
- The person in first place?
- It must be SungJin.

1387
00:45:58,852 --> 00:46:00,091
- SungJin?
- I think it's SungJin.

1388
00:46:00,092 --> 00:46:01,591
The first place among all of you is...

1389
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,592
SungJin.

1390
00:46:03,362 --> 00:46:04,821
- Nice!
- I knew it.

1391
00:46:04,822 --> 00:46:06,031
That's our team leader!

1392
00:46:06,032 --> 00:46:07,391
- I didn't know you were smart.
- I knew it.

1393
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:08,868
- You're smart.
- Oh, yes! We'll win.

1394
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:10,731
- I knew he would place first.
- You did a good job.

1395
00:46:10,732 --> 00:46:13,772
SungJin's record is 3 minutes 48.05 seconds.

1396
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:17,372
And he got two questions wrong.

1397
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:20,311
His final record is 4 minutes 8 seconds.

1398
00:46:20,312 --> 00:46:22,412
- Who placed last?
- Yes?

1399
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:25,002
- The last place of all is...
- Could it be me?

1400
00:46:25,072 --> 00:46:26,212
I think it's Jong Min.

1401
00:46:26,312 --> 00:46:27,841
- The person in last place is...
- Who is it?

1402
00:46:27,842 --> 00:46:28,911
- Wonpil?
- No way.

1403
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:30,141
- It's Jong Min.
- See?

1404
00:46:30,142 --> 00:46:33,352
(Jong Min placed last.)

1405
00:46:34,282 --> 00:46:35,551
- I'm relieved.
- That's good. We can relax now.

1406
00:46:35,552 --> 00:46:37,028
- That means our team won.
- It's not me.

1407
00:46:37,052 --> 00:46:38,721
- The second to last place is...
- I think we'll win.

1408
00:46:38,722 --> 00:46:39,722
Dowoon.

1409
00:46:40,322 --> 00:46:42,151
- That's great. What a relief.
- Both are on the other team.

1410
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:43,698
- You're better than me.
- Six minutes twenty seconds.

1411
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:45,602
- I think we won.
- Six minutes twenty seconds.

1412
00:46:45,922 --> 00:46:48,092
- So...
- Gosh.

1413
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:51,231
- We'll enjoy the food.
- This is driving me nuts.

1414
00:46:51,232 --> 00:46:52,901
- As for this team...
- I feel no suspense.

1415
00:46:52,902 --> 00:46:54,631
- We won.
- I think we won.

1416
00:46:54,632 --> 00:46:56,741
- Although SungJin placed first...
- "Although."

1417
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:58,002
- Nice!
- "Although."

1418
00:46:58,472 --> 00:47:00,542
Shall we call this team Team Young K?

1419
00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:02,511
- Team Youngpil.
- Team Youngpil.

1420
00:47:02,512 --> 00:47:04,411
- Team Youngpil.
- Name your team too, please.

1421
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:05,682
- Team Youngpil?
- Team Dojin.

1422
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:07,088
- Team Dojin, it is.
- Team Dojin?

1423
00:47:07,112 --> 00:47:08,981
As a result of the O-X Quiz Race,

1424
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:10,451
- Team Youngpil won.
- Oh, yes!

1425
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,081
(Team Youngpil wins the O-X Quiz Race.)

1426
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:13,121
- Do we have a big gap?
- Nice!

1427
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:15,051
- We'll enjoy the food.
- The gap is...

1428
00:47:15,052 --> 00:47:17,921
Team Youngpil's record is 19 minutes 9 seconds.

1429
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:19,638
- That's quite short.
- It's 19 minutes 9 seconds.

1430
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:21,661
- Yes. And...
- That's a good record.

1431
00:47:21,662 --> 00:47:24,502
Team Dojin's record is 22 minutes 6 seconds.

1432
00:47:25,932 --> 00:47:27,471
- There's a big record gap.
- Wonpil was like this.

1433
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:28,472
That's a big gap.

1434
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:30,141
(These two widened the gap.)

1435
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:33,442
We'll go and meet the two members who left the group earlier.

1436
00:47:33,672 --> 00:47:35,972
- We won!
- We did a great job.

1437
00:47:36,212 --> 00:47:38,581
- We gained 2 portions of food.
- We got 2 meal tickets.

1438
00:47:38,582 --> 00:47:40,688
- We got two meal tickets.
- The food will be delicious.

1439
00:47:40,712 --> 00:47:43,152
- Gosh, it's hot.
- Goodness, it's really hot.

1440
00:47:43,482 --> 00:47:45,442
- It's so hot.
- You should drink a lot of water.

1441
00:47:45,622 --> 00:47:46,651
Right. You should drink water on a hot day like this.

1442
00:47:46,652 --> 00:47:48,012
Or else, you might get dehydrated.

1443
00:47:48,552 --> 00:47:49,892
I think this patch works.

1444
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:51,321
Yes, I think...

1445
00:47:51,322 --> 00:47:53,592
- it cools the skin.
- Right.

1446
00:47:56,062 --> 00:47:57,202
This is fun.

1447
00:47:57,902 --> 00:47:59,022
- Are you having fun?
- Yes.

1448
00:47:59,672 --> 00:48:01,331
- Watching it is fun too.
- Really?

1449
00:48:01,332 --> 00:48:02,852
(Young Hyun finds 2 Days 1 Night fun.)

1450
00:48:03,042 --> 00:48:04,442
This will be a good memory.

1451
00:48:04,942 --> 00:48:06,912
- Being on this show?
- Yes, I'm sure it'll be.

1452
00:48:07,312 --> 00:48:11,182
This is our first time being on a variety show like this.

1453
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:13,651
When things are hard, they become more memorable.

1454
00:48:13,652 --> 00:48:15,811
(The optimistic Wonpil)

1455
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:18,582
How many missions do you usually do on a day?

1456
00:48:18,822 --> 00:48:21,822
We keep playing games until we go to bed.

1457
00:48:21,992 --> 00:48:24,492
- As many games as time allows?
- Correct.

1458
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:27,562
That sounds nice.

1459
00:48:28,692 --> 00:48:31,431
- It's not over yet.
- I think we're back where we were.

1460
00:48:31,432 --> 00:48:32,432
I think you're right.

1461
00:48:33,572 --> 00:48:34,831
I want to have a cup of iced Americano.

1462
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:37,312
(They'll let us have something when we go to the cafe, right?)

1463
00:48:37,402 --> 00:48:39,042
Young K said he wanted a cup of coffee.

1464
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:43,211
- He wants something to drink.
- Young K said that.

1465
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,458
(He confesses his honest feelings.)

1466
00:48:44,482 --> 00:48:45,682
I sure am hungry.

1467
00:48:45,782 --> 00:48:46,982
Oh, I want some ice cream.

1468
00:48:47,282 --> 00:48:48,282
That looks delicious.

1469
00:48:48,283 --> 00:48:49,781
- Cement ice cream? It looks good.
- Cement ice cream.

1470
00:48:49,782 --> 00:48:51,522
I want to try cement ice cream.

1471
00:48:54,252 --> 00:48:55,291
Bye.

1472
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:57,622
(Can they have dessert as they wish?)

1473
00:48:59,322 --> 00:49:00,662
- You're here.
- You're here.

1474
00:49:01,862 --> 00:49:03,301
- We're back.
- It's so cool in here.

1475
00:49:03,302 --> 00:49:05,002
- What?
- Hello.

1476
00:49:05,432 --> 00:49:06,672
- We won.
- You're here.

1477
00:49:07,032 --> 00:49:08,701
- Did our team win?
- Yes, we won.

1478
00:49:08,702 --> 00:49:11,301
- We won? Oh, yes! Great job!
- We got two meal tickets.

1479
00:49:11,302 --> 00:49:12,542
- We won.
- Okay!

1480
00:49:13,172 --> 00:49:16,312
(You guys lost too.)

1481
00:49:16,682 --> 00:49:18,381
- Really?
- We have nothing to say.

1482
00:49:18,382 --> 00:49:19,882
(Feeling bitter)

1483
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,011
Those who went for the luge ride wondered...

1484
00:49:22,012 --> 00:49:23,581
- what the two were doing.
- That's right.

1485
00:49:23,582 --> 00:49:26,821
To have some snacks with you,

1486
00:49:26,822 --> 00:49:29,792
they played a game on a duck boat to earn an allowance.

1487
00:49:31,392 --> 00:49:32,461
That's great!

1488
00:49:32,462 --> 00:49:33,792
(You earned a lot, right?)

1489
00:49:34,162 --> 00:49:37,132
- Sae Ho earned 4 dollars.
- I earned 4 dollars.

1490
00:49:37,902 --> 00:49:39,871
- If we have four dollars...
- Listen to Se Yoon's record.

1491
00:49:39,872 --> 00:49:41,178
- I earned four dollars.
- Then we can have...

1492
00:49:41,202 --> 00:49:42,432
As for Se Yoon,

1493
00:49:43,072 --> 00:49:44,401
he gained minus 3.5 dollars.

1494
00:49:44,402 --> 00:49:46,442
- We'll enjoy the snack.
- All right!

1495
00:49:47,072 --> 00:49:49,042
- Pardon?
- Thank you!

1496
00:49:49,312 --> 00:49:50,741
We rode a duck boat.

1497
00:49:50,742 --> 00:49:52,681
And there were rubber ducks floating on the water.

1498
00:49:52,682 --> 00:49:55,011
- We had to use a net...
- We scooped up the rubber ducks.

1499
00:49:55,012 --> 00:49:56,081
To scoop up the rubber ducks.

1500
00:49:56,082 --> 00:49:57,581
Se Yoon showed such bad manners.

1501
00:49:57,582 --> 00:50:00,091
- You're in no position to say that.
- You showed such bad manners.

1502
00:50:00,092 --> 00:50:01,791
- You sabotaged me...
- Don't be ridiculous.

1503
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:03,261
- when I tried to scoop up...
- Stop putting on a show.

1504
00:50:03,262 --> 00:50:05,322
I'm not lying. You slapped me like this earlier.

1505
00:50:07,262 --> 00:50:10,262
(That sounds so satisfying.)

1506
00:50:10,902 --> 00:50:12,102
(Did you just hit me?)

1507
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:13,632
- What's wrong with you?
- Ouch!

1508
00:50:15,802 --> 00:50:17,772
Se Yoon, stop! No!

1509
00:50:19,342 --> 00:50:20,441
- What's wrong with you?
- Ouch!

1510
00:50:20,442 --> 00:50:23,381
(Screaming)

1511
00:50:23,382 --> 00:50:26,612
(A beautiful page of youth)

1512
00:50:27,212 --> 00:50:31,482
(That was funny.)

1513
00:50:31,582 --> 00:50:32,651
We were planning this.

1514
00:50:32,652 --> 00:50:34,151
- You guys planned it?
- After shouting in turns...

1515
00:50:34,152 --> 00:50:35,351
- Hit me.
- Ouch!

1516
00:50:35,352 --> 00:50:39,531
(The professional entertainers came up with the skit while waiting.)

1517
00:50:39,532 --> 00:50:40,591
- Like this? Okay.
- Yes.

1518
00:50:40,592 --> 00:50:43,152
Young K said he'd do his best if he got something cool to drink.

1519
00:50:43,632 --> 00:50:46,132
One cup of iced Americano would be really nice.

1520
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:48,412
Give me some ice cream, please.

1521
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:49,841
Right. He'll have ice cream.

1522
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:51,978
- We'll have cement ice cream.
- Cement ice cream, please.

1523
00:50:52,002 --> 00:50:54,441
Their signature ice cream is 6.5 dollars.

1524
00:50:54,442 --> 00:50:56,111
(Sad news)

1525
00:50:56,112 --> 00:50:58,341
We should try cement ice cream since we're here.

1526
00:50:58,342 --> 00:51:00,011
Then let's play a random game.

1527
00:51:00,012 --> 00:51:01,681
Give us nine cups of cement ice cream...

1528
00:51:01,682 --> 00:51:03,442
- and one cup of real cement.
- Real cement?

1529
00:51:03,822 --> 00:51:05,052
(Do we have to go that far?)

1530
00:51:05,382 --> 00:51:08,852
- Yes, real cement. Let's do it.
- Real cement?

1531
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:11,362
Seriously, I mean, DAY6 is here.

1532
00:51:11,422 --> 00:51:14,092
Right. They're doing their best to make our show fun.

1533
00:51:14,692 --> 00:51:16,361
- Come on. DAY6 is here.
- Then...

1534
00:51:16,362 --> 00:51:19,531
(You will give us ice cream, right?)

1535
00:51:19,532 --> 00:51:22,601
Then we'll... We're not supposed to give you this,

1536
00:51:22,602 --> 00:51:24,871
but we'll give each team a cup of ice cream and iced Americano...

1537
00:51:24,872 --> 00:51:26,201
so you can share them with your team members.

1538
00:51:26,202 --> 00:51:27,841
- That sounds good.
- Thank you.

1539
00:51:27,842 --> 00:51:28,842
Thank you!

1540
00:51:29,812 --> 00:51:31,211
We'll have to play rock-paper-scissors...

1541
00:51:31,212 --> 00:51:33,092
to decide who eats first. You know that, right?

1542
00:51:33,712 --> 00:51:35,551
(We'll have to compete again?)

1543
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:37,581
Is he still your role model after seeing him like this?

1544
00:51:37,582 --> 00:51:39,062
I've never seen him like this before.

1545
00:51:40,192 --> 00:51:42,592
(He's learning about variety shows at every moment.)

1546
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:45,192
It looks good.

1547
00:51:45,722 --> 00:51:47,261
There's a piece of marshmallow too.

1548
00:51:47,262 --> 00:51:48,808
It'll be a little hard to share the marshmallow.

1549
00:51:48,832 --> 00:51:50,631
I want to eat one.

1550
00:51:50,632 --> 00:51:52,972
(Nutty black sesame ice cream with toasted marshmallow)

1551
00:51:53,232 --> 00:51:54,831
- Look at the marshmallow.
- Oh, my.

1552
00:51:54,832 --> 00:51:55,952
I thought it was cuttlefish.

1553
00:51:56,542 --> 00:51:57,641
- Impressive.
- Hand it over here.

1554
00:51:57,642 --> 00:51:59,372
It's so realistic. Look at the details.

1555
00:51:59,612 --> 00:52:02,241
- The spoons look like shovels.
- Shovels.

1556
00:52:02,242 --> 00:52:03,612
Oh, they look like shovels.

1557
00:52:03,682 --> 00:52:04,911
- It's black sesame.
- Oh, my.

1558
00:52:04,912 --> 00:52:08,112
(Sweet scent)

1559
00:52:09,252 --> 00:52:12,651
(He has a bite of marshmallow.)

1560
00:52:12,652 --> 00:52:14,691
(And then he has a bite of ice cream.)

1561
00:52:14,692 --> 00:52:15,851
- It's good.
- Indeed.

1562
00:52:15,852 --> 00:52:17,398
- It's good just as it is.
- It's good.

1563
00:52:17,422 --> 00:52:19,522
- It's so good.
- It tastes so good.

1564
00:52:20,692 --> 00:52:21,862
It's very soft.

1565
00:52:22,332 --> 00:52:23,812
- It's very soft.
- It's really good.

1566
00:52:23,962 --> 00:52:25,332
It tastes like black sesame.

1567
00:52:25,502 --> 00:52:26,671
It's black sesame ice cream.

1568
00:52:26,672 --> 00:52:28,231
(That's natural as it's black sesame ice cream.)

1569
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:29,302
No wonder.

1570
00:52:30,742 --> 00:52:31,842
Eat it all.

1571
00:52:32,972 --> 00:52:35,172
(Eating)

1572
00:52:35,842 --> 00:52:37,141
(Meanwhile, Young K, the iced Americano lover...)

1573
00:52:37,142 --> 00:52:38,282
More ice cream will come.

1574
00:52:40,982 --> 00:52:42,082
Here's your coffee.

1575
00:52:45,352 --> 00:52:46,491
(He finally has a sip of coffee.)

1576
00:52:46,492 --> 00:52:47,622
It's good.

1577
00:52:49,092 --> 00:52:50,891
(He even licks the skewer.)

1578
00:52:50,892 --> 00:52:52,172
- It's really good.
- It's good.

1579
00:52:53,092 --> 00:52:54,561
It's so good.

1580
00:52:54,562 --> 00:52:56,862
(Where is their next destination?)

1581
00:52:57,702 --> 00:52:58,731
Oh, my.

1582
00:52:58,732 --> 00:53:02,102
Counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

1583
00:53:02,172 --> 00:53:04,102
Why is this seat empty? Will no one sit here?

1584
00:53:04,672 --> 00:53:06,872
- Can we sit in the front seat?
- Will no one sit here?

1585
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,242
Then I'll sit there.

1586
00:53:09,112 --> 00:53:10,342
This will be fun. Awesome.

1587
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:12,042
(He hits his head.)

1588
00:53:13,212 --> 00:53:14,212
My gosh.

1589
00:53:14,952 --> 00:53:16,011
He's unique.

1590
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:17,421
(Dowoon can't stop showing his charming sloppiness.)

1591
00:53:17,422 --> 00:53:18,452
Are we good to go?

1592
00:53:18,922 --> 00:53:21,891
Shall we leave now? Shall we? Okay.

1593
00:53:21,892 --> 00:53:23,522
(Chuckling)

1594
00:53:24,022 --> 00:53:26,382
- I really like Se Yoon.
- We don't know where we're going.

1595
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:28,361
You all put on your seat belts, right?

1596
00:53:28,362 --> 00:53:29,532
- Yes, we did.
- Yes.

1597
00:53:30,202 --> 00:53:32,561
- Let's go.
- Hold on tight

1598
00:53:32,562 --> 00:53:34,931
(Setting off excitedly)

1599
00:53:34,932 --> 00:53:37,201
Are you happy with your team members so far?

1600
00:53:37,202 --> 00:53:39,342
- Yes, I'm really happy!
- Of course, we are!

1601
00:53:39,872 --> 00:53:43,642
(The three members answered right away...)

1602
00:53:44,412 --> 00:53:46,611
(while the luge champion stayed quiet.)

1603
00:53:46,612 --> 00:53:47,881
- SungJin, are you happy too?
- He...

1604
00:53:47,882 --> 00:53:49,411
Yes.

1605
00:53:49,412 --> 00:53:50,721
Are you happy with your team members?

1606
00:53:50,722 --> 00:53:51,881
Yes.

1607
00:53:51,882 --> 00:53:54,751
Would you like a chance to change team members?

1608
00:53:54,752 --> 00:53:56,051
Yes... What?

1609
00:53:56,052 --> 00:53:57,192
(Tempted)

1610
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,021
(Laughing)

1611
00:53:59,022 --> 00:54:02,592
It's so nice to have more people in the group like this.

1612
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:05,732
- It feels like a picnic.
- Right.

1613
00:54:06,602 --> 00:54:08,031
- Is this automatic?
- Sorry?

1614
00:54:08,032 --> 00:54:09,402
- Is this automatic?
- Yes.

1615
00:54:09,842 --> 00:54:11,001
How are you feeling now?

1616
00:54:11,002 --> 00:54:12,871
- I like hanging out with people.
- Where did you go?

1617
00:54:12,872 --> 00:54:14,341
You're a good fit for 2 Days 1 Night.

1618
00:54:14,342 --> 00:54:16,071
I actively go on trips too.

1619
00:54:16,072 --> 00:54:17,412
- Oh, my. Really?
- Yes.

1620
00:54:17,742 --> 00:54:20,581
Do you guys go on an outing together or something like that?

1621
00:54:20,582 --> 00:54:22,781
- We go on trips together often.
- Really?

1622
00:54:22,782 --> 00:54:24,251
- We go on trips often.
- The four of you?

1623
00:54:24,252 --> 00:54:25,252
- Yes.
- Yes.

1624
00:54:25,253 --> 00:54:27,921
Just the four of you? Without anyone else?

1625
00:54:27,922 --> 00:54:29,091
- That's right. Just the four of us.
- Nice.

1626
00:54:29,092 --> 00:54:31,191
- That's not easy.
- Right.

1627
00:54:31,192 --> 00:54:32,221
(They have a strong bond.)

1628
00:54:32,222 --> 00:54:34,061
It's been 20 years since KOYOTE debuted.

1629
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,938
Have you ever gone on a trip with your group members?

1630
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:37,162
- Just the three of us?
- Yes.

1631
00:54:37,532 --> 00:54:39,301
- "Just the 3 of us?"
- "Just the 3 of us?"

1632
00:54:39,302 --> 00:54:41,182
He gave you his answer. "Just the three of us?"

1633
00:54:41,772 --> 00:54:42,972
How about just the two of you?

1634
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:44,101
Just the two of us?

1635
00:54:44,102 --> 00:54:45,741
(He hates the idea.)

1636
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:46,971
- Alone?
- Alone?

1637
00:54:46,972 --> 00:54:48,041
Yes, alone.

1638
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:50,042
- Just KOYOTE.
- He goes on trips alone.

1639
00:54:51,282 --> 00:54:52,941
How many years ago did you guys meet for the first time?

1640
00:54:52,942 --> 00:54:54,211
The members...

1641
00:54:54,212 --> 00:54:55,911
- The 3 of us...
- It's been about 15 years.

1642
00:54:55,912 --> 00:54:58,521
- It's been 15 or 16 years.
- It's been over 15 years?

1643
00:54:58,522 --> 00:55:00,291
How long did you train for at the agency?

1644
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:01,751
- For 5 years.
- For about 6 years.

1645
00:55:01,752 --> 00:55:02,752
- That's a long time.
- Really?

1646
00:55:02,753 --> 00:55:04,321
SungJin set up the band.

1647
00:55:04,322 --> 00:55:05,521
Oh, you set up the band?

1648
00:55:05,522 --> 00:55:06,531
(Did SungJin set up DAY6?)

1649
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:08,052
- It's because I can't dance.
- I see.

1650
00:55:08,332 --> 00:55:10,901
So you picked the ones who couldn't dance?

1651
00:55:10,902 --> 00:55:13,201
- No, it wasn't like that...
- SungJin was such a great vocalist,

1652
00:55:13,202 --> 00:55:16,941
- so it would be a waste of talent.
- I see.

1653
00:55:16,942 --> 00:55:18,801
So the agency decided...

1654
00:55:18,802 --> 00:55:20,771
- to set up a new band.
- "Let's give it a try."

1655
00:55:20,772 --> 00:55:21,948
(That's how the first boy band from JYP Entertainment was created.)

1656
00:55:21,972 --> 00:55:23,211
SungJin, did you know...

1657
00:55:23,212 --> 00:55:25,742
that Young K and Wonpil would join your band?

1658
00:55:25,982 --> 00:55:27,982
Well... At one point,

1659
00:55:28,352 --> 00:55:30,351
it did cross my mind that it would happen that way.

1660
00:55:30,352 --> 00:55:31,621
- Really?
- Yes.

1661
00:55:31,622 --> 00:55:33,492
When I was practicing dancing so hard?

1662
00:55:33,992 --> 00:55:36,291
He and I were going to debut in a dance group.

1663
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:37,621
(Young K and Wonpil were trainees for an idol group.)

1664
00:55:37,622 --> 00:55:39,931
Dowoon also learned the basic dance moves.

1665
00:55:39,932 --> 00:55:40,962
Really?

1666
00:55:41,392 --> 00:55:44,331
It sounds like we could have a dance battle against you guys.

1667
00:55:44,332 --> 00:55:45,561
- We're all very confident.
- Yes, that's possible...

1668
00:55:45,562 --> 00:55:47,601
I mean, I'm pretty sure you guys are better than us.

1669
00:55:47,602 --> 00:55:48,602
(They have no intention to win at all.)

1670
00:55:48,603 --> 00:55:50,871
We have Jong Min, so we can win a dance battle.

1671
00:55:50,872 --> 00:55:52,371
Jong Min, you can still do a windmill.

1672
00:55:52,372 --> 00:55:54,271
- Really?
- He can still do a windmill.

1673
00:55:54,272 --> 00:55:55,571
- Is that true?
- Of course.

1674
00:55:55,572 --> 00:55:56,611
(I can still do a windmill.)

1675
00:55:56,612 --> 00:55:59,281
Dowoon wants to learn how to do a windmill.

1676
00:55:59,282 --> 00:56:00,681
- Really?
- Oh, that's right.

1677
00:56:00,682 --> 00:56:01,911
He wants to learn breakdancing.

1678
00:56:01,912 --> 00:56:03,011
(The youngest member and drummer wants to learn to dance.)

1679
00:56:03,012 --> 00:56:04,451
Jong Min, can you...

1680
00:56:04,452 --> 00:56:05,481
- I'll show you.
- Okay.

1681
00:56:05,482 --> 00:56:06,552
Really?

1682
00:56:07,652 --> 00:56:13,732
(Next week, Kim Jong Min's windmill class will open.)

1683
00:56:14,962 --> 00:56:16,731
How about we listen to songs by DAY6?

1684
00:56:16,732 --> 00:56:17,931
- Sounds great.
- Yes!

1685
00:56:17,932 --> 00:56:20,131
I'm not lying. My favorite song by DAY6 is...

1686
00:56:20,132 --> 00:56:22,472
"I Like You." When the song was released...

1687
00:56:22,602 --> 00:56:25,871
When I met my wife, I just couldn't get myself...

1688
00:56:25,872 --> 00:56:27,572
to tell her how I felt about her.

1689
00:56:27,972 --> 00:56:29,141
Sae Ho, sing a little bit of the song.

1690
00:56:29,142 --> 00:56:30,982
(Sing the song with the emotion you had then!)

1691
00:56:31,812 --> 00:56:34,211
(He seems sentimental already.)

1692
00:56:34,212 --> 00:56:36,922
The lyrics still make me feel emotional.

1693
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:38,251
- Sae Ho, here we go.
- Here we go.

1694
00:56:38,252 --> 00:56:39,522
(The chorus will begin.)

1695
00:56:40,392 --> 00:56:41,551
(I like)

1696
00:56:41,552 --> 00:56:44,391
(You)

1697
00:56:44,392 --> 00:56:47,432
(Vocalizing)

1698
00:56:48,032 --> 00:56:50,961
(I tried to hold it back)

1699
00:56:50,962 --> 00:56:53,872
(Singing at the top of his lungs.)

1700
00:56:55,032 --> 00:56:57,802
(Surprised)

1701
00:56:59,242 --> 00:57:00,871
(Disgusted)

1702
00:57:00,872 --> 00:57:03,712
- I can't stand it.
- I hate hearing him sing.

1703
00:57:04,242 --> 00:57:06,682
(His face is so red.)

1704
00:57:07,512 --> 00:57:08,512
This is so nice.

1705
00:57:08,513 --> 00:57:10,552
(Young K purifies their ears with his voice.)

1706
00:57:11,482 --> 00:57:14,421
(He's run out of energy.)

1707
00:57:14,422 --> 00:57:16,292
You must love her sincerely.

1708
00:57:16,552 --> 00:57:18,191
- You must love her so much.
- You could feel his sincerity.

1709
00:57:18,192 --> 00:57:21,291
- Young K, can you please sing...
- With the original singer's voice.

1710
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:22,561
A little bit of the chorus of "I Like You?"

1711
00:57:22,562 --> 00:57:23,878
- Shall I sing the song?
- Yes, please.

1712
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:25,902
We need to hear the original singer sing the song.

1713
00:57:26,562 --> 00:57:31,372
(I like you)

1714
00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:39,042
(The heart-wrenching voice with a rock spirit)

1715
00:57:40,452 --> 00:57:42,052
Is this the same song that Sae Ho sang?

1716
00:57:42,282 --> 00:57:45,481
(Sae Ho suddenly starts singing.)

1717
00:57:45,482 --> 00:57:47,822
(Imitating Sae Ho)

1718
00:57:50,862 --> 00:57:52,761
(You should refrain yourself a little.)

1719
00:57:52,762 --> 00:57:55,061
- There are a few songs I like.
- Okay.

1720
00:57:55,062 --> 00:57:57,162
One is included in Wonpil's solo album.

1721
00:57:57,302 --> 00:57:58,302
The one with the beautiful lyrics you told me about?

1722
00:57:58,303 --> 00:57:59,731
- "A Journey."
- Right, "A Journey."

1723
00:57:59,732 --> 00:58:02,601
- Was it played on our show before?
- That song is so beautiful.

1724
00:58:02,602 --> 00:58:03,642
All right.

1725
00:58:03,742 --> 00:58:04,941
This is such a good song.

1726
00:58:04,942 --> 00:58:06,811
- Wonpil released this song...
- Yes.

1727
00:58:06,812 --> 00:58:08,371
Before he enlisted in the military.

1728
00:58:08,372 --> 00:58:09,372
Oh, really?

1729
00:58:09,373 --> 00:58:11,493
At the end of the song, it goes, "I'll be back soon."

1730
00:58:20,492 --> 00:58:23,128
The lyrics are about how he felt before enlisting in the military.

1731
00:58:23,152 --> 00:58:25,321
"It's time to carry the bag I packed and open the door."

1732
00:58:25,322 --> 00:58:29,591
And it's also for those who are about to have a fresh start in life.

1733
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:31,431
The song's release overlapped...

1734
00:58:31,432 --> 00:58:33,431
- with the Summer Games.
- They overlapped.

1735
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:34,471
It was a good cheer song as well.

1736
00:58:34,472 --> 00:58:35,712
The chorus part is really good.

1737
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,552
(If you please)

1738
00:58:52,922 --> 00:58:55,052
(Wish me luck)

1739
00:58:55,252 --> 00:58:56,622
(For my future)

1740
00:58:57,322 --> 00:58:58,421
It's the perfect song to hear...

1741
00:58:58,422 --> 00:58:59,961
- during the Summer Games.
- It's so great.

1742
00:58:59,962 --> 00:59:01,031
(When I come back after seasons change)

1743
00:59:01,032 --> 00:59:02,862
It's so good.

1744
00:59:03,902 --> 00:59:07,401
(I will have become a better self)

1745
00:59:07,402 --> 00:59:09,972
(Look forward to it)

1746
00:59:11,472 --> 00:59:12,571
It's such a great song.

1747
00:59:12,572 --> 00:59:14,042
Your pitch is perfect.

1748
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:15,542
(Laughing)

1749
00:59:16,572 --> 00:59:17,612
That's a relief.

1750
00:59:19,312 --> 00:59:22,911
(The medley of great songs by DAY6 continued after that.)

1751
00:59:22,912 --> 00:59:26,481
(The medley of great songs by DAY6 continued after that.)

1752
00:59:26,482 --> 00:59:27,491
It sounds even better when they sing live.

1753
00:59:27,492 --> 00:59:31,521
(The medley of great songs by DAY6 continued after that.)

1754
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:35,731
(The medley of great songs by DAY6 continued after that.)

1755
00:59:35,732 --> 00:59:38,961
(The medley of great songs by DAY6 continued after that.)

1756
00:59:38,962 --> 00:59:40,032
The solo part!

1757
00:59:41,532 --> 00:59:42,532
That was so great.

1758
00:59:42,932 --> 00:59:44,671
- That was fun.
- It's a great song.

1759
00:59:44,672 --> 00:59:45,942
(It's fun to sing in the car.)

1760
00:59:46,742 --> 00:59:49,772
SungJin, can we hear you sing this time?

1761
00:59:50,842 --> 00:59:52,241
I want to hear you sing too.

1762
00:59:52,242 --> 00:59:53,752
I wonder if we can hear him sing.

1763
00:59:54,182 --> 00:59:55,251
I'm not sure.

1764
00:59:55,252 --> 00:59:56,311
I wanted to hear him sing.

1765
00:59:56,312 --> 00:59:58,272
(The unedited live performance in the moving car)

1766
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:00,022
(Right now!)

1767
01:00:04,822 --> 01:00:07,562
(Mellow)

1768
01:00:08,432 --> 01:00:10,362
(Impressed)

1769
01:00:14,502 --> 01:00:18,242
(It's Wonpil's turn.)

1770
01:00:19,702 --> 01:00:21,311
(Getting goosebumps)

1771
01:00:21,312 --> 01:00:22,312
My hand!

1772
01:00:24,342 --> 01:00:25,912
His voice is powerful.

1773
01:00:26,812 --> 01:00:27,952
If so!

1774
01:00:28,652 --> 01:00:29,711
Let's go!

1775
01:00:29,712 --> 01:00:32,352
- One, two, three, go!
- Welcome to the show

1776
01:00:34,192 --> 01:00:39,691
(The part that everyone sings together)

1777
01:00:39,692 --> 01:00:42,692
(Covering his mouth in amazement)

1778
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:43,831
(Seon Ho's camera)

1779
01:00:43,832 --> 01:00:47,632
(I can't believe DAY6 is singing in front of me.)

1780
01:00:48,172 --> 01:00:51,271
(I promise this one thing)

1781
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:54,672
(I will give you my everything)

1782
01:00:55,272 --> 01:00:58,212
(I will make sure your eyes are set on me)

1783
01:00:58,682 --> 01:01:02,152
(I will stand here looking at you)

1784
01:01:02,382 --> 01:01:04,952
- Everyone, I can see the ocean.
- Look at the ocean.

1785
01:01:05,182 --> 01:01:07,421
(Oh, my. Look at the ocean.)

1786
01:01:07,422 --> 01:01:08,821
Look at that. Gosh.

1787
01:01:08,822 --> 01:01:09,892
That's refreshing.

1788
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:14,392
(The vast ocean unfolds before their eyes.)

1789
01:01:24,772 --> 01:01:29,311
(The next page of DAY6 to be opened on the refreshing beach)

1790
01:01:29,312 --> 01:01:33,482
(The next page of DAY6 to be opened on the refreshing beach)

1791
01:01:36,412 --> 01:01:40,852
(What will happen here?)

1792
01:01:40,952 --> 01:01:42,191
We should go over there.

1793
01:01:42,192 --> 01:01:43,591
We're going to the beach.

1794
01:01:43,592 --> 01:01:44,621
(They arrived at the romantic blue ocean.)

1795
01:01:44,622 --> 01:01:46,521
The ocean looks so picturesque.

1796
01:01:46,522 --> 01:01:48,202
(They arrived at the romantic blue ocean.)

1797
01:01:48,492 --> 01:01:49,732
Chuam Beach?

1798
01:01:50,232 --> 01:01:51,302
It's beautiful.

1799
01:01:51,532 --> 01:01:53,331
I see some things floating in the water. Are they for us?

1800
01:01:53,332 --> 01:01:54,612
I'm sure we'll play a game here.

1801
01:01:55,172 --> 01:01:57,472
I see a buoy. We'll definitely play a game here.

1802
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:58,942
I'm sure DAY6 will do well.

1803
01:01:59,202 --> 01:02:01,472
- They're great at everything.
- We won't do well.

1804
01:02:01,642 --> 01:02:03,212
Show your passion. Dive into the water.

1805
01:02:03,242 --> 01:02:05,311
I almost forgot. That's right.

1806
01:02:05,312 --> 01:02:07,192
- Show your passion.
- I'm an energetic person.

1807
01:02:07,252 --> 01:02:08,312
Let's go!

1808
01:02:09,282 --> 01:02:10,282
Let's do this!

1809
01:02:10,283 --> 01:02:12,082
- This doesn't feel real.
- Hey.

1810
01:02:12,622 --> 01:02:15,051
We drive somewhere, and there's a different background.

1811
01:02:15,052 --> 01:02:17,921
And then we move again, and arrive at a beach.

1812
01:02:17,922 --> 01:02:20,662
Don't worry. We've only recorded 15 percent.

1813
01:02:20,832 --> 01:02:22,391
- We have a long way to go.
- Exactly.

1814
01:02:22,392 --> 01:02:24,061
(Cheerful)

1815
01:02:24,062 --> 01:02:26,932
You just have to play 17 more games before you go home.

1816
01:02:27,672 --> 01:02:29,571
- Seventeen games?
- Cheer up.

1817
01:02:29,572 --> 01:02:31,048
You only played the luge game. That's all.

1818
01:02:31,072 --> 01:02:33,641
This place is called Chuam Beach.

1819
01:02:33,642 --> 01:02:35,341
- Chuam Beach?
- Chuam Beach is nice.

1820
01:02:35,342 --> 01:02:36,642
(It's beautiful.)

1821
01:02:37,142 --> 01:02:40,412
(The combination of the white sand and the blue ocean)

1822
01:02:41,782 --> 01:02:44,722
(Chuam Beach is loved by tourists every year.)

1823
01:02:46,122 --> 01:02:48,551
- Do you see the rock behind you?
- What's it called?

1824
01:02:48,552 --> 01:02:49,822
- That rock is...
- Chuam Rock?

1825
01:02:50,152 --> 01:02:51,891
What Chuam Beach is famous for...

1826
01:02:51,892 --> 01:02:53,831
and one of the best sunrise watching spots in Korea.

1827
01:02:53,832 --> 01:02:54,961
It's called Candlestick Rock.

1828
01:02:54,962 --> 01:02:56,291
- Oh, Candlestick Rock?
- Candlestick Rock?

1829
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:58,132
- It's magnificent.
- That's Candlestick Rock?

1830
01:02:59,862 --> 01:03:00,971
It's amazing.

1831
01:03:00,972 --> 01:03:03,901
Through this game, you can gain two meal tickets.

1832
01:03:03,902 --> 01:03:05,202
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

1833
01:03:05,272 --> 01:03:07,471
- We'll be okay if we have four.
- That'd be great.

1834
01:03:07,472 --> 01:03:08,472
- Six would be even better.
- Right.

1835
01:03:08,473 --> 01:03:11,481
The game you'll play this time is The Duck Squad.

1836
01:03:11,482 --> 01:03:12,712
- The Duck Squad?
- Yes.

1837
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:14,951
- The Duck Squad?
- It's a 5-on-5 team match.

1838
01:03:14,952 --> 01:03:16,681
- You already decided the teams.
- Yes.

1839
01:03:16,682 --> 01:03:19,021
You'll have 3 rounds. The 1st team to win 2 rounds wins.

1840
01:03:19,022 --> 01:03:20,051
- Okay.
- Got it.

1841
01:03:20,052 --> 01:03:22,252
You'll play all rounds of the game in swim fins.

1842
01:03:23,492 --> 01:03:24,691
There are so many games.

1843
01:03:24,692 --> 01:03:26,221
There are so many games in the world.

1844
01:03:26,222 --> 01:03:27,468
There's another thing we have to use.

1845
01:03:27,492 --> 01:03:29,732
- We'll sleep soundly tonight.
- I...

1846
01:03:29,962 --> 01:03:33,331
The first round is The Swim Fins Ocean Operation.

1847
01:03:33,332 --> 01:03:35,702
We have to go to the buoy wearing swim fins, right?

1848
01:03:35,772 --> 01:03:37,271
Each team will run on the sand...

1849
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:38,901
while carrying an inflatable boat.

1850
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:40,001
- A boat?
- Yes.

1851
01:03:40,002 --> 01:03:41,441
You have to carry your boat...

1852
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,541
and take the flag floating in the water.

1853
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:45,641
The first team to come back wins.

1854
01:03:45,642 --> 01:03:47,911
- That sounds exhausting.
- So we all will go into the water.

1855
01:03:47,912 --> 01:03:49,251
But once you go into the water,

1856
01:03:49,252 --> 01:03:51,451
one of the five team members should get on the boat.

1857
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,951
- Just one member?
- Only the member on the boat...

1858
01:03:53,952 --> 01:03:54,991
can take the flag.

1859
01:03:54,992 --> 01:03:56,121
(Only the member on the boat can obtain the flag.)

1860
01:03:56,122 --> 01:03:58,521
How about we recommend the member to be on the boat...

1861
01:03:58,522 --> 01:03:59,621
for the other team?

1862
01:03:59,622 --> 01:04:01,261
- You served in the Navy.
- I served in the Navy.

1863
01:04:01,262 --> 01:04:02,631
He served in the Navy. He's the man of the ocean.

1864
01:04:02,632 --> 01:04:04,561
- The Navy!
- Weren't you a boatswain's mate?

1865
01:04:04,562 --> 01:04:05,761
- Yes, I was a boatswain's mate.
- Right.

1866
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:08,301
- Then you should be on the boat.
- A boatswain's mate.

1867
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:10,001
I have my own strategy too.

1868
01:04:10,002 --> 01:04:11,271
- All right.
- You have a plan?

1869
01:04:11,272 --> 01:04:12,841
I freedive, you know.

1870
01:04:12,842 --> 01:04:14,071
(The man who freedives)

1871
01:04:14,072 --> 01:04:15,441
- Right. You freedive.
- I scuba dive too.

1872
01:04:15,442 --> 01:04:17,382
He freedives. He dives in the water freely.

1873
01:04:17,612 --> 01:04:19,511
It's shallow enough for a little kid to stand.

1874
01:04:19,512 --> 01:04:20,852
And you'll freedive there?

1875
01:04:21,052 --> 01:04:22,511
(You can walk in the water here.)

1876
01:04:22,512 --> 01:04:23,851
That kid is standing there.

1877
01:04:23,852 --> 01:04:25,081
I'm sure that the kid is taller than you.

1878
01:04:25,082 --> 01:04:26,182
(Embarrassed)

1879
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,491
You have to put on a different type of mic.

1880
01:04:29,492 --> 01:04:31,622
- Oh, dear.
- We won't change our clothes?

1881
01:04:31,722 --> 01:04:32,962
We should take off our clothes.

1882
01:04:33,092 --> 01:04:34,432
Take off your clothes, everyone.

1883
01:04:34,532 --> 01:04:35,592
Or else, we can't do this.

1884
01:04:36,032 --> 01:04:37,731
- This is our team's boat.
- SungJin.

1885
01:04:37,732 --> 01:04:38,901
(Distributing the swim fins)

1886
01:04:38,902 --> 01:04:39,962
Joon.

1887
01:04:40,832 --> 01:04:41,871
(Taking off his socks)

1888
01:04:41,872 --> 01:04:42,912
It's better without socks.

1889
01:04:44,602 --> 01:04:45,602
Seon Ho.

1890
01:04:45,603 --> 01:04:47,123
You keep helping me find items for me.

1891
01:04:47,442 --> 01:04:49,971
- DinDin must be lighter.
- Shall I get on the boat?

1892
01:04:49,972 --> 01:04:51,212
Right. You can get on the boat.

1893
01:04:51,342 --> 01:04:53,481
You were trained in the Navy,

1894
01:04:53,482 --> 01:04:54,511
- so go into the water.
- Here.

1895
01:04:54,512 --> 01:04:56,181
I think we can hold the rope to lift the boat up.

1896
01:04:56,182 --> 01:04:57,728
- We just go to the flag...
- But we'll be wearing swim fins.

1897
01:04:57,752 --> 01:04:59,181
Right. We can walk backward.

1898
01:04:59,182 --> 01:05:00,521
- On the sand?
- No, we'll walk forward.

1899
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:01,951
- We'll run forward on the sand.
- Okay. Got it.

1900
01:05:01,952 --> 01:05:03,128
We'll walk backward in the water.

1901
01:05:03,152 --> 01:05:05,191
I don't think we should walk backward. It's very short.

1902
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,192
But it'll still be hard to walk forward in them.

1903
01:05:06,192 --> 01:05:07,192
- Really?
- Yes.

1904
01:05:07,193 --> 01:05:08,392
Oh, gosh. My feet are hot.

1905
01:05:09,832 --> 01:05:11,312
Which one of us will get on the boat?

1906
01:05:12,062 --> 01:05:14,278
I might be slower than you. So how about I get on the boat?

1907
01:05:14,302 --> 01:05:15,432
How much do you weigh?

1908
01:05:15,772 --> 01:05:16,902
I weigh 85kg.

1909
01:05:19,042 --> 01:05:20,071
Actually, 48kg.

1910
01:05:20,072 --> 01:05:21,072
(Total disaster)

1911
01:05:21,073 --> 01:05:22,171
Each of my thighs weighs that much.

1912
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:23,532
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

1913
01:05:24,042 --> 01:05:25,402
No, Dowoon should get on the boat.

1914
01:05:25,482 --> 01:05:27,782
It's only right for Dowoon to get on the boat.

1915
01:05:27,812 --> 01:05:30,312
I'll do my best to get the flag.

1916
01:05:30,522 --> 01:05:31,782
- Let's go, Dowoon.
- Sure.

1917
01:05:32,122 --> 01:05:33,151
But where are we going?

1918
01:05:33,152 --> 01:05:34,552
- I mean, get on the boat.
- Right.

1919
01:05:34,952 --> 01:05:37,292
(I don't feel good about this.)

1920
01:05:38,492 --> 01:05:40,761
Are you all ready?

1921
01:05:40,762 --> 01:05:41,831
(DinDin and Dowoon will get on the boats.)

1922
01:05:41,832 --> 01:05:44,532
Dowoon, get on the boat as soon as we get in the water.

1923
01:05:44,702 --> 01:05:47,101
- What about me?
- The 2 of us will run at 1st.

1924
01:05:47,102 --> 01:05:49,201
- Okay.
- I'll run with him first.

1925
01:05:49,202 --> 01:05:50,702
- You mean at first?
- Yes.

1926
01:05:50,802 --> 01:05:52,242
- Seon Ho...
- But this is...

1927
01:05:52,702 --> 01:05:54,272
You should step back a little.

1928
01:05:54,442 --> 01:05:55,641
- Okay.
- What's going on?

1929
01:05:55,642 --> 01:05:57,441
- What's with you?
- Go back to your team.

1930
01:05:57,442 --> 01:05:59,162
It's no joke. He tries to keep us in check.

1931
01:05:59,312 --> 01:06:00,951
- Let's go!
- We can do this!

1932
01:06:00,952 --> 01:06:01,981
Let's get going.

1933
01:06:01,982 --> 01:06:03,851
- Bring it forward.
- No, grab the rope there.

1934
01:06:03,852 --> 01:06:05,581
- No, this is right.
- You all stay calm.

1935
01:06:05,582 --> 01:06:06,622
Stay calm?

1936
01:06:06,822 --> 01:06:08,292
Let's get this started. Ready?

1937
01:06:08,722 --> 01:06:09,951
Start.

1938
01:06:09,952 --> 01:06:11,392
You know what? Let's just run.

1939
01:06:12,815 --> 01:06:15,218
You're doing great!

1940
01:06:15,243 --> 01:06:16,522
- Bring it forward.
- No, grab the rope there.

1941
01:06:16,547 --> 01:06:17,884
- No, this is right.
- You all stay calm.

1942
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:18,909
Stay calm?

1943
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:20,579
Let's get this started. Ready?

1944
01:06:21,049 --> 01:06:22,278
Start.

1945
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,749
You know what? Let's just run.

1946
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:27,619
You're doing great!

1947
01:06:28,289 --> 01:06:30,989
(Running as fast as they can)

1948
01:06:31,259 --> 01:06:34,189
(As discussed, the two of them are running while carrying the boat)

1949
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:37,558
(Only Joon and SungJin are carrying the boat.)

1950
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:42,068
You're doing great!

1951
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:43,669
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1952
01:06:44,899 --> 01:06:46,209
Keep going!

1953
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,639
(Dowoon goes in the water first.)

1954
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:54,248
(Dowoon's camera)

1955
01:06:54,249 --> 01:06:56,948
(On the other hand, DinDin is one step behind them.)

1956
01:06:56,949 --> 01:06:58,219
Put the boat down.

1957
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:00,748
(The boat even got flipped.)

1958
01:07:00,749 --> 01:07:02,359
We have to flip the boat.

1959
01:07:03,389 --> 01:07:05,689
(Team Dojin's boat got flipped as well.)

1960
01:07:05,889 --> 01:07:07,488
(Chaos)

1961
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:09,098
(Dowoon's camera)

1962
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:12,029
(There's a hindrance.)

1963
01:07:12,899 --> 01:07:14,229
We got this.

1964
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:17,038
(Team Dojin flipped the boat.)

1965
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,069
- Okay.
- We got this.

1966
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:20,938
- Let's go!
- Let's go now.

1967
01:07:20,939 --> 01:07:22,139
(Dowoon got on the boat.)

1968
01:07:22,439 --> 01:07:23,678
(Team Dojin is going first toward the flag.)

1969
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:24,809
Just go!

1970
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:26,649
Let's go.

1971
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:30,019
(Trying their best)

1972
01:07:30,049 --> 01:07:31,378
- What?
- The boat shouldn't be flipped.

1973
01:07:31,379 --> 01:07:33,589
- Get on the boat.
- Get on the boat.

1974
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:36,418
(DinDin got on the boat.)

1975
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,319
It's better to go backwards.

1976
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:40,428
- Backwards.
- We can just go.

1977
01:07:40,429 --> 01:07:42,428
- Backwards.
- We can just go!

1978
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:47,228
Backwards.

1979
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,069
- Let's go.
- It's better to go this way.

1980
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:50,979
It doesn't matter. Let's just go this way.

1981
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:52,808
- Just keep going.
- Keep going as is.

1982
01:07:52,809 --> 01:07:54,369
- Backward...
- Let's go.

1983
01:07:55,369 --> 01:07:59,549
(Only those who are on the boat can grab the flag.)

1984
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:03,179
(Neck-and-neck)

1985
01:08:03,419 --> 01:08:06,619
(We can't tell which team is going to win.)

1986
01:08:06,889 --> 01:08:08,548
- Keep going in this direction.
- Hey, let's go.

1987
01:08:08,549 --> 01:08:09,859
Something got stuck...

1988
01:08:10,059 --> 01:08:11,158
(However, the two old men are falling behind.)

1989
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:12,259
Just keep going.

1990
01:08:13,129 --> 01:08:14,129
Let's go.

1991
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,258
(Going slowly)

1992
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:16,328
Keep going!

1993
01:08:16,329 --> 01:08:17,329
(Joon and SungJin are the only ones who are pushing the boat.)

1994
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:19,010
Having many people on a team isn't a plus.

1995
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:22,639
(Everyone on Team Youngpil is taking part.)

1996
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:26,039
(With all his strength)

1997
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:29,738
(Team Youngpil is speeding up.)

1998
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:32,139
Push the boat a little more.

1999
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:35,249
I got it! Let's go back!

2000
01:08:35,609 --> 01:08:37,018
Let's go back!

2001
01:08:37,019 --> 01:08:38,478
- Nice.
- Well done.

2002
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,018
- Let's go back now.
- Backwards.

2003
01:08:40,019 --> 01:08:42,759
- We're very fast.
- Push.

2004
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:44,888
(Team Dojin reached the flag right after the other team did.)

2005
01:08:44,889 --> 01:08:45,959
Push.

2006
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:47,958
- Let's go!
- Now, we go back.

2007
01:08:47,959 --> 01:08:49,199
(Team Dojin also got the flag.)

2008
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:52,999
(The team that returns first wins.)

2009
01:08:53,499 --> 01:08:54,799
- We're very fast.
- Push.

2010
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:57,699
They're coming to block us.

2011
01:08:58,069 --> 01:08:59,069
Backwards.

2012
01:08:59,309 --> 01:09:01,538
(Trying to get in the way)

2013
01:09:01,539 --> 01:09:03,879
(Splash attack)

2014
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:05,538
(It's a very close game.)

2015
01:09:05,539 --> 01:09:06,609
Yes!

2016
01:09:06,749 --> 01:09:08,408
- We're here.
- We're almost there.

2017
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:09,479
Keep pushing!

2018
01:09:10,849 --> 01:09:15,188
(Which team will be the winner?)

2019
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:16,489
Lift the boat now.

2020
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:18,188
- Lift it.
- Now, run!

2021
01:09:18,189 --> 01:09:20,028
- Keep going.
- Let's go! We're winning.

2022
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:21,058
(It's Team Youngpil.)

2023
01:09:21,059 --> 01:09:22,258
Let's go.

2024
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:25,429
(Trying their best to run back)

2025
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:31,199
(Getting exhausted from splashing water)

2026
01:09:33,139 --> 01:09:35,138
(Team Youngpil arrived first.)

2027
01:09:35,139 --> 01:09:36,308
We won!

2028
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:37,539
Okay!

2029
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:39,039
We won.

2030
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:40,648
(A daring race of the youth)

2031
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:41,779
You have to come in.

2032
01:09:42,519 --> 01:09:44,118
We can chill for a second.

2033
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:47,119
(We lost again.)

2034
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:50,689
(Dowoon drags the boat by himself.)

2035
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:51,818
(Game over)

2036
01:09:51,819 --> 01:09:53,529
That was a great game.

2037
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:55,929
I swallowed a lot of water.

2038
01:09:56,799 --> 01:09:58,658
(Out of breath)

2039
01:09:58,659 --> 01:10:00,168
This is exhausting.

2040
01:10:00,169 --> 01:10:01,599
- I know.
- Goodness.

2041
01:10:02,099 --> 01:10:03,368
We can't beat them.

2042
01:10:03,369 --> 01:10:04,599
(Staggering)

2043
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:09,069
I think I'm too old now.

2044
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:12,009
My legs are sore.

2045
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:16,219
(Mine too.)

2046
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,419
The result of the game.

2047
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:21,148
- Who won?
- Team Youngpil won.

2048
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:22,788
- Okay!
- Let's go.

2049
01:10:22,789 --> 01:10:24,688
- We won every game.
- We never lose.

2050
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:26,228
- I know.
- We never lose.

2051
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:27,229
We won again.

2052
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:29,329
What's the reason behind our defeat?

2053
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:31,958
I think you're shameless.

2054
01:10:31,959 --> 01:10:33,505
(You really are asking this because you don't know why?)

2055
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:36,239
See? He's an old man who can't even stand right now.

2056
01:10:37,139 --> 01:10:38,698
Let's be honest. You're an old man.

2057
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:39,708
(My body is aching.)

2058
01:10:39,709 --> 01:10:41,838
Do we have any other games where we can throw each other?

2059
01:10:41,839 --> 01:10:43,208
- Any physical games?
- Let's play physical games.

2060
01:10:43,209 --> 01:10:45,509
You see? We are all strong men, including SungJin.

2061
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:47,508
Let's play physical games.

2062
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,078
- Sure, let's play.
- Sure.

2063
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:51,148
I'm on a diet these days,

2064
01:10:51,149 --> 01:10:52,889
- so I don't really feel strong...
- Right.

2065
01:10:53,389 --> 01:10:54,749
- What is this?
- What?

2066
01:10:55,619 --> 01:10:57,488
(Entering)

2067
01:10:57,489 --> 01:10:58,888
Hey, I see ducks.

2068
01:10:58,889 --> 01:11:00,689
(Laughing)

2069
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:02,289
(Real ducks are here.)

2070
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:03,429
This is fun.

2071
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:05,929
Did you prepare the real ducks too?

2072
01:11:06,569 --> 01:11:08,169
Are we supposed to...

2073
01:11:08,329 --> 01:11:09,669
Cheer up, Wonpil.

2074
01:11:10,669 --> 01:11:11,799
You know...

2075
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:14,238
This gently reminds me of the time at the Navy boot camp.

2076
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,639
- Really?
- Yes, I'm serious.

2077
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,178
Well, everyone. Team Youngpil won.

2078
01:11:19,179 --> 01:11:20,809
- Yes.
- Nice.

2079
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:23,749
- Great.
- We can't keep winning like this.

2080
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:25,479
You should go easy on us, at least once.

2081
01:11:26,689 --> 01:11:28,295
This is the mission for the second round.

2082
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:29,988
- What is it?
- It's Swim Fins Fight.

2083
01:11:29,989 --> 01:11:31,188
- Okay.
- It's a fight.

2084
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:32,389
- Great.
- It's a fight.

2085
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:34,829
- I won't lose this time.
- Let's beat them all.

2086
01:11:34,989 --> 01:11:36,528
You know how to chicken fight, right?

2087
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:38,399
- Yes.
- Oh, chicken fight.

2088
01:11:38,529 --> 01:11:40,028
Oh, chicken fight.

2089
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,969
You can do a chicken fight while wearing swim fins.

2090
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:43,999
This will be tough.

2091
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,338
You have to win 2 out of 3 rounds.

2092
01:11:46,339 --> 01:11:47,339
(2 wins out of 3 rounds)

2093
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,908
We will have 2-on-2 games for the 1st 2 games.

2094
01:11:49,909 --> 01:11:52,108
It will be a 1-on-1 game for the last match.

2095
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:53,209
- Okay.
- Goodness.

2096
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:56,519
We have to come up with the players who can win first.

2097
01:11:56,649 --> 01:11:57,748
- Right.
- It's important to win first.

2098
01:11:57,749 --> 01:11:58,918
- It means nothing if we lose.
- Okay.

2099
01:11:58,919 --> 01:12:00,618
- If we can...
- Let him play first.

2100
01:12:00,619 --> 01:12:01,718
- Okay.
- Okay.

2101
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:03,495
Who plays this game better between the two of you?

2102
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:04,958
Wonpil plays it better than me.

2103
01:12:04,959 --> 01:12:06,688
- He's a better player.
- Really? How come?

2104
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,228
- Because you're tired?
- I think I just...

2105
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:09,558
DinDin and Young K should play first.

2106
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:10,559
- You start the game.
- Okay.

2107
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:11,559
- You start the game.
- Sure.

2108
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,228
- Then it's you two.
- Sure.

2109
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:14,628
I'll take a rest.

2110
01:12:14,629 --> 01:12:16,339
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

2111
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:17,599
- Okay.
- Okay.

2112
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:19,238
Who is playing this match?

2113
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:20,968
- You share your players first.
- No, you share.

2114
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:22,885
The players should step forward on the count of three.

2115
01:12:22,909 --> 01:12:24,409
One, two, three.

2116
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:27,408
- Goodness.
- They're strong players.

2117
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:29,208
- They're strong.
- We're in trouble.

2118
01:12:29,209 --> 01:12:30,819
- We got this.
- Yes, we got it.

2119
01:12:31,819 --> 01:12:32,888
We'll beat you.

2120
01:12:32,889 --> 01:12:35,219
I can feel that they are strong.

2121
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:37,819
It's about time we go easy on them.

2122
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:41,729
(DinDin is trying hard to look cool.)

2123
01:12:42,059 --> 01:12:44,398
When they try to attack us,

2124
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:45,729
it's better to help each other.

2125
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:46,968
You know when they attack...

2126
01:12:46,969 --> 01:12:49,069
DinDin will play it like...

2127
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:51,339
I will just go outside.

2128
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:54,738
SungJin, all they can do is run away.

2129
01:12:54,739 --> 01:12:56,139
Right, they will run away for sure.

2130
01:12:56,279 --> 01:12:58,409
They won't do anything. They'll run away for sure.

2131
01:12:58,579 --> 01:13:00,409
So you have to find the right time.

2132
01:13:00,749 --> 01:13:01,848
Ready?

2133
01:13:01,849 --> 01:13:03,249
(It's a chance to turn the tables.)

2134
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:05,948
DinDin will run for sure.

2135
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:07,519
Attack his front teeth.

2136
01:13:08,119 --> 01:13:09,718
Okay, you ready?

2137
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:10,819
That's a foul.

2138
01:13:10,989 --> 01:13:12,189
Let's go!

2139
01:13:12,289 --> 01:13:13,329
Okay.

2140
01:13:13,929 --> 01:13:16,228
(Let me show you what a winning duo looks like.)

2141
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:17,329
Start.

2142
01:13:17,799 --> 01:13:19,598
(The first match begins.)

2143
01:13:19,599 --> 01:13:21,499
(Hesitating)

2144
01:13:21,699 --> 01:13:23,839
- He's got it.
- Look.

2145
01:13:24,269 --> 01:13:25,839
They are intimidating.

2146
01:13:26,369 --> 01:13:28,708
Joon, that's right. Go next to him...

2147
01:13:28,709 --> 01:13:31,138
(Provoking)

2148
01:13:31,139 --> 01:13:32,338
(Getting closer)

2149
01:13:32,339 --> 01:13:33,348
What? Come.

2150
01:13:33,349 --> 01:13:35,048
What's with Young K? You should attack 1 person 1st.

2151
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:36,049
(DinDin, Young K, Joon, SungJin)

2152
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,448
(Surrounding)

2153
01:13:38,449 --> 01:13:41,188
SungJin, come and attack me. Come on, boy.

2154
01:13:41,189 --> 01:13:42,589
(Is SungJin turning toward DinDin?)

2155
01:13:42,649 --> 01:13:44,989
Don't attack DinDin first. It's a trap.

2156
01:13:45,589 --> 01:13:47,088
Go 1-on-1.

2157
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,358
Go 1-on-1.

2158
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:49,959
Isn't it hard? Come on.

2159
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:51,858
It will be over if you go outside the box.

2160
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:54,269
Just attack his back from the back.

2161
01:13:54,469 --> 01:13:55,828
- From the back.
- Push him out.

2162
01:13:55,829 --> 01:13:57,268
There you go. You got them cornered.

2163
01:13:57,269 --> 01:13:58,668
- You got them.
- It's over.

2164
01:13:58,669 --> 01:14:01,239
(Young K's camera)

2165
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:04,209
(Young K at risk)

2166
01:14:04,409 --> 01:14:07,579
(Colliding)

2167
01:14:09,309 --> 01:14:10,449
Oh, no!

2168
01:14:10,549 --> 01:14:12,078
What? Why is he at the back?

2169
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:13,249
(What on earth is going on?)

2170
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:16,219
(Joon is cornering Young K.)

2171
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:17,459
Goodness!

2172
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:19,388
Look at DinDin!

2173
01:14:19,389 --> 01:14:20,788
- DinDin!
- No, this can't be happening.

2174
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,559
(DinDin)

2175
01:14:22,589 --> 01:14:25,199
(Joon is eliminated as he's pushed by DinDin.)

2176
01:14:25,959 --> 01:14:28,599
(Young K was helping right next to him.)

2177
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:30,899
(He also gets eliminated.)

2178
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:33,238
- Reset.
- Are you out too?

2179
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:34,809
Hold on. Be careful.

2180
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:36,779
- Gosh.
- You're doing well.

2181
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:38,559
What's going on? It's over if you fall out?

2182
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:42,209
(DinDin versus SungJin)

2183
01:14:42,409 --> 01:14:44,579
End it against him. It's just him that's left.

2184
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:45,878
- You can win.
- End it against him.

2185
01:14:45,879 --> 01:14:47,479
It's just him that's left. You got this.

2186
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:49,919
- What?
- What?

2187
01:14:52,089 --> 01:14:54,229
- Gosh!
- What was that?

2188
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,359
- What was that?
- Hey!

2189
01:14:56,629 --> 01:14:58,929
- Hey!
- That looked pathetic.

2190
01:14:59,059 --> 01:15:01,368
(DinDin hit him slightly...)

2191
01:15:01,369 --> 01:15:03,798
(and was handed over the win.)

2192
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:05,599
(Flustered)

2193
01:15:06,069 --> 01:15:08,169
(Cheering)

2194
01:15:08,539 --> 01:15:10,108
(Team Youngpil wins the first battle.)

2195
01:15:10,109 --> 01:15:11,409
Nice!

2196
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:14,878
(Here's a reminder that they were the best team.)

2197
01:15:14,879 --> 01:15:16,148
We'll start right away.

2198
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:17,378
(Team Youngpil 1, Team Dojin 0)

2199
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:19,788
- Our plan went wrong as they lost.
- All of our plans went wrong.

2200
01:15:19,789 --> 01:15:21,195
Who knew that they would lose to DinDin?

2201
01:15:21,219 --> 01:15:22,888
We lost against their worst group.

2202
01:15:22,889 --> 01:15:24,888
- The next groups should enter now.
- Let's go.

2203
01:15:24,889 --> 01:15:26,829
I'll just end things before Sae Ho.

2204
01:15:27,129 --> 01:15:28,158
They were pathetic.

2205
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:29,798
- Those two look weak too.
- You can win this, right?

2206
01:15:29,799 --> 01:15:30,858
- Right.
- No.

2207
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,428
They don't expect much from them.

2208
01:15:32,429 --> 01:15:34,045
They're starting with all of the weak ones.

2209
01:15:34,069 --> 01:15:36,238
What will happen if we win again?

2210
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,068
Our plan totally went sideways.

2211
01:15:38,069 --> 01:15:39,368
Let's do this.

2212
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:40,608
Dowoon and I will go out next.

2213
01:15:40,609 --> 01:15:42,208
I won't be of much help.

2214
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:44,609
I will corner them, so you should take care of both of them.

2215
01:15:45,009 --> 01:15:46,009
Become a hero for us.

2216
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:47,978
After trying it, it seems like going to them first isn't good.

2217
01:15:47,979 --> 01:15:48,979
It isn't good to go to them first.

2218
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,518
It's definitely advantageous to stay still.

2219
01:15:50,519 --> 01:15:52,078
But he falls while staying still.

2220
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:53,148
Right.

2221
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:56,489
(He always fell on his own while staying still.)

2222
01:15:56,689 --> 01:15:57,858
(Stuck)

2223
01:15:57,859 --> 01:16:00,058
Then rush at them from the start. That's the right thing to do.

2224
01:16:00,059 --> 01:16:01,888
Let's hurry up and start!

2225
01:16:01,889 --> 01:16:03,428
- Okay.
- Please be understanding.

2226
01:16:03,429 --> 01:16:04,509
We will win no matter what.

2227
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:06,199
We haven't won yet.

2228
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:08,968
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2229
01:16:08,969 --> 01:16:10,098
It's Se Yoon?

2230
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:11,269
Look at Se Yoon's legs!

2231
01:16:11,539 --> 01:16:13,369
Those are all muscles. They're not fat.

2232
01:16:13,639 --> 01:16:15,309
We'll begin! Get ready!

2233
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:18,008
(Round 2 might become the decider.)

2234
01:16:18,009 --> 01:16:20,008
- Let's go, Dowoon!
- Let's go!

2235
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:21,248
- Let's go!
- Hang in there, Se Yoon!

2236
01:16:21,249 --> 01:16:22,378
Look at his legs.

2237
01:16:22,379 --> 01:16:24,249
(Determined)

2238
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,418
(Team Youngpil will take the win if they win this round.)

2239
01:16:26,419 --> 01:16:27,588
Do it comfortably.

2240
01:16:27,589 --> 01:16:28,819
Set.

2241
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:29,918
(Round 2 begins.)

2242
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,759
What? What's wrong with you?

2243
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:34,058
(Wonpil charges at Se Yoon right at the start.)

2244
01:16:34,059 --> 01:16:35,499
- What's wrong with you?
- Let's go!

2245
01:16:35,589 --> 01:16:37,758
(Flustered by the reckless attack)

2246
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,799
(Charging at him again)

2247
01:16:40,269 --> 01:16:41,599
- Nice!
- Gosh!

2248
01:16:41,899 --> 01:16:44,238
(Wonpil and Se Yoon get eliminated together.)

2249
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:45,868
Nice one.

2250
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:47,538
Nice!

2251
01:16:47,539 --> 01:16:49,708
(He gets eliminated without being able to utilize his thick legs.)

2252
01:16:49,709 --> 01:16:50,709
No!

2253
01:16:51,379 --> 01:16:52,439
Don't feel pressured.

2254
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:53,649
Let's go.

2255
01:16:53,779 --> 01:16:55,708
The way he's holding his leg looks off.

2256
01:16:55,709 --> 01:16:57,148
- Why is he holding it like that?
- Hurry up, Seon Ho.

2257
01:16:57,149 --> 01:16:58,318
That looks off.

2258
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:00,518
- He's looking shaky.
- Don't go, Seon Ho.

2259
01:17:00,519 --> 01:17:02,195
- Just do what you want.
- Don't go, Dowoon.

2260
01:17:02,219 --> 01:17:05,158
(Making a dive at him)

2261
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:06,229
Go for it.

2262
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:07,988
(Crashing down)

2263
01:17:07,989 --> 01:17:09,658
- What was that?
- His legs came down!

2264
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:10,728
- His foot hit the ground first!
- Hold on.

2265
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:12,228
- His foot hit the ground first.
- I'm serious.

2266
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:14,109
- We need a VAR review.
- We need a VAR review.

2267
01:17:14,169 --> 01:17:15,399
His foot hit the ground first.

2268
01:17:18,369 --> 01:17:20,409
(Seon Ho's foot hit the ground first.)

2269
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:24,438
Seon Ho's foot hit the ground first.

2270
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,178
- Right.
- Okay!

2271
01:17:26,179 --> 01:17:27,478
- Nice one!
- Yes!

2272
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:28,608
(Team Dojin wins Round 2 thanks to Dowoon.)

2273
01:17:28,609 --> 01:17:29,649
Nice one!

2274
01:17:30,349 --> 01:17:31,478
Nice!

2275
01:17:31,479 --> 01:17:33,418
Thank you so much. That was our first win.

2276
01:17:33,419 --> 01:17:36,019
You were the first person to charge at me.

2277
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,518
Everyone else ran away from me.

2278
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:38,988
- I'll give you that, Wonpil.
- Right.

2279
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:41,429
We'll go with Round Three now.

2280
01:17:41,889 --> 01:17:44,328
Sae Ho, make Jong Min's face dirty.

2281
01:17:44,329 --> 01:17:45,329
Okay.

2282
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,528
- We can do this.
- Think about the 90s.

2283
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:48,868
He was really good at this.

2284
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:51,038
This is the final round!

2285
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:52,568
- Okay.
- We played paper against rock.

2286
01:17:52,569 --> 01:17:53,569
Let's go!

2287
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:55,010
(The battle that decides the winner)

2288
01:17:55,769 --> 01:17:57,178
Gosh, I feel nervous!

2289
01:17:57,179 --> 01:17:58,608
This is the decider.

2290
01:17:58,609 --> 01:18:01,308
- This is for my younger brothers.
- Let's go!

2291
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:03,448
For my younger brothers who are all looking up to me.

2292
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:05,678
- Jong Min!
- This is for them.

2293
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,518
(Just trust me, my brothers.)

2294
01:18:07,519 --> 01:18:09,348
Jong Min has never done anything...

2295
01:18:09,349 --> 01:18:10,749
for someone else in his whole life.

2296
01:18:10,789 --> 01:18:12,019
We'll begin.

2297
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:13,389
They don't know that.

2298
01:18:13,629 --> 01:18:15,489
Please show us this time.

2299
01:18:15,989 --> 01:18:17,129
Get ready.

2300
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:20,099
- My brother!
- Set.

2301
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:21,328
Will it be okay?

2302
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:22,998
- Come on!
- Just be comfortable.

2303
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:25,139
- Let's go! Fight like a man.
- Come on!

2304
01:18:25,769 --> 01:18:27,708
- Let's go.
- The newlywed groom!

2305
01:18:27,709 --> 01:18:29,208
- Don't come near me!
- It's downhill.

2306
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:30,409
Go back up.

2307
01:18:31,079 --> 01:18:32,208
- Gosh!
- Attack him.

2308
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:33,509
- You can do it!
- Okay.

2309
01:18:33,579 --> 01:18:35,279
- Hold on.
- We won.

2310
01:18:35,379 --> 01:18:36,648
- You have to endure it.
- Okay.

2311
01:18:36,649 --> 01:18:38,079
- Gosh.
- Where are you going?

2312
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:40,688
(Sae Ho attacks again.)

2313
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:41,689
He's coming.

2314
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:43,288
- Let's go!
- Don't get pushed out!

2315
01:18:43,289 --> 01:18:44,319
Nice!

2316
01:18:45,689 --> 01:18:47,759
(Jong Min is in danger.)

2317
01:18:50,299 --> 01:18:51,628
Don't get pushed out!

2318
01:18:51,629 --> 01:18:52,698
(Dodging)

2319
01:18:52,699 --> 01:18:54,769
(Jong Min dodges the attack by turning his body.)

2320
01:18:55,069 --> 01:18:57,069
(Sae Ho loses.)

2321
01:18:57,569 --> 01:19:00,438
(We won!)

2322
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:03,339
(Our older brother is the best.)

2323
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:06,579
Why did you charge at him?

2324
01:19:06,649 --> 01:19:08,909
- Why did you charge at him?
- Yes!

2325
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:13,089
(Team Dojin becomes the final winner.)

2326
01:19:16,759 --> 01:19:19,089
What was that?

2327
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:23,129
- What happened to your face?
- Sae Ho!

2328
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:25,428
- Jong Min!
- You did your best, Sae Ho.

2329
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:27,228
- Jong Min...
- Gosh, that's impressive.

2330
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:28,729
Won for the 1st time in 18 years...

2331
01:19:29,029 --> 01:19:30,369
for his younger brothers.

2332
01:19:30,469 --> 01:19:32,438
- That's my role model.
- Why did I miss him?

2333
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:34,808
Round Three is very simple.

2334
01:19:34,809 --> 01:19:36,068
We'll just switch the cameras quickly.

2335
01:19:36,069 --> 01:19:37,079
All right.

2336
01:19:37,879 --> 01:19:39,208
- All right, everyone!
- Let's get ready!

2337
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:40,508
Stand right there while facing this way.

2338
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:41,548
- Okay.
- Okay.

2339
01:19:41,549 --> 01:19:43,319
- I'm hungry.
- I'm going to collapse today.

2340
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:45,479
- I'm hungry.
- Your faces have tanned.

2341
01:19:46,049 --> 01:19:47,689
The score is tied right now.

2342
01:19:48,249 --> 01:19:51,118
Round Three is Capture the Beachball.

2343
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,019
- What is that?
- Capture the Beachball?

2344
01:19:53,259 --> 01:19:54,788
All right.

2345
01:19:54,789 --> 01:19:56,428
The team that gets the beachball back there...

2346
01:19:56,429 --> 01:19:58,499
past the finish line first will be the winner.

2347
01:19:58,729 --> 01:19:59,969
- Let's go!
- Where is it?

2348
01:20:00,799 --> 01:20:03,298
(Capture the Beachball starts.)

2349
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,299
Let's go!

2350
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,338
(Sprinting to the max)

2351
01:20:07,339 --> 01:20:08,368
No!

2352
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:11,639
(They dive into the sea to secure the beachball.)

2353
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:12,879
No!

2354
01:20:13,149 --> 01:20:15,148
(Diving in)

2355
01:20:15,149 --> 01:20:16,748
Get ready for it.

2356
01:20:16,749 --> 01:20:17,878
- Gosh.
- Get ready.

2357
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:19,318
(I will secure the beachball.)

2358
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:20,319
Nice!

2359
01:20:20,489 --> 01:20:22,319
Throw it, Joon!

2360
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:24,119
Joon!

2361
01:20:24,889 --> 01:20:25,919
Throw it.

2362
01:20:26,389 --> 01:20:27,429
Here.

2363
01:20:27,459 --> 01:20:28,889
- Throw it.
- Here.

2364
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:30,398
- Over here.
- Here!

2365
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:32,729
Give it to Se Yoon!

2366
01:20:32,899 --> 01:20:34,999
No. Keep it with you.

2367
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,398
Keep it with you for a while.

2368
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:37,468
- Gosh!
- Keep it with you!

2369
01:20:37,469 --> 01:20:38,999
(Closing him down, Keeping it secure)

2370
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:41,568
(An intense face-off)

2371
01:20:41,569 --> 01:20:44,339
- Here!
- Go, Joon!

2372
01:20:44,909 --> 01:20:48,009
- Go, Joon!
- Get him!

2373
01:20:48,249 --> 01:20:50,018
- What?
- What?

2374
01:20:50,019 --> 01:20:51,718
- Go!
- What?

2375
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:53,388
- Go!
- Get him!

2376
01:20:53,389 --> 01:20:55,269
(Young K is waiting for him outside the water.)

2377
01:20:55,319 --> 01:20:56,758
- Young K!
- What?

2378
01:20:56,759 --> 01:20:59,059
Go!

2379
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:00,829
(Did he get caught?)

2380
01:21:01,129 --> 01:21:02,359
(Slipping)

2381
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:05,499
Go!

2382
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:07,268
What?

2383
01:21:07,269 --> 01:21:09,069
(He runs as fast as he can after losing him.)

2384
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:13,439
Gosh.

2385
01:21:13,709 --> 01:21:14,869
Yes!

2386
01:21:15,469 --> 01:21:16,709
He did it.

2387
01:21:16,979 --> 01:21:18,109
My gosh.

2388
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:20,649
Please! I really wanted to win.

2389
01:21:21,049 --> 01:21:22,148
I thought you would pass it at least once,

2390
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:23,395
but you kept it to yourself until the end.

2391
01:21:23,419 --> 01:21:25,555
- I thought they would lose it.
- You didn't trust anyone.

2392
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:26,888
(His teammates whom he can't trust at all)

2393
01:21:26,889 --> 01:21:28,518
You didn't trust anyone.

2394
01:21:28,519 --> 01:21:30,419
He took off his swim fins!

2395
01:21:30,789 --> 01:21:33,158
- That's cheating!
- You can't take them off!

2396
01:21:33,159 --> 01:21:34,329
They came off.

2397
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:35,658
Where are your swim fins?

2398
01:21:35,659 --> 01:21:36,798
(What? Where are my swim fins?)

2399
01:21:36,799 --> 01:21:38,058
He took off his swim fins!

2400
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,735
- That's cheating!
- We should play again!

2401
01:21:39,759 --> 01:21:41,719
It's against the rules to take off the swim fins.

2402
01:21:42,469 --> 01:21:43,899
That can't happen.

2403
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:45,568
Why didn't you take them off too?

2404
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:46,745
(His swim fins came off while running like crazy.)

2405
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:48,768
- Let's restart the match.
- Okay.

2406
01:21:48,769 --> 01:21:50,538
Joon used all of his strength...

2407
01:21:50,539 --> 01:21:51,985
that he had saved up for the rest of the day.

2408
01:21:52,009 --> 01:21:53,208
We should take the swim fins off then.

2409
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:55,148
- Without the swim fins?
- Let's take them off.

2410
01:21:55,149 --> 01:21:56,595
- Okay.
- They come off in the water.

2411
01:21:56,619 --> 01:21:58,678
- We'll go without them then.
- Okay.

2412
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:00,589
- Let's go without them.
- Right.

2413
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,019
I got a good result after a while.

2414
01:22:02,549 --> 01:22:05,058
- Stay in position right here.
- I'm fine.

2415
01:22:05,059 --> 01:22:06,158
Catch the person coming.

2416
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:08,289
As we're all running, I'll step on their feet.

2417
01:22:09,029 --> 01:22:11,559
- Great.
- What is our plan?

2418
01:22:11,729 --> 01:22:14,628
If we get the ball, we have to pass the ball around.

2419
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:16,898
- Should I try to secure the ball?
- Sure.

2420
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:19,268
We will start with all of you facing me.

2421
01:22:19,269 --> 01:22:20,468
We'll start right away, everyone.

2422
01:22:20,469 --> 01:22:21,838
The team that gets the beachball back there...

2423
01:22:21,839 --> 01:22:23,168
past the finish line first will be the winner.

2424
01:22:23,169 --> 01:22:24,609
Get ready...

2425
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:29,008
(A refreshing sprint to the sea)

2426
01:22:29,009 --> 01:22:30,918
- Oh, right.
- Gosh, it's hot!

2427
01:22:30,919 --> 01:22:32,325
(Joon sprints once again with his great stamina.)

2428
01:22:32,349 --> 01:22:34,288
(Power dive)

2429
01:22:34,289 --> 01:22:35,518
Just let us have it.

2430
01:22:35,519 --> 01:22:37,618
- Get closer.
- You'll run out of breath.

2431
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:38,788
Don't go for it.

2432
01:22:38,789 --> 01:22:40,588
Leave it. Block the way!

2433
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:42,128
Block the way!

2434
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:43,405
(Seon Ho manages to get the ball.)

2435
01:22:43,429 --> 01:22:44,429
Come this way!

2436
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:46,129
(Give me back my ball.)

2437
01:22:46,499 --> 01:22:47,729
Find Sae Ho.

2438
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:49,628
Okay. Get ready to receive it.

2439
01:22:49,629 --> 01:22:50,698
Come here, Seon Ho.

2440
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:51,798
(Team Dojin closes down on them.)

2441
01:22:51,799 --> 01:22:53,739
- What is wrong with him?
- Come closer.

2442
01:22:54,009 --> 01:22:55,239
Give it to Wonpil!

2443
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:58,379
(Passing to Wonpil according to DinDin's orders)

2444
01:22:58,579 --> 01:23:01,009
(Pass it here, Wonpil!)

2445
01:23:01,249 --> 01:23:04,049
(They are close to taking the win if the pass goes through to DinDin.)

2446
01:23:05,379 --> 01:23:06,888
- What?
- Dowoon!

2447
01:23:06,889 --> 01:23:08,189
- Run!
- Dowoon!

2448
01:23:09,589 --> 01:23:11,858
(The ball falls to Dowoon with a misplaced pass.)

2449
01:23:11,859 --> 01:23:13,759
(Kicking hard)

2450
01:23:14,259 --> 01:23:15,659
Run, Dowoon!

2451
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:18,329
Run, Dowoon!

2452
01:23:18,459 --> 01:23:20,599
(Chasing after him quickly)

2453
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:21,928
Run, Dowoon!

2454
01:23:21,929 --> 01:23:24,639
(However, he already got away by quite a distance.)

2455
01:23:24,839 --> 01:23:26,068
Dowoon!

2456
01:23:26,069 --> 01:23:27,708
(Team Dojin wins.)

2457
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:30,139
Yes, Dowoon!

2458
01:23:30,509 --> 01:23:33,378
(We did it!)

2459
01:23:33,379 --> 01:23:34,479
That was so dramatic!

2460
01:23:34,779 --> 01:23:36,148
(Nice one, Dowoon!)

2461
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:37,379
Dowoon!

2462
01:23:38,679 --> 01:23:40,849
(Hugging)

2463
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:42,419
Go to Se Yoon.

2464
01:23:43,249 --> 01:23:47,389
(Team Youngpil was very close.)

2465
01:23:48,059 --> 01:23:49,389
Dowoon did well.

2466
01:23:49,889 --> 01:23:52,129
The score is 2 to 1.

2467
01:23:52,629 --> 01:23:54,498
Team Dojin takes the win.

2468
01:23:54,499 --> 01:23:56,269
- Yes!
- You will get two meal tickets.

2469
01:23:56,429 --> 01:23:58,998
Great work, everyone. We will head over to eat now.

2470
01:23:58,999 --> 01:24:00,409
We will eat right away?

2471
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:01,708
Let's go.

2472
01:24:01,709 --> 01:24:03,269
Nice one, Dowoon.

2473
01:24:04,409 --> 01:24:06,508
(Feeling proud)

2474
01:24:06,509 --> 01:24:08,078
That was quite a scene.

2475
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:10,379
- I'm your successor.
- You kicked the ball.

2476
01:24:10,919 --> 01:24:12,978
You kicked the ball and ran after, catching it.

2477
01:24:12,979 --> 01:24:14,518
(They head to the next spot after making a passionate memory.)

2478
01:24:14,519 --> 01:24:15,749
That was today's moment.

2479
01:24:15,889 --> 01:24:17,118
(The intense Duck Squad mission comes to an end.)

2480
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:18,559
Gosh, I'm hungry now.

2481
01:24:19,589 --> 01:24:21,758
Your face looks a bit tanned.

2482
01:24:21,759 --> 01:24:22,828
- Me?
- Right.

2483
01:24:22,829 --> 01:24:23,898
We all got a tan.

2484
01:24:23,899 --> 01:24:25,298
All our faces are tanned.

2485
01:24:25,299 --> 01:24:26,799
We really are tan.

2486
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:30,199
(Yawning)

2487
01:24:30,769 --> 01:24:32,168
Dowoon, you were so cool earlier.

2488
01:24:32,169 --> 01:24:34,408
During the Duck Squad mission,

2489
01:24:34,409 --> 01:24:36,409
- You're right.
- he was amazing.

2490
01:24:36,569 --> 01:24:40,079
To be honest, his team won all the games thanks to Dowoon.

2491
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:46,019
(A victory led by Dowoon after a close match)

2492
01:24:46,279 --> 01:24:47,988
- You're right.
- The chicken fight too.

2493
01:24:47,989 --> 01:24:49,348
- That's true.
- What did you guys do?

2494
01:24:49,349 --> 01:24:50,718
- My gosh.
- You won because of him.

2495
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:51,789
Thank you.

2496
01:24:51,919 --> 01:24:53,929
Joon, if it weren't for you...

2497
01:24:54,029 --> 01:24:57,159
Are you all right? How much energy do you have left?

2498
01:24:57,729 --> 01:24:59,728
- One percent.
- Only one percent left?

2499
01:24:59,729 --> 01:25:00,869
(Laughing)

2500
01:25:01,599 --> 01:25:03,698
- Who has one percent left?
- SungJin.

2501
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:05,638
- SungJin has one percent left?
- That's bad.

2502
01:25:05,639 --> 01:25:06,639
Did you not sleep?

2503
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,238
Young K, are you feeling recharged?

2504
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,108
Yes. I got about ten percent.

2505
01:25:10,109 --> 01:25:11,838
You got ten percent? So how much is it in total?

2506
01:25:11,839 --> 01:25:13,309
- Ten percent.
- Ten percent?

2507
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:14,679
What about you, Wonpil?

2508
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,708
I'm at about 70 percent.

2509
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:17,718
At about 70 percent?

2510
01:25:17,719 --> 01:25:18,778
(A whopping 70 percent)

2511
01:25:18,779 --> 01:25:20,749
- He's young.
- Wonpil, you should do everything.

2512
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:22,448
- Gangneung...
- Are we going to a restaurant?

2513
01:25:22,449 --> 01:25:23,719
Where are we now?

2514
01:25:23,959 --> 01:25:25,689
- We should go to Samcheok.
- Samcheok?

2515
01:25:26,859 --> 01:25:28,028
I'm hungry.

2516
01:25:28,029 --> 01:25:29,559
(They start to feel hungry.)

2517
01:25:30,259 --> 01:25:32,858
So, do we have two meal tickets each now?

2518
01:25:32,859 --> 01:25:34,428
- Yes.
- Yes. It's the same.

2519
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:36,939
That's not enough, but it's 2:30pm already.

2520
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:38,769
We should eat now.

2521
01:25:39,469 --> 01:25:41,168
We get to eat lunch early today.

2522
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:42,238
- It's almost 3pm.
- It's earlier than I thought.

2523
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:43,979
- Is this early?
- Yes.

2524
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:46,139
We get to eat on time.

2525
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:49,308
We will have dinner at around 11pm.

2526
01:25:49,309 --> 01:25:50,979
What kind of show is this?

2527
01:25:51,349 --> 01:25:52,949
We will have dinner at 11pm.

2528
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:54,548
We haven't eaten a single meal today.

2529
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:55,988
Right. My gosh.

2530
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:57,669
This is embarrassing. When we have guests,

2531
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:00,229
we should let them eat on time.

2532
01:26:00,389 --> 01:26:02,988
I know. This isn't about us. It's for the guests.

2533
01:26:02,989 --> 01:26:04,658
Of course. We eat all the time.

2534
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:05,999
We don't have to eat.

2535
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:07,169
Really?

2536
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:08,969
We're serious.

2537
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:10,539
How much do you eat?

2538
01:26:10,869 --> 01:26:13,838
These two eat pretty well.

2539
01:26:13,839 --> 01:26:15,168
- Young K and SungJin?
- Yes.

2540
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:17,178
- Wonpil and Dowoon...
- Dowoon and I don't.

2541
01:26:17,179 --> 01:26:18,539
- have a small appetite?
- Yes.

2542
01:26:19,309 --> 01:26:21,008
They both like to eat rice, though.

2543
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:22,048
They eat rice well?

2544
01:26:22,049 --> 01:26:23,579
- Just white rice.
- Just rice?

2545
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:25,378
- Wonpil really likes rice.
- Just white rice?

2546
01:26:25,379 --> 01:26:27,318
- When you eat rice...
- Two bowls.

2547
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:28,989
- When you eat gukbap?
- All the time?

2548
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:30,858
- More than two bowls.
- Yes, when I'm hungry.

2549
01:26:30,859 --> 01:26:33,419
Two bowls of rice are perfect for me.

2550
01:26:33,529 --> 01:26:35,889
When you're young, you have to eat two bowls.

2551
01:26:36,059 --> 01:26:37,658
- Is this the restaurant?
- A restaurant?

2552
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:38,859
It's a restaurant.

2553
01:26:39,429 --> 01:26:41,029
Everyone, you must be hungry.

2554
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,368
- Are you hungry?
- SungJin says...

2555
01:26:43,369 --> 01:26:45,538
- his battery is at one percent now.
- One percent?

2556
01:26:45,539 --> 01:26:46,819
- I'm hungry.
- That's not true.

2557
01:26:47,209 --> 01:26:49,168
- I'm starving.
- Wonpil has 70 percent left.

2558
01:26:49,169 --> 01:26:50,209
Really?

2559
01:26:50,379 --> 01:26:52,078
- Young K is at ten percent.
- Yes.

2560
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:53,438
- I'm hungry.
- I've got ten percent.

2561
01:26:53,439 --> 01:26:56,108
They literally cried in the car. Just a little.

2562
01:26:56,109 --> 01:26:58,018
(Please give us food.)

2563
01:26:58,019 --> 01:27:00,149
Don't embarrass us. We have guests, Director Joo.

2564
01:27:01,419 --> 01:27:03,318
- I'll try.
- We should feed the guests.

2565
01:27:03,319 --> 01:27:05,258
- We should treat the guests well.
- Right.

2566
01:27:05,259 --> 01:27:08,129
We should maintain a good relationship with JYP.

2567
01:27:08,229 --> 01:27:09,628
(Thankful and embarrassed)

2568
01:27:09,629 --> 01:27:11,529
You sweated a lot today.

2569
01:27:12,029 --> 01:27:13,798
- So we have small octopus bossam, - Okay.

2570
01:27:13,799 --> 01:27:15,519
Which is good for revitalizing your energy.

2571
01:27:16,969 --> 01:27:19,169
- That's great.
- That must be delicious.

2572
01:27:19,639 --> 01:27:22,119
(The nutritious small octopus grilled directly over flames...)

2573
01:27:22,939 --> 01:27:25,579
(and tender boiled pork are nicely matched.)

2574
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:29,609
(Today is the small octopus bossam day.)

2575
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:31,518
We can't miss out on small octopus bossam.

2576
01:27:31,519 --> 01:27:33,788
- All right, everyone.
- I'm so hungry.

2577
01:27:33,789 --> 01:27:35,148
Here's the result of the mission.

2578
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,688
Team Youngpil has two meal tickets,

2579
01:27:36,689 --> 01:27:38,258
and Team Dojin has two meal tickets.

2580
01:27:38,259 --> 01:27:39,459
- We're on good terms.
- Nice.

2581
01:27:39,589 --> 01:27:40,958
This is...

2582
01:27:40,959 --> 01:27:43,558
the last mission for lunch.

2583
01:27:43,559 --> 01:27:46,529
So the winning team will get two meal tickets and mung bean jeon.

2584
01:27:46,699 --> 01:27:48,399
- Great.
- And two meal tickets?

2585
01:27:48,829 --> 01:27:50,268
That's good. If we win, we'll have four tickets.

2586
01:27:50,269 --> 01:27:51,768
With two extra meal tickets and mung bean jeon,

2587
01:27:51,769 --> 01:27:53,298
- we will have enough food.
- Right.

2588
01:27:53,299 --> 01:27:54,768
Even if we win, one of us won't get to eat.

2589
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:56,108
You're right. The tickets...

2590
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:58,038
This is disappointing, Director Joo.

2591
01:27:58,039 --> 01:27:59,378
- We should treat them well.
- We have guests here,

2592
01:27:59,379 --> 01:28:01,085
- but some of them won't get to eat.
- Three meal tickets.

2593
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,878
SungJin asks for three meal tickets.

2594
01:28:02,879 --> 01:28:04,078
- Are you giving only two?
- So all of you can eat?

2595
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:05,978
Yes. Make it 3 so all the members of 1 team can eat.

2596
01:28:05,979 --> 01:28:07,348
- SungJin, three meal tickets?
- Three.

2597
01:28:07,349 --> 01:28:08,749
- Three.
- Right.

2598
01:28:08,889 --> 01:28:09,889
- Can you do that?
- Please.

2599
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:11,258
The losing team will have...

2600
01:28:11,259 --> 01:28:13,779
- only two members eat anyway.
- Sand is coming out of my ears.

2601
01:28:13,929 --> 01:28:15,589
It will come out even tomorrow.

2602
01:28:16,329 --> 01:28:17,558
- Please do us a favor.
- One of the two teams...

2603
01:28:17,559 --> 01:28:19,028
- should eat.
- Okay.

2604
01:28:19,029 --> 01:28:20,768
- Wonpil, go and lie down there.
- Then,

2605
01:28:20,769 --> 01:28:23,568
we will give you three meal tickets and mung bean jeon.

2606
01:28:23,569 --> 01:28:25,839
- Nice.
- Let's do that.

2607
01:28:26,499 --> 01:28:28,108
He is tender-hearted.

2608
01:28:28,109 --> 01:28:29,408
He is.

2609
01:28:29,409 --> 01:28:30,908
- You should ask for more.
- Okay.

2610
01:28:30,909 --> 01:28:32,149
Should we ask for four tickets?

2611
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:34,109
(Laughing)

2612
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:36,855
I didn't know negotiation could be this easy.

2613
01:28:36,879 --> 01:28:38,079
This mission is...

2614
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:40,548
the Count-up Naming Game.

2615
01:28:40,549 --> 01:28:42,518
- Count?
- I should use my head. It's bad.

2616
01:28:42,519 --> 01:28:45,319
You must name one word that matches the keyword at a time.

2617
01:28:45,459 --> 01:28:48,258
From 1 syllable to 5 syllables,

2618
01:28:48,259 --> 01:28:50,798
you must name words with one syllable added every time.

2619
01:28:50,799 --> 01:28:53,328
- I see.
- Se Yoon is really bad at this.

2620
01:28:53,329 --> 01:28:55,329
And Jong Min is a little worse than him.

2621
01:28:55,729 --> 01:28:58,169
- Se Yoon is terrible at this.
- Don't look down on our team!

2622
01:28:58,269 --> 01:28:59,398
(He's so tough.)

2623
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:00,708
Darn it!

2624
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:03,208
There will be unexpected difficulties.

2625
01:29:03,209 --> 01:29:04,578
- Don't let it get to you.
- Right.

2626
01:29:04,579 --> 01:29:06,139
- Sure.
- Don't mind them.

2627
01:29:06,309 --> 01:29:07,709
Let's just do this.

2628
01:29:07,979 --> 01:29:09,478
It goes, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

2629
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:12,678
Dowoon, you should try to steal their answers later.

2630
01:29:12,679 --> 01:29:14,159
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes.

2631
01:29:14,189 --> 01:29:15,449
- I will...
- Focus.

2632
01:29:15,619 --> 01:29:17,988
- This is so much fun.
- While you play the game,

2633
01:29:17,989 --> 01:29:19,519
they will start cooking.

2634
01:29:19,989 --> 01:29:23,899
You have three options. Less spicy, spicy, and extra spicy.

2635
01:29:24,099 --> 01:29:25,628
- Spicy?
- Let's make it spicy.

2636
01:29:25,629 --> 01:29:28,499
We will make it spicy and have Cheongyang chili pepper on the side.

2637
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:30,439
Between less spicy and spicy.

2638
01:29:30,539 --> 01:29:31,898
- That sounds nice.
- Yes.

2639
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:33,138
- No.
- Come on.

2640
01:29:33,139 --> 01:29:34,868
- Hey!
- What's that?

2641
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,308
- Spicy?
- Let's make it spicy.

2642
01:29:36,309 --> 01:29:38,108
- Spicy works for them.
- We will make it spicy.

2643
01:29:38,109 --> 01:29:39,309
- Spicy? Okay.
- Sure.

2644
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:41,108
I want to eat it even more now.

2645
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:42,378
- I don't want to lose it.
- I bet it's delicious.

2646
01:29:42,379 --> 01:29:44,118
If we make it less spicy, it won't be enough.

2647
01:29:44,119 --> 01:29:45,978
- So... It's small octopus.
- Right. Let's do that.

2648
01:29:45,979 --> 01:29:47,118
This is fun. I love playing games like this.

2649
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:48,248
So you want it to be spicy.

2650
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:50,359
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

2651
01:29:50,419 --> 01:29:51,758
- Something like male idols.
- By the way,

2652
01:29:51,759 --> 01:29:54,189
will you play fair and square or commit fouls?

2653
01:29:54,259 --> 01:29:55,739
When did we not play fair and square?

2654
01:29:55,989 --> 01:29:57,328
- We always play fair.
- We should.

2655
01:29:57,329 --> 01:29:58,998
- Please make sure, audio director.
- Okay.

2656
01:29:58,999 --> 01:30:00,198
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

2657
01:30:00,199 --> 01:30:01,428
- Let's do this!
- We can do it.

2658
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:03,228
- Go, Team Youngpil.
- One, two, three.

2659
01:30:03,229 --> 01:30:04,475
- Team Youngpil!
- Team Youngpil!

2660
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:06,798
- All right. The first question.
- Think of your answer in advance.

2661
01:30:06,799 --> 01:30:08,068
(Which team will be enjoying a hearty lunch?)

2662
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:09,109
All right.

2663
01:30:09,669 --> 01:30:13,079
Korean male singers, including bands that broke up.

2664
01:30:13,239 --> 01:30:14,548
- Dojin.
- Youngpil

2665
01:30:14,549 --> 01:30:15,708
- Youngpil.
- Dojin.

2666
01:30:15,709 --> 01:30:17,178
- Dojin was faster.
- He said Jong Min.

2667
01:30:17,179 --> 01:30:18,248
- Se Yoon said Dojin.
- Okay.

2668
01:30:18,249 --> 01:30:19,879
- Hurry.
- Three.

2669
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:21,148
- Gal.
- Two.

2670
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:22,248
- What?
- What?

2671
01:30:22,249 --> 01:30:23,549
- Girl.
- Incorrect.

2672
01:30:23,759 --> 01:30:24,918
- Rain.
- What is Gal?

2673
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:25,988
- You said Girl.
- Band...

2674
01:30:25,989 --> 01:30:27,349
- Okay. It's our turn.
- Youngpil.

2675
01:30:27,489 --> 01:30:28,529
Rain.

2676
01:30:28,659 --> 01:30:29,758
- You said Girl.
- VIXX.

2677
01:30:29,759 --> 01:30:31,259
- Three.
- aespa.

2678
01:30:31,429 --> 01:30:32,698
- Male singers.
- I got it.

2679
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:33,768
Incorrect.

2680
01:30:33,769 --> 01:30:34,998
Why?

2681
01:30:34,999 --> 01:30:36,428
You should name male singers.

2682
01:30:36,429 --> 01:30:37,568
- What did he say?
- aespa?

2683
01:30:37,569 --> 01:30:39,068
Dojin!

2684
01:30:39,069 --> 01:30:40,738
- Name male singers.
- Male singers.

2685
01:30:40,739 --> 01:30:42,209
- Can.
- Can.

2686
01:30:42,839 --> 01:30:45,008
- Three, two...
- Bucks.

2687
01:30:45,009 --> 01:30:46,208
(Committing fouls, hiding behind Se Yoon's back)

2688
01:30:46,209 --> 01:30:47,209
- Bucks.
- Incorrect.

2689
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:48,749
- Incorrect.
- Youngpil.

2690
01:30:48,879 --> 01:30:50,309
(Is it incorrect?)

2691
01:30:50,349 --> 01:30:52,319
(Making a fuss)

2692
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:55,819
(This is exciting! It's our turn!)

2693
01:30:56,619 --> 01:30:57,788
(Sae Ho is going to win.)

2694
01:30:57,789 --> 01:31:00,188
- Hurry.
- Three, two...

2695
01:31:00,189 --> 01:31:01,189
Rain.

2696
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:02,259
- Three...
- VIXX.

2697
01:31:02,589 --> 01:31:04,328
- Three, two...
- It's over.

2698
01:31:04,329 --> 01:31:05,758
- Taesaja.
- That's it.

2699
01:31:05,759 --> 01:31:06,828
- Three...
- DAY6.

2700
01:31:06,829 --> 01:31:08,068
- Three.
- NCT DREAM.

2701
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:09,598
- Okay!
- Yes!

2702
01:31:09,599 --> 01:31:10,669
Correct.

2703
01:31:11,369 --> 01:31:13,568
(Team Youngpil gets 1 point.)

2704
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:14,739
- Yes!
- Let's eat!

2705
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:16,838
(Welcome to lunch.)

2706
01:31:16,839 --> 01:31:17,839
(Shouting)

2707
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,338
- They said aespa.
- I didn't know this one.

2708
01:31:20,339 --> 01:31:21,448
I mean, next time...

2709
01:31:21,449 --> 01:31:22,878
By the way, what did you say earlier?

2710
01:31:22,879 --> 01:31:24,379
- Bucks.
- What is Bucks?

2711
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:26,648
- It's Buck.
- What?

2712
01:31:26,649 --> 01:31:27,789
He said Bucks?

2713
01:31:27,919 --> 01:31:29,219
- He got it wrong.
- I know.

2714
01:31:29,289 --> 01:31:30,989
This is so much fun. Really.

2715
01:31:31,959 --> 01:31:33,688
Gosh, our team... Good.

2716
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:35,388
- It's okay.
- Let's move on.

2717
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:37,088
- All right.
- Relax.

2718
01:31:37,089 --> 01:31:38,128
(The second question)

2719
01:31:38,129 --> 01:31:39,728
- Korean song titles.
- Dojin.

2720
01:31:39,729 --> 01:31:41,299
- Dojin.
- Dojin.

2721
01:31:41,799 --> 01:31:44,038
Three, two, one.

2722
01:31:44,039 --> 01:31:45,298
- "Only."
- Yes.

2723
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:46,999
- Three, two...
- "Love."

2724
01:31:47,869 --> 01:31:49,339
- Three.
- "I Love You."

2725
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:51,078
- Incorrect.
- "I Love You."

2726
01:31:51,079 --> 01:31:52,408
- You can't say that.
- Incorrect.

2727
01:31:52,409 --> 01:31:53,538
Why?

2728
01:31:53,539 --> 01:31:55,549
- "Come."
- Correct.

2729
01:31:55,709 --> 01:31:57,248
- "Proposal."
- "Proposal."

2730
01:31:57,249 --> 01:31:59,718
Okay. Three, two, one.

2731
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:00,819
- Time's up.
- Time's up.

2732
01:32:00,889 --> 01:32:01,919
- Three.
- "Bruise."

2733
01:32:02,119 --> 01:32:03,519
- Three, two...
- "Love."

2734
01:32:03,789 --> 01:32:05,059
- Three...
- "I Love You."

2735
01:32:05,089 --> 01:32:06,659
- Three...
- "I Miss You."

2736
01:32:06,919 --> 01:32:08,328
- Three, two...
- "Come Back to Me."

2737
01:32:08,329 --> 01:32:09,559
- Okay.
- Correct.

2738
01:32:09,659 --> 01:32:11,199
- Success.
- Yes!

2739
01:32:11,729 --> 01:32:12,958
(Laughing)

2740
01:32:12,959 --> 01:32:15,828
Well done. Our youngest is so good.

2741
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:17,299
Dowoon, you're good.

2742
01:32:18,269 --> 01:32:19,668
(Disappointed)

2743
01:32:19,669 --> 01:32:21,208
I was waiting to say my answer.

2744
01:32:21,209 --> 01:32:22,468
- Wonpil is...
- What was your answer?

2745
01:32:22,469 --> 01:32:24,308
(I like you)

2746
01:32:24,309 --> 01:32:25,378
I was going to say this.

2747
01:32:25,379 --> 01:32:27,325
- By the way...
- Jong Min, what is "I Love You?"

2748
01:32:27,349 --> 01:32:29,278
- It's a song.
- By SWEET SORROW.

2749
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:30,285
- I love you - SWEET SORROW.

2750
01:32:30,309 --> 01:32:33,818
("I Love You" by SWEET SORROW)

2751
01:32:33,819 --> 01:32:34,948
It's SWEET SORROW!

2752
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:35,989
Oh, right.

2753
01:32:36,219 --> 01:32:37,219
All right.

2754
01:32:37,759 --> 01:32:39,588
- The score is 1 to 1.
- This is nerve-racking.

2755
01:32:39,589 --> 01:32:40,928
- Hang on.
- My gosh.

2756
01:32:40,929 --> 01:32:42,228
The team that names 5 words 1st wins, right?

2757
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:43,589
Right. It's 1 to 1.

2758
01:32:43,759 --> 01:32:45,029
My heart is pounding.

2759
01:32:45,329 --> 01:32:46,659
This is really fun.

2760
01:32:46,899 --> 01:32:48,659
- My heart is pounding too.
- This is crazy.

2761
01:32:48,869 --> 01:32:49,929
All right.

2762
01:32:50,329 --> 01:32:53,638
(A heart-pounding game. Who will win the meal tickets?)

2763
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:55,609
(Next episode)

2764
01:32:55,939 --> 01:32:58,838
(Things are as heated as the weather.)

2765
01:32:58,839 --> 01:33:00,809
Drumsticks aren't a musical instrument.

2766
01:33:01,049 --> 01:33:02,809
(Drumsticks)

2767
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:05,578
(Feeling dizzy)

2768
01:33:05,579 --> 01:33:07,118
- Why?
- Male singers!

2769
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:09,389
(DAY6 has fully adapted to 2 Days 1 Night.)

2770
01:33:09,849 --> 01:33:12,459
(The war of nerves is getting more intense.)

2771
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:14,889
(Exhausted)

2772
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:18,959
(Someone, please stop the members.)

2773
01:33:19,559 --> 01:33:22,999
(Shall we change the mood?)

2774
01:33:23,499 --> 01:33:27,199
(A midsummer night's party that they enjoy together)

2775
01:33:27,409 --> 01:33:29,939
(You thought it was a party, right?)

2776
01:33:30,579 --> 01:33:33,539
(It's heating up again.)

2777
01:33:33,909 --> 01:33:36,209
(We will win no matter what.)

2778
01:33:36,649 --> 01:33:39,549
(It won't be easy.)

2779
01:33:39,949 --> 01:33:41,949
(They are totally excited.)

2780
01:33:42,389 --> 01:33:44,589
(A showdown under the moonlight)

2781
01:33:45,489 --> 01:33:49,289
(The 2nd story with DAY6)

2782
01:33:50,189 --> 01:33:53,299
(See you on Sunday night at 6:10pm.)
