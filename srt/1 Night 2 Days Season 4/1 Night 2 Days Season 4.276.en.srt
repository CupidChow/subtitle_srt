1
00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:03,402
(Two men visit 2 Days 1 Night.)

2
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:06,142
(Park Bo Gum)

3
00:00:07,372 --> 00:00:09,312
(Lee Sang Yi)

4
00:00:09,972 --> 00:00:12,041
(The travel mates are Park Bo Gum...)

5
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:14,242
(and Lee Sang Yi from "Good Boy.")

6
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:18,482
(The Good Boys will join us on a Yeosu Food Boy trip.)

7
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:20,282
Excited.

8
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:23,952
(He's synced with 2 Days 1 Night.)

9
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:25,492
- What...
- Hey.

10
00:00:25,962 --> 00:00:27,322
I didn't think you'd be like this.

11
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:30,062
That's impressive.

12
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:32,062
(Bo Gum refuses to give in.)

13
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:36,332
(The Food Boys ooze their own unique charm...)

14
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:38,772
(as the close race continues.)

15
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:39,972
Lee Joon.

16
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:44,312
(While Sang Yi shows his oddball side, )

17
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,482
(Bo Gum shows his sense and quick wit.)

18
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:49,712
(Team Bo Gum wins lunch.)

19
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:54,182
(Just watching Bo Gum eat makes you feel full.)

20
00:00:56,352 --> 00:00:57,352
Try this.

21
00:00:57,852 --> 00:00:59,292
(It's really good.)

22
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:02,932
(Sang Yi hasn't eaten all day and is hungry.)

23
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:05,231
(The Food Boys are still hungry, )

24
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,802
(so they get a dessert mission.)

25
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,331
(If someone recognizes them, )

26
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:11,572
(they fail.)

27
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:14,002
(How could anyone fail to recognize these two?)

28
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:15,841
(This is Bo Gum.)

29
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,371
(To win dessert, they don a disguise.)

30
00:01:17,372 --> 00:01:19,612
(This is Sang Yi.)

31
00:01:20,212 --> 00:01:23,412
(Can they buy dessert without getting noticed?)

32
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:28,022
(2 Days 1 Night)

33
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:29,991
(Team Bo Gum, Team Sang Yi)

34
00:01:29,992 --> 00:01:31,852
(Disguise complete)

35
00:01:32,252 --> 00:01:34,822
(Team Sang Yi's pick: strawberry sticky rice cake)

36
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:37,992
(It's the closest store, right across the road.)

37
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,202
(But there's a ton of people.)

38
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,202
(Team Bo Gum's pick: threesome dumplings)

39
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,472
(The shop is away a little, )

40
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:51,772
(but there are fewer people today because it's raining.)

41
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,581
(Can they manage to not get recognized?)

42
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,181
- It's time.
- We need to go now.

43
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:58,351
- There are fewer people now.
- Joon!

44
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,681
- You...
- If it gets bad, ignore each other.

45
00:02:00,682 --> 00:02:01,682
Okay. We'll split up.

46
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:02,852
- Let's go.
- Go, Joon.

47
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:04,092
Do we go separately?

48
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:05,422
We can go separately.

49
00:02:05,522 --> 00:02:06,522
- Yes, separately.
- Separately.

50
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:08,262
- Let's play safe. Okay.
- Split up.

51
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:10,091
- See you.
- We're off.

52
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:11,292
- Bye.
- Take care.

53
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:15,332
(Team Bo Gum and Team Sang Yi set off.)

54
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:18,071
(Salt bread, dumpling, strawberry sticky rice cake, )

55
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,878
(handmade burger, honey bread, mugwort chocolate pie and ice cream)

56
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:23,542
(This busy area is known for their desserts.)

57
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:27,512
(It's raining, but there are quite a few people.)

58
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:31,052
Standing in line to buy that?

59
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:33,252
It's not easy.

60
00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:36,321
(Joon: purple umbrella, DinDin: yellow umbrella)

61
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,421
Stand over here.

62
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:38,491
(Bo Gum: pink umbrella, Sang Yi: blue umbrella)

63
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,091
- Here's your camera.
- Okay, thanks.

64
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:42,562
(Can they hide their identity and succeed in their missions?)

65
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:47,962
- They're out.
- Bo Gum is running.

66
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:50,171
- Sang Yi and Bo Gum are running.
- No. If they run like that...

67
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,871
If they run like that, they will draw attention.

68
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,472
(Bo Gum boldly runs to the destination.)

69
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,701
(Chuckling)

70
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:56,712
I'll succeed.

71
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:01,041
What? Why is the dumpling place suddenly so crowded?

72
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:02,581
Why is the dumpling place so crowded all of a sudden?

73
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,612
What?

74
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:06,122
That was sudden. There's an unexpected situation.

75
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:09,222
(Bo Gum)

76
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:12,562
The dumpling place is crowded.

77
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:16,992
(The walk to the dumpling place is easy since it's raining.)

78
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:22,431
(But lining up at the dumpling place will be the challenge.)

79
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:23,432
(Bo Gum)

80
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:26,502
(The waiting area, the pick-up area)

81
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:32,042
(He joins the line without getting recognized for now.)

82
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:34,182
Is Bo Gum waiting in line now?

83
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,052
Yes.

84
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:39,452
(It seems things are going smoothly.)

85
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:46,692
(The man with the flowerpot shows up.)

86
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:54,002
(Anyone would find him suspicious.)

87
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:57,132
Excuse me. Do you accept card payments too?

88
00:03:57,632 --> 00:03:58,672
- Yes.
- Yes.

89
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:01,382
I'd like to order one serving of kimchi dumplings to go.

90
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:03,372
He only took cash.

91
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,602
He placed the order directly with the owner.

92
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:07,241
- Bo Gum placed the order?
- Yes. He did.

93
00:04:07,242 --> 00:04:10,003
- His voice was so recognizable.
- She didn't recognized him for now.

94
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:12,512
Wait. Someone is approaching. It can't be, right?

95
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:15,751
(At that moment, a passerby walks toward Bo Gum.)

96
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,122
Could I get a receipt too?

97
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:20,662
(Team Bo Gum is nervous.)

98
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,662
Could I get a receipt too?

99
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:25,591
(To make matters worse, )

100
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:27,802
(the microphone with his name on it is exposed.)

101
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:33,602
(Will his cover be blown now?)

102
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:36,112
Thank you.

103
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:39,042
(Luckily, it seems she didn't see anything.)

104
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:41,981
(Look at the microphone!)

105
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,712
(Only the staff members get startled.)

106
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:47,021
(He was lucky!)

107
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:48,282
(Covering the microphone)

108
00:04:50,152 --> 00:04:51,152
I think he might succeed.

109
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:52,292
He might succeed.

110
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:56,192
(Park Bo Gum)

111
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:59,231
(He even has the gut to wave at the headquarters.)

112
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,362
Excuse me.

113
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:02,262
How can I pay with cash?

114
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:07,642
(He forgot about this suspicious man for a moment.)

115
00:05:08,802 --> 00:05:11,412
(Characteristics: He keeps smelling the fake flower.)

116
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:16,452
(Trying to hold back his laughter)

117
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:18,552
What would you like?

118
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:20,422
I'd like...

119
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:22,822
two servings of threesome dumplings.

120
00:05:26,462 --> 00:05:27,521
I think he's saying something.

121
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:29,062
Gosh, I told him to change his tone.

122
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,731
He's trying to speak with a strange tone.

123
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:31,962
- He changed his tone?
- Yes.

124
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:34,612
- But he sounds like DinDin.
- He's not articulating.

125
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:37,431
Do you have any sugar-free drinks?

126
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:38,801
(He's garnering more attention with his suspicions tone.)

127
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:40,562
Two servings of threesome dumplings, please.

128
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:42,972
Oh, no.

129
00:05:43,272 --> 00:05:44,512
I think someone recognized him.

130
00:05:46,442 --> 00:05:48,642
(Pretending not to be with DinDin)

131
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,081
(Turning away)

132
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:53,982
(He must have just thought DinDin was a weirdo.)

133
00:05:54,482 --> 00:05:56,192
(Smelling)

134
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:57,791
(He's completely immersed...)

135
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,992
(in his character which seems to have a strange theme.)

136
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:04,632
(Meanwhile, Team Sang Yi heads out to buy sticky rice cakes.)

137
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:08,361
(The rice cake store has a line of customers too.)

138
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:09,431
- That's...
- Gosh. Hey.

139
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:10,631
- Look at him.
- Look at Joon.

140
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:12,272
- Joon.
- Joon is taking a bold approach.

141
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,441
- Yes. No one will recognize them.
- Sang Yi and Joon are being bold.

142
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,348
- Yes. That's what they should do.
- They're not hesitant.

143
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:18,342
- Hey, people saw them.
- They ought to be bold.

144
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:20,941
(Sang Yi, Joon)

145
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:23,262
(They manage to join the line without getting recognized.)

146
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:29,292
(At that moment, more people begin to line up.)

147
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:30,892
(Glancing)

148
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:34,221
(But...)

149
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:35,562
(Glancing)

150
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,632
(Everyone glances at them before joining the line.)

151
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:43,302
(Could it be that they're already recognized?)

152
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:53,112
(It must have been because Joon opened his eyes so wide.)

153
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:56,782
(Concealing their identities with glasses and double eyelids)

154
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:58,752
But Sang Yi and Joon...

155
00:06:59,322 --> 00:07:00,882
We might not be able to recognize them.

156
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:02,082
We might not be able to recognize them.

157
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,403
They look like regular customers.

158
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:05,591
(Sang Yi and Joon are right here.)

159
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,022
(They blend perfectly into the waiting line.)

160
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:13,102
(Gosh, my eyes are tired.)

161
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:14,701
(At the same time, Team Bo Gum)

162
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,732
(Bo Gum and DinDin)

163
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:19,172
(The suspicious man finishes placing the order.)

164
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,812
(Anxious)

165
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,742
Don't come closer. No, DinDin.

166
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:30,402
(He fears he might be recognized and distances himself from DinDin.)

167
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:32,062
Why can't people recognize them?

168
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:35,522
This is taking a while.

169
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:39,762
(People place orders next to Bo Gum.)

170
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:44,362
(But they don't recognize Bo Gum.)

171
00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:46,542
- Relatively speaking...
- It's not as crowded?

172
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:48,802
I mean, it's not something they'd imagine.

173
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:51,148
- Right. In Yeosu...
- They wouldn't even think it's him.

174
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:53,601
Right. Since it's raining, there aren't a lot of people.

175
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:54,901
- Right.
- It's supposed to be packed.

176
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:56,571
I had to wait in line for 30 minutes the last time I came.

177
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:58,132
Right. It's usually packed with people.

178
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:03,952
(Park Bo Gum)

179
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:09,592
(You only gaze afar)

180
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:15,992
(Park Bo Gum is right here.)

181
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,832
(He's so handsome.)

182
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:25,031
(If you turn your head just a bit, )

183
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:31,112
(you can see Park Bo Gum.)

184
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,581
Number 52. Your kimchi dumplings are ready.

185
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,182
Okay. Could you give me the receipt too?

186
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:37,412
Sure. Hold on.

187
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,752
(He even manages to grab the receipt.)

188
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:42,892
- Thank you. Sell a lot.
- Thank you.

189
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:48,422
(Will Team Bo Gum be able to complete the mission?)

190
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,871
I'll make a pit stop since I don't want to go back just yet.

191
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:59,600
(I'll make a pit stop since I don't want to go back just yet.)

192
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:05,838
I'll make a pit stop since I don't want to go back just yet.

193
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,379
(I'll make a pit stop since I don't want to go back just yet.)

194
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:10,255
I'll make a pit stop since I don't want to go back just yet.

195
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,248
(Why is Bo Gum suddenly entering a convenience store?)

196
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:15,649
- What will you do then?
- He went into a convenience store.

197
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:17,548
- Why did he suddenly go in there?
- What?

198
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:18,688
He said he didn't want to come back just yet...

199
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:19,889
- and went in. Wait.
- Bo Gum?

200
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,658
- What?
- Who?

201
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:23,689
- He's doing a separate mission.
- That's...

202
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,698
(The staff member is rapidly pounding away at the keyboard.)

203
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:30,798
(Bo Gum's Director)

204
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,739
(Bo Gum boldly entered a convenience store.)

205
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,169
(He decisively picks out the ice cream.)

206
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:41,039
Do you know KBS's tax number for cash receipts?

207
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:43,478
You don't know the business registration number?

208
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,719
(He wants to file the cash receipt for the station?)

209
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:47,279
What's wrong with him?

210
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:50,619
Hello.

211
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,858
(If he's recognized here, the mission could be a bust.)

212
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,459
Are these 4 melon ice pops 3 dollars?

213
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,429
Yes.

214
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,758
Could you give me the receipt?

215
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,928
(Will the owner recognize Bo Gum?)

216
00:09:58,929 --> 00:09:59,958
The convenience store...

217
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,198
(Will the owner recognize Bo Gum?)

218
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:03,629
Could you give me the receipt?

219
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,699
(She didn't recognize him!)

220
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,409
Thank you. Bye.

221
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,748
(Bo Gum returns after stopping by the convenience store.)

222
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:16,749
(Sighing)

223
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,818
(Bo Gum returns after stopping by the convenience store.)

224
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,378
- That's...
- Bo Gum is coming back.

225
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:21,418
- I wouldn't get that.
- Bo Gum is almost here.

226
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,249
- Bo Gum is almost here.
- He did it.

227
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,088
What about DinDin?

228
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:27,919
(But where is DinDin now?)

229
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,928
(DinDin sees that Bo Gum has left.)

230
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:33,999
Are their dumplings good?

231
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,698
- What?
- I'm not sure.

232
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:38,268
- You've never had them? Really?
- I'm here on a trip.

233
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,669
(He's talking to another customer.)

234
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,309
I wasn't sure, so I kept looking at you.

235
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:43,439
Me?

236
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,639
Do you think... So you recognized me?

237
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:46,909
I can recognize you now.

238
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,359
You can't with the hat on, right?

239
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,909
No. I still can.

240
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:52,519
What about with the hat on?

241
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,178
- Can you?
- I was wondering if it was you.

242
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,179
- Really?
- Seriously.

243
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,388
(They finally recognize DinDin.)

244
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:58,389
- Hello.
- Hello.

245
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,359
- I love watching 2 Days 1 Night.
- Thank you.

246
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,858
- DinDin.
- Thank you.

247
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,428
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

248
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,159
(The people of Yeosu are welcoming DinDin.)

249
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,698
She recognized him but didn't say anything.

250
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,699
(DinDin fails his mission.)

251
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,269
- They recognized DinDin?
- Yes.

252
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:14,369
(However, even if DinDin failed, Team Bo Gum had already succeeded.)

253
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:16,368
Have a good day.

254
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:18,409
(DinDin picks up the dumplings he ordered earlier.)

255
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,308
Should I go over there and mess with them?

256
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:23,149
(Should I go over there and mess with them?)

257
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,778
Should we go over there and buy the baguette burger?

258
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,379
(Team Sang Yi is still waiting in line.)

259
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,389
(30 seconds before DinDin's ambush)

260
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:35,989
Gosh, my eyes are tired.

261
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,958
- I think you can relax your eyes.
- Right?

262
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,099
Are their rice cakes good?

263
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:42,999
Are their rice cakes good?

264
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,899
(Flustered)

265
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:47,899
Are their rice cakes good?

266
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,069
(Are their rice cakes good?)

267
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:52,579
(Right then, he spots DinDin.)

268
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,349
(He must have thought DinDin was just a weird guy.)

269
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:04,689
(DinDin leaves the scene after getting strange looks from him.)

270
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:06,818
Keep them someplace cool, please.

271
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,258
You can store them in the fridge for two days.

272
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:10,065
Are the sticky rice cakes your signature product?

273
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,158
The sticky rice cakes? Yes.

274
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,858
(Yes)

275
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:14,298
- Thank you.
- Okay.

276
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,369
(The celebrities leave.)

277
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:19,739
Just now, Joon asked him point-blank,

278
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:21,698
"Are the sticky rice cakes your signature product?"

279
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,768
- Joon asked him that.
- Yes.

280
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:25,008
Then the worker say, "Yes, they are our signature product."

281
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,039
(Why would he ask me an obvious question?)

282
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:32,179
(It's understandable why no one recognized him.)

283
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,189
(While they return to the headquarters...)

284
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:39,595
- What?
- You didn't get recognized, right?

285
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,219
- I didn't.
- Nice.

286
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,359
- Hey.
- You didn't?

287
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,388
What did you do...

288
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:44,665
- at the convenience store?
- Why?

289
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:45,899
I bought some melon ice pops.

290
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,759
- Ice cream?
- Yes.

291
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,368
- Hey.
- I got the receipt...

292
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,868
just in case.

293
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,545
(The melon ice pops Bo Gum risked his life for)

294
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:53,569
Here you go.

295
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:55,839
These are melon ice pops from Bo Gum.

296
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,009
- The dumplings.
- That's amazing.

297
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,408
Take a picture and then eat it.

298
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:00,938
(Take a picture and then eat it.)

299
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:03,408
- DinDin.
- Well, we got a tasty dessert.

300
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,779
- What are you doing?
- No one recognized you in that?

301
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,378
Even in that getup?

302
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:08,448
(DinDin from Team Bo Gum returns shortly after.)

303
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:09,419
- My gosh.
- You're back.

304
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,188
We might have worried too much for no reason.

305
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:12,189
Is that so? My gosh.

306
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:13,519
That looks good.

307
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:16,988
We had some money left, so we bought this.

308
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:18,389
- Great.
- Nice.

309
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:21,358
You said there were many critical moments.

310
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:23,005
- No one looked at us.
- Critical moments?

311
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,428
- There weren't critical moments.
- No.

312
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,298
- There was no critical moment.
- No one even looked at us.

313
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:27,768
I detached the camera on my umbrella.

314
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:29,139
I took a selfie and stuff.

315
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:30,339
Seriously.

316
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:32,979
(The camera was attached to the umbrella.)

317
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,349
(A selfie time)

318
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:38,378
Do we just eat now? Or...

319
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:40,078
- Over there...
- Take your time and have your food.

320
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,849
In five minutes, the dessert...

321
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:43,048
The dessert will arrive as promised.

322
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:44,588
- Okay. Let's eat and talk.
- Yes.

323
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:45,989
We can share some with them.

324
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,839
- Dig in. The ice cream is melting.
- Hey.

325
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,788
I bet your heart is pounding now.

326
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,965
(Bo Gum shares the food with the staff first.)

327
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:53,589
- Go ahead.
- The eldest must eat first.

328
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:55,975
- The eldest must eat 1st?
- The eldest must eat 1st.

329
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,329
(Slurping)

330
00:13:58,199 --> 00:13:59,868
- Let's share the rice cakes.
- The chopsticks...

331
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:00,998
- It's so good.
- This is crazy.

332
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:01,999
- This is so good.
- Rice cakes...

333
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,408
- We'll eat this first.
- This is crazy.

334
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,969
- Hey, this is so good.
- It's so good.

335
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:06,678
- The ice cream is so good.
- Is it good?

336
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,999
- Really?
- Of course, it's good.

337
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:09,109
The dumplings are tasty.

338
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,009
(Bo Gum is hooked on the dumplings.)

339
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:14,379
- My gosh.
- Nice. The dumplings are tasty.

340
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,319
- Gosh, the dumplings are so good.
- The dumplings are tasty.

341
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,489
The dumplings are tasty.

342
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:21,059
Bo Gum was great.

343
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:23,735
- Hey.
- My gosh, it's good.

344
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,258
(He's amazed by the taste of the dumplings.)

345
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,329
- Seriously. It's so good.
- This is crazy.

346
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:30,269
- We have so much ice cream.
- My gosh.

347
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,568
(House-made mugwort-flavored chocolate pie...)

348
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:35,198
(and sweet mugwort ice cream)

349
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,768
- Today is our lucky day.
- Gosh. I just need that.

350
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:37,929
Things are usually different?

351
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:39,908
This is the most food I had while starring on this show.

352
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:41,685
Really? Wait. Can I get one more? The chocolate...

353
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:42,779
I mean, the ice cream.

354
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,679
(Time to taste the additional desserts)

355
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,518
(Munching)

356
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,519
This is so good.

357
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:53,918
(A dessert party in Yeosu)

358
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,789
Yeosu has a lot of tasty desserts.

359
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,628
(I know that this clip is random.)

360
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:07,568
(But Bo Gum is just so handsome, so I included it.)

361
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:09,868
(From the editor)

362
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,469
My gosh. You eat a lot.

363
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:12,789
- This is so good.
- Really?

364
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,979
- Sang Yi finished it in one go.
- Right.

365
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:18,978
Sang Yi, you look much happier now than you did an hour ago.

366
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:20,018
So that's nice.

367
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,425
- Because he had some food now.
- Yes.

368
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:22,689
By the way, this is so good.

369
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,218
At this rate, I could eat a few dozens of this.

370
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:26,518
- Here's why.
- This...

371
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,258
You need to stop me. My gosh, this...

372
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,959
It's sweet.

373
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,959
- The sweetness isn't in-your-face.
- Right.

374
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:33,935
You can keep eating this kind of sweet dessert.

375
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,729
- It's so good.
- Right. This...

376
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,368
(Bo Gum eats the strawberry sticky rice cake in one bite.)

377
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:40,609
- Jong Min, you love chocolate.
- Yes, I love chocolate.

378
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:44,269
- Bo Gum, you eat a lot.
- Yes, he eats a lot.

379
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:46,438
Go ahead, Sang Yi. Eat up...

380
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:48,115
because we might not be able to eat later.

381
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:49,908
That's 100 percent. We might not be able to eat.

382
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:51,179
- That's a possibility.
- Yes.

383
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:54,379
By the way, this feels a bit iffy.

384
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:55,619
- Why?
- Why?

385
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:57,899
Because it feels like we just went out and got food.

386
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,358
- When I was eating...
- It was just a nervous food run.

387
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,958
It didn't feel like a mission. It was like a food run.

388
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,129
So I feel a bit guilty.

389
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:05,229
This is how it felt.

390
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,299
Bo Gum wore a hoodie and turned away from the people.

391
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,869
But they all glanced at Bo Gum like this.

392
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:13,239
- Because he's handsome.
- Yes.

393
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,539
Do you have more?

394
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,979
(They must've thought he was just a handsome guy.)

395
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,625
- Yeosu has great desserts. Yes.
- Did you all enjoy the desserts?

396
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,778
Then let's head over to the base camp.

397
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,679
- Okay.
- My gosh. Really?

398
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,149
Right.

399
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,749
(Bo Gum gathers the trash.)

400
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:33,089
Gosh, look at him clearing the table.

401
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,019
- Right.
- My gosh.

402
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:39,058
Sang Yi, do you need a clip like that?

403
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:40,775
- What kind of clip?
- Of you clearing the table.

404
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,959
- I'm good.
- Really?

405
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,809
- We can clear the table together.
- Yes.

406
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,698
(Let's clean up together and head over to the base camp.)

407
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:48,739
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

408
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,408
- I'm so full.
- My blood sugar is up now.

409
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:53,709
Stop dozing off.

410
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:56,079
Gosh, I'm full. I'm done for the day.

411
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,508
Right. That's enough sugar.

412
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:59,119
- Really?
- Yes. I can't eat anymore.

413
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,749
No, we must eat more.

414
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,019
- Really?
- Yes.

415
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,658
I'm used to eating constantly throughout the day.

416
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,659
(Sang Yi spreads his food philosophy to Jong Min.)

417
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:13,198
It's been a while since we traveled together on a bus, right?

418
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,039
(It seems he has something to say to Se Yoon.)

419
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:16,669
Do you want to sit here?

420
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,869
- Why?
- Do you want to sit here?

421
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,669
- Why?
- You don't have a backrest.

422
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:23,108
- No.
- No, I'm comfortable here.

423
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,085
- Se Yoon, I can support your back.
- It's comfortable here.

424
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,109
- It's...
- Are you okay?

425
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,049
(There they are. He's been hiding his wings all along.)

426
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:31,679
(Is he okay?)

427
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:37,089
Sang Yi. You were on a few variety shows lately.

428
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:38,518
Bo Gum, hasn't it been a while...

429
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,665
since you filmed a variety show outdoors?

430
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:40,689
Yes, it has been a while.

431
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:42,258
How is it?

432
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:44,529
Are you more comfortable with filming dramas? Or...

433
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:46,158
I mean, it might not be comfortable.

434
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:49,129
- But it might be different...
- But when I'm on variety shows,

435
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,229
I don't worry or get nervous.

436
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,239
- It's fun for me.
- Really?

437
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:55,868
Seeing how you raised your eyebrows earlier,

438
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:57,229
- variety shows suit you.
- Right.

439
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,585
- We could tell you were having fun.
- You were born with this talent.

440
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:00,638
- Right.
- He has fun.

441
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,809
- What about you, Bo Gum?
- Me?

442
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,049
Variety shows that involve physical activities are fun for me.

443
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,855
- Really?
- Ones with physical activities?

444
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,559
- Do you like going into the water?
- Yes.

445
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:11,649
Really?

446
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,319
- When we were filming our drama, - Okay.

447
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:16,359
We had to go underwater for a scene.

448
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:19,428
Bo Gum is a great swimmer. His nickname is Seal.

449
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:21,759
He helped me feel safe during the scene.

450
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:24,098
Bo Gum, you're a good swimmer.

451
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:26,145
I'm sure you can become a certified diver pretty fast.

452
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:27,999
- I'm already certified.
- You are?

453
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,408
I knew it.

454
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,245
Have you ever seen that? Fanta rays? What was that called?

455
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:32,409
- Manta rays.
- No.

456
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,679
Fanta?

457
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,979
- That sounds tasty.
- Fanta.

458
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:36,478
Are fanta rays tasty?

459
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,239
What was that? You should've said Santa ray.

460
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:40,279
- Fanta. Are they orange-flavored?
- No.

461
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:42,719
I wish the weather was better today.

462
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:44,718
We could've gone for a swim.

463
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,535
- Right. What a pity.
- We could've gone hiking.

464
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,959
- This is not good.
- We're near the sea in Yeosu.

465
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:50,658
We could go into the sea...

466
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:52,499
- and take off our shirts.
- Yes.

467
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,659
- Sang Yi has a great body.
- Really?

468
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,128
- Not now.
- You should dive into the water.

469
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:57,429
I stopped watching my figure.

470
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:59,098
- When you watch "Bloodhounds,"
- Right.

471
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:00,545
- you can see his body.
- His body fat...

472
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:02,138
Isn't it under five percent?

473
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:03,408
Back then, it was seven percent.

474
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,668
- Right.
- That's crazy.

475
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:05,939
That's just impossible.

476
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:08,579
It sounds like you guys live so diligently.

477
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:10,778
- You worked out and got certified.
- Yes.

478
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:11,808
Right. That's crazy.

479
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:15,579
But is there something you fear? Like a challenge, perhaps?

480
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,019
Can you catch a cockroach?

481
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,058
- I find it gross, but I can.
- You can still do it, though.

482
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,899
Can you hook an earthworm on a fishing needle?

483
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:23,328
- Should I try?
- Really?

484
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,659
(Utterly enthusiastic)

485
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:26,759
- Then...
- Can you eat caterpillars?

486
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:28,299
- Eat them?
- Can you eat them?

487
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:30,309
- Why would he eat caterpillars?
- For protein.

488
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,138
- Isn't that future food?
- We should screen the answers.

489
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,315
- Yes. It's future food. Space food.
- It's future food.

490
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:36,568
Have you had sand lance extract?

491
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:37,685
(Forget about caterpillars.)

492
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,709
- I don't think I had it properly.
- Really?

493
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,138
But I'd like to try it if there's an opportunity for it.

494
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,459
- I think he can do it.
- Really?

495
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:45,179
Do you consider yourself a lucky guy?

496
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:46,819
Yes, I do.

497
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,418
- Am I a lucky guy? No.
- Then...

498
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,395
(A man who thinks he's a lucky guy and a man who doesn't)

499
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:53,319
(12 hours later)

500
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,059
- Please!
- Please!

501
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,989
- Please!
- No!

502
00:19:57,189 --> 00:20:01,229
(A cruel fate will shock them.)

503
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,729
(What will happen to them?)

504
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,439
The weather is clearing up.

505
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,009
Right. It stopped raining.

506
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,938
It's not raining anymore.

507
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:13,679
(They arrive at the base camp.)

508
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:15,538
- Let's go.
- Yes.

509
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,218
(Annex)

510
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,579
(Spotting the drone camera)

511
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,949
(Waving)

512
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:28,419
(Fly up!)

513
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,858
(The sea in Yeosu stretches out endlessly.)

514
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:33,129
The view is amazing.

515
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,559
Gosh, what is this?

516
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,559
(Amazed)

517
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,599
Is the view nice?

518
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,669
- The view looks amazing.
- It's no joke.

519
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:39,798
This is crazy.

520
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,668
(They get upgraded to a room with the view of the ocean.)

521
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:43,068
- Gosh.
- I love the sound of the waves.

522
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:45,809
(Enjoying the sound of the waves in the balcony)

523
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:48,308
- Hey, come on in.
- Let's lie down.

524
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:49,309
(He remembers to tidy up the shoes.)

525
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,379
- Let me finish this.
- The view is amazing.

526
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,378
My gosh. Seriously.

527
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:55,579
(Plopping down)

528
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,658
(Fatigue suddenly hits him now that he's sitting down.)

529
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:00,889
My gosh, look over there.

530
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:02,388
- What?
- The clouds. The fog...

531
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:04,058
What do you call that?

532
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:05,059
The ocean fog.

533
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,429
(Laughing)

534
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:10,928
(Chuckling)

535
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:12,198
I doubt that you guys had much sleep.

536
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:14,038
- Did you have to film something?
- Yes.

537
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,768
Sang Yi probably had to film his drama yesterday.

538
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:17,369
I had to film "Bloodhounds 2" yesterday.

539
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:20,249
- I see. You're filming it now?
- Yes, we're still filming it.

540
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:22,808
I've been watching my diet lately too.

541
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,949
- That's the worst.
- So today is my cheat day.

542
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,279
I see.

543
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:28,355
- But you barely got to eat today.
- But...

544
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:29,779
- Right.
- You only had vegetables.

545
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,089
- I like it.
- Yes.

546
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:33,719
- Are the cameras recording us?
- Really?

547
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,289
Yes, they're recording.

548
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:38,028
Charging the batteries must be a lot of work too.

549
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:39,029
(In the midst of all this, )

550
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,399
(Seon Ho seems restless for some reason.)

551
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:44,499
Bo Gum.

552
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:46,499
- Yes?
- Can I...

553
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,838
- take a picture with you?
- Sure. Of course, you can.

554
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,839
He said...

555
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,508
- that the best drama in his life...
- Come on.

556
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:53,638
Was "When Life Gives You Tangerines."

557
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:55,515
- That's right.
- Right. He said that to me earlier.

558
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:56,948
- For real?
- I wanted to talk to him all along,

559
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:57,949
- but I didn't have the courage.
- Because you like him?

560
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,270
- Why does it take courage to do so?
- Hey, how did you...

561
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,549
(Actually, 5 minutes earlier, Seon Ho...)

562
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,589
(Prowling)

563
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:10,089
(Moving awkwardly)

564
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,499
- You can put it here.
- Sorry? Well...

565
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,298
- Shall I put it there?
- Yes.

566
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,298
(He nervously says, "Shall I put it there?")

567
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:18,468
- Why does it take courage to do so?
- Hey, how did you...

568
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:19,998
even do the shoot with him if you were so nervous?

569
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:21,438
- You can't even talk to him.
- I really don't know.

570
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,385
- Did you pretend you were okay?
- I pretended I wasn't nervous.

571
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:24,409
Thank you, Bo Gum.

572
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,479
(Making a V-sign)

573
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:28,308
(Seon Ho meets his celebrity crush. Bo Gum and Seon Ho together)

574
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:29,548
(Cute and refreshing)

575
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:32,108
It was my almost first time asking another celebrity for a picture.

576
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:33,119
Really?

577
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:36,749
- It was my third time.
- I see.

578
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,248
You've never asked DinDin yet.

579
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:40,418
(Putting his hand on his lap)

580
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:41,419
He also wants...

581
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:44,428
- Hey, what was that?
- It meant nothing.

582
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,688
- Sang Yi.
- I didn't mean anything by that.

583
00:22:45,689 --> 00:22:46,729
It meant nothing.

584
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:48,128
- I want to take a picture with you.
- That's okay.

585
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:49,969
That's a natural way to express what you want.

586
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,239
You should've just said to him.

587
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,269
One, two...

588
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:54,668
- That's funny.
- Come on. Make a V-sign.

589
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:56,209
(Come on. Make a V-sign.)

590
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,208
Do you want to get bitten by the bloodhound?

591
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,378
(Sang Yi and Seon Ho, Not forced, Be good not to get bitten.)

592
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,539
Try not to get on his nerves.

593
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,938
I'll take a picture with everyone.

594
00:23:01,939 --> 00:23:03,478
(Let's take a group selfie.)

595
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,479
Gather around.

596
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:06,849
Wait. Sae Ho isn't here.

597
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,549
I just changed gauze. I'll be right there.

598
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:11,818
- Oh, no. He peed himself.
- Yes, he did.

599
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:13,219
Did you pee yourself?

600
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:14,959
One, two, three.

601
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,628
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

602
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,688
(Making a good memory with Bo Gum, Jong Min is in the bathroom.)

603
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:19,728
Thank you.

604
00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:20,928
- Thank you so much, Bo Gum.
- I have to change gauze...

605
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:22,675
- I should be thanking you.
- I'm not usually like this.

606
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:24,145
- That was nothing.
- Thank you so much.

607
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,905
- I put some below there too.
- Please sit here.

608
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:27,568
- That's okay.
- Sae Ho, lie down.

609
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:28,569
No, that's okay.

610
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:30,668
By the way, this place has a great view.

611
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:32,008
- Isn't it amazing?
- It's beautiful, right?

612
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:33,078
- Yes.
- The beach is right there.

613
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,808
If two people who are interested in each other come here,

614
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:36,679
they would go out there and start dating.

615
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:39,879
But this is a place for adolescents.

616
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:42,178
If kids come here and start dating, that'd be a little...

617
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:43,419
Don't adolescents date?

618
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:44,988
Yes, they do date.

619
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:45,989
- Right?
- Yes, they do.

620
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,859
Would Si Yeon have a romantic time with a boy if she came here?

621
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:51,129
Why would you take my daughter as an example?

622
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,258
- He's sensitive about it as a dad.
- Isn't she an adolescent?

623
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,075
What will you do when your daughter start dating?

624
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:56,498
Well, I should congratulate her.

625
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:58,075
- She must be popular...
- Later when she becomes...

626
00:23:58,099 --> 00:23:59,168
Let's say she's a college student.

627
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:00,338
- She just enrolled in college.
- She's 20 years old.

628
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,599
And suddenly, she says she has a boyfriend.

629
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,869
She wants to go on a trip with him.

630
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,409
That would be unexpected.

631
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,678
- An overnight trip.
- Right.

632
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,349
- With her boyfriend.
- "Can I go, Dad?"

633
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:11,809
- Can I tag along?
- No.

634
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:14,478
Seeing that you stuttered, you wouldn't let her go.

635
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:15,479
That's not it.

636
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,918
I have no choice. Since she's an adult,

637
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,465
- I should let her decide.
- What about you, Bo Gum?

638
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:19,858
- What about you, Bo Gum?
- I should let her decide.

639
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,195
Let's say you have a daughter, and she wants to go on a trip.

640
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:23,588
What would you do if you were a dad?

641
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:24,828
(They want to know how Bo Gum thinks since he played Gwan Sik.)

642
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:25,889
With her female friends?

643
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:27,935
- No, with her boyfriend.
- No, with her boyfriend.

644
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,468
- No? I see.
- No? Really?

645
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,469
- Then when would you approve?
- There's no way.

646
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,469
When she's 21?

647
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:35,468
I don't think I'd approve of her going on a trip with her boyfriend.

648
00:24:35,469 --> 00:24:37,639
- Really?
- It's an overnight trip.

649
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,809
- No way.
- Really?

650
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,285
- At what age can she do that?
- Then...

651
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:42,255
Let's say you have a daughter, and she's getting married.

652
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,055
My daughter introduces me to her future husband?

653
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,448
Would you choose Bo Gum with 100,000 dollars?

654
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:46,718
(Choose Your Son-in-Law, Bo Gum with 100,000 dollars)

655
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,119
Or Sae Ho with 100 million dollars?

656
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:49,948
That's a hard question.

657
00:24:49,949 --> 00:24:51,048
I'd definitely choose Bo Gum with 100,000 dollars...

658
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:52,995
because I think Sae Ho with 100 million dollars...

659
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:54,918
- would be too boastful.
- Why would Sae Ho...

660
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:56,458
- My gosh. That brat...
- My daughter...

661
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:57,558
- You're messing with Sae Ho.
- My daughter...

662
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,089
He's so disrespectful.

663
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,905
He's just saying things to annoy me.

664
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:02,359
I wouldn't choose you either.

665
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,928
I wouldn't choose you even if you had 100 million dollars.

666
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:05,468
- This is why I wouldn't choose you.
- I think he'd be a good choice.

667
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,429
Bo Gum, whom would you choose as your son-in-law?

668
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:09,039
Se Yoon with 100 million dollars?

669
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:11,815
Or Bo Gum with five million dollars?

670
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,399
Five million dollars is a lot of money.

671
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:17,048
(Thinking)

672
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,209
Be completely honest with us.

673
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:21,649
He's hesitating to answer. You know what his answer is.

674
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,618
How about this? Se Yoon with 100 million dollars...

675
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:24,619
or Bo Gum with two million dollars in debt?

676
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,888
- That's hard to decide.
- With two million dollars in debt.

677
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:27,388
- I'd choose 100 million dollars.
- I see.

678
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:28,988
- What if it's 1 million dollars?
- I'd still choose 100 million.

679
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:30,389
- He's in debt...
- How about zero?

680
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,159
- No debt?
- And no money.

681
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,228
Then I'd choose Bo Gum.

682
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:36,998
(Then I'd choose Bo Gum.)

683
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:38,599
You brat! Don't stop me!

684
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,039
(Laughing)

685
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:46,778
- It's all good if he has no debt?
- It's fun.

686
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,008
- Right. It's fun, indeed.
- It's fun.

687
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:49,449
- It's fun.
- Hey.

688
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:51,908
- Is Sang Yi okay?
- I think he's fine.

689
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:53,295
- Is he really okay?
- Yesterday...

690
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,425
He fought a bloodhound yesterday, so he must be tired.

691
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:56,488
- He must be really tired.
- Sorry?

692
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:58,949
He might be listening to our conversation.

693
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:01,658
Maybe he missed the right time to open his eyes,

694
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:02,758
which is why he keeps his eyes closed.

695
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:03,828
- You know what I mean, right?
- He's just tired.

696
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,328
- He'll be fine.
- He seems really tired.

697
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:09,569
(Sang Yi, have a nice nap. We'll see you later.)

698
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:12,629
(While the members rest, the sun goes down.)

699
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,038
So the scene from "When Life Gives You Tangerines..."

700
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,439
(The members gathered again.)

701
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:19,538
This is where Ae Sun calls her mother, right?

702
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:20,738
- That's correct.
- Really?

703
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:21,899
- What? Really?
- Oh, I know.

704
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:23,478
- Where she writes a poem?
- Yes.

705
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,239
- Was the scene filmed here?
- That's right.

706
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:28,449
(The large grass field at the base camp)

707
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,925
This is where the scene was filmed? That's amazing.

708
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:31,988
Really?

709
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:33,759
This is where Ae Sun, played by IU...

710
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,429
Wait. What's that? I see boxing gloves there.

711
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:38,305
- To be honest, I wanted...
- It's an individual game.

712
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:40,175
- to have a match with Sang Yi.
- You can put them here.

713
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,528
(Acting tough)

714
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:45,129
They didn't go home because they were tired, right?

715
00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:46,939
Should I discipline them?

716
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,269
- There they come.
- One, two. Ready, go.

717
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,208
(Happy birthday to you, and congratulations on your marriage)

718
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,239
- What's that?
- Oh, my.

719
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:53,579
Se Yoon and Jong Min

720
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:56,138
(Bo Gum and Sang Yi prepared cakes?)

721
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:57,148
But it's not today.

722
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:58,208
Those cakes...

723
00:26:58,209 --> 00:26:59,848
(Our loving Jong Min and Se Yoon)

724
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:00,878
What's that?

725
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:02,178
- What's that?
- You didn't have to do this.

726
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:03,889
(They're surprised. "Are those for us?")

727
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:06,888
(They surprised them with the cakes to congratulate the two of them.)

728
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:09,689
This is a very rare sight to see, so I'll send you the video, Se Yoon.

729
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,235
- Is it for me? Are you serious?
- It's for his birthday.

730
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:12,388
Really? Thank you so much.

731
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:13,658
Actually, Bo Gum prepared the cakes.

732
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:14,698
- He asked me to hold one of them.
- I asked him to do it with me.

733
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:15,699
- Really?
- Yes.

734
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:18,669
(They talked about Se Yoon's birthday for a bit in the bus.)

735
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,298
(Perking up his ears)

736
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:22,039
(He heard it and remembered it.)

737
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,879
- Oh, my. I'm so grateful.
- Me too. I'm so touched.

738
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,239
Blow out the candles.

739
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:28,009
- One...
- One, two, three.

740
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:29,709
Thank you so much.

741
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:30,709
(Congratulations)

742
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,308
- I really appreciate this.
- I'll make sure to deliver this.

743
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:33,748
- That's thoughtful of him.
- Thank you so much.

744
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:36,689
There's a legend that says if you don't share a cake,

745
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:38,788
something bad may happen...

746
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:41,118
- to the star of the day.
- Right. I heard that too.

747
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,818
On my mother-in-law's birthday, we ate...

748
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:44,139
Is it too obvious that I'm lying?

749
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,228
- You went too far.
- Your mother-in-law's birthday?

750
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:47,328
- That's a far-fetched lie.
- Right.

751
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:49,228
- I'm sorry. What?
- Thank you so much for this.

752
00:27:49,229 --> 00:27:51,368
- Thank you. Can you...
- Don't mention it.

753
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,038
- put this in our room or tent?
- Have it before you go to bed.

754
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,098
- It looks so delicious.
- Make sure of it.

755
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:55,768
- Thank you, guys.
- They're more thoughtful...

756
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:56,838
- than the cast members.
- I'm so touched.

757
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,938
Bo Gum, thank you.

758
00:27:57,939 --> 00:27:59,638
(Happy)

759
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:00,709
Congratulations, you two.

760
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,049
Bo Gum, you know what place this is, right?

761
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,025
- Moon So Ri's scene was filmed.
- Here?

762
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:06,108
- I'm having goosebumps.
- It was filmed here.

763
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:07,119
It's written there.

764
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:08,355
- The 1st scene of the 1st episode.
- Correct.

765
00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:09,379
- Here?
- That's right.

766
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:11,048
- I watched it.
- Where she teaches a class?

767
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:12,089
That's correct.

768
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:14,488
So it was filmed here on this grass field.

769
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:15,569
- It's beautiful.
- Indeed.

770
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:17,128
- Everyone, are you enjoying...
- Yes.

771
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,258
The taste of Yeosu?

772
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:19,259
- Yes!
- Yes!

773
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,180
- Vegetables are good in Yeosu.
- They're sweet.

774
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,998
- You didn't try many dishes, right?
- Mushrooms are good too.

775
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:24,268
- Mushrooms are good in Yeosu.
- Sang Yi...

776
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,368
The dinner we prepared for you...

777
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:27,798
is a collection...

778
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:28,799
- of best dishes in Yeosu.
- Marinated crab?

779
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,438
It's the Meal of Yeosu's Delicacies.

780
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,345
- It's worth fighting for.
- It sounds delicious.

781
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:33,378
- A meal of delicacies?
- Yes.

782
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,538
- A meal of delicacies.
- This is the beginning.

783
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,878
We jumped through hoops to get this at a very popular restaurant.

784
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,709
- Soy sauce marinated crab.
- Of course.

785
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,518
And gray mullet sashimi made with fish...

786
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,718
caught freshly in the coastal water.

787
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,118
- Gray mullet?
- Gray mullet is in season now.

788
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,119
Gray mullet is in season now.

789
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,249
(They will also have stone crab doenjang stew.)

790
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,119
(Braised silver pomfret)

791
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:50,828
Including Dolsan mustard greens kimchi,

792
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,358
- seven dishes will be served.
- Seven dishes?

793
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,599
- Seven dishes.
- Yes.

794
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:55,958
- We'll make sure to win.
- We'll eat this time.

795
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:56,998
It sounds delicious.

796
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:58,368
Now it's time for the Dinner Game.

797
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,398
- Yes.
- Yes.

798
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,239
As Bo Gum and Sang Yi play...

799
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:05,568
former Summer Games medalists in their drama "Good Boy,"

800
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:06,638
we prepared this game.

801
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:08,878
- Today's Dinner Game is...
- What could that be?

802
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:10,509
Food Boy Summer Games.

803
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,248
- Summer Games.
- Summer Games?

804
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,848
There are three different games,

805
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:14,878
- and it's a team match.
- I see.

806
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,649
Only the team with the higher score get to eat dinner.

807
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:19,959
The first game of Food Boy Summer Games is...

808
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:22,189
Dynamic Visual Acuity Boxing.

809
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:23,328
- "Dynamic visual acuity?"
- What kind of game is it?

810
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:26,528
Bo Gum, you play a former boxer who won a gold medal, right?

811
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:27,529
Yes.

812
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,198
(Bo Gum transforms into a boxer in the drama.)

813
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,698
("Park Bo Gum Becomes a Boxer," "Park Bo Gum Trains for 6 Months")

814
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:32,168
("Park Bo Gum Plays a Boxer in 'Good Boy'")

815
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:34,668
It's not that we don't believe you.

816
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:36,198
- Yes?
- Can you shadow-box for us?

817
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,959
- Right. Show us, please.
- Show us, please.

818
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:40,239
- His basic stance is good.
- Oh, my. That's good.

819
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:41,479
One, two.

820
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:42,909
That's good.

821
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:45,078
- One, two.
- I can see them.

822
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,748
- That was good.
- I could see his fists.

823
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:48,048
Even his fists seem nice.

824
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,049
- Faster!
- No, wait.

825
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,218
- Learn DinDin's toy hammer skills.
- He's good at it.

826
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:51,325
Show him your toy hammer skills.

827
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:52,648
- You need to move fast...
- The toy hammer skills.

828
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:53,865
- so that your fists are invisible.
- That's right.

829
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:54,889
(Moving his arms quickly)

830
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,359
That's good.

831
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,359
(Flailing)

832
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,388
(It seems like it wouldn't hurt at all.)

833
00:29:58,389 --> 00:29:59,658
- I just did it.
- I couldn't see his hands.

834
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:00,958
- You couldn't see them, right?
- My hand touched you. Yes.

835
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,528
- My hand touched you.
- I really couldn't see his move.

836
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:03,798
Sang Yi, can you show us too?

837
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,528
- Sang Yi is...
- He's good at boxing.

838
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:06,775
- He's great at it.
- I'm not so good at it.

839
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,708
DinDin saw the gloves and said he wanted to spar...

840
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,908
- with Sang Yi. What do you say?
- Right.

841
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:13,808
- I'll assist you.
- Nonsense. He's great at it.

842
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:15,585
- One, one, two? I'll assist you.
- Will he be okay?

843
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:16,609
Okay.

844
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:18,869
- He's running away.
- Okay.

845
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:20,848
(DinDin runs away in fear after Sang Yi throws a few punches.)

846
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:21,849
(Intimidated)

847
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:23,918
That was great.

848
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:24,919
(Scared)

849
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,148
You should've hit my palms.

850
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:27,719
Why did you aim for my face?

851
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:30,005
- What will you do? He's crying.
- It's not... I was...

852
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,029
This is why I'm uncomfortable around the guests...

853
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,110
who are the same age as me.

854
00:30:32,189 --> 00:30:33,559
- Oh, no. He's crying.
- My gosh.

855
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:35,598
He cries easily. Don't be like that.

856
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,398
In this mission, the boxing skills of the team leaders,

857
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,139
who are Bo Gum and Sang Yi, are very crucial.

858
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,009
The leader of one team will hit the cobra bag...

859
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,939
- with an emoji quiz on it.
- Yes.

860
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,279
The members of the other team have to see the emojis...

861
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:51,478
and guess the answer.

862
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,479
We have to solve a quiz?

863
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:54,878
The team that gets the right answer faster than the other...

864
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:56,218
- wins.
- Oh, I see.

865
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:57,248
- Okay.
- Okay.

866
00:30:57,249 --> 00:31:00,659
The team that gets the right answer in a shorter time gets 100 points.

867
00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:02,619
Please bring it here.

868
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:04,488
- So this is a cobra bag.
- Put it down.

869
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:05,528
It must be filled with water.

870
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,129
This brings me back old memories.

871
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,529
I ripped about eight punching bags like this.

872
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,029
Why don't you try hitting it to get the hang of it?

873
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:13,398
- Bo Gum, do some warm-ups.
- Try hitting it.

874
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:14,399
- Right. Do it.
- You should do some warm-ups.

875
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,468
- Start with one-two combo.
- It's difficult.

876
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:16,869
It will be swinging and swaying.

877
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,469
- He's good.
- Nice.

878
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:20,785
- I can't see his hand movements.
- He hits it well.

879
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:23,085
- He hits the target accurately.
- He's good as I expected.

880
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:24,589
Nice. It's hard to hit it accurately.

881
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,655
- It seems difficult.
- Nice. That's good.

882
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:28,678
- I've never used this before.
- Think that it's DinDin.

883
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:29,679
It's DinDin's head.

884
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,320
Think that it's DinDin's head and hit it.

885
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:33,049
My gosh. That's scary.

886
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:34,619
That's good, Sang Yi.

887
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:36,605
- Just do it as you do it now.
- He's hitting it hard.

888
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,005
Sang Yi, just do it as you do it now. That's great.

889
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,128
- I like his facial expression.
- Oh, gosh. Stop.

890
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:40,535
- What do you think of my punches?
- I'm scared.

891
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,998
- Goodness.
- DinDin avoided eye contact.

892
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,628
DinDin, do you want to show your toy hammer skills again?

893
00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:45,805
("I shall show them too." Here comes Dongbu Ichon-dong Toy Hammer.)

894
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:48,299
(He's just DinDin the Kid at a game arcade.)

895
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:50,308
- "Stop hitting me."
- He's Dongbu Ichon-dong Toy Hammer.

896
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,309
(Imitating DinDin the Kid)

897
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,378
- "I said to stop hitting me."
- "Did you just hit me again?"

898
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:55,115
- "You'll keep going on like this?"
- "I'm going to get back at you."

899
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:56,808
(He's almost possessed by DinDin the Kid's spirit.)

900
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:58,079
(Annoyed)

901
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,309
(Laughing)

902
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:01,379
Hey, give me 50 cents.

903
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,739
You had fun like you were playing a game, right?

904
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,889
- Give me 50 cents.
- That was humiliating.

905
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:08,249
- He's cute.
- Why is he so cute today?

906
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:10,888
Se Yoon, try punching it like this just once.

907
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:12,858
- Punching this is easy.
- Hit it just once.

908
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:14,059
Just try hitting it.

909
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:15,759
"Hey, you brat."

910
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,299
(Laughing)

911
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:20,599
(A heavy punch like Ma Dong Seok's)

912
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:21,999
(Agile)

913
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:24,508
(Maybe he got tired from a few punches. He misses the target.)

914
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,639
I can't see it.

915
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:27,809
So this is how you should punch it.

916
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,185
- A hard punch makes it invisible.
- You should hit it hard.

917
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:31,625
You should hit it hard to make it invisible.

918
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,625
- Oh, you should hit it hard.
- You should hit it hard.

919
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:35,478
Have you all gotten the hang of it?

920
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:37,618
- Yes.
- Which team will go first?

921
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:39,388
- You two play rock-paper-scissors.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

922
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:41,558
You can use your mouth to play rock-paper-scissors.

923
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,559
By mouthing those three words.

924
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,328
Rock, scissors, and paper.

925
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,128
- There's no game like that.
- I just made it.

926
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:47,158
- It'll be fun.
- Right. Okay.

927
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:48,358
- He just made it.
- Yes.

928
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,128
What do you say? You can use your mouth too.

929
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:52,668
- All right.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

930
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:53,698
(Rock, paper)

931
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:54,699
- What?
- Sang Yi won.

932
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:55,869
- Sang Yi won.
- Rock.

933
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:57,608
- Paper.
- What would be better?

934
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,908
- Let's play after them.
- Let's go second.

935
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,115
- We'll play later. You go first.
- We must see how they do it. Right.

936
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:03,348
The members of Team Bo Gum, please turn around.

937
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,469
- Let's turn around.
- Okay.

938
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,749
Please don't look.

939
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:08,418
So this is where the first scene was filmed.

940
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,449
It's difficult.

941
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:11,248
I can't even figure it out while looking at it.

942
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:13,065
It's really difficult. You guys won't be able to succeed.

943
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:15,089
It has about ten syllables.

944
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:17,789
You see, 98 percent of what Jong Min says is a lie.

945
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,458
(Keeping it in mind)

946
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:21,229
- The category is...
- Let's start.

947
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:22,658
Movie.

948
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:23,898
- Got it.
- It's a movie.

949
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:25,928
- Sang Yi will start now. Ready, go.
- Okay.

950
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:27,069
Start punching it.

951
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:28,568
- Let's begin. Turn around.
- They won't be able to succeed.

952
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:30,068
It's over. They won't know even if they see the hint.

953
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:31,208
"Masquerade."

954
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,209
"Marathon."

955
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:34,838
(You can barely see the hint.)

956
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,909
"Along with the Gods."

957
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:38,949
Gosh. I can't see it.

958
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:41,318
- I can't see it at all.
- "Gone with the Wind."

959
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,895
If you guys get this one right, I'll be impressed.

960
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:45,039
Sang Yi, hit it a bit lightly. I can't see it at all.

961
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:48,000
(You can barely see the hint.)

962
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:50,884
Sang Yi, hit it a bit lightly. I can't see it at all.

963
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:54,778
(This is Team Bo Gum's question. It's a movie title.)

964
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:56,370
If you guys get this one right, I'll be impressed.

965
00:33:56,371 --> 00:33:58,130
(It's a difficult question to solve even when you see the hint clearly.)

966
00:33:58,131 --> 00:34:00,140
- I can't see it.
- Sang Yi will get tired soon.

967
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:01,141
- No, he's...
- Wait until he gets tired.

968
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:02,487
- I can't see it at all.
- Exactly.

969
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:04,310
- The light makes it harder to see.
- You can see it clearly.

970
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:06,441
- No, we can't see it.
- We can't see it at all.

971
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:07,841
Come and see. You can't see it.

972
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:09,550
- Oh, it's completely invisible.
- That's right.

973
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:10,950
- I can't see the shape...
- What's that?

974
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:12,050
You can see it because you know the answer.

975
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:13,621
- "Haeundae."
- Incorrect.

976
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:16,402
- I think it's related to water.
- I think I saw the sea.

977
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,460
(Seon Ho saw the sea.)

978
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:20,890
- I think I saw the sea.
- I see water.

979
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:21,960
"Avatar..."

980
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:24,090
(Sang Yi speeds up to prevent them from seeing the other pictures.)

981
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:25,837
- Sang Yi is really good at boxing.
- Is it a Korean movie?

982
00:34:25,861 --> 00:34:27,130
- You can really see that?
- I can't see anything.

983
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,830
- You're not tired, are you?
- Slow down just a bit.

984
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:30,370
- Hit it lightly. Please.
- Sang Yi, you're not tired, right?

985
00:34:30,371 --> 00:34:32,541
- He seems a little tired.
- No, he's not.

986
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:34,670
- I can't see the second one.
- No, he's okay.

987
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:35,840
The first one is the palm of a hand.

988
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,171
- That's good.
- Nice!

989
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,080
- The palm of a hand. What is it?
- The palm of a hand.

990
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:40,210
- The palm of a hand.
- "Tazza: The High Rollers."

991
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,280
Incorrect.

992
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:43,361
- That's a good guess.
- You're close to the answer.

993
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,620
- What's this movie? What is it?
- What's the second one?

994
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:46,621
- "Inside Men."
- "Inside Men."

995
00:34:46,622 --> 00:34:47,862
- Correct.
- "Inside Men." Yes!

996
00:34:48,691 --> 00:34:50,450
- What is it?
- Mojito.

997
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,860
- Mojito?
- A hand and mojito...

998
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:54,220
- It's so difficult.
- How could anyone figure this out?

999
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:55,560
- Team Bo Gum's record is...
- We did well.

1000
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:57,490
- one minute and forty-two seconds.
- That was fast.

1001
00:34:57,491 --> 00:34:58,560
Our record is 1 minute and 42 seconds?

1002
00:34:58,561 --> 00:35:01,030
- That's a good record.
- Bo Gum saw the hand.

1003
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:03,471
- I saw it in a brief moment.
- Nice.

1004
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,570
It's not bad, don't you think?

1005
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,240
- Right. It was difficult.
- You did well.

1006
00:35:07,241 --> 00:35:08,940
- It wasn't bad.
- You did really well.

1007
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,570
Bo Gum will punch it while Team Sang Yi guess the answer.

1008
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:13,611
Okay. You look only at the last one.

1009
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,040
- I'll see the one in the center.
- Okay.

1010
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,310
- Focus only on one picture.
- Got it.

1011
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:17,311
- Okay?
- Yes.

1012
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:19,420
What could be the answer? I can't figure it out. Hold on.

1013
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,227
- There's no way they'll succeed.
- What is it?

1014
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:22,851
I want to have a meal with seven dishes.

1015
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,850
- The category is movie.
- Okay. It's a movie.

1016
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:25,890
- It's a movie title.
- It could mean the story...

1017
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,220
- or the title.
- Bo Gum, are you ready?

1018
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:28,260
- Yes.
- All right.

1019
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:29,261
I'll do my best.

1020
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:30,261
(Bo Gum is ready.)

1021
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:32,101
- Go.
- All right.

1022
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:33,961
Now look.

1023
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:37,541
- There's no way they'll succeed.
- They won't be able to succeed.

1024
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:41,601
(This is Team Sang Yi's question. It's a movie title.)

1025
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:43,110
(Frowning)

1026
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:44,411
(It's hard to see as expected.)

1027
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:46,057
There's no way they'll figure it out.

1028
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,181
That's good.

1029
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:49,451
Bo Gum, why are you so excited?

1030
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:53,551
(He hits it accurately in a great stance.)

1031
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:02,660
- They can't figure it out.
- There's no way they will.

1032
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,730
- I can't see any of them.
- Hit it lightly.

1033
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:06,701
- You can hit it lightly.
- They won't figure it out anyway.

1034
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:08,981
There's no way they'll figure it out.

1035
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,930
- I can't see it.
- I see clothes.

1036
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:11,931
- They won't figure it out.
- What is that?

1037
00:36:11,932 --> 00:36:13,571
I see clothes. There are clothes...

1038
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:14,640
- You should keep hitting it.
- I see a person.

1039
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:16,310
- Bo Gum lets them see it all.
- I think I saw a person.

1040
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:18,311
- I see a store.
- I see yellow hair.

1041
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:19,511
Yellow hair?

1042
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:20,710
(Clothes and yellow hair?)

1043
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,751
- I can see... That's...
- "The Host."

1044
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:24,311
- Correct.
- What?

1045
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:25,850
I saw a store and squid.

1046
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:26,851
Correct.

1047
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,721
(They succeeded already?)

1048
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:30,091
- I was right.
- I saw a bow,

1049
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:32,160
a school uniform, and a person.

1050
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:33,367
(Han River bridge, Song Kang Ho, school uniform, bow)

1051
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,991
- Is the man Song Kang Ho?
- Okay. Good.

1052
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:36,061
Hey, that was amazing.

1053
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:38,390
- They did well thanks to Joon.
- That was unbelievable.

1054
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:39,530
- How did you figure it out?
- They did well.

1055
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,760
Team Sang Yi got the right answer in 32 seconds.

1056
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:43,130
(Team Sang Yi's record is 32 seconds.)

1057
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:45,000
- Awesome.
- Joon, you did a great job.

1058
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:46,600
You have good dynamic visual acuity.

1059
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:48,811
Joon has been contributing a lot to his team's wins.

1060
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,341
I'm becoming the ace of the team.

1061
00:36:50,571 --> 00:36:52,480
- That was amazing.
- He was incredible, I admit.

1062
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:53,510
- I'm amazed. Joon...
- I agree.

1063
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,671
He can't memorize times tables, but he's good at this.

1064
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:58,950
As a result of the first game Dynamic Visual Acuity Boxing,

1065
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,920
- Team Sang Yi gained 100 points.
- We were facing this side too.

1066
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:02,620
(Team Sang Yi gained 100 points.)

1067
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,420
- We got closer to a fancy meal.
- Hey, Joon.

1068
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:06,090
- We got one step closer to it.
- We're getting closer to it.

1069
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,320
- Joon is doing so great today.
- He's doing a great job.

1070
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:10,890
Listen up. As far as we heard,

1071
00:37:10,891 --> 00:37:12,200
Sang Yi's role in the drama...

1072
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:14,630
- is a medalist in fencing.
- We're in trouble.

1073
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:15,770
We prepared the next game based on that.

1074
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:17,630
- The second game is...
- What sport was it?

1075
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:19,601
- We'll play fencing?
- Bull Fencing.

1076
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,800
- "Buhul Fencing?"
- Bull Fencing.

1077
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:23,110
- "Buhul?"
- What's "Buhul Fencing?"

1078
00:37:23,111 --> 00:37:24,570
- You mean, bull, an animal?
- Bull?

1079
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:26,480
- Bull, an animal.
- You said, "buhul."

1080
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:27,610
It sounded like "Buhul Fencing."

1081
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:29,080
Does he always speak with a lisp?

1082
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,280
You don't have to wear it.

1083
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,681
Sang Yi just asked, "Does he always speak with a lisp?"

1084
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:34,321
(Laughing)

1085
00:37:34,781 --> 00:37:36,820
- No one has ever said that.
- "Bull Fencing."

1086
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,350
"Bull Fencing."

1087
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:40,597
Cast members, you know what it is since you've done it before, right?

1088
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:43,130
One member holds the legs of the other one who's the bull...

1089
00:37:43,131 --> 00:37:45,160
and be in the position for a bullfight.

1090
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:46,500
It's the game we played before.

1091
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:48,160
The time limit is one minute.

1092
00:37:48,161 --> 00:37:49,830
The team that puts more camouflage cream...

1093
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:52,371
- on the opponent's face wins.
- I see.

1094
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:54,661
The team to win the 1st 2 rounds out of 3 rounds wins.

1095
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:57,171
The winning team will get 100 points.

1096
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:59,510
Please set it up now.

1097
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,980
How is this game related to fencing?

1098
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:02,981
(Laughing)

1099
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:03,981
It's not.

1100
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:06,251
Do you have strong back muscles?

1101
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,550
- I'm sure he does.
- I think I do.

1102
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,990
Can you lift up your torso...

1103
00:38:08,991 --> 00:38:11,150
while I'm holding your legs, like a b-boy dance move?

1104
00:38:11,151 --> 00:38:12,190
I think I can do it.

1105
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:14,461
(Their winning strategy is the flying bull strategy.)

1106
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:15,761
I'll try.

1107
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:17,190
- DinDin did it, and we won.
- Just once.

1108
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:18,307
- He attacked from above.
- Just once.

1109
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:20,160
That team is so strong. Se Yoon can lift up a person.

1110
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:21,837
- Let's try doing the same thing.
- Anyway...

1111
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:23,400
- How much do you weigh?
- I weigh 75kg.

1112
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,171
- You're quite heavy too.
- I weigh 75kg.

1113
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:28,600
How about you compete against the same age friend here?

1114
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:29,710
Why don't you two have a match?

1115
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:31,471
- You... Will you come out?
- Sang Yi and...

1116
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,610
- Let's do it.
- Great. That's good.

1117
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:36,980
Sang Yi and DinDin will have a match between same age friends.

1118
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,050
Yes, I'll try.

1119
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:40,481
We'll begin the first round.

1120
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:42,721
- The weight class...
- Look at his arm.

1121
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:43,851
Oh, my. Look at that.

1122
00:38:43,852 --> 00:38:44,920
- I'll pop those muscles.
- This?

1123
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,021
(Getting cheeky)

1124
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:47,960
(It seems quite intense for a warm-up.)

1125
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:49,930
- Punch him.
- Is that allowed?

1126
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:51,090
- Of course.
- I think he mistakes our show...

1127
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:52,461
for a different show.

1128
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:54,700
- Do you think we can do it?
- We can do it.

1129
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:56,970
DinDin, show them your toy hammer skills.

1130
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:58,870
Sang Yi, intimidate him so that he can't even look at you.

1131
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:00,100
The match between same-age friends.

1132
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:01,640
- You have one minute.
- Okay.

1133
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:02,811
- Ready.
- Ready.

1134
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:04,610
- Get set.
- Who will win?

1135
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:06,531
- Make sure to apply it to his face.
- Okay. Go.

1136
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,251
- Let's go.
- They're getting close.

1137
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:10,881
Let's go.

1138
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:12,881
(Toy Hammer boldly attacks first.)

1139
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,451
(Taken aback)

1140
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:18,021
- DinDin! Hey!
- Apply it to his face.

1141
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:21,591
(Too short)

1142
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:23,991
(What? Look at this brat.)

1143
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,531
(Grabbing his hand)

1144
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:30,501
(What?)

1145
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:35,441
(Extremely flustered)

1146
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,010
(He was stolen his weapon in an instant.)

1147
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:38,240
He took my glove.

1148
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:40,511
He lost his glove. His glove is over there.

1149
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:42,811
- Pick up your glove.
- Wait. Hang on.

1150
00:39:42,951 --> 00:39:45,951
He took my glove. Sang Yi took it away from me.

1151
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,891
DinDin, your glove is here.

1152
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:50,451
Pick up your glove.

1153
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:53,137
- That's good. Keep going.
- I lost my glove!

1154
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:54,890
- Time out!
- It's okay. Keep going.

1155
00:39:54,891 --> 00:39:56,431
- He took my glove!
- Are you okay?

1156
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,731
Why didn't you pause the game?

1157
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:00,001
You're doing well.

1158
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:02,042
- You saw him taking my glove.
- You're doing well.

1159
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:03,971
He's a jerk!

1160
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,100
- He took my glove!
- That was a good strategy.

1161
00:40:07,101 --> 00:40:09,310
- It's a strategy. It's your fault.
- It's our strategy.

1162
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:10,440
Would a soldier let anyone take his gun?

1163
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,581
Twenty-four seconds have passed.

1164
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:15,141
- DinDin, you've got this.
- Ready.

1165
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:18,581
- Not even half has passed.
- We'll resume the game. Ready.

1166
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:20,227
- Seon Ho seems a little tired.
- Look at them. Oh, my.

1167
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,921
(Moving forward quickly)

1168
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:23,721
- This is your chance.
- Oh, my.

1169
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,367
- Right now! Now is the time!
- Let's go!

1170
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:27,361
(DinDin attacks first boldly again.)

1171
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:29,430
(I got you.)

1172
00:40:29,431 --> 00:40:30,460
He caught DinDin.

1173
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,130
(He succeeded in capturing DinDin.)

1174
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:34,000
- That's good. This is your chance.
- Great!

1175
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,670
- You're doing well. Keep going.
- This is your chance.

1176
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:38,570
- Please spare DinDin.
- This is your chance. Go for it.

1177
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:40,471
- That's good.
- Please spare him.

1178
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,570
- Okay, timeout.
- Goodness.

1179
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:43,971
(The match is halted again.)

1180
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:49,380
Did he rub it on his face?

1181
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:51,381
(Is he a beggar?)

1182
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:53,051
(Laughing)

1183
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:54,781
(Laughing)

1184
00:40:55,551 --> 00:40:57,920
He's in tatters.

1185
00:40:57,921 --> 00:40:59,191
Is this right?

1186
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:01,691
What kind of game is this?

1187
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:04,061
This is pure violence.

1188
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,400
- This is nonsense.
- He wasn't trying to touch my face.

1189
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:07,461
He was hitting me.

1190
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:09,507
What many seconds are left on the clock?

1191
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:11,300
About ten seconds remain.

1192
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:13,370
Let me ask DinDin.

1193
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:14,970
Would you like to continue...

1194
00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:16,571
or stop here?

1195
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,071
Bring it on.

1196
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:19,981
Let's fight until the end.

1197
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:21,841
This is the last shot.

1198
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:23,851
All right, the fight will continue.

1199
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,561
- Get ready...
- You got ten seconds.

1200
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:27,981
- DinDin, you have to hurry.
- Bring it on.

1201
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:30,150
(Charging ahead with a vengeful spirit)

1202
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:31,151
Why do you keep...

1203
00:41:31,152 --> 00:41:32,220
(A reckless attack)

1204
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:33,221
What's going on?

1205
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:34,221
(The two get fired up at the last moment.)

1206
00:41:34,222 --> 00:41:35,290
Come on.

1207
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:36,291
- What's going on?
- Keep going.

1208
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,861
- No.
- Oh, my.

1209
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:39,161
Two, one.

1210
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,330
Stop. Time is up.

1211
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:43,631
(That's enough, you punks.)

1212
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:46,271
(Panting)

1213
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,241
He also got a lot on his face.

1214
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:51,570
- You put a lot on him.
- Gosh.

1215
00:41:51,571 --> 00:41:52,740
- You put a lot on him.
- They were quick.

1216
00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:54,021
I haven't looked at my face yet.

1217
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:56,461
- Both of you look similar.
- You look similar.

1218
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,350
Stand next to each other.

1219
00:41:58,351 --> 00:42:00,881
Could you look over here while standing?

1220
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,950
DinDin, you look like a character from "Boss..."

1221
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:04,890
- or "General's Son."
- "Boss?"

1222
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:06,420
Sang Yi looks like a member of the Special Forces.

1223
00:42:06,421 --> 00:42:07,460
(On the other hand, Sang Yi looks like a Special Forces member.)

1224
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:10,231
- What makes you say that?
- What?

1225
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:11,291
How do I look?

1226
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:12,900
You look like a gangster.

1227
00:42:12,901 --> 00:42:15,401
- "Gangster?"
- In the first round,

1228
00:42:15,971 --> 00:42:17,171
Sang Yi is the winner.

1229
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:21,100
- Don't look at yourself.
- Will you?

1230
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:22,381
(He checks his face right away.)

1231
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,341
Hey, you!

1232
00:42:24,941 --> 00:42:25,941
What...

1233
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:27,641
What have you done?

1234
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,910
He smudged poop on my face.

1235
00:42:29,911 --> 00:42:31,127
(How did he make my face look like this?)

1236
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:34,620
It's nice to see sportsmanship between two players.

1237
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:36,350
(Taking a selfie to make peace)

1238
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:37,490
It got all over their faces.

1239
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:39,620
(The boss and a Special Forces member)

1240
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:41,290
I'm a little disappointed, but we played well.

1241
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,660
- You played well.
- We played well.

1242
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:44,190
From your team, who will play next?

1243
00:42:44,191 --> 00:42:47,330
Our next player is Kim Jong Min.

1244
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,737
(Jong Min from Team Sang Yi participates.)

1245
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:50,977
How many years has it been since you met on 2 Days 1 Night?

1246
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,341
- It's been 9 years.
- It's their fight after 9 years.

1247
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,600
Jong Min, this is what made you angry.

1248
00:42:55,601 --> 00:42:57,740
- You didn't want to go on the ride, - Not at all.

1249
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,611
But Bo Gum asked you to do it.

1250
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:01,940
You agreed to do it with a smile, but you had a hard time.

1251
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:03,051
It was very difficult.

1252
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:06,121
(This is so much fun.)

1253
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:10,320
(He suffered a lot thanks to Bo Gum.)

1254
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,320
(Park Bo Gum!)

1255
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:13,921
Now is the time. Please say a few words.

1256
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:15,761
Do you know how hard it was for me?

1257
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:18,291
- That's it?
- What was that?

1258
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:19,500
What's going on between you two?

1259
00:43:19,501 --> 00:43:21,000
- He wasn't aware of it back then.
- Really?

1260
00:43:21,001 --> 00:43:22,431
You could say, "Of course."

1261
00:43:22,931 --> 00:43:25,430
Jong Min, tell Bo Gum...

1262
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:26,570
what to expect.

1263
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,200
Explain what will happen to him.

1264
00:43:28,201 --> 00:43:31,041
- First, I'll slap your right cheek.
- His right cheek.

1265
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:33,140
Then I'll slap your other cheek.

1266
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:34,141
- On the left.
- Once on each side.

1267
00:43:34,142 --> 00:43:35,780
Slap on the right and left. An uppercut.

1268
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:39,581
Is an uppercut allowed? He's the national something.

1269
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,050
National what?

1270
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,520
Can I use this hand only?

1271
00:43:42,521 --> 00:43:44,120
You have cream only on that hand.

1272
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,421
If you want, you can hit him with your left hand.

1273
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:48,341
You can hit him when he's not looking.

1274
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:49,841
Can I smudge it on my other hand?

1275
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,290
- Okay.
- Okay.

1276
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:53,530
- Okay.
- That's a tactic.

1277
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:55,207
- Here you go.
- Put gloves on both hands.

1278
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:57,191
- Put them on both hands.
- Gloves on both hands.

1279
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:01,070
(Both of them are fired up for the fight.)

1280
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,711
- Will you be okay?
- I'll try.

1281
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:04,841
- Shout, "Flying now."
- Okay.

1282
00:44:05,371 --> 00:44:06,380
Let's shine this time.

1283
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:08,280
- Jong Min explained beforehand...
- You can do it.

1284
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:10,410
How he will make his attack.

1285
00:44:10,411 --> 00:44:11,780
What's your plan, Bo Gum?

1286
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:12,880
- Me?
- Yes.

1287
00:44:12,881 --> 00:44:14,150
I'll pat him and say, "You're so cute."

1288
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,250
(Patting with double gloves)

1289
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:17,650
- "Jong Min."
- "You're so adorable."

1290
00:44:17,651 --> 00:44:19,591
- Gosh, he's so sweet.
- I see.

1291
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:22,091
- He'll be gentle.
- "Congratulations on your wedding."

1292
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,530
Let's start the second round.

1293
00:44:25,531 --> 00:44:27,130
I'm scared of Sang Yi.

1294
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,131
I feel nervous.

1295
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:29,531
All right.

1296
00:44:29,671 --> 00:44:32,201
This is great. It feels stable.

1297
00:44:33,441 --> 00:44:34,641
Cross your legs.

1298
00:44:35,301 --> 00:44:36,371
That's it.

1299
00:44:36,771 --> 00:44:39,281
He's incredibly strong. It feels very tight.

1300
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:43,481
(Smiling)

1301
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:46,021
- Bo Gum has a nice body.
- He does.

1302
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:48,350
If we win this round,

1303
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:50,090
we'll be the final winner, right?

1304
00:44:50,091 --> 00:44:51,890
That's right. Let's get started.

1305
00:44:51,891 --> 00:44:53,520
(Will Jong Min end the game in this round?)

1306
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:55,320
- Goodness.
- Get ready,

1307
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:56,560
- set...
- Shout, "Flying now!"

1308
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:57,561
Please win.

1309
00:44:58,231 --> 00:44:59,601
Gosh, wait. Okay.

1310
00:45:01,301 --> 00:45:03,671
- I'm going to lift you.
- Goodness.

1311
00:45:04,031 --> 00:45:06,201
- Flying now!
- Flying now!

1312
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:09,311
Flying now!

1313
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:11,970
Flying now!

1314
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:13,491
(A one-sided attack with "flying now")

1315
00:45:13,581 --> 00:45:15,311
"Congratulations on your wedding."

1316
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:19,851
(Caressing while congratulating him)

1317
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,850
(Where is he?)

1318
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:23,721
(Rising quietly)

1319
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:26,060
We're going back.

1320
00:45:26,061 --> 00:45:28,691
Let's back out.

1321
00:45:29,261 --> 00:45:30,661
(Park Bo Gum, you'll pay for this.)

1322
00:45:30,831 --> 00:45:32,230
(He approaches him with a deadly intent.)

1323
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:34,131
Flying now!

1324
00:45:34,361 --> 00:45:35,461
I love you, Jong Min.

1325
00:45:36,231 --> 00:45:37,631
- Push him.
- I love you, Jong Min.

1326
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,870
I'm sorry, Jong Min.

1327
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:42,500
Back away. Flying now.

1328
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:44,671
- Try to do something. Try to fly.
- "Flying now."

1329
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:45,941
"Flying now."

1330
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:47,840
- Back away.
- Take a break.

1331
00:45:47,841 --> 00:45:48,841
Flying now!

1332
00:45:48,842 --> 00:45:49,850
(Whoosh)

1333
00:45:49,851 --> 00:45:50,910
Flying now!

1334
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:53,051
(Flying again with insane core strength)

1335
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:55,421
- Flying now.
- Flying...

1336
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:57,121
- Okay, back away.
- What?

1337
00:45:57,351 --> 00:45:59,051
- Oh, my.
- Look at him.

1338
00:45:59,121 --> 00:46:00,491
That's incredible.

1339
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,121
Look at him.

1340
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:06,500
(Amazed)

1341
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:08,431
- That's incredible.
- Let me put some on you.

1342
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:11,630
(Jong Min stretches out his hand desperately.)

1343
00:46:11,631 --> 00:46:13,311
- That's amazing.
- What's wrong with him?

1344
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:16,610
(This way...)

1345
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:18,541
(and that way)

1346
00:46:18,771 --> 00:46:21,111
- Please.
- Lift up. Flying now.

1347
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:22,650
Flying...

1348
00:46:22,651 --> 00:46:25,111
(As he's strong, he's flying for the 4th time.)

1349
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:27,250
(Struggling)

1350
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,580
- He's good.
- Five, four...

1351
00:46:28,581 --> 00:46:29,850
- Please.
- That's incredible.

1352
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:31,420
- Two, - Go forward.

1353
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,450
- one.
- Time's up.

1354
00:46:32,451 --> 00:46:33,591
It ends here.

1355
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:34,760
- Are you okay?
- How did you do it?

1356
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:36,491
Okay, that was great.

1357
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:37,830
Okay.

1358
00:46:37,831 --> 00:46:39,130
(Sobbing)

1359
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:41,300
That was devastating.

1360
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:42,437
(His team lost, but it's still funny.)

1361
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:43,871
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

1362
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:46,401
What just happened?

1363
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,540
(I want to be alone.)

1364
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:50,911
There's nothing else he can do.

1365
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,201
Jong Min, why are you crying?

1366
00:46:52,341 --> 00:46:54,580
Don't cry. There's no crying on variety shows.

1367
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:55,781
Bo Gum hit me.

1368
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:58,181
Don't wipe it on your clothes.

1369
00:46:58,551 --> 00:46:59,851
- Bo Gum hit me.
- It was...

1370
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:02,921
It was the most gruesome scene I've seen recently.

1371
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:05,190
- Do I look okay?
- Actually, you look nice.

1372
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:06,761
- Really?
- I did it nicely.

1373
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:09,331
- You look nice.
- Jong Min.

1374
00:47:09,491 --> 00:47:11,531
- Where have you been?
- What?

1375
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:13,660
Mom has been looking for you.

1376
00:47:13,661 --> 00:47:14,700
Who are you?

1377
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:15,901
I'm Cheol.

1378
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:18,200
Mom has been looking for you for three years.

1379
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:19,300
(At a loss for words)

1380
00:47:19,301 --> 00:47:20,741
- Jong Min.
- Hey.

1381
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,601
- This is my older brother.
- I...

1382
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,211
You finally found each other.

1383
00:47:26,341 --> 00:47:27,940
He soared suddenly.

1384
00:47:27,941 --> 00:47:30,050
- He practically flew.
- There was no way out.

1385
00:47:30,051 --> 00:47:31,411
When he soars, there's no way out.

1386
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:35,450
He curled up his body. I've never seen that before.

1387
00:47:35,451 --> 00:47:36,551
Me neither.

1388
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:41,021
(He showed a new technique with his core strength.)

1389
00:47:41,221 --> 00:47:43,090
- The second round.
- Is it necessary to do it?

1390
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:44,830
- Team Bo Gum wins.
- Okay.

1391
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:45,860
(Team Bo Gum wins Round 2.)

1392
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:47,861
I haven't seen such a clean game in a while.

1393
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:49,371
Everyone,

1394
00:47:49,531 --> 00:47:51,031
this is the best of three.

1395
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:52,740
- The last round.
- It's the last match.

1396
00:47:52,741 --> 00:47:53,940
Seon Ho is up.

1397
00:47:53,941 --> 00:47:55,317
(Seon Ho from Team Bo Gum participates.)

1398
00:47:55,341 --> 00:47:57,440
Did you hear the magic phrase when I played with Bo Gum?

1399
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,610
- "Flying now?"
- Yes, that's when you attack.

1400
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:01,611
How should I do it? Do I have to lift you?

1401
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:04,311
- It'll be hard to lift me.
- I'll try anyway.

1402
00:48:04,411 --> 00:48:06,480
- Should I do this?
- Seon Ho will be lifted for sure.

1403
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:07,521
Joon.

1404
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:09,890
- You're our last hope.
- I should have...

1405
00:48:09,891 --> 00:48:10,920
- You're our last hope.
- played last.

1406
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,351
- Use that.
- Okay.

1407
00:48:12,451 --> 00:48:14,891
There's a mercenary in the back. That's not allowed.

1408
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:16,330
- What do you mean?
- That's scary.

1409
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:18,060
- What?
- Sang Yi looks like a mercenary.

1410
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,960
- No, he's not a mercenary.
- Isn't he a professional soldier?

1411
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:21,230
- No.
- Is he in the Special Forces?

1412
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,071
The smudge looks quite good.

1413
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:25,001
I mean...

1414
00:48:25,231 --> 00:48:27,401
- Isn't he...
- He's Baron Ashura.

1415
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,870
"Baron Ashura?"

1416
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:30,841
(Slipping)

1417
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:32,570
- Are you okay?
- Be careful.

1418
00:48:32,571 --> 00:48:33,581
(This is embarrassing.)

1419
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:37,251
I was fencing. This is very slippery.

1420
00:48:37,551 --> 00:48:39,520
(Bo Gum, on the other hand)

1421
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:41,450
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1422
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,891
(He seems worried about Jong Min.)

1423
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:44,621
(I'm fine.)

1424
00:48:45,151 --> 00:48:46,361
Let's get started.

1425
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:48,861
The current score is 1 to 1, and this is the last round.

1426
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:51,791
It's Yoo Seon Ho versus Lee Joon. It's Lee Joon versus Yoo Seon Ho.

1427
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:53,660
(It's us who are going to eat.)

1428
00:48:53,661 --> 00:48:54,931
You can grab my back.

1429
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:57,071
Set...

1430
00:48:57,671 --> 00:48:58,671
(The game starts.)

1431
00:48:58,672 --> 00:48:59,770
You can do it.

1432
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,100
- There's a psychological fight.
- You don't have time.

1433
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:02,170
- Go.
- Flying now.

1434
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:03,241
Here they come.

1435
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:06,710
- Flying now.
- Here they come.

1436
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:10,451
(They soar up as soon as they start.)

1437
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,621
(Thrilling)

1438
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,021
(Surprised)

1439
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:18,521
- It's like a cavalry battle.
- My goodness.

1440
00:49:22,761 --> 00:49:24,661
(Seon Ho wobbles.)

1441
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:27,701
(Seon Ho, you lost your balance.)

1442
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:29,231
It's like a cavalry battle.

1443
00:49:30,031 --> 00:49:31,771
- Flying now.
- He got him.

1444
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:32,940
All right.

1445
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:35,340
(Gripping his arm to stop him from running away)

1446
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:36,470
- Flying now.
- He got him.

1447
00:49:36,471 --> 00:49:37,510
(Sang Yi controls the crazy bull.)

1448
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:40,340
- Joon, you're doing well.
- Gosh, Joon.

1449
00:49:40,341 --> 00:49:43,151
(Explosive grip)

1450
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:47,180
- It's Lee Sang Yi's strength.
- This is a cavalry battle.

1451
00:49:47,181 --> 00:49:49,491
- This is Sang Yi's power.
- You're doing well.

1452
00:49:49,591 --> 00:49:51,391
- This is a cavalry battle.
- This is insane.

1453
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:52,991
This is Sang Yi's power.

1454
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:55,620
Get up.

1455
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:56,630
(Powerful doppelganger)

1456
00:49:56,631 --> 00:49:58,161
He grabbed my hand.

1457
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:00,030
(Holding his hand tightly)

1458
00:50:00,031 --> 00:50:01,630
- Wait.
- What's going on?

1459
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,000
You have ten seconds.

1460
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,300
(Stop it.)

1461
00:50:05,301 --> 00:50:06,770
This is Lee Sang Yi's power.

1462
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:07,940
(Poor Seon Ho)

1463
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:09,971
We need to separate them by force.

1464
00:50:10,371 --> 00:50:12,311
- Let me go.
- Go.

1465
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:13,981
(The game is over.)

1466
00:50:15,441 --> 00:50:16,580
Joon.

1467
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:17,981
(The doppelganger brought victory.)

1468
00:50:20,581 --> 00:50:22,197
- The weight class difference.
- What happened to you?

1469
00:50:22,221 --> 00:50:24,151
It's because of their difference in weight.

1470
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,121
A complete difference in weight class.

1471
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:28,421
It's a complete victory.

1472
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:29,931
A complete victory.

1473
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:31,260
Could you quiet down?

1474
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,490
- It's a lost fight.
- A lost fight.

1475
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:33,731
Don't laugh.

1476
00:50:34,501 --> 00:50:35,631
Could everyone quiet down?

1477
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:37,771
- Hey.
- That's our little brother.

1478
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,471
- Where have you been?
- Our youngest.

1479
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:41,640
- Here he is.
- Our youngest.

1480
00:50:41,641 --> 00:50:43,911
- Jong Min.
- We're together again.

1481
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,010
I missed you.

1482
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:47,280
You finally became complete.

1483
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:48,311
(Laughing)

1484
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:50,211
(Giggling)

1485
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,280
- I have nothing on my face.
- No, your face is completely clean.

1486
00:50:54,281 --> 00:50:55,380
Goodness.

1487
00:50:55,381 --> 00:50:56,790
You're really strong.

1488
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:57,791
His waist...

1489
00:50:57,792 --> 00:51:00,073
- How could they go up so high?
- They went up very high.

1490
00:51:00,221 --> 00:51:01,860
It's all because Sang Yi is strong.

1491
00:51:01,861 --> 00:51:03,330
- You're very strong.
- He's a beast.

1492
00:51:03,331 --> 00:51:04,661
The clothes helped me.

1493
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:06,190
This is Lee Sang Yi's strength.

1494
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:08,301
It was like a cavalry battle.

1495
00:51:08,461 --> 00:51:10,930
- Two rounds of bullfight fencing.
- Okay.

1496
00:51:10,931 --> 00:51:12,501
Team Sang Yi wins.

1497
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:13,900
What? What do you mean?

1498
00:51:13,901 --> 00:51:15,340
- We won the first round.
- Well done.

1499
00:51:15,341 --> 00:51:16,610
- Did you lose?
- It was great.

1500
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:17,817
- You lost.
- We won two rounds.

1501
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,171
The score is 2 to 1.

1502
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:22,580
Currently, Team Sang Yi won 200 points.

1503
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:24,781
Team Bo Gum has zero points.

1504
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:27,181
The last game to determine who wins.

1505
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,150
It's called flip wrestling.

1506
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,090
- "Flip wrestling?"
- Wrestling?

1507
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:33,760
- In "Good Boy," Heo Sung Tae...
- Right.

1508
00:51:33,761 --> 00:51:35,561
Plays a wrestler.

1509
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:37,461
So we prepared this game.

1510
00:51:37,691 --> 00:51:41,160
- Does everyone know "par terre?"
- Yes.

1511
00:51:41,161 --> 00:51:44,431
The offensive team will flip the opponent in defense.

1512
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:46,470
- Do you remember the emojis?
- Yes.

1513
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:47,940
It will be on his body.

1514
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:49,170
- At the bottom?
- The emoji on the body...

1515
00:51:49,171 --> 00:51:50,270
Se Yoon is way too strong.

1516
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:51,510
- After looking at the emoji, - We can't defeat Se Yoon.

1517
00:51:51,511 --> 00:51:54,641
Shout out the correct answer to win.

1518
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,951
Three from each team will play.

1519
00:51:58,011 --> 00:52:00,651
The first team to finish will win.

1520
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,150
Since it's the last game,

1521
00:52:03,151 --> 00:52:04,250
the winning team...

1522
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:05,620
(No way)

1523
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:07,321
- will gain 300 points.
- No way.

1524
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,590
- But up to now...
- It can't be any worse.

1525
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:11,731
- This will be a close game.
- What's this?

1526
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,360
I really wanted the meal with seven side dishes.

1527
00:52:13,361 --> 00:52:14,500
(Sang Yi is hungry.)

1528
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:16,331
- The 1st team to win 2 rounds wins.
- Right.

1529
00:52:16,531 --> 00:52:18,607
If we're given the highest points in the last round,

1530
00:52:18,631 --> 00:52:20,071
what's the point of playing?

1531
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:23,010
- If they win, it'll be game over.
- What's this?

1532
00:52:23,011 --> 00:52:24,710
- This is...
- I really did my best.

1533
00:52:24,711 --> 00:52:27,110
- It's to end on a good note.
- Is that why?

1534
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:28,441
(Can't we do this instead?)

1535
00:52:29,081 --> 00:52:30,981
They won't be able to flip me over.

1536
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,951
In my opinion, this is the most important.

1537
00:52:33,421 --> 00:52:34,650
They'll never be able to flip you.

1538
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,820
- They'll definitely flip me.
- Right.

1539
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:38,720
(Team Sang Yi on offense, Team Bo Gum on defense)

1540
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:39,721
All right.

1541
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:42,921
This team has four emojis.

1542
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:44,890
The genre is drama.

1543
00:52:44,891 --> 00:52:46,901
You said 4, but why are there 3 of them?

1544
00:52:47,561 --> 00:52:49,461
One of them has two emojis.

1545
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:51,571
It's better to flip Se Yoon first.

1546
00:52:51,831 --> 00:52:53,870
Let's flip Se Yoon first.

1547
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,070
It's better to flip him together.

1548
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,610
It's impossible to flip him.

1549
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:58,671
If it doesn't work, we'll flip the rest of them.

1550
00:52:58,771 --> 00:52:59,980
- DinDin.
- Yes?

1551
00:52:59,981 --> 00:53:01,511
Why don't you stay close to Se Yoon?

1552
00:53:01,741 --> 00:53:02,810
All right.

1553
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:04,050
(Would that be safer?)

1554
00:53:04,051 --> 00:53:05,780
They might be able to flip Se Yoon first.

1555
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:06,820
If they flip you, so be it.

1556
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:08,151
Should I stay close like this?

1557
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:11,721
- Lock arms with me.
- Get ready.

1558
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:12,791
Start with Se Yoon.

1559
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:13,791
(The game starts.)

1560
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:16,361
It's not working.

1561
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:18,690
(Se Yoon doesn't budge at all.)

1562
00:53:18,691 --> 00:53:19,931
They can't do it.

1563
00:53:21,801 --> 00:53:24,501
- This side.
- Look over here.

1564
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:26,171
One, two.

1565
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,270
(The 3 of them join forces to lift DinDin.)

1566
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:31,870
- Gosh.
- Separate them.

1567
00:53:31,871 --> 00:53:34,381
(Sang Yi's camera)

1568
00:53:35,141 --> 00:53:36,141
(He gives in.)

1569
00:53:36,142 --> 00:53:37,381
I can't see it.

1570
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:39,571
- I don't think he has it.
- Let's see.

1571
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:41,120
Where is it?

1572
00:53:41,121 --> 00:53:42,451
(Go board)

1573
00:53:42,781 --> 00:53:43,920
- It's a Go board.
- A Go board.

1574
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:45,620
- "The Match."
- Incorrect.

1575
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:47,120
- "The Match."
- It's not a movie.

1576
00:53:47,121 --> 00:53:48,891
- It's not a movie?
- "Sandglass."

1577
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:50,260
- "Sandglass."
- Incorrect.

1578
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:51,490
The one with that actor...

1579
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:56,001
(I can't flip Bo Gum.)

1580
00:53:56,471 --> 00:53:58,871
Bo Gum, you're doing well.

1581
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:01,200
- No.
- One, two, three.

1582
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:03,211
- It's not working.
- One, two, three.

1583
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:05,110
- I can see it.
- No.

1584
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:06,680
- What is it? One...
- No.

1585
00:54:06,681 --> 00:54:09,381
One, two, three. I can see it.

1586
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:10,511
(Don't disturb us.)

1587
00:54:10,512 --> 00:54:12,380
- I can see it.
- What is it?

1588
00:54:12,381 --> 00:54:14,620
- One, two, three.
- Flip him. I can see it.

1589
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:15,751
Good job, Bo Gum.

1590
00:54:16,181 --> 00:54:17,920
- Bo Gum.
- It's a car.

1591
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,650
- One.
- Flip him.

1592
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:20,890
(While everyone is attacking Bo Gum)

1593
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,361
- Did you grab him?
- Move him.

1594
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:25,630
(Looking blankly)

1595
00:54:25,631 --> 00:54:26,631
One.

1596
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:28,661
I think it's a car.

1597
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:30,730
What was the last emoji?

1598
00:54:30,731 --> 00:54:31,971
Where is it?

1599
00:54:32,531 --> 00:54:34,371
One, two, three.

1600
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:36,770
- We lifted him.
- We got it.

1601
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:38,511
Let's take a look. What is it?

1602
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:39,980
There it is.

1603
00:54:39,981 --> 00:54:42,010
(Defending himself until the end)

1604
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:43,040
What is it?

1605
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:44,650
Do you see it?

1606
00:54:44,651 --> 00:54:45,651
(They can almost see it.)

1607
00:54:45,652 --> 00:54:47,350
- Cloudy weather.
- Weather?

1608
00:54:47,351 --> 00:54:48,880
- Weather?
- Weather and a Go board.

1609
00:54:48,881 --> 00:54:50,451
(The sun behind a cloud)

1610
00:54:50,651 --> 00:54:52,590
Cloudy weather? What does that mean?

1611
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:54,290
- Weather and Go.
- Is it a drama?

1612
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,291
(Is there such a drama?)

1613
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,420
Let's think. It's a drama.

1614
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:58,431
(Try to guess the answer with them.)

1615
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:01,600
(A drama with Go and the weather?)

1616
00:55:01,601 --> 00:55:02,800
What could be the answer?

1617
00:55:02,801 --> 00:55:04,801
(The ultimate opponent, Moon Se Yoon)

1618
00:55:05,331 --> 00:55:07,441
(DinDin tries to stop him from flipping.)

1619
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:09,741
- Stop harassing me.
- Help me.

1620
00:55:10,111 --> 00:55:11,941
(Grabbing him tightly so he can't move)

1621
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:14,341
(Laughing)

1622
00:55:14,981 --> 00:55:16,240
(Joon is struggling alone.)

1623
00:55:16,241 --> 00:55:17,351
Hey!

1624
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:20,450
- It's a drama.
- Bo Gum, help me.

1625
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:22,380
It's related to the weather.

1626
00:55:22,381 --> 00:55:23,990
- A drama related to weather.
- A drama with the weather?

1627
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:25,251
- Go and weather.
- The wind?

1628
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:27,821
- The windy weather...
- That's good.

1629
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:31,231
The hint that Se Yoon has is critical.

1630
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,060
(What are the image hints on Se Yoon's stomach?)

1631
00:55:33,061 --> 00:55:35,360
(Doctor, hair iron)

1632
00:55:35,361 --> 00:55:37,801
(Answer: "The Glory")

1633
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,170
Let's go.

1634
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:40,541
- Move out of the way.
- No.

1635
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:42,770
- Se Yoon is...
- No, don't do it.

1636
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:44,910
- To the right.
- One, two, three.

1637
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:46,640
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1638
00:55:46,641 --> 00:55:48,781
One, two, three.

1639
00:55:48,981 --> 00:55:50,350
To the right. One, two, three.

1640
00:55:50,351 --> 00:55:52,550
- Hang in there, Se Yoon.
- Resist them.

1641
00:55:52,551 --> 00:55:53,620
(Hang in there, Se Yoon.)

1642
00:55:53,621 --> 00:55:54,750
Se Yoon is...

1643
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,380
This is cheating.

1644
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:58,390
(Sang Yi's camera)

1645
00:55:58,391 --> 00:55:59,690
- It's a doctor.
- A doctor.

1646
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:01,720
- It's a doctor.
- A doctor.

1647
00:56:01,721 --> 00:56:03,260
- "The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call."
- "The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call."

1648
00:56:03,261 --> 00:56:04,590
- Incorrect.
- You saw them all.

1649
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:06,230
You can't guess the answer when you saw 3 out of 4?

1650
00:56:06,231 --> 00:56:07,660
There's that one.

1651
00:56:07,661 --> 00:56:09,700
The character named Yeon Jung or Yeon Jun. Who was it?

1652
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:11,670
- "The Glory."
- "The Glory."

1653
00:56:11,671 --> 00:56:13,770
- "The Glory."
- Okay, that was good.

1654
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:14,800
- "The Glory?"
- Good job.

1655
00:56:14,801 --> 00:56:17,611
The game Go from "The Glory?" That's hard to decipher.

1656
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,370
- What was the last one?
- A hair iron.

1657
00:56:19,371 --> 00:56:20,880
- A hair iron?
- How did you see the doctor?

1658
00:56:20,881 --> 00:56:22,641
Se Yoon has an image of a hair iron.

1659
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:24,110
The hair iron was the hardest.

1660
00:56:24,111 --> 00:56:25,510
- You blocked them well.
- You did.

1661
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,121
- Good job.
- This is a little...

1662
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,620
difficult.

1663
00:56:28,621 --> 00:56:31,491
Sang Yi, I'll let you pick the question.

1664
00:56:32,991 --> 00:56:34,190
My goodness.

1665
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:36,067
(Team Sang Yi gets a benefit of picking the question.)

1666
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:37,291
My goodness.

1667
00:56:38,031 --> 00:56:39,561
This could be difficult.

1668
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:42,031
(Sensitive about being watched)

1669
00:56:42,301 --> 00:56:43,701
Whom will you flip first?

1670
00:56:44,331 --> 00:56:45,471
Just...

1671
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:47,571
grab anyone you find.

1672
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:50,541
- How about a drama?
- This is a foreign movie.

1673
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:53,440
Can we exclude the clock and show only four?

1674
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:55,840
- Can we give them only 4 emojis?
- You need to give them 5 emojis.

1675
00:56:55,841 --> 00:56:58,351
It's because the time goes backward in the movie.

1676
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,221
The time goes backward.

1677
00:57:00,281 --> 00:57:03,621
(We will reveal Team Sang Yi's question.)

1678
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:05,751
(The clock moving in reverse)

1679
00:57:06,391 --> 00:57:09,161
(A person who is getting younger?)

1680
00:57:09,361 --> 00:57:11,431
(Answer: "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button")

1681
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,761
- Gosh.
- All right.

1682
00:57:14,161 --> 00:57:15,301
Also...

1683
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:17,930
- All right, Team Bo Gum.
- That's right.

1684
00:57:17,931 --> 00:57:21,500
- Yes?
- This one is a movie.

1685
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:24,040
There are five emojis.

1686
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,210
(Genre: Movie, 5 emoji hints)

1687
00:57:25,211 --> 00:57:26,340
Let's get started.

1688
00:57:26,341 --> 00:57:29,141
All right. Let's go!

1689
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:30,681
Join us after 20 seconds.

1690
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:32,010
- Okay.
- Get ready.

1691
00:57:32,011 --> 00:57:33,450
You two should start.

1692
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:34,720
- Set.
- You got it?

1693
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:36,220
Let's do it together.

1694
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:38,451
- Start.
- We'll finish them off, Se Yoon.

1695
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:40,590
- This way.
- This way.

1696
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:42,020
One, two, three.

1697
00:57:42,021 --> 00:57:44,331
- They locked themselves.
- Over here.

1698
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,261
I saw an image of an old man.

1699
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,421
Let's do it together.

1700
00:57:51,422 --> 00:57:53,792
- Start.
- We'll finish them off, Se Yoon.

1701
00:57:53,862 --> 00:57:55,891
- This way.
- This way.

1702
00:57:55,892 --> 00:57:57,291
One, two, three.

1703
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:59,502
- They locked themselves.
- Over here.

1704
00:58:01,972 --> 00:58:03,432
I saw an image of an old man.

1705
00:58:03,932 --> 00:58:05,941
"The Curious Case of Benjamin."

1706
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:08,171
(Answer: "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button")

1707
00:58:08,172 --> 00:58:09,272
It's an old man.

1708
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:11,142
It's an old man.

1709
00:58:12,342 --> 00:58:13,982
- It's an old man.
- Incorrect.

1710
00:58:15,042 --> 00:58:17,411
(The game continues because the answer isn't accurate.)

1711
00:58:17,412 --> 00:58:19,682
(How did he find out?)

1712
00:58:19,782 --> 00:58:21,851
- Stop it. Don't touch me.
- Does he have one emoji?

1713
00:58:21,852 --> 00:58:23,251
- Don't touch me.
- I saw it on his left.

1714
00:58:23,252 --> 00:58:24,352
"Exhuma."

1715
00:58:24,492 --> 00:58:25,562
(Lifting)

1716
00:58:26,522 --> 00:58:28,892
- Let's do it together in 3, 2, 1.
- Incorrect.

1717
00:58:30,732 --> 00:58:32,662
(Resist)

1718
00:58:33,662 --> 00:58:36,202
Se Yoon, we need you.

1719
00:58:37,302 --> 00:58:39,672
(Is it my time to take the lead?)

1720
00:58:40,042 --> 00:58:41,741
- Se Yoon, we need you.
- It's a baby.

1721
00:58:41,742 --> 00:58:43,911
- A baby and...
- We got two.

1722
00:58:43,912 --> 00:58:45,941
- A baby and an old man.
- Se Yoon.

1723
00:58:45,942 --> 00:58:47,141
We need you here.

1724
00:58:47,142 --> 00:58:49,012
Isn't it "The Curious Case of Benjamin?"

1725
00:58:49,512 --> 00:58:51,312
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."

1726
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:53,921
- Correct.
- It's correct.

1727
00:58:53,922 --> 00:58:54,981
- We got the answer.
- What?

1728
00:58:54,982 --> 00:58:56,822
- Se Yoon, we got the answer.
- We got it.

1729
00:58:57,292 --> 00:58:58,652
- Are you okay?
- What's going on?

1730
00:58:59,092 --> 00:59:00,591
- Is it over?
- What?

1731
00:59:00,592 --> 00:59:01,931
I got it right.

1732
00:59:01,932 --> 00:59:03,131
- How did you know?
- What's going on here?

1733
00:59:03,132 --> 00:59:05,031
- He said that it was an old man.
- I saw an image...

1734
00:59:05,032 --> 00:59:06,831
of an old man on Joon.

1735
00:59:06,832 --> 00:59:08,531
- What just happened?
- When I said, "It's an old man,"

1736
00:59:08,532 --> 00:59:10,472
he said, "The Curious Case of Benjamin."

1737
00:59:10,532 --> 00:59:12,572
- What on earth?
- I enjoyed this movie.

1738
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:15,611
How did you guess it based on the old man?

1739
00:59:15,612 --> 00:59:17,141
- The old man.
- You heard the answer, right?

1740
00:59:17,142 --> 00:59:18,941
- No, I swear to you.
- Right.

1741
00:59:18,942 --> 00:59:20,182
What on earth?

1742
00:59:20,242 --> 00:59:21,512
What kind of game is this?

1743
00:59:23,052 --> 00:59:25,211
Wait, we gained 300 points.

1744
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:27,751
(Yes, 300 points!)

1745
00:59:27,752 --> 00:59:30,922
- A meal with 7 side dishes.
- A meal with 7 side dishes.

1746
00:59:31,122 --> 00:59:32,621
I feel completely drained.

1747
00:59:32,622 --> 00:59:33,792
I got it on my first try.

1748
00:59:33,892 --> 00:59:36,461
- That's amazing.
- What?

1749
00:59:36,462 --> 00:59:37,868
Why don't we share the meal with seven side dishes?

1750
00:59:37,892 --> 00:59:40,062
Isn't there a morning mission?

1751
00:59:40,332 --> 00:59:41,401
He doesn't disappoint.

1752
00:59:41,402 --> 00:59:42,571
After a meal...

1753
00:59:42,572 --> 00:59:44,871
- Get up. He knelt right away.
- Hey.

1754
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,901
He came all the way here. We'll feel bad if he doesn't eat.

1755
00:59:46,902 --> 00:59:48,401
That's right. Let's be lenient for Sang Yi.

1756
00:59:48,402 --> 00:59:50,742
In that case, since everyone worked hard...

1757
00:59:50,912 --> 00:59:52,512
The Yeosu meal with seven side dishes...

1758
00:59:53,082 --> 00:59:54,811
- will be enjoyed by everyone.
- That sounds good.

1759
00:59:54,812 --> 00:59:55,911
(True happiness)

1760
00:59:55,912 --> 00:59:57,681
- Let's stand alternately...
- Okay.

1761
00:59:57,682 --> 00:59:59,681
- to show harmony.
- Sang Yi needed to eat.

1762
00:59:59,682 --> 01:00:01,651
- That's right.
- We're all about harmony.

1763
01:00:01,652 --> 01:00:03,092
(We're the good boys who get along.)

1764
01:00:04,022 --> 01:00:09,032
(Hand in hand, let's go over the wall)

1765
01:00:10,992 --> 01:00:15,102
(Singing passionately)

1766
01:00:15,602 --> 01:00:17,701
Let's go and eat.

1767
01:00:17,702 --> 01:00:19,142
- Okay.
- All right.

1768
01:00:19,702 --> 01:00:23,042
(They set off together for a meal.)

1769
01:00:23,142 --> 01:00:25,541
- My goodness.
- Gosh, what's this?

1770
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:27,581
- Hey, 2 Days 1 Night is the best.
- It's the best meal we've had.

1771
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,011
It's the best meal we've had.

1772
01:00:29,012 --> 01:00:30,552
Bo Gum, it's the best meal we've had.

1773
01:00:30,652 --> 01:00:32,082
- My goodness.
- It looks so tasty.

1774
01:00:32,252 --> 01:00:35,082
They prepared a nice meal for the precious guests.

1775
01:00:35,152 --> 01:00:38,252
Hold on. Did you prepare kimchi jeon because Bo Gum wanted it?

1776
01:00:39,662 --> 01:00:41,822
(What's Foodie Bo Gum's favorite food?)

1777
01:00:42,262 --> 01:00:44,492
(I eat everything well!)

1778
01:00:45,262 --> 01:00:47,632
(What do you want to eat on a rainy day?)

1779
01:00:48,162 --> 01:00:50,631
(Kimchi jeon is the best for a rainy day.)

1780
01:00:50,632 --> 01:00:52,112
(You should hurry up and prepare it.)

1781
01:00:53,002 --> 01:00:55,302
(Solemn)

1782
01:00:55,842 --> 01:00:57,811
Did you prepare kimchi jeon because Bo Gum wanted it?

1783
01:00:57,812 --> 01:00:59,111
Sang Yi, go inside.

1784
01:00:59,112 --> 01:01:00,881
- Really?
- I'm touched.

1785
01:01:00,882 --> 01:01:03,912
Kimchi jeon was prepared in a hurry...

1786
01:01:04,052 --> 01:01:05,552
for Bo Gum.

1787
01:01:06,182 --> 01:01:08,752
- May I take photos?
- Go ahead and take photos.

1788
01:01:09,052 --> 01:01:10,352
- Go ahead.
- Gosh, this is...

1789
01:01:10,852 --> 01:01:12,992
So much care went into this meal.

1790
01:01:13,322 --> 01:01:14,391
(Making a V sign)

1791
01:01:14,392 --> 01:01:15,492
Gosh, this is...

1792
01:01:16,062 --> 01:01:17,431
(A legendary meal on 2 Days 1 Night)

1793
01:01:17,432 --> 01:01:18,762
(We're happy to eat together.)

1794
01:01:18,862 --> 01:01:20,831
Thank you, chef.

1795
01:01:20,832 --> 01:01:21,861
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1796
01:01:21,862 --> 01:01:23,871
Our chef is the best. The food is so tasty.

1797
01:01:23,872 --> 01:01:25,232
Today's dinner menu...

1798
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:27,301
(The taste of Yeosu is here.)

1799
01:01:27,302 --> 01:01:28,742
Soy sauce marinated crab,

1800
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:30,641
- gray mullet sashimi, - Yes.

1801
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:32,581
Stone crab doenjang stew,

1802
01:01:32,582 --> 01:01:33,612
braised silver pomfret,

1803
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:35,412
Namdo tteokgalbi,

1804
01:01:35,682 --> 01:01:36,911
mustard greens jeon,

1805
01:01:36,912 --> 01:01:38,751
and Dolsan mustard greens kimchi.

1806
01:01:38,752 --> 01:01:41,681
These dishes make up the Meal of Yeosu's Delicacies.

1807
01:01:41,682 --> 01:01:43,351
This is insane. We'll want to eat all the rice.

1808
01:01:43,352 --> 01:01:44,492
Someone call the police!

1809
01:01:45,222 --> 01:01:47,621
- Are you satisfied?
- We'll want to eat so much rice.

1810
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:49,662
- I'm so excited.
- Please enjoy the meal together.

1811
01:01:49,692 --> 01:01:50,962
(Thank you for the food.)

1812
01:01:50,992 --> 01:01:52,231
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you for the food.

1813
01:01:52,232 --> 01:01:53,401
Thank you for the food.

1814
01:01:53,402 --> 01:01:55,162
- What should I eat first?
- This is insane.

1815
01:01:56,072 --> 01:01:58,702
(Which dish does Bo Gum pick up first?)

1816
01:01:59,142 --> 01:02:01,071
(It's the kimchi jeon the chef made for Bo Gum.)

1817
01:02:01,072 --> 01:02:02,741
I'm jealous of myself for this meal.

1818
01:02:02,742 --> 01:02:03,872
Thank you for the food.

1819
01:02:03,942 --> 01:02:06,541
Bo Gum is eating the kimchi jeon.

1820
01:02:06,542 --> 01:02:07,862
Bo Gum is eating the kimchi jeon.

1821
01:02:08,112 --> 01:02:10,452
(He puts the entire thing in his mouth.)

1822
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:12,352
Enjoy the food.

1823
01:02:13,852 --> 01:02:14,852
It's tasty.

1824
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:16,591
It's so nice to eat happily together.

1825
01:02:16,592 --> 01:02:17,921
Gosh, this is insane.

1826
01:02:17,922 --> 01:02:20,203
(Sang Yi's first choice is the soy sauce marinated crab.)

1827
01:02:20,692 --> 01:02:22,431
(It's 1 of 10 delicacies in Yeosu...)

1828
01:02:22,432 --> 01:02:24,762
(that goes well with rice.)

1829
01:02:24,832 --> 01:02:26,031
- How is it?
- Gloves.

1830
01:02:26,032 --> 01:02:27,131
- How is it?
- Gloves.

1831
01:02:27,132 --> 01:02:28,231
The soy sauce marinated crab is insane.

1832
01:02:28,232 --> 01:02:29,302
Is it insane?

1833
01:02:29,502 --> 01:02:30,802
- It's insane.
- Really?

1834
01:02:30,902 --> 01:02:33,741
It's from a very famous restaurant in Yeosu.

1835
01:02:33,742 --> 01:02:35,201
- A very famous restaurant in Yeosu?
- Yes.

1836
01:02:35,202 --> 01:02:36,641
- Not pretty famous. Very famous.
- Very famous.

1837
01:02:36,642 --> 01:02:38,171
It's from a very famous restaurant.

1838
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:39,241
Soy sauce marinated crab?

1839
01:02:39,242 --> 01:02:41,281
(Open your mouth for the dish that's perfect with rice.)

1840
01:02:41,282 --> 01:02:42,612
This is nice.

1841
01:02:42,752 --> 01:02:44,282
(He's seriously moved.)

1842
01:02:45,282 --> 01:02:47,482
You should show it to the camera.

1843
01:02:48,622 --> 01:02:49,951
(Full of crab meat)

1844
01:02:49,952 --> 01:02:51,992
- You're really good at it.
- Oh, my.

1845
01:02:54,192 --> 01:02:56,432
(They bite into it at the same time.)

1846
01:02:57,892 --> 01:03:00,962
What they see on the screen. It's much better than that.

1847
01:03:01,162 --> 01:03:02,801
- The taste, right?
- This is incredible.

1848
01:03:02,802 --> 01:03:04,432
- They must imagine it.
- Much better?

1849
01:03:04,502 --> 01:03:06,972
It seems like you put more effort into the meal than usual.

1850
01:03:07,172 --> 01:03:08,372
It's tastier than usual.

1851
01:03:08,502 --> 01:03:10,011
It's partly because of the guests.

1852
01:03:10,012 --> 01:03:11,511
Also, Yeosu is...

1853
01:03:11,512 --> 01:03:12,882
a city that's famous...

1854
01:03:13,242 --> 01:03:14,841
- for tasty food.
- Delicacies.

1855
01:03:14,842 --> 01:03:16,811
It makes us proud.

1856
01:03:16,812 --> 01:03:18,452
- I know.
- We got to give a good meal...

1857
01:03:18,782 --> 01:03:19,822
to the guests.

1858
01:03:19,882 --> 01:03:21,681
- That's right. The guests are here.
- That's right.

1859
01:03:21,682 --> 01:03:22,728
(He grabs rice with his hand.)

1860
01:03:22,752 --> 01:03:24,122
It seriously makes us proud.

1861
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:27,621
(He furrows his brows since it's tasty.)

1862
01:03:27,622 --> 01:03:28,831
It's so tasty.

1863
01:03:28,832 --> 01:03:30,132
- Right?
- Thank you so much.

1864
01:03:31,232 --> 01:03:32,432
Thank you so much.

1865
01:03:32,502 --> 01:03:34,201
(There's no time to rest.)

1866
01:03:34,202 --> 01:03:36,372
- The braised silver pomfret...
- Okay.

1867
01:03:36,502 --> 01:03:38,132
Will be easy to eat...

1868
01:03:38,172 --> 01:03:39,872
because the fish is deboned.

1869
01:03:40,102 --> 01:03:41,442
- Really?
- Yes.

1870
01:03:42,342 --> 01:03:43,518
Is this the braised silver pomfret?

1871
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:45,271
You know about the braised silver pomfret, right?

1872
01:03:45,272 --> 01:03:48,011
The man who lived on an island all his life said...

1873
01:03:48,012 --> 01:03:49,692
that the braised silver pomfret was tasty.

1874
01:03:50,712 --> 01:03:52,012
What are you talking about?

1875
01:03:52,922 --> 01:03:54,251
(Indecipherable)

1876
01:03:54,252 --> 01:03:55,691
I omitted some information.

1877
01:03:55,692 --> 01:03:56,991
The man who lived on an island said...

1878
01:03:56,992 --> 01:03:58,291
that the braised silver pomfret was tasty?

1879
01:03:58,292 --> 01:03:59,322
(It's that tasty.)

1880
01:03:59,822 --> 01:04:01,992
(This table doesn't have the braised silver pomfret.)

1881
01:04:02,562 --> 01:04:03,661
(For them, Bo Gum scoops out some braised silver pomfret.)

1882
01:04:03,662 --> 01:04:05,022
We need to try the silver pomfret.

1883
01:04:05,232 --> 01:04:07,202
What about the grandpa on an island?

1884
01:04:07,332 --> 01:04:10,572
There was a man who lived on an island all his life.

1885
01:04:11,002 --> 01:04:12,002
Did he make the dish?

1886
01:04:14,002 --> 01:04:16,342
(He scoops out the sauce and radish as well.)

1887
01:04:18,142 --> 01:04:19,211
(Have some braised silver pomfret.)

1888
01:04:19,212 --> 01:04:21,082
Let's eat it together.

1889
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:25,952
- The silver pomfret is so tasty.
- I know.

1890
01:04:26,822 --> 01:04:27,822
My goodness.

1891
01:04:27,882 --> 01:04:29,798
It's incredible that the silver pomfret got filleted.

1892
01:04:29,822 --> 01:04:31,491
They filleted it and cooked with it.

1893
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,821
(Inhaling)

1894
01:04:32,822 --> 01:04:33,961
Bo Gum, is it incredible?

1895
01:04:33,962 --> 01:04:35,161
- My goodness.
- Is it really tasty?

1896
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,038
- There are no bones.
- It melts in the mouth, right?

1897
01:04:37,062 --> 01:04:38,432
(Chewing)

1898
01:04:38,932 --> 01:04:41,332
(Sang Yi takes a big bite.)

1899
01:04:41,662 --> 01:04:42,972
It's so tasty.

1900
01:04:43,402 --> 01:04:44,772
As I eat,

1901
01:04:45,102 --> 01:04:46,841
- I feel happy.
- It's tasty. It's so tasty.

1902
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:48,642
(Drinking from the bowl)

1903
01:04:49,312 --> 01:04:50,972
Gosh, it's so tasty.

1904
01:04:51,172 --> 01:04:52,581
It's nice to eat with everyone.

1905
01:04:52,582 --> 01:04:55,211
Viewers will imagine the taste from what they see...

1906
01:04:55,212 --> 01:04:56,881
on the screen.

1907
01:04:56,882 --> 01:04:58,751
It's much better than that.

1908
01:04:58,752 --> 01:04:59,851
- The taste, right?
- It's like me.

1909
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:01,152
It's unbelievable.

1910
01:05:01,622 --> 01:05:03,522
- Seriously. It's like Sang Yi.
- Me.

1911
01:05:03,752 --> 01:05:04,891
This is...

1912
01:05:04,892 --> 01:05:06,292
Our chef is no joke.

1913
01:05:07,122 --> 01:05:09,132
Do you usually cook?

1914
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,801
How could you ask the chef, "Do you usually cook?"

1915
01:05:12,802 --> 01:05:14,031
(What kind of a question is that?)

1916
01:05:14,032 --> 01:05:15,532
I mean, for example...

1917
01:05:15,732 --> 01:05:17,302
Do you usually act?

1918
01:05:18,302 --> 01:05:20,402
Were you asking if she cooks regularly?

1919
01:05:21,002 --> 01:05:24,211
- She might cook for her family.
- You wanted to know that.

1920
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,442
That was what I was asking.

1921
01:05:25,712 --> 01:05:28,641
Did the chef make the soy sauce marinated crab?

1922
01:05:28,642 --> 01:05:30,211
I said earlier that it was from a famous restaurant...

1923
01:05:30,212 --> 01:05:31,811
- in Yeosu.
- I see.

1924
01:05:31,812 --> 01:05:33,481
He's absorbed in the tastes.

1925
01:05:33,482 --> 01:05:35,992
Gosh, is it okay for us to eat so well?

1926
01:05:36,622 --> 01:05:38,292
(He inhales the gray mullet sashimi.)

1927
01:05:41,692 --> 01:05:42,761
(Grabbing the tteokgalbi)

1928
01:05:42,762 --> 01:05:44,431
- Grab a piece each.
- Good.

1929
01:05:44,432 --> 01:05:45,532
It's insane.

1930
01:05:46,262 --> 01:05:48,502
(He also delivers it to his mouth.)

1931
01:05:49,372 --> 01:05:50,671
(Sitting in the most uncomfortable pose)

1932
01:05:50,672 --> 01:05:52,171
- Really?
- It's so tasty.

1933
01:05:52,172 --> 01:05:54,072
I'm sorry, but it's so...

1934
01:05:55,302 --> 01:05:57,288
Sang Yi, are you preparing to take off or something?

1935
01:05:57,312 --> 01:05:58,341
(Eating)

1936
01:05:58,342 --> 01:06:00,081
Sang Yi, are you preparing to take off or something?

1937
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:01,312
Why are you eating like that?

1938
01:06:02,012 --> 01:06:03,112
My goodness.

1939
01:06:03,712 --> 01:06:05,188
Sang Yi, does the food suit your taste?

1940
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:06,222
I'm happy.

1941
01:06:06,282 --> 01:06:07,781
That's right. This food brings happiness.

1942
01:06:07,782 --> 01:06:09,121
Sang Yi must be starved.

1943
01:06:09,122 --> 01:06:10,792
He didn't have a proper lunch.

1944
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,292
I felt bad for him.

1945
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:16,338
(He inhales dinner as if he's filming an eating show.)

1946
01:06:16,362 --> 01:06:18,061
The gray mullet sashimi is so tasty.

1947
01:06:18,062 --> 01:06:19,231
It's so chewy.

1948
01:06:19,232 --> 01:06:21,862
This is for the gray mullet sashimi.

1949
01:06:21,932 --> 01:06:24,402
(It goes straight to his mouth.)

1950
01:06:25,942 --> 01:06:28,242
(He loves the chewy texture.)

1951
01:06:28,342 --> 01:06:29,702
Have you made a wrap with sashimi?

1952
01:06:29,812 --> 01:06:31,972
- Not yet.
- It's so tasty.

1953
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:35,242
- Make a wrap with two pieces.
- Thank you.

1954
01:06:35,582 --> 01:06:36,652
He knows everything.

1955
01:06:37,682 --> 01:06:40,082
(He adds two pieces of the gray mullet sashimi.)

1956
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:41,882
(Bo Gum likes wasabi.)

1957
01:06:43,322 --> 01:06:46,722
(He shoves the face-sized wrap into his mouth.)

1958
01:06:47,992 --> 01:06:49,261
I'm so happy.

1959
01:06:49,262 --> 01:06:50,331
(The taste makes him happy.)

1960
01:06:50,332 --> 01:06:51,931
I'm happy.

1961
01:06:51,932 --> 01:06:53,201
Mixing rice in the crab back...

1962
01:06:53,202 --> 01:06:54,261
of the soy sauce marinated crab is insane.

1963
01:06:54,262 --> 01:06:55,401
It's insane.

1964
01:06:55,402 --> 01:06:57,172
People come to Yeosu for this.

1965
01:06:57,302 --> 01:06:58,648
- It's understandable.
- That's right.

1966
01:06:58,672 --> 01:07:00,372
Sang Yi eats with gusto.

1967
01:07:01,042 --> 01:07:02,202
Look at Sang Yi.

1968
01:07:02,542 --> 01:07:03,612
He's eating properly.

1969
01:07:03,842 --> 01:07:05,782
(A big spoonful)

1970
01:07:05,812 --> 01:07:06,882
Seriously.

1971
01:07:07,412 --> 01:07:09,092
(He takes the second spoonful right away.)

1972
01:07:09,652 --> 01:07:12,282
(Drinking from the crab back)

1973
01:07:12,352 --> 01:07:14,151
What's this crab back? The taste is insane.

1974
01:07:14,152 --> 01:07:15,792
The soy sauce marinated crab is insane.

1975
01:07:16,222 --> 01:07:17,691
Would you give me another bowl of rice?

1976
01:07:17,692 --> 01:07:19,362
It has begun.

1977
01:07:20,822 --> 01:07:22,761
- Do you need more rice?
- Would you like more rice?

1978
01:07:22,762 --> 01:07:24,492
Do you want more rice?

1979
01:07:25,192 --> 01:07:27,331
Is there more rice? Bo Gum wants more rice.

1980
01:07:27,332 --> 01:07:28,761
- That's incredible.
- Of course.

1981
01:07:28,762 --> 01:07:30,472
Bo Gum eats with gusto.

1982
01:07:31,032 --> 01:07:33,972
(This is how well he eats.)

1983
01:07:34,172 --> 01:07:35,172
(Eating vegetables)

1984
01:07:35,172 --> 01:07:36,172
(Eating jeon)

1985
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:38,142
(Drinking soup)

1986
01:07:38,942 --> 01:07:40,541
(The soy sauce marinated crab is his favorite.)

1987
01:07:40,542 --> 01:07:41,741
Bo Gum eats with gusto.

1988
01:07:41,742 --> 01:07:43,351
Bo Gum is destroying that crab.

1989
01:07:43,352 --> 01:07:44,482
(Breaking)

1990
01:07:45,582 --> 01:07:48,081
- It's like that.
- It happens often.

1991
01:07:48,082 --> 01:07:49,952
- Bo Gum, is your hand bleeding?
- Yes?

1992
01:07:50,552 --> 01:07:51,991
I'm okay.

1993
01:07:51,992 --> 01:07:53,161
- Why are you bleeding?
- What?

1994
01:07:53,162 --> 01:07:54,838
- While eating the crab...
- Did you get pricked?

1995
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,431
I'll give you an ointment after you're done eating.

1996
01:07:56,432 --> 01:07:58,092
Okay. Thank you.

1997
01:07:58,492 --> 01:08:00,632
Otherwise, you'll never be able to eat it.

1998
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,262
Seriously.

1999
01:08:02,632 --> 01:08:03,632
I'm really glad you came.

2000
01:08:03,633 --> 01:08:05,432
Try it. It's...

2001
01:08:06,072 --> 01:08:07,301
- Gosh.
- Why aren't they eating...

2002
01:08:07,302 --> 01:08:08,341
the crab legs?

2003
01:08:08,342 --> 01:08:09,741
- The crab legs? Where?
- Over there.

2004
01:08:09,742 --> 01:08:10,742
Joon, would you like this?

2005
01:08:10,743 --> 01:08:12,112
Joon, would you like this?

2006
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:14,881
I want to eat more, but I ate so many crabs.

2007
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,281
- Eat it.
- Would you like one?

2008
01:08:16,282 --> 01:08:17,451
- Eat it.
- Well, I...

2009
01:08:17,452 --> 01:08:18,681
I ate so many crabs.

2010
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:20,282
- Eat.
- How many crabs did you eat?

2011
01:08:20,382 --> 01:08:22,522
- I... Three.
- You ate so many crabs

2012
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:25,122
My goodness. Hey, he ate four crabs!

2013
01:08:25,192 --> 01:08:27,092
(Worried)

2014
01:08:27,162 --> 01:08:28,421
We're getting tip-offs.

2015
01:08:28,422 --> 01:08:30,182
- Sang Yi, you should eat it.
- I'll eat it.

2016
01:08:30,432 --> 01:08:32,391
- I feel bad.
- He ate four crabs.

2017
01:08:32,392 --> 01:08:35,432
I should've known. The dish was gone after I ate one.

2018
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:37,731
I'm sorry. I think I lost my mind.

2019
01:08:37,732 --> 01:08:39,202
I'm sorry. I ate a lot too.

2020
01:08:39,302 --> 01:08:41,301
It's okay. I can eat this anytime.

2021
01:08:41,302 --> 01:08:43,271
We'll film 2 Days 1 Night again the week after the next one.

2022
01:08:43,272 --> 01:08:45,372
For a while, we won't be able to eat this well.

2023
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:50,012
- It's too bad.
- Suddenly, I lost my energy.

2024
01:08:50,182 --> 01:08:51,712
I lost my appetite.

2025
01:08:51,952 --> 01:08:53,151
Although he hadn't said much...

2026
01:08:53,152 --> 01:08:54,652
Let's only use pretty words.

2027
01:08:54,752 --> 01:08:56,522
- Come to think of it, - Yes?

2028
01:08:56,622 --> 01:08:57,952
We took all the wins.

2029
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,092
Really?

2030
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:01,021
Didn't Sang Yi's team win in the Feeling Speed Quiz?

2031
01:09:01,022 --> 01:09:03,292
- We won.
- We won in the Feeling Speed Quiz.

2032
01:09:03,392 --> 01:09:06,202
Joon is doing well since his junior from university is here.

2033
01:09:06,732 --> 01:09:08,531
- Is that so?
- Of course.

2034
01:09:08,532 --> 01:09:09,571
Did you major in modern dance?

2035
01:09:09,572 --> 01:09:10,572
- Modern dance.
- Applied modern dance?

2036
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:12,102
- Applied modern dance.
- My goodness.

2037
01:09:12,372 --> 01:09:13,572
Only geniuses major in it.

2038
01:09:14,342 --> 01:09:15,912
I was a genius.

2039
01:09:16,272 --> 01:09:17,311
(Laughing)

2040
01:09:17,312 --> 01:09:19,441
- I mean, if you think about it...
- I said it myself.

2041
01:09:19,442 --> 01:09:21,282
The Seocho-dong Campus has...

2042
01:09:21,482 --> 01:09:23,351
students who enter university at the age of 15.

2043
01:09:23,352 --> 01:09:25,151
- That's right.
- Only such students gather around.

2044
01:09:25,152 --> 01:09:27,222
Only geniuses major in it.

2045
01:09:27,452 --> 01:09:29,551
Was Joon that good at dancing?

2046
01:09:29,552 --> 01:09:31,951
- Of course.
- He was number one.

2047
01:09:31,952 --> 01:09:33,291
Everyone knew about him.

2048
01:09:33,292 --> 01:09:34,422
He's really good.

2049
01:09:34,562 --> 01:09:35,662
- Really?
- Yes.

2050
01:09:35,962 --> 01:09:37,492
That's right. Don't look down on me.

2051
01:09:38,332 --> 01:09:40,502
His tone makes me want to look down on him.

2052
01:09:41,002 --> 01:09:42,778
(They tease Joon whenever they get a chance.)

2053
01:09:42,802 --> 01:09:44,072
(Joon, you're cool.)

2054
01:09:44,172 --> 01:09:46,101
- What did you major in?
- Acting.

2055
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:47,301
You were the representative...

2056
01:09:47,302 --> 01:09:49,018
- of the department.
- The class is famous.

2057
01:09:49,042 --> 01:09:50,042
The class that entered in 2010.

2058
01:09:50,043 --> 01:09:51,672
- Really?
- That class is legendary.

2059
01:09:51,972 --> 01:09:53,481
Se Yoon is funny...

2060
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:55,081
- because he majored in recreation.
- Yes.

2061
01:09:55,082 --> 01:09:56,851
- Really?
- He knows many games.

2062
01:09:56,852 --> 01:09:57,912
Can you do this?

2063
01:09:59,882 --> 01:10:01,762
Don't you usually make a square and a triangle?

2064
01:10:04,652 --> 01:10:06,592
That's the upgraded version.

2065
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:09,461
- He's good.
- He can do it.

2066
01:10:09,462 --> 01:10:11,692
- He's good.
- What?

2067
01:10:12,762 --> 01:10:14,331
(Bo Gum copies him.)

2068
01:10:14,332 --> 01:10:15,831
Let's see if you can do this.

2069
01:10:15,832 --> 01:10:17,372
It isn't easy. Watch.

2070
01:10:17,772 --> 01:10:19,742
(A difficult technique)

2071
01:10:20,242 --> 01:10:22,442
(An unexpected specialty leaves him flustered.)

2072
01:10:22,542 --> 01:10:24,212
I bet it'll be hard for Bo Gum as well.

2073
01:10:24,312 --> 01:10:25,941
You hit your chin and your forehead.

2074
01:10:25,942 --> 01:10:27,581
(Hit your chin and your forehead.)

2075
01:10:27,582 --> 01:10:29,082
(Speeding up)

2076
01:10:31,652 --> 01:10:32,881
- Gosh, it's hard.
- Gosh.

2077
01:10:32,882 --> 01:10:34,221
- Try it.
- How...

2078
01:10:34,222 --> 01:10:36,292
- Does it go like this?
- I can't do it at all.

2079
01:10:36,352 --> 01:10:37,392
I can't even begin.

2080
01:10:38,952 --> 01:10:40,662
- Am I doing it right?
- How is that hard?

2081
01:10:41,262 --> 01:10:43,232
You punk, it's my dad's specialty.

2082
01:10:43,962 --> 01:10:45,391
(Struggling)

2083
01:10:45,392 --> 01:10:46,631
When my dad goes somewhere,

2084
01:10:46,632 --> 01:10:48,902
he goes, "Hello, I'm Cho Sae Ho's dad."

2085
01:10:48,932 --> 01:10:50,372
"I should do a specialty, right?"

2086
01:10:50,602 --> 01:10:53,402
"I'll show you." Then he does this.

2087
01:10:55,572 --> 01:10:56,771
- Gosh.
- Really?

2088
01:10:56,772 --> 01:10:58,848
I can tell that you have a bachelor's degree in comedy.

2089
01:10:58,872 --> 01:11:00,482
- Like this.
- Hey, Seon Ho.

2090
01:11:00,642 --> 01:11:02,682
Show them. Do the Bop Bop.

2091
01:11:02,812 --> 01:11:04,388
- What's the Bop Bop?
- Only he can do it.

2092
01:11:04,412 --> 01:11:06,322
Why are we suddenly showing our specialties?

2093
01:11:06,682 --> 01:11:08,521
What kind of a show is this?

2094
01:11:08,522 --> 01:11:10,221
Sang Yi will have my respect if he copies it.

2095
01:11:10,222 --> 01:11:11,791
Do something only you can do.

2096
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:12,991
- There are three stages.
- Yes.

2097
01:11:12,992 --> 01:11:14,492
Stage One. Anyone can do it.

2098
01:11:14,692 --> 01:11:16,261
That's right. Anyone can do it.

2099
01:11:16,262 --> 01:11:17,262
I can do it too.

2100
01:11:18,162 --> 01:11:19,162
I can't do it.

2101
01:11:19,163 --> 01:11:20,331
(Carefree)

2102
01:11:20,332 --> 01:11:21,632
- Stage 2.
- Stage 2.

2103
01:11:22,202 --> 01:11:24,132
(Bop, bop)

2104
01:11:24,472 --> 01:11:26,042
(He's good.)

2105
01:11:26,102 --> 01:11:28,341
There you go. It's hard to do.

2106
01:11:28,342 --> 01:11:30,142
(Shocked)

2107
01:11:30,842 --> 01:11:31,842
(How is that possible?)

2108
01:11:31,843 --> 01:11:33,042
Can anyone do it?

2109
01:11:33,082 --> 01:11:34,111
(Let me try it.)

2110
01:11:34,112 --> 01:11:35,141
You can't do it.

2111
01:11:35,142 --> 01:11:37,411
(It sounds like there's no air.)

2112
01:11:37,412 --> 01:11:39,351
- Okay. Stage 3.
- Stage 3.

2113
01:11:39,352 --> 01:11:41,352
(For Stage 3, he reveals his legs.)

2114
01:11:41,882 --> 01:11:42,891
(Halting)

2115
01:11:42,892 --> 01:11:43,892
- What's this?
- What's this?

2116
01:11:43,893 --> 01:11:45,251
This is the real deal.

2117
01:11:45,252 --> 01:11:46,791
Stage Three involves the legs, right?

2118
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:48,921
Had it been an ordinary trick, we wouldn't have recruited him.

2119
01:11:48,922 --> 01:11:51,132
(Bop, bop)

2120
01:11:51,462 --> 01:11:53,501
(That's incredible.)

2121
01:11:53,502 --> 01:11:55,831
- That's insane.
- Why are you doing this?

2122
01:11:55,832 --> 01:11:58,272
Seon Ho, sing as well. You can sing as well, right?

2123
01:11:58,572 --> 01:12:01,972
I love you a lot

2124
01:12:02,042 --> 01:12:03,142
(Laughing)

2125
01:12:03,642 --> 01:12:05,372
- Seon Ho, that's it.
- I mean...

2126
01:12:05,672 --> 01:12:07,242
(Proud)

2127
01:12:07,582 --> 01:12:08,641
- That's incredible.
- Hey.

2128
01:12:08,642 --> 01:12:09,951
- He must've practiced at home.
- Hey.

2129
01:12:09,952 --> 01:12:11,181
- Seon Ho.
- Yes?

2130
01:12:11,182 --> 01:12:13,322
If you play the music, Bo Gum will sing.

2131
01:12:13,622 --> 01:12:16,021
You'll be too spoiled if you get used to a luxurious band.

2132
01:12:16,022 --> 01:12:17,391
You should try singing to his music.

2133
01:12:17,392 --> 01:12:19,121
Sing "A Love Story of a Country Boy" to that.

2134
01:12:19,122 --> 01:12:20,192
That's right.

2135
01:12:20,892 --> 01:12:21,921
(Lying on his back)

2136
01:12:21,922 --> 01:12:23,861
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Six, seven, eight.

2137
01:12:23,862 --> 01:12:25,292
("A Love Story of a Country Boy")

2138
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,362
(Singing by Park Bo Gum)

2139
01:12:27,732 --> 01:12:29,062
(Music by Mr. Bop Bop)

2140
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:31,332
(Tearing up)

2141
01:12:31,802 --> 01:12:33,272
(I can do it.)

2142
01:12:33,502 --> 01:12:35,242
(Flapping)

2143
01:12:36,272 --> 01:12:37,648
(Bo Gum fails to suppress his laughter.)

2144
01:12:37,672 --> 01:12:39,582
I could do it since the age of four.

2145
01:12:39,882 --> 01:12:42,041
- Is there anything else?
- Is there anything else, Sang Yi?

2146
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:44,311
I can move my second toe only.

2147
01:12:44,312 --> 01:12:45,352
No way.

2148
01:12:45,512 --> 01:12:47,221
- No way.
- I can't move it a lot.

2149
01:12:47,222 --> 01:12:48,251
I can move it once if I concentrate.

2150
01:12:48,252 --> 01:12:49,692
Tell us when you'll begin.

2151
01:12:50,522 --> 01:12:51,752
(Curious)

2152
01:12:51,922 --> 01:12:52,962
One,

2153
01:12:53,792 --> 01:12:55,521
two, three.

2154
01:12:55,522 --> 01:12:57,291
(Concentrating)

2155
01:12:57,292 --> 01:13:00,202
(Twitching)

2156
01:13:02,832 --> 01:13:05,672
(He can do it.)

2157
01:13:05,902 --> 01:13:07,002
How fascinating.

2158
01:13:07,642 --> 01:13:08,741
What?

2159
01:13:08,742 --> 01:13:09,871
What's up with him?

2160
01:13:09,872 --> 01:13:11,471
(A standing ovation)

2161
01:13:11,472 --> 01:13:13,381
- It moved this much.
- That was insane.

2162
01:13:13,382 --> 01:13:14,781
It's impossible.

2163
01:13:14,782 --> 01:13:16,512
- It's impossible.
- It's impossible.

2164
01:13:16,582 --> 01:13:18,881
- Like this?
- That was funny.

2165
01:13:18,882 --> 01:13:20,881
- They have strange talents.
- My goodness.

2166
01:13:20,882 --> 01:13:22,481
- How can you do it?
- I need to concentrate.

2167
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:25,052
Do you learn this at Korea National University of Arts?

2168
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,421
- We imitate a lion.
- So...

2169
01:13:27,422 --> 01:13:29,491
- Joon, you know it.
- Of course. I did the same thing.

2170
01:13:29,492 --> 01:13:30,831
- I know it.
- We imitate a lion.

2171
01:13:30,832 --> 01:13:32,431
I learned the racing trick at the university.

2172
01:13:32,432 --> 01:13:33,661
The racing trick.

2173
01:13:33,662 --> 01:13:35,301
- Let's see it. Show us.
- I...

2174
01:13:35,302 --> 01:13:37,501
I drive when I'm bored at home.

2175
01:13:37,502 --> 01:13:39,331
- Show us.
- I do this at home.

2176
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,778
- Turn on the ignition.
- I'll turn on the ignition.

2177
01:13:40,802 --> 01:13:43,271
(Turning on the ignition)

2178
01:13:43,272 --> 01:13:44,472
It's in the drive gear.

2179
01:13:45,942 --> 01:13:47,112
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2180
01:13:47,642 --> 01:13:48,982
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2181
01:13:50,352 --> 01:13:51,382
(Vroom)

2182
01:13:51,582 --> 01:13:54,252
(He suddenly begins to race.)

2183
01:13:56,452 --> 01:13:57,622
(Laughing)

2184
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:01,591
(His mouth twitches.)

2185
01:14:01,592 --> 01:14:03,662
(What's this?)

2186
01:14:05,062 --> 01:14:07,162
(He can drift.)

2187
01:14:07,462 --> 01:14:09,132
(The sound is the loudest.)

2188
01:14:09,432 --> 01:14:10,832
(Laughing out loud)

2189
01:14:11,032 --> 01:14:12,471
- He's drifting.
- Joon.

2190
01:14:12,472 --> 01:14:14,672
(Seeing the supercar in the room makes him feel dizzy.)

2191
01:14:15,072 --> 01:14:16,072
(A sudden stop)

2192
01:14:17,472 --> 01:14:18,771
- All right.
- Okay.

2193
01:14:18,772 --> 01:14:20,482
(He wraps it up perfectly.)

2194
01:14:20,612 --> 01:14:22,681
- That was incredible.
- The writers were impressed.

2195
01:14:22,682 --> 01:14:24,352
Gosh, that was incredible.

2196
01:14:24,612 --> 01:14:26,321
We're second to none when it comes to specialties.

2197
01:14:26,322 --> 01:14:27,521
You're right.

2198
01:14:27,522 --> 01:14:29,081
We suddenly showed our eccentric talents.

2199
01:14:29,082 --> 01:14:31,451
- Bo Gum eats with gusto.
- Bo Gum really eats with gusto.

2200
01:14:31,452 --> 01:14:33,992
- Seriously.
- He kept eating while we talked.

2201
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:37,462
(While the members showed their specialties)

2202
01:14:38,032 --> 01:14:39,731
(Inhaling food)

2203
01:14:39,732 --> 01:14:41,132
(Watching the specialties)

2204
01:14:41,202 --> 01:14:43,702
(Inhaling food)

2205
01:14:43,732 --> 01:14:45,472
(Trying to copy the specialty)

2206
01:14:46,032 --> 01:14:48,192
(On his rice, he piled up the braised silver pomfret.)

2207
01:14:48,872 --> 01:14:51,412
(An eating specialty)

2208
01:14:52,142 --> 01:14:55,982
(The very existence of Foodie Bo Gum is fun.)

2209
01:14:56,482 --> 01:14:58,851
- I think he eats more than Seon Ho.
- I know.

2210
01:14:58,852 --> 01:15:00,121
He eats a lot.

2211
01:15:00,122 --> 01:15:02,921
- The food is really tasty.
- Yes, it's really tasty.

2212
01:15:02,922 --> 01:15:04,121
I feel victimized.

2213
01:15:04,122 --> 01:15:06,122
Although he eats more than me, he lives like that.

2214
01:15:06,262 --> 01:15:07,521
I know. How does he do that?

2215
01:15:07,522 --> 01:15:08,692
I feel so victimized.

2216
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:12,232
(Foodie Bo Gum finishes two bowls of rice.)

2217
01:15:12,332 --> 01:15:14,831
We played this Balance Game while Sang Yi was sleeping.

2218
01:15:14,832 --> 01:15:16,161
What would you rather be in your next life?

2219
01:15:16,162 --> 01:15:19,302
Cho Sae Ho versus an orangutan.

2220
01:15:20,702 --> 01:15:21,972
He's torn.

2221
01:15:22,342 --> 01:15:23,841
Isn't it strange that you have to think about it?

2222
01:15:23,842 --> 01:15:25,202
Sang Yi, why do you need to think?

2223
01:15:25,512 --> 01:15:27,682
The fact that you need to think about it...

2224
01:15:27,782 --> 01:15:29,112
Hey, why do you need to think?

2225
01:15:30,152 --> 01:15:31,281
How about this?

2226
01:15:31,282 --> 01:15:32,951
What would you rather be in your next life? Cho Sae Ho...

2227
01:15:32,952 --> 01:15:35,422
versus a pine tree that's listed as a national treasure.

2228
01:15:36,052 --> 01:15:37,572
What would you rather be? A pine tree.

2229
01:15:37,822 --> 01:15:39,452
- I'd rather be a pine tree.
- I see.

2230
01:15:39,992 --> 01:15:41,021
Did you have a good meal?

2231
01:15:41,022 --> 01:15:42,661
- Yes. Thank you for the food.
- We really enjoyed it.

2232
01:15:42,662 --> 01:15:44,961
Let's proceed with the next schedule.

2233
01:15:44,962 --> 01:15:46,732
- Okay.
- Thank you for the food.

2234
01:15:47,462 --> 01:15:49,462
(Darkness falls and the moon rises.)

2235
01:15:49,672 --> 01:15:51,902
(Lively energy fills the place.)

2236
01:15:52,032 --> 01:15:54,572
(Lights reflect the place gently.)

2237
01:15:54,942 --> 01:15:57,942
(Yeosu night sea)

2238
01:15:59,812 --> 01:16:00,942
My goodness.

2239
01:16:02,742 --> 01:16:05,312
(Where is the piano sound coming from?)

2240
01:16:06,422 --> 01:16:07,482
No way.

2241
01:16:09,992 --> 01:16:11,021
Would you play mi once?

2242
01:16:11,022 --> 01:16:13,822
(Why are they here without the members?)

2243
01:16:13,922 --> 01:16:14,962
Ti.

2244
01:16:20,102 --> 01:16:23,572
(The genius of musical instruments with the perfect pitch, Bo Gum...)

2245
01:16:24,332 --> 01:16:26,131
(and the terrible game player, Sang Yi...)

2246
01:16:26,132 --> 01:16:27,332
(will show unexpected charms.)

2247
01:16:28,072 --> 01:16:31,042
(Is this the class of the department representative?)

2248
01:16:31,612 --> 01:16:34,742
(Why did they take out their musical instruments at night?)

2249
01:16:35,582 --> 01:16:40,022
(They prepared a song to enjoy the night of Yeosu.)

2250
01:16:45,592 --> 01:16:47,661
(It's a high-quality performance...)

2251
01:16:47,662 --> 01:16:49,932
(you couldn't hear on 2 Days 1 Night.)

2252
01:16:50,162 --> 01:16:52,262
I don't know the latter part.

2253
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:53,561
Will everyone know it?

2254
01:16:53,562 --> 01:16:55,843
(How will be the night of Yeosu with Bo Gum and Sang Yi?)

2255
01:17:01,602 --> 01:17:02,842
What's this?

2256
01:17:03,912 --> 01:17:05,142
My goodness.

2257
01:17:06,712 --> 01:17:07,741
(Surprised)

2258
01:17:07,742 --> 01:17:09,542
- What's this?
- Hey.

2259
01:17:09,652 --> 01:17:11,412
Is this "Park Bo-gum's Cantabile?"

2260
01:17:11,512 --> 01:17:13,222
They make such a beautiful picture.

2261
01:17:13,922 --> 01:17:15,851
(Today, it's "1 Night Again," not "Park Bo-gum's Cantabile.")

2262
01:17:15,852 --> 01:17:16,951
It feels strange.

2263
01:17:16,952 --> 01:17:18,792
It's the vibe I absolutely love.

2264
01:17:19,422 --> 01:17:21,422
("Yeosu Night Sea" by Busker Busker)

2265
01:17:22,922 --> 01:17:25,632
(It's blissful.)

2266
01:17:26,402 --> 01:17:28,761
(The musical accompaniment and Sang Yi's vocals...)

2267
01:17:28,762 --> 01:17:30,471
(make the melody even more beautiful.)

2268
01:17:30,472 --> 01:17:32,602
- It's cool.
- It's so nice.

2269
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:41,782
(He's in love.)

2270
01:17:43,052 --> 01:17:45,811
(They exude an air...)

2271
01:17:45,812 --> 01:17:50,092
(of perfection.)

2272
01:17:51,092 --> 01:17:53,761
(Their voices come together...)

2273
01:17:53,762 --> 01:17:57,432
(and create the fantastic harmony.)

2274
01:18:23,422 --> 01:18:27,161
(The gift was even more touching since they didn't expect it.)

2275
01:18:27,162 --> 01:18:29,161
You know, the atmosphere is so nice.

2276
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:31,392
- How are they...
- It was so cool.

2277
01:18:31,492 --> 01:18:32,931
Not musicians?

2278
01:18:32,932 --> 01:18:34,261
Why are they actors?

2279
01:18:34,262 --> 01:18:36,871
I knew that Bo Gum was good at playing the piano.

2280
01:18:36,872 --> 01:18:38,331
- Sang Yu played the guitar.
- I didn't know about that.

2281
01:18:38,332 --> 01:18:39,502
I can't play it very well.

2282
01:18:39,602 --> 01:18:42,072
Is he really the one who did this with me?

2283
01:18:42,142 --> 01:18:43,871
- My goodness.
- They're good.

2284
01:18:43,872 --> 01:18:45,341
How are actors so good at playing musical instruments?

2285
01:18:45,342 --> 01:18:47,742
By any chance, can you give us an encore performance?

2286
01:18:48,942 --> 01:18:51,551
I really want Jong Min...

2287
01:18:51,552 --> 01:18:52,581
- to sing this song.
- We need his help.

2288
01:18:52,582 --> 01:18:53,621
- Good.
- What is it?

2289
01:18:53,622 --> 01:18:55,581
- They requested him.
- When we begin,

2290
01:18:55,582 --> 01:18:57,451
you'll be able to join in right away.

2291
01:18:57,452 --> 01:18:58,522
Which song will it be?

2292
01:19:08,332 --> 01:19:09,402
(B flat!)

2293
01:19:10,332 --> 01:19:12,678
(He figures out the chord by listening to Jong Min's voice.)

2294
01:19:12,702 --> 01:19:14,501
It's like "1 Night Again" today.

2295
01:19:14,502 --> 01:19:15,902
- That's what it feels like.
- Yes.

2296
01:19:16,402 --> 01:19:20,982
(They turned the basecamp into a concert venue.)

2297
01:19:24,782 --> 01:19:27,852
(He can play the keyboard well no matter the genre.)

2298
01:19:29,752 --> 01:19:31,122
That's right.

2299
01:19:32,592 --> 01:19:35,222
- It's insane.
- This is so nice.

2300
01:19:35,492 --> 01:19:36,561
Isn't he a genius?

2301
01:19:36,562 --> 01:19:37,931
(Honored fans)

2302
01:19:37,932 --> 01:19:39,662
He's playing it while watching him.

2303
01:19:52,612 --> 01:19:54,312
(Jaw-dropping)

2304
01:19:54,512 --> 01:19:57,082
Gosh, that's really high.

2305
01:19:57,812 --> 01:19:58,812
No.

2306
01:19:59,012 --> 01:20:00,952
You should fix this later.

2307
01:20:01,322 --> 01:20:02,552
Okay? All right.

2308
01:20:02,752 --> 01:20:04,521
- They'll fix it later.
- I don't sing Shinji's part.

2309
01:20:04,522 --> 01:20:06,592
So is it like you can play...

2310
01:20:06,892 --> 01:20:09,091
- any song we want on the spot?
- That's amazing.

2311
01:20:09,092 --> 01:20:10,231
Yes, I can.

2312
01:20:10,232 --> 01:20:12,592
- Is there any song...
- Can you play "Don't Worry?"

2313
01:20:12,692 --> 01:20:14,802
- "Don't Worry?"
- Can you do that?

2314
01:20:15,462 --> 01:20:17,532
(They start playing right away.)

2315
01:20:17,602 --> 01:20:18,631
You should just start.

2316
01:20:18,632 --> 01:20:20,201
Once you start, I'll follow you.

2317
01:20:20,202 --> 01:20:21,472
(Okay)

2318
01:20:22,302 --> 01:20:23,742
- Is this right?
- Yes.

2319
01:20:25,212 --> 01:20:27,712
(It is slightly offbeat.)

2320
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:33,422
(He plays to his singing voice without getting flustered.)

2321
01:20:33,682 --> 01:20:36,252
- He plays the keyboard so well.
- I know. It's unbelievable.

2322
01:20:37,492 --> 01:20:40,922
(What is it that you can't do?)

2323
01:20:41,862 --> 01:20:44,532
(They're starting to be in sync.)

2324
01:20:45,232 --> 01:20:48,202
(This is quite nice.)

2325
01:20:49,202 --> 01:20:52,231
(Just let the past)

2326
01:20:52,232 --> 01:20:56,202
(Be the past)

2327
01:20:57,942 --> 01:21:02,712
(They are singing in harmony.)

2328
01:21:04,452 --> 01:21:07,682
(They forget about the wild road variety show...)

2329
01:21:08,382 --> 01:21:11,692
(and enjoy the relaxing moment for a short while.)

2330
01:21:12,622 --> 01:21:14,821
(Say you loved them without regrets)

2331
01:21:14,822 --> 01:21:20,102
(Say you loved them without regrets)

2332
01:21:20,402 --> 01:21:21,431
My heart is fluttering.

2333
01:21:21,432 --> 01:21:23,032
(A male production staff)

2334
01:21:23,732 --> 01:21:25,331
Are we supposed to have fun like this?

2335
01:21:25,332 --> 01:21:27,801
Aren't we going to play Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors?

2336
01:21:27,802 --> 01:21:30,071
- No, we will soon...
- We don't have to sleep.

2337
01:21:30,072 --> 01:21:31,471
- What?
- This is really nice.

2338
01:21:31,472 --> 01:21:33,071
It'd be nice if we could sleep together talking about music.

2339
01:21:33,072 --> 01:21:34,411
- Like this.
- Right. All night.

2340
01:21:34,412 --> 01:21:37,051
Both the members and the guests are...

2341
01:21:37,052 --> 01:21:38,911
serious about music.

2342
01:21:38,912 --> 01:21:41,152
- Everyone is a singer.
- So we had some busking...

2343
01:21:41,422 --> 01:21:43,151
with the night sea in the background.

2344
01:21:43,152 --> 01:21:45,521
- That was really nice.
- Now,

2345
01:21:45,522 --> 01:21:47,461
- we will do our thing.
- Our thing?

2346
01:21:47,462 --> 01:21:49,592
We will start Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

2347
01:21:50,432 --> 01:21:52,331
I'd like to thank the two guests for their hard work.

2348
01:21:52,332 --> 01:21:54,212
(Thank you for giving us such a precious time.)

2349
01:21:54,262 --> 01:21:56,461
It's our pleasure. Thank you.

2350
01:21:56,462 --> 01:21:58,101
That was really nice.

2351
01:21:58,102 --> 01:22:00,441
My goodness. I've never seen anything like this before.

2352
01:22:00,442 --> 01:22:01,541
- I mean, people like them.
- They're amazing.

2353
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,741
Only musicians and pianists can do this.

2354
01:22:03,742 --> 01:22:05,072
That was insane.

2355
01:22:05,742 --> 01:22:07,282
We're almost there.

2356
01:22:07,542 --> 01:22:08,681
Please hang in there.

2357
01:22:08,682 --> 01:22:10,411
- We're okay. We got some energy.
- We did.

2358
01:22:10,412 --> 01:22:12,711
- We're almost there.
- Thank you for singing.

2359
01:22:12,712 --> 01:22:14,452
- It was nothing.
- I was really excited.

2360
01:22:14,522 --> 01:22:16,182
The atmosphere was really cool.

2361
01:22:16,722 --> 01:22:18,121
They both are amazing.

2362
01:22:18,122 --> 01:22:20,221
- I was really surprised.
- How they led us.

2363
01:22:20,222 --> 01:22:21,868
(Thanks to you, we got one more precious memory.)

2364
01:22:21,892 --> 01:22:23,061
Everyone.

2365
01:22:23,062 --> 01:22:24,761
For tonight, we prepared...

2366
01:22:24,762 --> 01:22:26,061
a high-quality game...

2367
01:22:26,062 --> 01:22:27,361
of Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors with some music.

2368
01:22:27,362 --> 01:22:28,461
I'd love that.

2369
01:22:28,462 --> 01:22:29,901
Yes. This is really nice.

2370
01:22:29,902 --> 01:22:31,572
I love it. I don't want to sleep tonight.

2371
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:34,372
Tonight's Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors is...

2372
01:22:34,572 --> 01:22:36,812
Babbab Dirara.

2373
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:41,842
(Bo Gum is cute even when he sings this song.)

2374
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:43,952
Did you guys know...

2375
01:22:44,252 --> 01:22:45,851
that Bo Gum was the bank president?

2376
01:22:45,852 --> 01:22:47,321
- Of course.
- We know.

2377
01:22:47,322 --> 01:22:48,581
- We're aware of that.
- Of course.

2378
01:22:48,582 --> 01:22:49,652
- Really?
- Yes.

2379
01:22:49,752 --> 01:22:50,792
Of course, we know.

2380
01:22:51,152 --> 01:22:52,651
Is it called the bank president?

2381
01:22:52,652 --> 01:22:53,692
(Sang Yi didn't know.)

2382
01:22:53,922 --> 01:22:56,021
Before "The Seasons: Cantabile of Park Bo Gum,"

2383
01:22:56,022 --> 01:22:57,661
- he was the bank president...
- "Music Bank."

2384
01:22:57,662 --> 01:22:59,362
- of "Music Bank."
- That's right.

2385
01:22:59,632 --> 01:23:02,462
(It seems like time is avoiding Bo Gum.)

2386
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:04,871
You know how every music show has different opening lines.

2387
01:23:04,872 --> 01:23:05,872
That's right.

2388
01:23:05,873 --> 01:23:08,441
Can you show us a little of the "Music Bank" opening lines?

2389
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:09,682
(His memory is a little fuzzy.)

2390
01:23:09,742 --> 01:23:11,172
Does he still remember that?

2391
01:23:11,412 --> 01:23:12,412
Do you remember?

2392
01:23:12,413 --> 01:23:14,882
My goodness. I have the script in my pocket.

2393
01:23:15,082 --> 01:23:16,912
- Oh, right.
- Suddenly, in my pocket...

2394
01:23:17,982 --> 01:23:19,152
It's been such a long time.

2395
01:23:19,312 --> 01:23:20,352
Where should I look?

2396
01:23:20,722 --> 01:23:22,122
Music Bank!

2397
01:23:22,222 --> 01:23:23,352
Music Bank!

2398
01:23:23,592 --> 01:23:26,052
(Peeping at the script)

2399
01:23:26,252 --> 01:23:27,922
(He's already done memorizing it?)

2400
01:23:28,562 --> 01:23:31,791
(How does the bank president look in 2025?)

2401
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:32,792
Here I go.

2402
01:23:33,192 --> 01:23:36,202
Evolving K-pop. The center of the Korean Wave.

2403
01:23:36,402 --> 01:23:37,801
With people all over the world,

2404
01:23:37,802 --> 01:23:40,872
- this is live "Music Bank."
- "Music Bank."

2405
01:23:41,572 --> 01:23:43,272
(He sounds the same.)

2406
01:23:43,412 --> 01:23:46,071
Here are the candidate songs for number one on the K-chart...

2407
01:23:46,072 --> 01:23:47,912
in the 1st week of June 2025.

2408
01:23:48,382 --> 01:23:49,911
(He feels shy after doing a great job.)

2409
01:23:49,912 --> 01:23:51,252
He's still got it.

2410
01:23:51,612 --> 01:23:52,612
(My friend Gum Bo is so cute.)

2411
01:23:52,613 --> 01:23:54,452
- He hasn't changed.
- He sounds the same.

2412
01:23:54,652 --> 01:23:56,081
All right. So,

2413
01:23:56,082 --> 01:23:59,091
we will have the Music Quiz with the number one songs...

2414
01:23:59,092 --> 01:24:00,791
from "Music Bank."

2415
01:24:00,792 --> 01:24:02,192
Number one songs from "Music Bank?"

2416
01:24:02,522 --> 01:24:05,332
You should listen to the song and answer the title and artist.

2417
01:24:05,432 --> 01:24:07,901
The team that has all the members give the correct answers...

2418
01:24:07,902 --> 01:24:09,402
wins the round.

2419
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:10,972
We're really good at this.

2420
01:24:11,702 --> 01:24:13,401
There will be a total of three rounds.

2421
01:24:13,402 --> 01:24:16,402
The team that wins two rounds will sleep indoors,

2422
01:24:16,442 --> 01:24:18,942
and the losing team will sleep outdoors.

2423
01:24:19,542 --> 01:24:21,182
It's a little chilly today.

2424
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:23,582
- It might rain at night.
- Right.

2425
01:24:23,882 --> 01:24:26,411
How long did you host the show, Bo Gum?

2426
01:24:26,412 --> 01:24:28,951
I did it in 2015.

2427
01:24:28,952 --> 01:24:30,251
In 2015.

2428
01:24:30,252 --> 01:24:32,052
I bet songs from the time will be played.

2429
01:24:32,992 --> 01:24:34,762
Before "Music Bank..."

2430
01:24:35,022 --> 01:24:36,091
"Top 10 Songs?"

2431
01:24:36,092 --> 01:24:37,491
Please include songs from "Top 10 Songs" as well.

2432
01:24:37,492 --> 01:24:39,091
- "Top 10 Songs."
- Son Pum Soo's "Top 10 Songs."

2433
01:24:39,092 --> 01:24:40,762
- I want "Top 10 Songs."
- Please.

2434
01:24:40,802 --> 01:24:42,631
Yes. Please include songs from "Top 10 Songs."

2435
01:24:42,632 --> 01:24:44,972
- We considered it as well.
- Okay.

2436
01:24:45,502 --> 01:24:47,171
I don't know old songs.

2437
01:24:47,172 --> 01:24:48,472
- You have me.
- Right.

2438
01:24:49,642 --> 01:24:51,042
Here's the first question.

2439
01:24:51,742 --> 01:24:54,611
We will start with the song from the time...

2440
01:24:54,612 --> 01:24:56,212
when Bo Gum was the bank president.

2441
01:24:56,612 --> 01:24:58,351
Okay. Let's do it.

2442
01:24:58,352 --> 01:25:00,722
- Then he'd know.
- In 2015 and 2016.

2443
01:25:01,582 --> 01:25:03,451
- He must've heard it every week.
- Right.

2444
01:25:03,452 --> 01:25:05,452
- He can get it.
- And it was the number one song.

2445
01:25:05,522 --> 01:25:08,491
I'm sure the other members would know the song.

2446
01:25:08,492 --> 01:25:10,162
- Please focus.
- All right. Let's go.

2447
01:25:11,392 --> 01:25:13,192
Music, please.

2448
01:25:14,962 --> 01:25:16,001
- Seon Ho!
- Sang Yi!

2449
01:25:16,002 --> 01:25:17,071
- Sang Yi was faster.
- Sang Yi was faster.

2450
01:25:17,072 --> 01:25:18,102
Seon Ho was faster.

2451
01:25:18,532 --> 01:25:20,101
- Sang Yi was faster.
- He was really fast.

2452
01:25:20,102 --> 01:25:21,642
- Sang Yi was really fast.
- He was.

2453
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:24,012
(Sang Yi's hand was a little faster.)

2454
01:25:24,842 --> 01:25:26,771
(Did Bo Gum recognize the song?)

2455
01:25:26,772 --> 01:25:27,811
Five.

2456
01:25:27,812 --> 01:25:28,881
(You have to think, Sang Yi.)

2457
01:25:28,882 --> 01:25:30,912
- Three.
- "TT" by TWICE.

2458
01:25:31,252 --> 01:25:32,411
DinDin!

2459
01:25:32,412 --> 01:25:33,751
- Wrong.
- DinDin.

2460
01:25:33,752 --> 01:25:35,282
- DinDin.
- DinDin.

2461
01:25:35,452 --> 01:25:37,751
- TWICE. Cheer up baby - Right.

2462
01:25:37,752 --> 01:25:39,991
- Cheer up baby - What's the title?

2463
01:25:39,992 --> 01:25:41,592
- "Cheer Up."
- Correct.

2464
01:25:41,692 --> 01:25:43,421
(DinDin is so cool.)

2465
01:25:43,422 --> 01:25:44,592
DinDin.

2466
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:45,991
I didn't know it was that song.

2467
01:25:45,992 --> 01:25:47,331
("Cheer Up" by TWICE was in 1st place for 4 weeks in 2015.)

2468
01:25:47,332 --> 01:25:48,431
What's that?

2469
01:25:48,432 --> 01:25:50,702
(Bo Gum shyly dances only with his shoulders.)

2470
01:25:51,432 --> 01:25:53,332
(Decalcomania)

2471
01:25:56,742 --> 01:26:00,712
(The student representative dances well too.)

2472
01:26:00,882 --> 01:26:03,212
I performed this song with Gu Ra on MBC.

2473
01:26:03,312 --> 01:26:05,032
- As a congratulatory performance.
- Right.

2474
01:26:05,182 --> 01:26:06,611
- Didn't Chang Hee do that?
- With Chang Hee.

2475
01:26:06,612 --> 01:26:08,222
- Right.
- And Kyeong Hwan.

2476
01:26:08,452 --> 01:26:09,481
Hwang Je Seong was there too.

2477
01:26:09,482 --> 01:26:10,792
- Gu Ra did it.
- Yes.

2478
01:26:10,952 --> 01:26:12,722
- That's right.
- It was "Cheer Up."

2479
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,722
- That was so close.
- It wasn't "TT."

2480
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:17,731
Let's have the person who passed stand behind the opposing team.

2481
01:26:17,732 --> 01:26:19,291
- He might give a hint.
- right.

2482
01:26:19,292 --> 01:26:21,402
- Come here, DinDin.
- Come here.

2483
01:26:22,832 --> 01:26:24,372
He's such a cheater.

2484
01:26:24,932 --> 01:26:26,301
Here's the next question.

2485
01:26:26,302 --> 01:26:28,572
All right. Let's meet them right away. "Cheer Up!"

2486
01:26:30,412 --> 01:26:31,841
Lee Joon!

2487
01:26:31,842 --> 01:26:32,912
- Oh, no.
- Lee Joon.

2488
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:35,682
"Shake It" by SISTAR.

2489
01:26:36,082 --> 01:26:37,282
- I see.
- What?

2490
01:26:37,812 --> 01:26:39,711
(That's right.)

2491
01:26:39,712 --> 01:26:40,821
Seon Ho.

2492
01:26:40,822 --> 01:26:42,122
- Correct.
- "Shake It!"

2493
01:26:42,882 --> 01:26:46,122
("Shake It" by SISTAR was in 1st place for 2 weeks in July 2015.)

2494
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:50,062
(Showing off his charms to Sang Yi)

2495
01:26:50,692 --> 01:26:55,132
(His body is reacting to the song automatically.)

2496
01:26:55,532 --> 01:26:58,132
(It captivates Bo Gum too.)

2497
01:26:59,432 --> 01:27:00,772
I really want to dance.

2498
01:27:04,442 --> 01:27:05,442
(Amazed)

2499
01:27:05,442 --> 01:27:06,442
(He's excited by his colleagues' song.)

2500
01:27:06,443 --> 01:27:07,482
There you go.

2501
01:27:07,742 --> 01:27:08,782
Nice.

2502
01:27:09,242 --> 01:27:10,681
- That was nice.
- I did well.

2503
01:27:10,682 --> 01:27:13,012
- Are you sure you're not drunk?
- I'm sober.

2504
01:27:13,722 --> 01:27:15,722
I knew it was SISTAR, but I didn't know the title.

2505
01:27:16,052 --> 01:27:17,291
Next question.

2506
01:27:17,292 --> 01:27:19,021
It is a song from the 2010s.

2507
01:27:19,022 --> 01:27:20,291
- Okay.
- All right.

2508
01:27:20,292 --> 01:27:22,412
- Let's watch it together.
- Let's watch it together.

2509
01:27:23,692 --> 01:27:25,831
- Seon Ho!
- Jong Min.

2510
01:27:25,832 --> 01:27:27,062
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho.

2511
01:27:27,602 --> 01:27:28,902
"Gee" by Girls’ Generation.

2512
01:27:29,102 --> 01:27:30,161
No.

2513
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:31,501
- Wrong.
- That's not it.

2514
01:27:31,502 --> 01:27:33,131
- Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho.

2515
01:27:33,132 --> 01:27:34,671
Don't say it if you're not sure. I'll answer.

2516
01:27:34,672 --> 01:27:36,201
- I know.
- I'm not the me you knew before

2517
01:27:36,202 --> 01:27:38,111
Three, two...

2518
01:27:38,112 --> 01:27:39,171
(What was the title?)

2519
01:27:39,172 --> 01:27:40,741
- One.
- "Girls’ Generation..."

2520
01:27:40,742 --> 01:27:41,742
by Girls’ Generation.

2521
01:27:41,812 --> 01:27:42,981
- That's ridiculous.
- Seon Ho.

2522
01:27:42,982 --> 01:27:44,351
- Wrong. Seon Ho.
- What is it?

2523
01:27:44,352 --> 01:27:45,452
"Oh" by Girls’ Generation.

2524
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:46,981
- It's "Oh!"
- Sang Yi.

2525
01:27:46,982 --> 01:27:48,281
(I don't think so.)

2526
01:27:48,282 --> 01:27:49,282
Correct.

2527
01:27:49,283 --> 01:27:50,322
(That's it.)

2528
01:27:50,792 --> 01:27:53,762
(He hugs Bo Gum before celebrating it.)

2529
01:27:54,662 --> 01:27:55,961
Isn't it "Genie?"

2530
01:27:55,962 --> 01:27:57,732
- No.
- Is it "Oh?"

2531
01:27:57,832 --> 01:27:58,832
I knew it.

2532
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:00,462
(He's sad, so he just dances.)

2533
01:28:01,002 --> 01:28:03,802
(Dancing gently in disappointment)

2534
01:28:04,372 --> 01:28:06,802
(Excited)

2535
01:28:08,672 --> 01:28:10,072
Here it comes.

2536
01:28:10,512 --> 01:28:11,741
Here comes the chorus.

2537
01:28:11,742 --> 01:28:13,981
- "I'm not the me you knew before."
- One, two, three, four.

2538
01:28:13,982 --> 01:28:15,302
- I'm not the me - I'm not the me

2539
01:28:16,342 --> 01:28:18,051
I should sing the part.

2540
01:28:18,052 --> 01:28:19,982
- Why did you stop the song?
- With 12,000 peaks

2541
01:28:21,322 --> 01:28:23,451
(Bo Gum has already been influenced by 2 Days 1 Night.)

2542
01:28:23,452 --> 01:28:24,452
(Laughing)

2543
01:28:24,453 --> 01:28:27,492
(He loves the joke.)

2544
01:28:27,592 --> 01:28:28,661
I should do this.

2545
01:28:28,662 --> 01:28:30,492
Why did you stop the song, mister?

2546
01:28:30,932 --> 01:28:33,232
Everyone. Team Bo Gum has two members left,

2547
01:28:33,562 --> 01:28:35,301
and Team Sang Yi has three members left.

2548
01:28:35,302 --> 01:28:37,331
Bo Gum, you should do it now.

2549
01:28:37,332 --> 01:28:38,402
Okay.

2550
01:28:39,132 --> 01:28:41,278
(When the first song played, Bo Gum was just smiling.)

2551
01:28:41,302 --> 01:28:43,382
(He didn't even get to say his name the whole time.)

2552
01:28:44,112 --> 01:28:46,112
(He just kept smiling beautifully.)

2553
01:28:46,242 --> 01:28:47,441
Try harder.

2554
01:28:47,442 --> 01:28:48,911
- You don't have to be nice.
- Okay.

2555
01:28:48,912 --> 01:28:51,012
Next question. Music, please.

2556
01:28:51,912 --> 01:28:53,822
- Sae Ho!
- Oh, no.

2557
01:28:53,882 --> 01:28:54,952
- Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho.

2558
01:28:55,222 --> 01:28:57,522
(He didn't move this time again.)

2559
01:28:57,652 --> 01:28:59,191
- G-DRAGON.
- My goodness.

2560
01:28:59,192 --> 01:29:01,222
- That's right.
- Tonight I'll be crooked.

2561
01:29:01,792 --> 01:29:03,192
He said, "Tonight I'll be crooked."

2562
01:29:03,292 --> 01:29:05,461
"Crooked" by G-DRAGON.

2563
01:29:05,462 --> 01:29:06,892
- "Curved" by BigBang.
- Correct.

2564
01:29:07,262 --> 01:29:08,302
Correct.

2565
01:29:08,902 --> 01:29:10,332
You should do this.

2566
01:29:11,072 --> 01:29:12,202
Do this for us.

2567
01:29:12,402 --> 01:29:14,372
(Dancing gently)

2568
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:16,142
I'm sorry.

2569
01:29:23,542 --> 01:29:26,812
(Tonight I'll be crooked)

2570
01:29:27,012 --> 01:29:28,682
It wasn't "Curved."

2571
01:29:29,122 --> 01:29:31,591
- Tonight I'll be curved - Curved

2572
01:29:31,592 --> 01:29:33,292
(Don't learn strange things here.)

2573
01:29:33,492 --> 01:29:35,922
Jong Min, among the songs that have been played so far,

2574
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:38,161
- was there anything you knew?
- Yes, I know them all.

2575
01:29:38,162 --> 01:29:40,602
- The titles too?
- He knew "Shake It." He danced.

2576
01:29:40,632 --> 01:29:41,831
I know the dance moves.

2577
01:29:41,832 --> 01:29:42,832
(Don't look down on me.)

2578
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:43,901
I don't know the first verses.

2579
01:29:43,902 --> 01:29:45,332
Here's the next song.

2580
01:29:45,672 --> 01:29:46,731
(It's calm, unlike the previous songs.)

2581
01:29:46,732 --> 01:29:48,271
- Sang Yi!
- Okay!

2582
01:29:48,272 --> 01:29:49,342
- Sang Yi.
- Rain.

2583
01:29:49,642 --> 01:29:50,771
"Love Song."

2584
01:29:50,772 --> 01:29:52,571
("Love Song" by Rain)

2585
01:29:52,572 --> 01:29:53,672
Correct.

2586
01:29:57,612 --> 01:30:00,112
(Dancing is almost a reflex.)

2587
01:30:01,382 --> 01:30:03,482
(The lookalikes try to imitate Rain.)

2588
01:30:03,822 --> 01:30:06,722
(Their hips swing and sway.)

2589
01:30:06,992 --> 01:30:08,021
- He looks like him!
- He does.

2590
01:30:08,022 --> 01:30:10,222
- He looks like him!
- It's identical from behind.

2591
01:30:10,932 --> 01:30:13,931
(You could say they're triplets.)

2592
01:30:13,932 --> 01:30:16,032
- They look the same.
- They look the same.

2593
01:30:17,772 --> 01:30:18,801
He's so good.

2594
01:30:18,802 --> 01:30:21,172
- He's just like Rain.
- Lee Sang Yi.

2595
01:30:23,102 --> 01:30:25,371
Hey, Sang Yi. You're incredible.

2596
01:30:25,372 --> 01:30:26,688
(Sang Yi's the third to succeed.)

2597
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:29,192
He's good at everything because he represented his department.

2598
01:30:29,242 --> 01:30:30,912
- This is great.
- Doesn't it feel good?

2599
01:30:31,712 --> 01:30:32,852
Why are you sitting down?

2600
01:30:33,652 --> 01:30:36,021
- Bo Gum, you need to work hard!
- Let's go, Bo Gum.

2601
01:30:36,022 --> 01:30:37,051
(At least try this time!)

2602
01:30:37,052 --> 01:30:38,321
You need to do this, Jong Min.

2603
01:30:38,322 --> 01:30:39,991
- Here we go.
- Don't help them out.

2604
01:30:39,992 --> 01:30:41,521
- I won't.
- We won't.

2605
01:30:41,522 --> 01:30:43,862
- I'll watch.
- Here's the song.

2606
01:30:46,092 --> 01:30:47,362
I heard this before!

2607
01:30:48,032 --> 01:30:49,331
- I want to guess.
- What is it?

2608
01:30:49,332 --> 01:30:50,531
- It's so easy.
- It's too easy.

2609
01:30:50,532 --> 01:30:51,732
(The winners know the answer.)

2610
01:30:52,232 --> 01:30:54,002
(He isn't even close.)

2611
01:30:54,702 --> 01:30:56,772
It sounds like someone's writing.

2612
01:30:57,002 --> 01:30:59,772
- We'll play it again.
- Someone's writing.

2613
01:31:00,312 --> 01:31:01,881
- Se Yoon.
- Yes, do it.

2614
01:31:01,882 --> 01:31:03,981
- Yes! That's it!
- What are you doing?

2615
01:31:03,982 --> 01:31:05,128
(Only Se Yoon shouted his name.)

2616
01:31:05,152 --> 01:31:07,321
(I think I know it too...)

2617
01:31:07,322 --> 01:31:08,851
You're almost there.

2618
01:31:08,852 --> 01:31:09,852
(He must guess it now.)

2619
01:31:09,853 --> 01:31:11,321
- You're almost there.
- BEAST.

2620
01:31:11,322 --> 01:31:13,022
- And?
- You know the answer.

2621
01:31:14,522 --> 01:31:15,792
- "Fiction."
- Correct.

2622
01:31:15,822 --> 01:31:18,392
- Okay!
- No way.

2623
01:31:19,232 --> 01:31:21,902
(We'd have won if we got it.)

2624
01:31:22,302 --> 01:31:23,972
(Here's one more guy who can't laugh.)

2625
01:31:25,702 --> 01:31:27,402
(Out of control)

2626
01:31:27,802 --> 01:31:29,142
Aren't they friends?

2627
01:31:29,842 --> 01:31:31,311
- Mister.
- Hey.

2628
01:31:31,312 --> 01:31:32,412
We got it right.

2629
01:31:33,112 --> 01:31:34,112
"Fiction."

2630
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:35,582
(Backing down)

2631
01:31:36,982 --> 01:31:38,412
Jong Min knows it all.

2632
01:31:39,412 --> 01:31:42,321
(Jong Min quietly shows off.)

2633
01:31:42,322 --> 01:31:43,322
He knows the moves.

2634
01:31:43,323 --> 01:31:44,452
(This is fun.)

2635
01:31:44,922 --> 01:31:47,662
(Winners and losers celebrate together.)

2636
01:31:47,862 --> 01:31:49,422
- Do your best.
- What do I do now?

2637
01:31:50,162 --> 01:31:51,991
(Much pressure)

2638
01:31:51,992 --> 01:31:53,361
We're down to one-all.

2639
01:31:53,362 --> 01:31:54,602
(1 on each team remains.)

2640
01:31:54,932 --> 01:31:56,102
Bo Gum.

2641
01:31:56,332 --> 01:31:58,071
You went down to Jong Min's level.

2642
01:31:58,072 --> 01:31:59,131
(Laughing)

2643
01:31:59,132 --> 01:32:00,201
You're down on Jong Min's level.

2644
01:32:00,202 --> 01:32:02,542
- I will bring you down.
- Jong Min versus Bo Gum.

2645
01:32:02,942 --> 01:32:04,672
- Here we go.
- Okay!

2646
01:32:04,972 --> 01:32:06,342
Bank president!

2647
01:32:06,442 --> 01:32:09,142
Don't be nervous.

2648
01:32:10,182 --> 01:32:12,312
(You made a mockery of me.)

2649
01:32:12,612 --> 01:32:14,952
(I'll make sure you regret it.)

2650
01:32:15,252 --> 01:32:17,521
Play the song.

2651
01:32:17,522 --> 01:32:18,851
(Please)

2652
01:32:18,852 --> 01:32:20,721
- Bo Gum!
- It's over.

2653
01:32:20,722 --> 01:32:22,661
Okay. It's over.

2654
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:24,461
(No. My chance to get revenge...)

2655
01:32:24,462 --> 01:32:26,291
- He doesn't know.
- Jong Min has no clue.

2656
01:32:26,292 --> 01:32:28,632
"You And I" by IU.

2657
01:32:28,832 --> 01:32:29,931
- Okay.
- That's correct.

2658
01:32:29,932 --> 01:32:31,802
(That's correct.)

2659
01:32:32,502 --> 01:32:33,832
- Correct!
- Okay!

2660
01:32:34,642 --> 01:32:37,122
("You And I" by IU was number 1 for 6 weeks in a row in 2011.)

2661
01:32:37,872 --> 01:32:40,612
(A precious sight of Bo Gum's bouncing in glee.)

2662
01:32:41,342 --> 01:32:44,082
(His dance routine portrays the words exactly.)

2663
01:32:45,012 --> 01:32:48,522
(Moping)

2664
01:32:52,952 --> 01:32:57,832
(He's on a high since he got one question right.)

2665
01:32:58,492 --> 01:33:00,491
(Bo Gum's face is our light and our future.)

2666
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:02,561
- You and I.
- Call out

2667
01:33:02,562 --> 01:33:06,802
- My name - My name

2668
01:33:07,742 --> 01:33:09,372
(This is great.)

2669
01:33:09,742 --> 01:33:11,271
(Ae Sun, you helped me win.)

2670
01:33:11,272 --> 01:33:14,311
- Team Bo Gum won round one.
- Okay!

2671
01:33:14,312 --> 01:33:15,481
(Round 1 goes to Team Bo Gum.)

2672
01:33:15,482 --> 01:33:17,711
Sorry. I should've done better.

2673
01:33:17,712 --> 01:33:18,712
No.

2674
01:33:18,713 --> 01:33:20,352
I know lots of songs from the 1990s.

2675
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,598
- What did you think it was?
- You can do it.

2676
01:33:21,622 --> 01:33:24,052
(Next episode)

2677
01:33:24,892 --> 01:33:27,621
(The party must go on.)

2678
01:33:27,622 --> 01:33:29,862
Jong Min. Go for it.

2679
01:33:30,362 --> 01:33:33,462
(Dance fever grips 2 Days 1 Night.)

2680
01:33:33,932 --> 01:33:35,732
(Here comes the mob boss.)

2681
01:33:36,462 --> 01:33:38,532
(Park Bo Gum's Good Boy)

2682
01:33:39,002 --> 01:33:41,142
(DJ Fatty's here too.)

2683
01:33:41,802 --> 01:33:44,412
(The last dance with hopes of going home)

2684
01:33:44,972 --> 01:33:47,382
(We got the footage. Let's go home now.)

2685
01:33:48,542 --> 01:33:50,542
(The members are by the sea?)

2686
01:33:51,152 --> 01:33:52,651
(In comes...)

2687
01:33:52,652 --> 01:33:54,552
(the spinning wheel.)

2688
01:33:55,052 --> 01:33:56,922
(Not even Bo Gum or Sang Yi can avoid this.)

2689
01:33:57,282 --> 01:33:59,592
(A roulette to decide who dives in the sea)

2690
01:33:59,792 --> 01:34:00,861
- Three!
- Please!

2691
01:34:00,862 --> 01:34:02,761
(The Goddess of Luck)

2692
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:04,492
(Who will she frown upon?)

2693
01:34:04,792 --> 01:34:08,162
(See you on Sunday night at 6:10pm.)
