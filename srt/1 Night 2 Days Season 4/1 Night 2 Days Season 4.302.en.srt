1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
(Goheung, the town of delicacies)

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,699
(An amazing dinner is prepared...)

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,570
(or so they thought.)

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,710
(Hungry Lupin the thief...)

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,510
(stole their dinner.)

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,449
(Among them, )

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,249
(Hungry Lupin...)

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,580
(is hiding.)

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,890
(Who is Hungry Lupin?)

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,989
(They must identify...)

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,420
(who Hungry Lupin is...)

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,230
(in order to eat dinner.)

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,130
(If they fail to arrest Hungry Lupin, )

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,130
(Hungry Lupin will feast all by himself.)

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,410
(They must complete the mission to get a hint about Hungry Lupin.)

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,440
(But Hungry Lupin must secretly try to sabotage the mission.)

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,609
(They kept making mistakes...)

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,840
(one after another.)

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,480
(Suspecting him right away)

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,950
(But how come you two messed up right at the end?)

21
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,980
(You're Hungry Lupin, right?)

22
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,320
(While they were suspicious of everyone, )

23
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,420
(a helper was chosen to assist Hungry Lupin.)

24
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,689
(Helper Lee Joon)

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,699
- You two will share the same fate.
- Why?

26
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,499
(Feeling the pressure)

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,500
That's correct.

28
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:14,200
(Luckily, Helper Joon won 1st place during the 3rd mission.)

29
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,669
(He got to check the hint by himself.)

30
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,640
(He looked like a bear.)

31
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,810
(He shared the real hint with the citizens.)

32
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,350
(He framed Se Yoon as Hungry Lupin.)

33
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,280
(However...)

34
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,479
- There's nothing on it.
- Show it to us.

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,890
(Se Yoon is just a mere citizen.)

36
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,020
(Now, Hungry Lupin is among the 4 of them.)

37
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,429
(Before the last mission...)

38
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,600
(to figure out who Hungry Lupin is...)

39
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,229
The two of them are sabotaging the games.

40
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,200
(Sae Ho is talking to Helper Joon?)

41
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,970
(Why are they together like that?)

42
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,110
(A suspicious sight)

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,210
(I figured it out.)

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,680
(DinDin has put together all the pieces?)

45
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,150
(Is the helper flustered?)

46
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,019
(Hungry Lupin didn't know...)

47
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,519
(Jong Min was going to be taken away.)

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,890
(Sae Ho didn't know, so he was surprised like us.)

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,329
(So that makes Sae Ho Hungry Lupin?)

50
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,436
- You must be out of your mind.
- And you're the helper.

51
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,530
(All of a sudden, they start to suspect Sae Ho as Hungry Lupin.)

52
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,270
(The members are closing in on Hungry Lupin.)

53
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,540
(This is their last chance to get the hint.)

54
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,879
(Hungry Lupin will secretly try...)

55
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,880
(to sabotage the mission.)

56
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,949
(2 Days 1 Night)

57
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,819
- All right. The last mission is...
- Gosh, I can't get up.

58
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,120
Mudflat Impossible.

59
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,589
(There are obstacles on the mudflat.)

60
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,299
You've all played the game, Step on the Back, right?

61
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,569
- What's that?
- Step on the Back.

62
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,410
- Step on the Back?
- Let me explain the game.

63
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,800
Everyone will bend over first.

64
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,739
One person will step on everyone's backs...

65
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,909
to complete the course...

66
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,070
while running.

67
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,739
The five of you will make a path...

68
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,280
with your backs.

69
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,780
The last member must complete the course,

70
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,819
return without letting...

71
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,050
any of his body part touch the mudflat,

72
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,849
and then pull the flag to finish the mission.

73
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,389
(The member on their backs must pull the flag.)

74
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,560
Firstly, you must weave through the three poles...

75
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,889
- in a zigzag pattern.
- In a zigzag pattern.

76
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,890
(Section 1: The zigzag pattern)

77
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:21,499
Then pass through the halfway point.

78
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,999
(Section 2: The halfway point)

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,320
Do you see the hurdle over there?

80
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,740
The member on top must go over the hurdle.

81
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,299
He can then return to the starting point and pull the flag.

82
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,840
- He must jump over the hurdle?
- Yes.

83
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,740
- Okay. But...
- All right.

84
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,579
If you successfully complete the mission,

85
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,510
I'll give you a crucial hint.

86
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,050
All right.

87
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,279
So this guy...

88
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,656
(Helper Joon must prevent them from succeeding.)

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,019
So we must separate Joon and Sae Ho.

90
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,089
- Yes. Right.
- That way...

91
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,059
- Listen. Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

92
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,389
- Jong Min, - Come on.

93
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,729
- Sae Ho, Se Yoon...
- You know what?

94
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,829
Let's figure out who Hungry Lupin is.

95
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,059
- Let's focus on winning first.
- Yes.

96
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,499
- Let's come up with a strategy.
- We must win first.

97
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,799
First of all, I want DinDin to be on top.

98
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,269
- Okay. I agree with that.
- Let's say...

99
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,070
we do everything right,

100
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,899
- but if he loses his balance, - Right.

101
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,640
- Then I'm Hungry Lupin.
- Right.

102
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,039
- I agree. Then I'm Hungry Lupin.
- Let's do that.

103
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,670
- Let's do this right for DinDin.
- Yes.

104
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,239
Why are you framing me?

105
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,909
- Seriously. I'm a citizen.
- Listen.

106
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,410
Jong Min could've sacrificed himself when he's Hungry Lupin.

107
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,749
- Jong Min...
- Me?

108
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,449
Would never leave when we were getting eels for lunch.

109
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,930
- Really?
- I could've gotten a bite.

110
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,420
Everyone, it was a done deal that I was going to get a bite.

111
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,319
Then I could've gotten the citron tea too.

112
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,919
(Sae Ho brings up the possibility Jong Min could've staged it.)

113
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,929
Can we hurry up?

114
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,889
- I'm as tall as Sae Ho now.
- Let's do it.

115
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,029
(I'm as tall as Sae Ho now.)

116
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,329
- Can we hurry up?
- Let's hurry up.

117
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,569
- Did you come up with a strategy?
- Okay. Let's go.

118
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,240
- Doing nothing is already tiring.
- Hey.

119
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,899
This is going to take a long time.

120
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,439
- Yes, it won't be easy.
- How...

121
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,246
And the first one must hurry up and come to the front.

122
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,009
If you can, put your head...

123
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,279
right on each other's bottom like we're playing buck buck.

124
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,680
Gosh, that's not pretty to look at.

125
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,520
Gosh, I hate this. Seriously.

126
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,090
We'll begin now.

127
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,820
Get ready,

128
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,420
- set...
- Gosh.

129
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,529
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

130
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,130
- This is good, right?
- Are you okay?

131
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,699
- This is good. Yes.
- Really?

132
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,030
This is good, right?

133
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,599
There's no way I'll fall off. Wait. Give me a second.

134
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,030
Yes. I'm good. Wait.

135
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,600
That's your microphone. Wait.

136
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,040
- I'm good.
- No, but I'm not good.

137
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,439
Are you good on my back?

138
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,010
I'm not on your back yet. Wait.

139
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,639
Seon Ho, wait.

140
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,009
(Taking it out on him)

141
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,019
Get closer. Wait. I'm not ready yet.

142
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,180
- Could you come closer? Okay.
- I must go over there.

143
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,419
- Gosh, that's huge. Wait.
- This is... Hey.

144
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,689
Gosh, that's huge. Wait.

145
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,160
Joon, don't move.

146
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,420
(Screaming)

147
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,830
- Hold on. That hurts a lot.
- Don't overreact.

148
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,990
(That's too much.)

149
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:33,999
Okay. We're good.

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,906
- Okay. We got it.
- Everyone, if we can keep it up...

151
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,029
(The helper lets him pass not to get caught.)

152
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,099
Everyone,

153
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,139
- if we can keep it up, - We got it.

154
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
- we can't fail.
- Okay.

155
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,769
- Seon Ho is coming over.
- Where?

156
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,939
- Okay.
- You're the most reliable one.

157
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,300
- So I'll say here.
- Okay. Great.

158
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,439
- I'm fine.
- DinDin, where should I go?

159
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,249
- I'm fine.
- Go in front of Jong Min.

160
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,349
- Stay in front of him?
- Yes.

161
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,626
- It should be diagonal.
- It should be slightly diagonal.

162
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,119
- I'm fine.
- Is this good?

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,600
- Yes, that's good.
- Okay. Let's go.

164
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Here I go.

165
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:59,149
(Moving forward)

166
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,220
- Sae Ho, you're good.
- I'm good.

167
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,760
(Sae Ho, the prime suspect, is holding up well.)

168
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,359
I'm good. What about me?

169
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,729
- Wait.
- Should I lie down somewhere?

170
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,930
- Wait.
- No! I'm not okay.

171
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,199
Wait.

172
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,970
- We can totally do this.
- Are we good?

173
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,870
Wait, Jong Min.

174
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,239
- Seon Ho, wait.
- Okay.

175
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,870
(DinDin passes through safely despite the commotion.)

176
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,440
(It's going smoothly.)

177
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,380
We can totally do this.

178
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,250
(He checks how far they've come.)

179
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,549
(Stalling for time)

180
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,719
Joon keeps acting weird.

181
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,619
- What's wrong with him?
- Joon keeps acting weird.

182
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,119
Hurry up. I'm getting stuck here.

183
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,489
Just don't step on the middle.

184
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,259
- Wait.
- Yes. Step on that spot.

185
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,390
Yes. I'm good.

186
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,899
I'm 99.98 percent certain...

187
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,530
that Joon is the helper.

188
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,646
You'd better wish you don't get caught.

189
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,840
How dare you banish me?

190
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,570
Wait. I'm settled in now.

191
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Okay.

192
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,340
Where should I go next? Tell me where to go.

193
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,950
We must pass over the halfway point.

194
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,750
I tried to get him to fall.

195
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,680
But he didn't.

196
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,879
Since we were crawling on the mudflat,

197
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,590
I was going to make him fall off while I pretended to grab him.

198
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,119
(Hungry Lupin is making his move.)

199
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,440
Think of it as getting a massage.

200
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,120
Hey! My gosh.

201
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,390
- Wait.
- Okay.

202
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:13,071
- Seon Ho has to hang in there.
- Se Yoon, move back a little more.

203
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,230
Hold on.

204
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,829
(They're turning at the halfway point.)

205
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,870
- Great.
- Gosh.

206
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,540
(Gosh, this is killing me.)

207
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,939
- Jong Min, wait.
- Okay.

208
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,310
We'll succeed no matter what.

209
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,050
(Jong Min is especially being more dramatic during this mission.)

210
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,320
Hey.

211
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,249
(Is he making a fist?)

212
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,349
Go.

213
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,519
(He gets up while leaning on DinDin's side.)

214
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,090
- Go.
- Wait.

215
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
It's so far.

216
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:44,590
- Hey. He's tired.
- That's so far.

217
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,559
Wait. Okay.

218
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,629
- Hey, over there.
- Okay.

219
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,500
(Leaving a gap on purpose)

220
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,899
- Gosh.
- Hold on.

221
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,970
- Wait.
- Okay.

222
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,239
Hey. That's...

223
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,969
- Wait.
- Okay.

224
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,610
- There's mud on your clothes.
- Sorry.

225
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,079
(That was close.)

226
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,250
- DinDin.
- Yes.

227
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,270
At this rate, I'll be under the hurdle.

228
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,980
- Se Yoon must go to the hurdle.
- Go and lie down horizontally.

229
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,289
- Where?
- Come on. Hurry up.

230
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,920
(Hurry up and go, please.)

231
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,219
- Here I come.
- Go.

232
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,359
(He goes on top of Sae Ho's back.)

233
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
We can do this.

234
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,529
- My gosh. It's getting muddy.
- I'm sorry.

235
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,089
- Look at my face. Gosh.
- Sorry. Mud won't get on your face.

236
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,860
(Sae Ho is leaving a gap?)

237
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,070
(Is that the same trick as Helper Joon's?)

238
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,840
(Slippery)

239
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,010
(He could have fallen off.)

240
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,840
My gut tells me it's Sae Ho.

241
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,540
For some reason, he kept placing himself in a weird spot.

242
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,810
(Their suspicion of Sae Ho grows.)

243
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,680
(They arrive at the hurdle.)

244
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,850
Did you go?

245
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,419
(All of a sudden, Jong Min's body is shaking a lot.)

246
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,720
Wait.

247
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,030
Wait.

248
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,729
(He escapes from the crisis by latching on Seon Ho's hair.)

249
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,299
You totally saved me.

250
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
- Really?
- You totally saved me.

251
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
- Okay.
- My gosh.

252
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,800
- I almost fell.
- No!

253
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,370
(No!)

254
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:02,599
(But isn't this a good thing?)

255
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,609
- Let's go. Get up.
- No!

256
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,870
You must get up.

257
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,679
(But now, Hungry Lupin is in a crisis.)

258
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,150
- Get up now.
- Get up.

259
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,449
- Hang in there a little longer.
- Okay.

260
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,720
- I got this.
- Hang in there.

261
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,179
(They're close to the finish line.)

262
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,579
(To Hungry Lupin, this is his last chance!)

263
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,850
You must get up now.

264
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,389
(Now, who's going to show strange behaviors?)

265
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,819
- This is the last one.
- Hey.

266
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,359
Grab it. Just don't grab the bony part.

267
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,490
Okay. Great.

268
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,729
- Great. It's going well now.
- Come over to my back fast.

269
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,829
(He successfully climbs over the hurdle.)

270
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,429
- Great. Go.
- Hey, this is our last one.

271
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,439
Hey. Wait.

272
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,840
- Hey. This is good.
- Hooray!

273
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,170
- Hey.
- Hooray!

274
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,409
(He suddenly screams, "Hooray," three times...)

275
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,780
(with his arms up right before completing the mission.)

276
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,349
(Why is he suddenly doing this here?)

277
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,780
Hey, you ungrateful child.

278
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,549
- We're almost there.
- Hurry up.

279
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,650
We can do this.

280
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,989
- We're almost there.
- My gosh. This is killing me.

281
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,159
Joon, we're almost there.

282
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,660
Joon, no funny tricks.

283
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,890
- Gosh, why...
- No funny tricks.

284
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,770
Why do you keep scolding me? Why is everyone on my case?

285
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,729
Why...

286
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,899
(Slow)

287
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,600
Okay. I got it. That's...

288
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,069
(Meanwhile, Sae Ho...)

289
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,910
(shoves his face into Jong Min's bottom.)

290
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,779
(Getting ambushed)

291
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,779
We're almost there. Joon, you're the last one.

292
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,780
(DinDin)

293
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:20,549
- We got this.
- We got it in the bag.

294
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,619
(Moving forward)

295
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,019
- What was that?
- I can't see anything.

296
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,290
Get on your fours.

297
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,819
We got it in the bag. There's no way I'll fall now.

298
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,289
Gosh, that's a big stone. Wait.

299
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,360
(Then the helper is in front of the flag.)

300
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,329
(What will Joon decide to do?)

301
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,659
You know what? Whoever messes up now...

302
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,069
- That hurts so much. Wait.
- must be Hungry Lupin.

303
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,230
Hold on.

304
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,599
- Gosh.
- Wait.

305
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,270
- Se Yoon.
- Okay. Go ahead.

306
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,569
Hey, I can't do it.

307
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,639
No, you must hang in there.

308
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,809
I can't do it.

309
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,209
(Crawling awkwardly)

310
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,409
- You must hurry.
- Hurry up.

311
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,479
- Wait. Joon is acting weird!
- Wait.

312
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,649
- What do you mean?
- Hurry up!

313
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,650
- What are you doing?
- Joon.

314
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,979
- I can't do this.
- Wait.

315
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,019
- Go ahead.
- I can't do it.

316
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,749
- Put your head down.
- It has to be Joon, 100 percent.

317
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,049
- What are you doing?
- It has to be Joon.

318
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,989
- Why is there a huge gap?
- It has to be him, 100 percent.

319
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,159
(Being a helper is hard.)

320
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,196
- Joon is acting weird.
- It has to be him, 100 percent.

321
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,529
- Have you lost your mind?
- Seon Ho.

322
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,689
- Help me.
- Have you lost your mind?

323
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,790
- Go.
- Seon Ho.

324
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,199
- Go ahead.
- Se Yoon.

325
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,400
- You're acting weird.
- It has to be him, 100 percent.

326
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,940
- Okay.
- We got it, right?

327
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
- Hey, I figured out who it is.
- All right.

328
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,739
- I figured it out.
- It has to be Joon, 100 percent.

329
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

330
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:20,279
He's acting so weird. All of a sudden...

331
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,779
- Hey.
- Why me?

332
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,420
- It has to be Joon, 100 percent.
- Wait.

333
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,420
How would you score the assistance from your helper?

334
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,680
- Thirty points.
- Thirty points.

335
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,619
This was really tough on me.

336
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,659
(This was really tough on me.)

337
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,890
It has to be Joon.

338
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,330
His pose was off the whole time.

339
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,530
- I didn't want to put my head down.
- One, two...

340
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,859
- Everyone.
- Nice timing.

341
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,129
You completed Mudflat Impossible.

342
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,900
- Okay.
- Give us the hint.

343
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,870
You completed the mission.

344
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,139
I'll give you a hint...

345
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,940
about Hungry Lupin.

346
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,530
Will we find out about the helper?

347
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,009
You're only interested in finding out who the helper is.

348
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,010
- Jong Min.
- All right.

349
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,050
This was the first hint.

350
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,249
Hungry Lupin's eyes and mouth looked funny.

351
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,489
His nose was triangle-shaped. And he looked like a bear.

352
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,789
A little kid said that.

353
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,959
This time,

354
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,619
I'll let you listen to AI's analysis of Hungry Lupin's face.

355
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,989
- AI's analysis of his face?
- Yes.

356
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,690
You'll only hear it once.

357
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,829
Listen carefully, and we must memorize it.

358
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,900
We must get closer.

359
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,129
Here we go.

360
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,629
Focus. Be quiet.

361
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,216
(The last piece of information about Hungry Lupin)

362
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,570
Here it goes.

363
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,970
Be quiet.

364
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,040
His eyes have a slight upward slant.

365
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,439
- When he smiles, - Isn't this Sae Ho?

366
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,639
There are natural wrinkles around his eyes.

367
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,109
He looks energetic and easygoing.

368
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,110
My gosh.

369
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:35,650
These wrinkles are shown only with a genuine smile.

370
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,889
It's likely that...

371
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,220
he expresses his feelings openly.

372
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,819
- What if it's a hallucination?
- He has a wide mouth.

373
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,760
Both corners of his lips are slightly slanted upward.

374
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,700
When he smiles, his cheekbones are raised.

375
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,200
His face overall lights up.

376
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,870
People with his face are active,

377
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,670
have a big heart,

378
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,010
and wear their heart on their sleeve.

379
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,310
On the other side, he's cheerful.

380
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,409
But deep down, he's the type...

381
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,826
- to think over things.
- It's Sae Ho.

382
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,880
- Gosh.
- It's him.

383
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,526
- Sae Ho, who do you think it is?
- Gosh.

384
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,619
- Sae Ho, can you smile?
- Sae Ho.

385
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
Smile.

386
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,749
- Around your eyes...
- Your cheekbones are raised.

387
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,089
- All right.
- You have eye wrinkles.

388
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,449
- Let me clarify this.
- Your jaw is angular.

389
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,996
- Who do you think it is?
- Right now...

390
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,689
That's the perfect description of Sae Ho's face.

391
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,410
I was surprised when I was listening to it.

392
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,490
Even I was surprised.

393
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,430
All right. Listen to me carefully.

394
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,230
I'm not it.

395
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,339
- Hear me out. Let me finish.
- I don't think it's you.

396
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,340
- It's not you. Go ahead.
- I'm serious.

397
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,340
It sometimes happens unintentionally.

398
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,210
People with similar facial features have wrinkles when they smile.

399
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,479
- I have eye wrinkles when I smile.
- You have so many of them.

400
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,810
But it's not me.

401
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,449
- All right.
- Who is it then?

402
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,720
- It's Jong Min.
- But Jong Min...

403
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,119
If he were Hungry Lupin,

404
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,449
the helper wouldn't have sent him away.

405
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,160
Jong Min isn't Hungry Lupin even though he has wrinkles.

406
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,559
- Besides, - He can't be.

407
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,659
He doesn't think over things.

408
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,959
Look at my jawline too.

409
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,429
It became crooked after I fell from a rooftop.

410
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,029
Right. His nose is crooked too.

411
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,976
- Listen. If you think about it...
- What did it say?

412
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,299
Why are you suspecting me?

413
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,180
If you're that frustrated because it's not you,

414
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,110
you would do anything to clear your name.

415
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,070
- Can you do a headspin here?
- I can do it.

416
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,339
- Show it to us.
- I'll show you.

417
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,410
Really?

418
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,379
Do it then. I'll believe you if you can do it.

419
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,809
- You...
- We won't pick you then.

420
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,309
- We won't pick you. Seriously.
- Seriously?

421
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,609
I might not be able to do the headspin.

422
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,879
- But I'll stick my head in.
- Okay. Do it.

423
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,356
- Come on.
- Do it if you feel wronged.

424
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,849
- Say, "I'm innocent, guys."
- Come on. No way.

425
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,019
- It's not there?
- For real?

426
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,020
My gosh.

427
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,660
(Feeling wronged)

428
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,029
- For real?
- My gosh.

429
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,500
(Looking indifferent)

430
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,769
(Expressing his frustration with his body)

431
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,930
I can't spin, though.

432
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,129
(Looking utterly messy)

433
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,810
- You try it.
- If you're really innocent,

434
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,599
can you cover your face with mud?

435
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,710
My gosh. Come on.

436
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,770
How many times must I tell you it's not me?

437
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,880
- Come on.
- Do you think you can do that?

438
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,280
Okay.

439
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,080
It's not me!

440
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,130
- The culprit is Cho Sae Ho!
- Cho Sae Ho!

441
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,849
- This is driving me crazy.
- Yes, we caught Hungry Lupin!

442
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,650
I'm not Hungry Lupin!

443
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,250
(Laughing)

444
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,589
We got him!

445
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,090
- We got him.
- You little...

446
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,859
- What?
- Are you Hungry Lupin?

447
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,860
Sure.

448
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,199
(His attempt to do a headspin only leads to disappointment.)

449
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,840
(Throwing mud on his face was pointless.)

450
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,730
This is killing me.

451
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,200
This is so annoying!

452
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,540
(Laughing)

453
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,579
(Is Sae Ho really frustrated because he's innocent?)

454
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,680
It's not me.

455
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,009
(Or is he just a splendid actor?)

456
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,249
- He's coming at us.
- I told you it wasn't me.

457
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,850
Hey, he's creating a scene now.

458
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,649
- Your acting is authentic.
- Who's Hungry Lupin?

459
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,090
It's convincing. Calm down.

460
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,959
It's not me!

461
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,260
(Is Sae Ho really Hungry Lupin?)

462
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,290
- Jong Min picked up a gun.
- Where?

463
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,159
(He stumbles across a gun-shaped stone.)

464
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,730
Who's the helper?

465
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,769
You just need to find the helper.

466
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,300
- It's the gun from our last trip.
- From our last trip.

467
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,839
He's not interested in arresting Hungry Lupin.

468
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,970
I'm not.

469
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,539
I'll only look for the helper.

470
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,049
All right. Everyone, we'll head over to the base camp.

471
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,149
At the base camp, you'll have a chance to arrest Hungry Lupin.

472
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,150
- By the way, - Yes.

473
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:55,219
- I have one last question.
- Sure.

474
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,900
- I'm not asking out of suspicion.
- Okay.

475
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,550
- Can the helper...
- Okay.

476
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,490
Send Hungry Lupin away?

477
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,630
Let's say Jong Min is Hungry Lupin.

478
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,359
"Send me away. I'll be away for a bit."

479
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,499
- They strategized?
- He could send...

480
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,629
Hungry Lupin away, right?

481
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,529
Of course. That's possible.

482
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,829
- Theoretically, it is.
- But...

483
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,640
Jong Min isn't the type to do that.

484
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,546
When I was listening to the facial description,

485
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,340
I kept picturing Jong Min in my head.

486
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,140
- I bet.
- Do a headspin for your innocence.

487
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,550
By the way, who are you? Why are you here?

488
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,420
- Why are you filming with us?
- We're shooting a TV show.

489
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,919
- Who are you?
- I'm Red Clay General.

490
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,690
- You're Red Clay General. I see.
- Yes.

491
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,519
Let's go to the base camp and see...

492
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,819
- if you can arrest Hungry Lupin.
- Sae Ho, you look like...

493
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,919
- a foreigner.
- Really?

494
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Yes.

495
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:37,889
How many times must I tell you it's not me?

496
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,250
(10 minutes before their attempt at arresting Hungry Lupin)

497
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,629
(There won't be any more hints.)

498
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,299
As soon as we arrive at the base camp, we'll begin.

499
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,329
- We must arrest him.
- We must catch him.

500
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,569
I'll give you time to arrest Hungry Lupin.

501
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,499
It's pretty much settled that the culprits are Joon and Sae Ho.

502
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,539
- Come on.
- Right.

503
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,239
(The first suspect, Sae Ho)

504
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,769
- Listen.
- The moment we got to the mudflat,

505
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,810
Sae Ho suddenly approached Joon in a sneaky way.

506
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,849
(As AI's analysis of Hungry Lupin's face...)

507
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,250
(showed a high resemblance to Sae Ho's face, )

508
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,320
(he became a prime suspect right away.)

509
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,289
(The first hint was that he looked like a bear.)

510
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,289
(That included Sae Ho as the suspect.)

511
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,090
- Can I provide my counter argument?
- Sure.

512
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,860
Hungry Lupin...

513
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,129
(The second suspect, DinDin)

514
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,169
DinDin.

515
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,439
(DinDin made a mistake which wasn't like him.)

516
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,339
DinDin kept assigning us our spots.

517
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,470
- Right.
- Yes.

518
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,739
(He acted like a leader in all of the missions.)

519
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,740
Think about DinDin's track record.

520
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,650
He usually goes all out for games like this.

521
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,649
If it's not Joon and Sae Ho, it has to be these two.

522
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,819
- Right.
- Yes.

523
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,090
(The third suspect, Jong Min)

524
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,890
(Jong Min was banished without knowing why.)

525
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,500
Let's say Jong Min is Hungry Lupin...

526
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,030
- and he picks Joon.
- Joon...

527
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,806
Then Joon sends Jong Min away all of a sudden.

528
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,999
Why won't you tell me why?

529
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,360
Jong Min's like, "Why did he send me away?"

530
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,469
So he's trying to divert attention by acting angry.

531
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,470
I'll give you that. Let's say that...

532
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,570
you're actually doing the opposite.

533
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,409
"Anyway, I'm not Hungry Lupin. I'm just his helper."

534
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,579
I thought, "Is he trying to confuse us or complicate this?"

535
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,861
I thought of every option, but nothing really made sense.

536
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,550
I'm not Hungry Lupin.

537
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,279
If you pick me,

538
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,019
the citizens won't be able to eat dinner. I swear.

539
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,149
You do look so frustrated.

540
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,459
- I'm telling the truth.
- No.

541
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,259
Don't trust DinDin.

542
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,189
No. Remember that Sae Ho's career peaked...

543
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,860
when people got the wrong idea about him.

544
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,930
- He's good at acting frustrated.
- Everyone.

545
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,599
It looked like an egg yolk.

546
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes, the egg yolk.

547
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:28,639
We're fighting over this...

548
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,899
- for hours today.
- This is exhausting.

549
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,860
- We've been fighting since 7am.
- This is crazy.

550
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,110
You've got yourself a faithful dog.

551
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,409
- Really?
- What a faithful dog.

552
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,879
(They arrive at the base camp.)

553
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,250
You will now get a chance to arrest...

554
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,720
Hungry Lupin who stole your dinner.

555
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,220
- Okay.
- All right.

556
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,720
Do we just point at him?

557
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,830
- Why are you excluding me?
- Hey.

558
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,059
- This is so annoying.
- Let me say this.

559
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,799
Don't fall for DinDin's sweet talk.

560
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,999
- Seon Ho, especially you.
- He's making them join him.

561
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,369
If you do, DinDin will happily get to enjoy his dinner.

562
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,499
But you won't get to eat.

563
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,469
DinDin has always been cool in my eyes.

564
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,639
- If...
- I...

565
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,840
- you two...
- Fight it out.

566
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,079
Talk it out, fight, and join our side,

567
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,779
- the helper...
- You...

568
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,450
- will get some food.
- You're ruining your chance.

569
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,189
Se Yoon and Jong Min...

570
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,420
- Yes.
- You know...

571
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,659
- Yes.
- They could be Hungry Lupin.

572
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,819
He didn't want to be the helper.

573
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,329
- Right.
- It wasn't your choice.

574
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,459
- I...
- Right. He chose Joon...

575
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,629
because they joined the show together.

576
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,059
- I'm the helper.
- Here's what I think.

577
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,330
- What?
- I'm...

578
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,999
- I'm the helper.
- Listen to me.

579
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,429
- Who made you the helper?
- I didn't want to be the helper.

580
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,200
- Who made you the helper?
- He did.

581
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,669
(Flustered)

582
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,640
- This is getting worse for him.
- It was Sae Ho.

583
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,310
Let me say this.

584
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,340
- Can they rescue me?
- Hold on.

585
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,840
Can they rescue me?

586
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,449
- We can't do that.
- We...

587
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,809
- What?
- We can't do that.

588
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,149
- We can help you out.
- We'll give you a bite.

589
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,319
- We can help you.
- Wait.

590
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,849
- I...
- He's coming clean now.

591
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,019
- You see, Joon is...
- My gosh.

592
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,319
- He's a hardworking guy.
- I... Listen.

593
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,920
Let me just say this.

594
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,430
When we began our mission today,

595
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,059
I wasn't Hungry Lupin.

596
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,330
I honestly did my best for all the games...

597
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,569
and stayed focused.

598
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,670
- But...
- I'm not sure...

599
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,640
if this guy is Hungry Lupin or the helper.

600
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,299
He's acting weird right now.

601
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,086
- Make a wise decision.
- Then are you the helper?

602
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,509
I'm neither the helper nor Hungry Lupin.

603
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,079
- Sae Ho.
- I'm nobody.

604
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,379
Are you crying?

605
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,380
- I'm serious.
- Is he crying over this game?

606
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,919
- But...
- Don't fall for his act.

607
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,579
- Is he really crying over this?
- Seon Ho.

608
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,949
- I'm serious.
- Why do you only call my name?

609
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,589
- I feel bad.
- You need to trust me.

610
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,420
That way, we can grow our group.

611
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,619
- By the way...
- You...

612
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,160
You're a crook.

613
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,129
- He's really a crook.
- Let me ask you something.

614
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,129
Since you've confessed...

615
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,570
- But I didn't confess anything.
- You shared your opinion.

616
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,240
Joon just said that he was the helper.

617
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,369
Does the helper know who Hungry Lupin is?

618
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,609
- He doesn't, does he?
- Why wouldn't he know?

619
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,709
- The helper...
- Of course he knows.

620
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,109
- Hungry Lupin gave him the order.
- He doesn't know.

621
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,439
Hungry Lupin picked the helper.

622
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,849
- Right, but...
- So he has to know.

623
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,409
I don't think Joon knows who it is.

624
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,709
I'm not Hungry Lupin,

625
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,250
but he's saying that it's me.

626
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,719
- The helper knows who it is.
- If he does,

627
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,519
Joon is acting very strange right now.

628
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Joon.

629
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,859
Did I ask you for help?

630
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,119
- Your food...
- Did I pick you as the helper?

631
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,360
- About your food...
- You did.

632
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,660
He's out of his mind.

633
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,160
Hey.

634
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,729
I'm not Hungry Lupin.

635
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,469
How could I pick you as the helper?

636
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,870
It's okay.

637
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,439
- We'll protect you.
- He's weird.

638
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,739
- We'll protect you.
- You're on our team now.

639
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,740
- Hey.
- Joon.

640
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:19,640
Seon Ho, do you really trust DinDin?

641
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,779
- My goodness.
- Joon, you're on our team now.

642
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,910
- That's enough.
- People are crazy today.

643
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,149
- Everyone is crazy.
- He's out of his mind.

644
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,379
- What's wrong with him?
- "Crazy?"

645
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,519
- Wait.
- Hey, you.

646
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,549
- When did I make you the helper?
- Sae Ho.

647
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,990
I understand that you're frustrated.

648
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,390
What did he tell you to do?

649
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,819
- Feel free to tell us.
- Joon, you're on our team.

650
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,889
- We'll protect you.
- Right.

651
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,459
Sae Ho and I didn't discuss beforehand.

652
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,000
- You didn't discuss?
- No.

653
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,129
When did I... He's ridiculous.

654
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,869
- Let him talk first.
- Okay, go ahead.

655
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,669
We'll let him talk.

656
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,099
It was a hard decision to make, so let's clap for him.

657
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,339
- Right.
- Thank you for telling us.

658
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,340
All right.

659
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:54,009
- DinDin must know.
- How?

660
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,410
When I was picked as the helper,

661
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,550
- I couldn't help but shout.
- Okay.

662
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,249
(The moment when he was picked as the helper)

663
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,250
(Why did he pick me?)

664
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,350
(Joon talked very loudly.)

665
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,819
- Weren't you nearby?
- Yes.

666
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,136
- You heard me shout, right?
- Yes.

667
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,760
I didn't want to be the helper.

668
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,659
- Really?
- So I am the helper.

669
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,829
So you shouted out loud?

670
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,500
And were you told...

671
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,340
that I was Hungry Lupin?

672
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,109
Is that what they told you?

673
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,539
Wait a minute.

674
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,810
Sae Ho is going very far. Maybe he's telling the truth.

675
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,880
Joon just confessed that he was the helper.

676
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,279
We might be able to convince him...

677
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,720
to tell us who Hungry Lupin is.

678
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,249
He should know that I'm not Hungry Lupin.

679
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,689
You have three more minutes.

680
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,389
Se Yoon, I'll listen to you.

681
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,519
- Who do you think it is?
- Gosh.

682
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,189
Seeing how serious he is...

683
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,229
- Wait a minute.
- Either he's very good at acting...

684
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,290
You know what?

685
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,799
A chill ran down my spine.

686
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,529
- Right, it feels strange.
- So I'll tell you one thing.

687
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,870
You guys are being ridiculous.

688
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,840
What did you just say to me?

689
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,980
I said that I trust you. I agree with your opinion.

690
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,910
Seon Ho hasn't done much today. Don't you think so?

691
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,149
You will be totally wrong if you're going to suspect me.

692
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,179
Also,

693
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,479
he lost the game.

694
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,950
He got suspected for that.

695
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,789
When we suspected him,

696
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,389
Seon Ho should've denied it like DinDin.

697
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,089
Suddenly, he said, "I have no idea."

698
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,760
"I'll listen to what you say."

699
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,689
That's strange. There's enough evidence...

700
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,430
to suspect you.

701
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,329
- What gave me the chills was...
- Joon.

702
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,630
Are you the helper?

703
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,129
(Is he still asking Joon if he's the helper?)

704
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,199
- Me? Yes.
- Yes.

705
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,739
Really? Then you must know who Hungry Lupin is.

706
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,940
It's you.

707
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,910
He's also accusing me.

708
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,479
- But I...
- He's accusing me too.

709
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,579
Be careful, Seon Ho.

710
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,709
- Be careful of Joon.
- It's not me.

711
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,010
Joon is accusing me, but I have no idea what he's saying.

712
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,050
If you think that it's unfair,

713
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,979
could you take off your pants?

714
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,690
Of course I can.

715
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,520
However, my underwear won't be pleasant to look at.

716
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,890
- Everyone.
- Yes?

717
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,089
Please get ready to decide.

718
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,229
(Time to determine Hungry Lupin)

719
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,259
- All right.
- Have you decided?

720
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Yes.

721
00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:57,529
- We made our decision.
- Please point out...

722
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,629
- who Hungry Lupin is.
- My goodness.

723
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,500
Hungry Lupin is...

724
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,040
- you, Sae Ho.
- It's you, Sae Ho.

725
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
It's him.

726
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:05,339
(It's you, Sae Ho.)

727
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,340
I think it's Seon Ho.

728
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:08,461
- Se Yoon, it's really not me.
- All right, everyone.

729
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,949
- It's not me.
- I'll reveal the helper first.

730
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,079
Isn't Joon the helper?

731
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,609
- Who is it?
- Joon has to be the helper.

732
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,719
Maybe it's not him.

733
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Hungry Lupin's helper is...

734
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,219
- It's Joon.
- Joon.

735
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,289
- See?
- It's him.

736
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,319
- We caught him.
- We got it.

737
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,329
How dare you make me fall behind?

738
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,730
(How dare you make me fall behind?)

739
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,829
(And...)

740
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,630
What did I tell you?

741
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,570
It's DinDin.

742
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,629
(Did the helper confess the truth?)

743
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,899
Let's listen.

744
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,239
We're one team.

745
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,270
Everyone.

746
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,209
I will reveal who Hungry Lupin is.

747
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,679
(Sighing)

748
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,450
You pointed out Sae Ho as Hungry Lupin.

749
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,080
(DinDin who's anxious)

750
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,290
(Jong Min who's smiling)

751
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,520
(Seon Ho who's relaxed)

752
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,159
Is he Hungry Lupin?

753
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,459
- Is he?
- Is he?

754
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,100
(Is Cho Sae Ho Hungry Lupin?)

755
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,511
Is Sae Ho Hungry Lupin?

756
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:05,866
- Is he?
- Is he?

757
00:25:07,136 --> 00:25:08,206
He is...

758
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:10,606
He's not.

759
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,645
- I knew that it was him.
- It's not me. I promise.

760
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,646
(They failed to arrest Hungry Lupin.)

761
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,986
How many times did I tell you?

762
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:19,285
- Wasn't I right?
- Why did you create confusion?

763
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:21,386
He didn't know all this time. Close your mouth.

764
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:23,185
- Then is it DinDin?
- I have no idea.

765
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:24,285
I didn't act suspicious at all.

766
00:25:24,286 --> 00:25:25,755
I'll tell you who Hungry Lupin is.

767
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:27,295
- It's him.
- Could you please line up?

768
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,196
- I told you that it was him.
- Hey!

769
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:30,865
- Everyone, line up.
- It's you, isn't it?

770
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,996
- Why you... How could you?
- You pig.

771
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,295
- You pig, isn't it you?
- Isn't it you?

772
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:36,765
- Everyone.
- Pig? Isn't it you?

773
00:25:36,766 --> 00:25:37,835
Please take one step back.

774
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,235
- This is crazy. Who is it?
- Did you see him?

775
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:41,035
His eyes were trembling at the last moment.

776
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:42,675
- Everyone.
- This is insane.

777
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:43,975
It has to be Seon Ho.

778
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,246
- Is it Jong Min?
- The real Hungry Lupin is...

779
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,516
Everyone, please close your eyes.

780
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:50,246
- Gosh.
- I won't close my eyes.

781
00:25:51,686 --> 00:25:53,986
- Why would I close my eyes?
- I'm sorry, Sae Ho.

782
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,615
- Why would I close them?
- I'm sorry.

783
00:25:55,616 --> 00:25:56,755
- Close your eyes.
- That's strange.

784
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:57,985
- Okay.
- I didn't know.

785
00:25:57,986 --> 00:25:59,795
- I won't say anything yet.
- I won't either.

786
00:25:59,796 --> 00:26:00,856
Okay.

787
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,096
- It has to be 1 of these 3.
- All right.

788
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:05,765
- What's going on here?
- I told you that it was Seon Ho.

789
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:07,065
- Seon Ho is good at hiding.
- Goodness.

790
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,395
I have a hunch.

791
00:26:08,396 --> 00:26:10,135
- My gosh.
- It's not me.

792
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:11,306
Just wait and see.

793
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:13,152
- The rest of you, close your eyes.
- This is...

794
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:15,636
- It's not me. It's Se Yoon.
- Why didn't you get angry?

795
00:26:16,346 --> 00:26:17,506
All right.

796
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,076
Now, the real Hungry Lupin.

797
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:21,816
It's Seon Ho.

798
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:24,015
Take one step forward.

799
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,885
(Take one step forward.)

800
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:27,956
All right.

801
00:26:28,216 --> 00:26:29,785
(Tightening)

802
00:26:29,786 --> 00:26:30,826
Everyone.

803
00:26:33,356 --> 00:26:34,626
Open your eyes.

804
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:36,295
What did I tell you?

805
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:40,535
(The shocking identity of Hungry Lupin)

806
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:41,896
Open your eyes.

807
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:43,535
What did I tell you?

808
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:45,966
(Kim Jong Min?)

809
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:48,805
(Taking a step forward quietly)

810
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:50,176
All right, everyone.

811
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,216
Open your eyes.

812
00:26:54,676 --> 00:26:55,815
What did I tell you?

813
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:59,045
(The real Hungry Lupin is Kim Jong Min.)

814
00:26:59,046 --> 00:27:00,355
(A big twist)

815
00:27:00,356 --> 00:27:01,356
All right.

816
00:27:02,116 --> 00:27:04,956
(Starting to punish him out of anger)

817
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:07,496
(Slapping)

818
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:09,225
I said...

819
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:10,265
(Underwear)

820
00:27:10,266 --> 00:27:12,326
I'm married.

821
00:27:13,436 --> 00:27:14,866
This is insane.

822
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:16,505
How dare you send me away?

823
00:27:16,506 --> 00:27:17,636
Me, of all people?

824
00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:19,265
- What did I tell you?
- Gosh.

825
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:21,006
He sent him away. What did I tell you?

826
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:23,075
His presence was creating confusion,

827
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:24,845
so he sent him away. Aren't I right?

828
00:27:24,846 --> 00:27:27,315
Right. To reduce the possibility of him getting caught,

829
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:28,916
I tried to hide him by moving him.

830
00:27:29,686 --> 00:27:31,216
When I got arrested, I was shocked.

831
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:32,816
How dare he send me away?

832
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,716
- Did you not expect it?
- Of course not.

833
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:37,586
Joon made a smart move.

834
00:27:38,186 --> 00:27:40,426
- Hungry Lupin.
- This is unbelievable.

835
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:42,355
Well done, Hungry Lupin. Thank you.

836
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,495
(We won.)

837
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,095
Sae Ho, I'm sorry.

838
00:27:46,096 --> 00:27:47,666
- He...
- Are you okay?

839
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,805
- Sae Ho.
- How many times did I tell you?

840
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:51,665
- Hey. I mean, - I'm sorry.

841
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,505
It wasn't me.

842
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,075
- Sae Ho, I'm sorry.
- Hey, Cheol.

843
00:27:55,076 --> 00:27:57,806
I didn't do a headspin in the mud for nothing.

844
00:27:58,306 --> 00:27:59,615
I even put mud on my face.

845
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,845
- I'm sorry.
- Seriously.

846
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,375
Sae Ho did a good job.

847
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:03,845
Even when I acted suspicious, everyone kept suspecting Sae Ho.

848
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:05,316
I was wondering why.

849
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,715
- Seriously.
- Goodness.

850
00:28:07,716 --> 00:28:10,856
If you had cleared the mission earlier,

851
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:12,285
this would have been a hint.

852
00:28:12,286 --> 00:28:13,455
- What is it?
- What could it be?

853
00:28:13,456 --> 00:28:15,425
"There's letter N in Hungry Lupin's name."

854
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:16,565
(Hint: There's letter N in Hungry Lupin's name.)

855
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:18,996
- There's no N in my name.
- Right.

856
00:28:19,226 --> 00:28:21,165
(Sae Ho is the only one without N in his name.)

857
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,105
With this hint, we would've eliminated Sae Ho.

858
00:28:23,106 --> 00:28:25,866
How many times did I tell you today...

859
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:27,605
that I wasn't it?

860
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,405
- Here is another hint.
- What is it?

861
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:31,576
His bite mark on the red bean jelly paste.

862
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:33,546
Right. These aren't Sae Ho's teeth.

863
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,516
Suddenly, I feel extremely sorry to Sae Ho.

864
00:28:36,586 --> 00:28:39,015
The looks he gave me were honest.

865
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:40,755
Usually, I lie often.

866
00:28:40,756 --> 00:28:42,596
For the first time today, I didn't lie at all.

867
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:45,255
I didn't lie at all today.

868
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,355
I'm serious.

869
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:47,555
Joon did an amazing job.

870
00:28:47,556 --> 00:28:50,125
Joon's decision to send Jong Min away was...

871
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:51,596
- Right.
- a stroke of genius.

872
00:28:51,826 --> 00:28:53,365
Did you guys discuss beforehand?

873
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,086
Of course. We even exchanged text messages.

874
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:57,965
We did everything.

875
00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:00,135
(We will reveal Hungry Lupin's hectic day.)

876
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:02,736
(We will reveal Hungry Lupin's hectic day.)

877
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:04,505
Am I getting breakfast?

878
00:29:04,506 --> 00:29:06,146
(Episode 1: The Birth of Hungry Lupin)

879
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:08,215
What's going on here?

880
00:29:08,216 --> 00:29:09,492
(He entered a cafe without knowing anything.)

881
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:11,146
What is this? What could it be?

882
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:13,715
What?

883
00:29:13,716 --> 00:29:14,915
(One card)

884
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:16,216
Jong Min,

885
00:29:16,726 --> 00:29:18,856
you stole the members' dinner.

886
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:21,895
You've been selected as Hungry Lupin.

887
00:29:21,896 --> 00:29:24,125
(Hungry Lupin)

888
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:26,796
Do I have to start acting again?

889
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:28,136
I will fool them.

890
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:29,865
(Making mistakes...)

891
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:31,005
(again and again)

892
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:32,566
You have to hit the head.

893
00:29:32,736 --> 00:29:35,406
I'm sorry, but please exclude Jong Min from this game.

894
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:38,645
He's unable to play a game like this.

895
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:40,552
(He got away with it thanks to his reputation for being dumb.)

896
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:42,986
Now, you will select one person as your helper.

897
00:29:43,886 --> 00:29:45,845
(Whom should I pick as the helper?)

898
00:29:45,846 --> 00:29:48,686
Sae Ho has been playing very seriously.

899
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:51,626
Or how about Seon Ho who is thoughtless?

900
00:29:52,286 --> 00:29:55,096
What about DinDin who is clever?

901
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:57,726
No, I will pick...

902
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:01,366
someone who's likely to be suspected.

903
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:05,636
Okay, everyone is suspecting him the most.

904
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,476
It's Joon on my team.

905
00:30:09,746 --> 00:30:12,576
(Helper Joon)

906
00:30:13,446 --> 00:30:15,576
This is such a great idea.

907
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:17,185
- Me?
- What?

908
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:18,786
(What's the matter?)

909
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:22,415
(He was taken away because of the helper.)

910
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:24,385
- What's the matter?
- He can't start...

911
00:30:24,386 --> 00:30:27,255
to get suspected by others.

912
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:28,596
So I removed him.

913
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:30,195
This is insane.

914
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:31,596
(At first, he couldn't understand.)

915
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:35,666
(He even won the game with unusual concentration.)

916
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,905
(The helper obtained the hint alone.)

917
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:41,406
(This is it!)

918
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:45,076
(He emphasized "bear" in the hint.)

919
00:30:45,646 --> 00:30:47,846
(The helper carried out a high-level diversion plan.)

920
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,436
Things are going according to my plan.

921
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,415
Point out Hungry Lupin...

922
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,356
who stole your dinner tonight.

923
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:59,056
(Hungry Lupin that we chose)

924
00:30:59,486 --> 00:31:01,756
(The final decision was Cho Sae Ho.)

925
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:04,525
(As he picked the right helper, )

926
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:06,696
(Hungry Lupin was excluded from the list of suspects.)

927
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:09,465
(He fooled all the citizens completely.)

928
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:10,966
This is insane.

929
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:14,275
(He committed the crime perfectly.)

930
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:15,475
Look at this.

931
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:17,796
(Secret communication between Hungry Lupin and the helper)

932
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:22,446
"Sacrifice yourself. Get caught. Make others accuse you."

933
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:24,046
"They're completely fooled."

934
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:25,346
"Master."

935
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:27,985
(The helper had completely bowed to him.)

936
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,725
"How dare you send me away? Your tactic is unusual."

937
00:31:29,726 --> 00:31:33,196
"If you get revealed, someone could suspect you."

938
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:35,425
"You're completely off from the list of suspects."

939
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,195
"People are accusing Se Yoon now."

940
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:38,725
- After I mentioned the bear...
- Did you keep reporting to him?

941
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:40,366
"It worked by 100 percent. Don't worry."

942
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:43,666
- He made a move to help me win.
- By the way,

943
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:46,166
Joon acted well. At the end...

944
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:48,405
(The helper's false confession confused everyone.)

945
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,375
He decided to reveal that he was the helper...

946
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,575
- and accuse Sae Ho.
- Exactly.

947
00:31:53,576 --> 00:31:54,746
That's what he was doing.

948
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:56,986
I heard for the first time that he was the helper.

949
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:59,646
I was like, "What?"

950
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:03,486
(The helper's arrogant lie)

951
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:04,785
You should've believed me.

952
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:05,786
- It wasn't Sae Ho.
- Even then,

953
00:32:05,787 --> 00:32:06,995
Se Yoon kept saying this.

954
00:32:06,996 --> 00:32:09,355
"All right. Hungry Lupin is definitely you."

955
00:32:09,356 --> 00:32:10,566
You kept accusing me.

956
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:12,865
- You kept saying that it was me.
- Are you acting DinDin?

957
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:14,396
- He was like...
- Is that DinDin?

958
00:32:15,536 --> 00:32:17,165
- "It's you."
- What about him?

959
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,166
(Unstoppable complaining about injustice)

960
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:19,536
- Hey.
- "It's you."

961
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:21,875
Se Yoon was also saying, "Sae Ho..."

962
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:24,005
- Is that me?
- "It's him."

963
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:25,045
And Seon Ho said,

964
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:26,146
"You're right."

965
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:27,776
"I think it's Sae Ho."

966
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,016
What was that all about?

967
00:32:29,276 --> 00:32:30,685
You must have felt wronged.

968
00:32:30,686 --> 00:32:32,216
I felt terrible from watching you.

969
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:35,285
You should've also lied. I had to suspect you...

970
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,126
- because your behavior was unusual.
- Sae Ho.

971
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,456
You're the one who ruined it.

972
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,225
It just shows what kind of person you've been so far.

973
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,395
It's the fate of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf."

974
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:43,496
All right, everyone.

975
00:32:43,966 --> 00:32:45,226
Unfortunately...

976
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:47,036
Let it all out.

977
00:32:48,596 --> 00:32:49,596
Let it all out.

978
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:54,835
(A harangue of anger)

979
00:32:54,836 --> 00:32:56,845
He must be so furious.

980
00:32:56,846 --> 00:32:58,745
He must feel so frustrated.

981
00:32:58,746 --> 00:32:59,915
(From 8:30am to 8:30pm)

982
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:01,116
My goodness.

983
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:05,816
(No one believed him.)

984
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,556
That's nice.

985
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,386
He must have been so stressed out.

986
00:33:10,526 --> 00:33:11,526
Yes, let it out.

987
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:12,526
(The more resentful he is, the funnier he gets.)

988
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,625
- Let it out.
- It was impossible to guess.

989
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:17,026
Everyone. Unfortunately,

990
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,096
you failed to arrest Hungry Lupin.

991
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:25,166
Hungry Lupin Jong Min and his helper, Joon.

992
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:29,035
We'll provide you a very generous meal for dinner.

993
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:32,275
(They win a generous meal of Goheung.)

994
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,745
- He did a good job.
- Well done.

995
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:36,985
- Okay.
- We'll give you dinner soon.

996
00:33:36,986 --> 00:33:38,415
- We did well.
- Okay.

997
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,955
Well done. I give you credit for it.

998
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:42,055
Well done.

999
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:43,186
We took it very seriously.

1000
00:33:43,686 --> 00:33:45,285
- Good job.
- Well done.

1001
00:33:45,286 --> 00:33:46,286
It was fun.

1002
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:47,995
It's making me angry. Let's take a shower.

1003
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:49,326
Let's go and wash up.

1004
00:33:49,556 --> 00:33:51,795
In that situation,

1005
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,195
even if someone had accused Jong Min all of a sudden,

1006
00:33:54,196 --> 00:33:56,556
- no one would've believed him.
- Right, it was impossible.

1007
00:33:56,706 --> 00:34:00,135
I was accused by everyone because of Joon's smart strategy.

1008
00:34:00,136 --> 00:34:01,235
It's because of Joon.

1009
00:34:01,236 --> 00:34:03,305
- In my opinion...
- Joon helped me a lot.

1010
00:34:03,306 --> 00:34:04,375
Joon did a good job.

1011
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,845
- Joon did well today.
- With Joon's help,

1012
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,276
things completely changed for me.

1013
00:34:09,776 --> 00:34:10,885
That's right.

1014
00:34:10,886 --> 00:34:12,085
- Joon...
- I didn't put much thought to it.

1015
00:34:12,086 --> 00:34:14,155
Joon isn't usually intelligent,

1016
00:34:14,156 --> 00:34:15,815
- but his strategy was amazing.
- There was something about him.

1017
00:34:15,816 --> 00:34:17,785
- Joon is doing well these days.
- Right.

1018
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:19,525
You must have enjoyed the shoot very much today.

1019
00:34:19,526 --> 00:34:21,055
Yes, I really did.

1020
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,325
Ever since I joined 2 Days 1 Night, I enjoyed today the most.

1021
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:24,466
(Very excited)

1022
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:26,895
It was so much fun because I knew who it was.

1023
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:28,066
Right.

1024
00:34:28,136 --> 00:34:29,836
How could you...

1025
00:34:30,106 --> 00:34:31,406
do that to me?

1026
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:34,205
At the end, he confessed that he was the helper.

1027
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,236
Then he said that I ordered him.

1028
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:38,122
It was the most frightening moment today.

1029
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:40,715
(His acting skills fooled everyone.)

1030
00:34:40,716 --> 00:34:43,245
"Joon, what are you doing?"

1031
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:44,246
(Sae Ho got ambushed all of a sudden.)

1032
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:45,386
"You gave me the order."

1033
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:48,915
During the shoot,

1034
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,656
- you lie so much.
- Gosh.

1035
00:34:51,026 --> 00:34:53,595
Didn't I tell you about 500 times today that it wasn't me?

1036
00:34:53,596 --> 00:34:54,655
Today, you were very...

1037
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:56,866
Who puts his head to the ground just to prove it?

1038
00:34:57,366 --> 00:34:58,825
You were particularly...

1039
00:34:58,826 --> 00:35:00,995
I got frustrated a few times saying that it wasn't me.

1040
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:02,996
Sae Ho, you're Hungry Lupin.

1041
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:05,636
Isn't he stupid or what?

1042
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:08,505
- We already found out who it is.
- No,

1043
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:09,976
I still think that you're lying.

1044
00:35:12,106 --> 00:35:15,916
(Sae Ho vented his resentment for the next 20 minutes.)

1045
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:20,016
(It's time for Hungry Lupin and the helper to enjoy their meal.)

1046
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:21,555
Gosh, it's beef.

1047
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:22,615
(The good citizens arrive first.)

1048
00:35:22,616 --> 00:35:23,685
It's barbecue.

1049
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:24,885
- Is it ramyeon?
- Ramyeon?

1050
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:26,672
- This isn't for us either.
- What's going on?

1051
00:35:26,696 --> 00:35:29,026
- Why did you do that, Sae Ho?
- Goodness.

1052
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:32,066
Have a seat. Let's talk. What's the problem?

1053
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,736
- Hungry Lupin.
- Let's sit.

1054
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:36,535
- Move out of the way.
- Is it ribs? Sirloin?

1055
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:37,835
Everyone, move out of the way.

1056
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,676
- Please move out of the way.
- So we can eat.

1057
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:40,936
(Exclaiming with joy)

1058
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,975
This is crazy.

1059
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,305
Tonight's dinner for the winners is...

1060
00:35:45,306 --> 00:35:47,275
Korean beef from Citron Valley, Goheung.

1061
00:35:47,276 --> 00:35:49,116
- Goheung is known for Korean beef.
- Right.

1062
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:51,115
Sirloin, tenderloin.

1063
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,415
(Starting with popular cuts, sirloin and tenderloin)

1064
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:56,786
- Beef short plate.
- Oh, my. Are they giving us beef?

1065
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:59,025
Korean cattle in Citron Valley are raised...

1066
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:02,795
on clean grass and feed made with citron.

1067
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:04,566
So their meat is tender and sweet.

1068
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:05,896
Really?

1069
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:08,795
We got you the top grade beef.

1070
00:36:08,796 --> 00:36:10,035
- The top grade?
- The top grade?

1071
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:11,635
- Yes.
- You can eat it raw.

1072
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,606
Also, ramyeon that matches perfectly with meat.

1073
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,605
(Ramyeon that matches perfectly with meat)

1074
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:19,605
And special side dishes from the restaurant owner at lunch.

1075
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:21,686
They're Namdo aged kimchi and mustard greens kimchi.

1076
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:22,875
These are for you.

1077
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:23,885
(Dinner that Hungry Lupin would desire)

1078
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:25,285
It includes everything from carbs to protein.

1079
00:36:25,286 --> 00:36:26,756
Shall we start eating?

1080
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,615
Only those who can eat will enjoy the meal.

1081
00:36:29,616 --> 00:36:31,162
He's going to act as an informant again.

1082
00:36:31,186 --> 00:36:32,386
I'm your helper.

1083
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:34,595
- What?
- Grill some meat for us.

1084
00:36:34,596 --> 00:36:35,995
- I'll help you with the meat.
- Will you grill it?

1085
00:36:35,996 --> 00:36:37,166
- Yes.
- Really?

1086
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:38,696
I will put it on the grill.

1087
00:36:39,626 --> 00:36:41,465
- We'll leave it up to you.
- I'll grill the tenderloin.

1088
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,786
(The top grade Korean beef from Goheung enters the grill.)

1089
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,675
(With the stimulating sizzling sound, )

1090
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:51,745
(the beef is getting cooked with grease.)

1091
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:54,045
Let's try some Namdo kimchi.

1092
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,246
- Jong Min, this is to die for.
- This?

1093
00:36:57,286 --> 00:36:58,785
What's this? Where is it from?

1094
00:36:58,786 --> 00:36:59,786
It's your fault.

1095
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:01,015
It's from the restaurant.

1096
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:02,696
- It's excellent.
- You didn't believe me.

1097
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:06,896
(He got arrested and couldn't eat anything at the restaurant.)

1098
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:08,556
It's from Namdo.

1099
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:11,696
- It must be amazing.
- Just say the truth.

1100
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:14,765
It's more sour than citron.

1101
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:15,935
(Empathizing)

1102
00:37:15,936 --> 00:37:17,366
On the molar...

1103
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:19,705
I don't know where it comes from,

1104
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:21,505
but there's an explosion of broth.

1105
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:22,736
It makes your mouth water.

1106
00:37:22,836 --> 00:37:24,382
Jong Min, the mustard greens kimchi is excellent.

1107
00:37:24,406 --> 00:37:25,875
He bragged about it earlier.

1108
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,275
He said that he'd give us the kimchi for dinner.

1109
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:30,546
It'd be unbelievable with ramyeon.

1110
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:32,445
Ramyeon with that kimchi?

1111
00:37:32,446 --> 00:37:33,655
(It's tormenting to imagine it.)

1112
00:37:33,656 --> 00:37:34,986
Sae Ho.

1113
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:37,686
Stop it.

1114
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:40,996
- Stop what?
- I'm having a very hard time.

1115
00:37:42,396 --> 00:37:46,166
(The main dish of tonight's dinner gets ready.)

1116
00:37:47,536 --> 00:37:50,566
(Grilled over high heat very quickly)

1117
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:57,176
(The ecstatic look of crunchy on the outside and moist inside)

1118
00:37:58,206 --> 00:38:00,075
- It's here.
- This is...

1119
00:38:00,076 --> 00:38:01,676
(The top grade Korean beef appears.)

1120
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,785
Look how thick it is.

1121
00:38:03,786 --> 00:38:05,216
(Look how thick it is.)

1122
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,085
(I'll let you smell it too.)

1123
00:38:07,086 --> 00:38:08,356
It's real beef.

1124
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,855
The smell is amazing.

1125
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:11,955
(Meanwhile, Joon dips it in some salt and eats it.)

1126
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,055
Goodness.

1127
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:16,396
(He closes his eyes and focuses only on the taste.)

1128
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:18,996
It tastes really good.

1129
00:38:19,696 --> 00:38:21,435
I love it.

1130
00:38:21,436 --> 00:38:22,465
Tell us something other than "I like it."

1131
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,905
I thought that it was a sponge.

1132
00:38:23,906 --> 00:38:25,806
- A sponge? Then spit it out.
- It's soft.

1133
00:38:26,106 --> 00:38:27,612
Spit it out if it tastes like a sponge.

1134
00:38:27,636 --> 00:38:28,636
It's just...

1135
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:30,305
(It's very juicy like a sponge.)

1136
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:31,976
Why is Jong Min so lucky?

1137
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:34,476
I'm certain...

1138
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:36,076
that he's blessed with people.

1139
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:38,145
His right-hand man was...

1140
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:39,985
Joon, my helper.

1141
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:41,086
(Joon, it's thanks to you.)

1142
00:38:41,256 --> 00:38:42,286
That's nice.

1143
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:45,336
The helper did everything today.

1144
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:47,696
(He also films the helper.)

1145
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:50,466
This is the helper.

1146
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,696
That was supposed to be for the four of us.

1147
00:38:53,326 --> 00:38:54,966
I love the thickness.

1148
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:59,966
I kept the thickness just right.

1149
00:39:00,636 --> 00:39:02,116
Thick enough to maintain the texture.

1150
00:39:03,276 --> 00:39:04,906
- You know what?
- What?

1151
00:39:05,246 --> 00:39:06,915
I don't know how well you want it done.

1152
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:10,115
I need to taste a piece to judge the thickness.

1153
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:12,485
- Just one piece?
- I'll try this one.

1154
00:39:12,486 --> 00:39:13,486
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

1155
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:15,716
Can we get a piece too?

1156
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:18,286
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

1157
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,825
- He picked it up and ate it.
- Did he eat it?

1158
00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:20,972
It's okay if he ate the one he dropped.

1159
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:22,456
He ate the one he dropped.

1160
00:39:22,656 --> 00:39:24,525
Since you had a bite, let's switch places.

1161
00:39:24,526 --> 00:39:25,695
- Shall I grill the rest?
- No.

1162
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,535
- Why not?
- I'm doing well right now.

1163
00:39:27,536 --> 00:39:28,595
Really?

1164
00:39:28,596 --> 00:39:31,805
I have to cook some chuck flap tail now.

1165
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:34,005
In all seasons of 2 Days 1 Night,

1166
00:39:34,006 --> 00:39:35,406
has anyone stolen food like a thug?

1167
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:37,945
- Exactly.
- It's 4 to 2.

1168
00:39:37,946 --> 00:39:39,905
I told you several times. Let's just ignore the rules and eat.

1169
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:41,666
- Let's go and eat.
- We should... Let's go.

1170
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:42,975
- But you can't...
- What?

1171
00:39:42,976 --> 00:39:44,445
What are you doing right now? Hey! Oh, gosh.

1172
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:45,986
(We'll take some of your beef.)

1173
00:39:46,286 --> 00:39:48,056
(Chaotic)

1174
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:50,016
You thugs.

1175
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:52,462
- Don't the losers get any food?
- What is this?

1176
00:39:52,486 --> 00:39:53,856
Yes, you do. Please sit down.

1177
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:56,102
- Looks like we'll get some food.
- They'll give us some food.

1178
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:58,666
The rest of you worked hard, so we should give you food to eat.

1179
00:39:58,826 --> 00:40:00,395
What's that? Rice and kimchi?

1180
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:01,516
What we said became reality.

1181
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:03,896
What's this? It's not regular kimchi. Onion?

1182
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,165
(Is this what the losers get to eat?)

1183
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,475
- What?
- It's what was left earlier.

1184
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:09,635
- Goheung is also famous for onions.
- Oh, really?

1185
00:40:09,636 --> 00:40:10,775
- It'll damage your stomach.
- Indeed.

1186
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,675
You'll have rice and onion kimchi made with newly harvested onions...

1187
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:15,596
that grew in Goheung where the sea breeze blows.

1188
00:40:16,176 --> 00:40:17,646
- Onion kimchi is tasty.
- Indeed.

1189
00:40:17,986 --> 00:40:18,986
I can't get enough of it.

1190
00:40:19,986 --> 00:40:21,656
I like onions. Let's try it.

1191
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:24,826
Put a piece of onion kimchi on rice and...

1192
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:26,585
Look at the onion kimchi.

1193
00:40:26,586 --> 00:40:27,926
Onion!

1194
00:40:28,656 --> 00:40:30,526
(He has a big bite.)

1195
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,035
(Close-up shot)

1196
00:40:34,036 --> 00:40:36,766
(Extreme close-up shot)

1197
00:40:37,236 --> 00:40:38,306
How does it taste?

1198
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,976
- I can't see the taste.
- You can't see the taste?

1199
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:43,035
- Well, you know...
- Is it good? Is it sour? How is it?

1200
00:40:43,036 --> 00:40:45,476
I'm being serious right now. We need something to go with it.

1201
00:40:46,146 --> 00:40:47,976
- We need meat or something.
- Right.

1202
00:40:48,876 --> 00:40:49,876
(Se Yoon, the kimchi lover, tries a bite too.)

1203
00:40:49,877 --> 00:40:51,816
It's good, but we need something else.

1204
00:40:51,886 --> 00:40:53,166
We need to wait until next week.

1205
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:55,055
It should be fermented for another week.

1206
00:40:55,056 --> 00:40:57,186
- It's not enough for you, right?
- No.

1207
00:40:57,586 --> 00:40:59,485
We'll give you a chance...

1208
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:01,356
- to share one plate.
- Okay. Good.

1209
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:03,395
Winners, are you okay with it?

1210
00:41:03,396 --> 00:41:05,125
- Okay.
- Sure. I'm okay with it.

1211
00:41:05,126 --> 00:41:06,895
- I feel bad about deceiving them.
- All right.

1212
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:07,935
(I'm sorry for stealing the food.)

1213
00:41:07,936 --> 00:41:11,636
We'll test your teamwork and luck for the last time.

1214
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,266
Please bring it here.

1215
00:41:14,106 --> 00:41:15,175
What's that?

1216
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:16,806
I think it's kind of a large-scale game.

1217
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:18,876
What is this?

1218
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:20,746
Oh, it's Mentos.

1219
00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:22,276
Oh, I get it. We'll put it in Coke.

1220
00:41:23,346 --> 00:41:26,316
(Coke explodes with Mentos candies.)

1221
00:41:26,646 --> 00:41:29,355
Among the eight soda bottles,

1222
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:30,685
only one bottle has water in it.

1223
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:31,762
(Among 8 soda bottles, 1 has water in it.)

1224
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:35,495
You'll take turns putting candies into a bottle using your mouth.

1225
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:36,732
(The members take turns putting candies into a soda bottle.)

1226
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:39,425
Even if only 1 of the 4 of you...

1227
00:41:39,426 --> 00:41:41,906
chooses water that won't explode, you'll complete the mission.

1228
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:44,935
- It's difficult.
- You two must not tell them.

1229
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:47,335
- Of course.
- I can't see it unexpectedly.

1230
00:41:47,336 --> 00:41:48,505
- It's hard to tell.
- It's hard to see the colors.

1231
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,835
- You can't see?
- They're all black.

1232
00:41:49,836 --> 00:41:52,006
- I cleaned it.
- I can't see the color at all.

1233
00:41:52,906 --> 00:41:54,245
It all looks black.

1234
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:55,815
(We mixed ink with water to prevent them from seeing it.)

1235
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:58,385
- The older members will go first.
- Okay.

1236
00:41:58,386 --> 00:41:59,746
I think it's either number 7 or 8.

1237
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:01,186
- Great!
- All right.

1238
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:02,686
For a worry-free life!

1239
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:04,926
- Let's go!
- Let's eat a plate without worries.

1240
00:42:06,786 --> 00:42:09,056
- I'll go with number seven.
- Okay.

1241
00:42:09,496 --> 00:42:11,496
Everyone laughed when he went toward number eight.

1242
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:12,796
Here we go.

1243
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:15,096
(Se Yoon chose number 7.)

1244
00:42:16,596 --> 00:42:18,536
(What could it be?)

1245
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,505
(Will he succeed in one try?)

1246
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:22,675
Here we go.

1247
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:24,506
(Swallowing saliva)

1248
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:35,286
Drink some Coke.

1249
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:39,556
(Right. I'll drink some Coke, at least.)

1250
00:42:40,496 --> 00:42:43,256
(Se Yoon failed.)

1251
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:44,996
Is it number eight?

1252
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,025
I think it's number six.

1253
00:42:47,026 --> 00:42:49,066
- Go with your instinct.
- Then go with number six.

1254
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,336
Go with your instinct.

1255
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:52,126
You have a 50-50 percent chance anyway.

1256
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:54,436
- Go, DinDin.
- Number six.

1257
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:56,306
- Number six.
- Here we go.

1258
00:42:57,036 --> 00:42:58,076
- Go.
- That's...

1259
00:42:58,976 --> 00:42:59,976
(Spitting)

1260
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:03,446
(There's no change?)

1261
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:07,656
- He made it.
- What?

1262
00:43:08,382 --> 00:43:09,451
- He made it.
- What?

1263
00:43:09,452 --> 00:43:10,691
(Did he succeed?)

1264
00:43:10,692 --> 00:43:13,262
(No, he failed.)

1265
00:43:13,492 --> 00:43:14,562
This is difficult.

1266
00:43:15,365 --> 00:43:17,365
Now you have two attempts left.

1267
00:43:17,705 --> 00:43:18,964
- Sae Ho.
- I trust you.

1268
00:43:18,965 --> 00:43:20,351
- You trust me?
- Go with whatever you want.

1269
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:23,045
(Meanwhile, Hungry Lupin and the helper are cooking ramyeon.)

1270
00:43:23,075 --> 00:43:24,975
It looks good. The ramyeon is ready.

1271
00:43:26,745 --> 00:43:27,845
It's done.

1272
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:31,244
- It smells good.
- The smell drives me crazy.

1273
00:43:31,245 --> 00:43:34,354
- Hurry up, or you won't get any.
- Hurry up.

1274
00:43:34,355 --> 00:43:36,355
- Let's go.
- We can't eat it if we're too late.

1275
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:39,154
- I'll go with number one.
- Go ahead.

1276
00:43:39,155 --> 00:43:40,525
- Go for it.
- Here we go.

1277
00:43:42,595 --> 00:43:43,824
I don't think it is the one.

1278
00:43:43,825 --> 00:43:44,895
(Nervous)

1279
00:43:49,535 --> 00:43:51,665
- What?
- That's a lot of Coke.

1280
00:43:53,475 --> 00:43:57,144
(He failed with a soda fountain show.)

1281
00:43:57,145 --> 00:43:58,245
That's a lot of Coke.

1282
00:43:59,315 --> 00:44:01,235
- The last attempt.
- This is your last attempt.

1283
00:44:01,645 --> 00:44:02,944
Today is Sae Ho's day.

1284
00:44:02,945 --> 00:44:04,045
What number did you pick?

1285
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:05,965
Let me think for a little while.

1286
00:44:07,085 --> 00:44:08,684
- What numbers are left?
- Number two...

1287
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:09,784
Numbers 1, 3,

1288
00:44:09,785 --> 00:44:11,584
- six, and seven.
- He picked number one, right?

1289
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:13,095
I think it's number eight.

1290
00:44:13,595 --> 00:44:14,655
I think it's number eight.

1291
00:44:15,095 --> 00:44:16,095
Okay. I'll go with it.

1292
00:44:16,465 --> 00:44:18,324
Guys, take a look at this.

1293
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:21,234
I'll give you a chance to change your decision.

1294
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:24,634
- Really?
- He said we should change it...

1295
00:44:24,635 --> 00:44:25,765
because he saw the bottles.

1296
00:44:25,975 --> 00:44:27,575
I think... Let's all share our thoughts.

1297
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,044
Number eight isn't it. Then...

1298
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:31,904
- There are numbers 2, 4, and 5.
- I think it's number 4.

1299
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:33,574
- Number four?
- I think it's in the middle too.

1300
00:44:33,575 --> 00:44:34,744
It's either number 2 or 4.

1301
00:44:34,745 --> 00:44:35,944
Let's go with number four.

1302
00:44:35,945 --> 00:44:37,225
I don't think it's on this side.

1303
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:41,314
(Hurry up and make up your mind.)

1304
00:44:41,315 --> 00:44:44,055
(Ramyeon will be gone shortly.)

1305
00:44:44,085 --> 00:44:46,124
We think it's number four, but our hunches were wrong, so you pick.

1306
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,254
- Okay.
- We think it's number four.

1307
00:44:47,255 --> 00:44:48,255
- I pick number five.
- Okay.

1308
00:44:48,256 --> 00:44:49,325
We think it's number four.

1309
00:44:49,865 --> 00:44:50,964
You picked number five? Okay, go with it.

1310
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:52,635
- Number 4.
- Number 4?

1311
00:44:53,095 --> 00:44:55,635
(Was Sae Ho's choice right?)

1312
00:44:58,305 --> 00:45:00,505
(The candies have fallen.)

1313
00:45:01,405 --> 00:45:02,875
(Please)

1314
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:09,955
- He made it.
- Can we see?

1315
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:12,685
- It was number four.
- Nice!

1316
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:14,685
(Sae Ho made it.)

1317
00:45:15,415 --> 00:45:16,424
Oh, I see.

1318
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:18,184
- I'm glad I changed my mind.
- They mixed ink with water.

1319
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:20,171
- That's why we couldn't see.
- They succeeded at the end.

1320
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:22,155
- I couldn't see it at all.
- Even I didn't know.

1321
00:45:23,325 --> 00:45:28,365
(It's a relief that you can at least taste the food.)

1322
00:45:28,565 --> 00:45:29,704
We must not drop this.

1323
00:45:29,705 --> 00:45:30,864
(They're allowed to eat only one plate.)

1324
00:45:30,865 --> 00:45:32,305
Okay. Good.

1325
00:45:32,675 --> 00:45:33,734
Nice.

1326
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:35,311
(They can only eat the food stacked on the plate.)

1327
00:45:35,335 --> 00:45:36,974
Can you put meat on it?

1328
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:39,051
Of course, we can. We'll have just four pieces of meat.

1329
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:40,915
And about the ramyeon...

1330
00:45:41,775 --> 00:45:42,991
How about only one of us eat it?

1331
00:45:43,015 --> 00:45:44,344
I'm in favor.

1332
00:45:44,345 --> 00:45:46,784
- Okay. Let's do that.
- Sharing it... Okay.

1333
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,814
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1334
00:45:47,815 --> 00:45:49,631
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1335
00:45:49,655 --> 00:45:51,885
(Scissors, paper, paper, scissors)

1336
00:45:54,195 --> 00:45:56,294
- Sae Ho, do you want to share it?
- I'm sorry.

1337
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,295
(I shouldn't have suggested the idea.)

1338
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,656
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1339
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:00,494
(Sae Ho wins.)

1340
00:46:00,495 --> 00:46:02,235
- Did Sae Ho win?
- That's amazing.

1341
00:46:02,295 --> 00:46:03,964
Since Sae Ho had a long day,

1342
00:46:03,965 --> 00:46:06,104
- He had a long day.
- getting yelled at.

1343
00:46:06,105 --> 00:46:07,505
Right. He went through a hard time.

1344
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:13,974
- Oh, my. Ramyeon and tasty kimchi.
- It must be really good.

1345
00:46:13,975 --> 00:46:15,615
(Taking a close-up shot again)

1346
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:18,985
(Slurping the broth)

1347
00:46:20,015 --> 00:46:21,885
(It's so good that I'm speechless.)

1348
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:24,124
Sae Ho, it makes you feel better, right?

1349
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:25,445
(It relieves all his resentment.)

1350
00:46:25,685 --> 00:46:28,355
I want to let them have some too since we're a team.

1351
00:46:28,525 --> 00:46:29,971
- Go ahead and dig in.
- Are you serious?

1352
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,235
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1353
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:33,041
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1354
00:46:33,065 --> 00:46:35,425
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1355
00:46:36,065 --> 00:46:37,134
I made it to the final.

1356
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:38,964
- I made it to the final.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1357
00:46:38,965 --> 00:46:41,974
(DinDin wins.)

1358
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:43,105
You know, here's the thing.

1359
00:46:43,705 --> 00:46:46,315
Earlier, DinDin said I deserved it because I had a long day.

1360
00:46:46,615 --> 00:46:48,315
He made such a heartfelt comment.

1361
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,785
What goes around comes around.

1362
00:46:51,145 --> 00:46:52,854
DinDin must be full. He ate a lot of meat earlier.

1363
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:53,855
You can eat onion kimchi now.

1364
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:55,784
(DinDin, is it good?)

1365
00:46:55,785 --> 00:46:56,855
You left some?

1366
00:46:57,185 --> 00:46:58,425
- We're a team.
- Great.

1367
00:46:59,085 --> 00:47:01,625
- Good.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1368
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,864
(Finally, Se Yoon wins.)

1369
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:05,425
My goodness. Thank you.

1370
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:07,534
Maybe I'll just go home. I'll start the car now.

1371
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:08,635
Thank you.

1372
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:13,634
(He sucks the noodles in like a vacuum cleaner.)

1373
00:47:13,635 --> 00:47:14,735
Try this. It's good.

1374
00:47:14,975 --> 00:47:16,645
- You can mix rice with it.
- Right.

1375
00:47:17,305 --> 00:47:18,575
Mixing it with rice?

1376
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:21,215
Can he have some of the broth?

1377
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:25,615
(The leftover Korean beef is all cooked well now.)

1378
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:29,685
(They taste a piece of Goheung's citron beef each.)

1379
00:47:30,785 --> 00:47:32,745
Put it on top of the rice and make it like sushi.

1380
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:34,905
You'll just eat it without rice?

1381
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:37,864
(It's just one piece, but we're happy.)

1382
00:47:37,865 --> 00:47:39,185
This goes well with onion kimchi.

1383
00:47:39,495 --> 00:47:40,695
- Now...
- Yes?

1384
00:47:41,135 --> 00:47:42,904
Let's go and do something to help you digest.

1385
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:45,264
(Right now?)

1386
00:47:45,265 --> 00:47:46,274
We just ate.

1387
00:47:46,275 --> 00:47:48,355
Do people do something to digest right after eating?

1388
00:47:48,905 --> 00:47:49,974
People usually rest a little bit first.

1389
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:51,505
- Got it.
- We'll get going.

1390
00:47:51,605 --> 00:47:53,674
- Okay. Let's go.
- I enjoyed the food.

1391
00:47:53,675 --> 00:47:55,251
(Let's go and do something to digest the food.)

1392
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:58,285
(The dark night falls already.)

1393
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:03,225
(Big waves come and go.)

1394
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:07,195
(It feels like something might happen on the beach.)

1395
00:48:07,425 --> 00:48:09,124
(And...)

1396
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:10,365
What are those? Sleeping bags?

1397
00:48:12,565 --> 00:48:15,094
(In the middle of the beach, )

1398
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:18,805
(a couple of camping cots are prepared.)

1399
00:48:19,305 --> 00:48:20,334
What's going on?

1400
00:48:20,335 --> 00:48:21,474
(This probably means...)

1401
00:48:21,475 --> 00:48:23,245
Some of us will sleep here.

1402
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,005
Gosh. What is this?

1403
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:27,675
We are sleeping outdoors.

1404
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:30,245
We are sleeping outdoors in this weather? No way.

1405
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:32,854
(A creeping sense of dread)

1406
00:48:32,855 --> 00:48:34,085
This is tough.

1407
00:48:34,855 --> 00:48:37,885
I’ve prepared a special night for you all tonight.

1408
00:48:38,025 --> 00:48:39,224
It's very special.

1409
00:48:39,225 --> 00:48:40,994
- Can you see that?
- What a pretty lodging!

1410
00:48:40,995 --> 00:48:42,495
Tonight, somebody...

1411
00:48:42,825 --> 00:48:45,524
will get to sleep by the beach...

1412
00:48:45,525 --> 00:48:47,064
that embraces this beautiful night sea of Goheung.

1413
00:48:47,065 --> 00:48:48,665
(Sleeping outdoors by the beach)

1414
00:48:50,235 --> 00:48:52,104
It does look like a picture. It's pretty on the screen.

1415
00:48:52,105 --> 00:48:54,465
- I can't help but laugh.
- It must be great on the screen.

1416
00:48:54,575 --> 00:48:55,905
It will be too cold at night.

1417
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:57,574
I think...

1418
00:48:57,575 --> 00:48:59,844
The water comes very close to this point.

1419
00:48:59,845 --> 00:49:01,974
- Did you even test this before?
- The beds are all laid down.

1420
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:04,744
Then they will float if the water comes in.

1421
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:06,361
We'll be in the middle of the sea when we get up.

1422
00:49:06,385 --> 00:49:08,854
- Then we'll get home fast.
- I know.

1423
00:49:08,855 --> 00:49:11,284
We'll have to see the situation.

1424
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:12,924
- What did you say?
- We have to see the situation.

1425
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:13,925
Whether the water comes in or not?

1426
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:14,925
We have to see whether it happens or not while we are sleeping?

1427
00:49:14,926 --> 00:49:16,864
Let's say you are all too tired.

1428
00:49:16,865 --> 00:49:19,094
Then you all fall asleep and can't get up.

1429
00:49:19,095 --> 00:49:21,064
Then we'll all be floating.

1430
00:49:21,065 --> 00:49:22,294
(They can drift in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.)

1431
00:49:22,295 --> 00:49:23,335
"Who are you?"

1432
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:26,174
In case of an emergency,

1433
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:27,605
- we can all get out.
- Of course.

1434
00:49:27,675 --> 00:49:30,745
We have a total of three rounds for the sleeping game.

1435
00:49:31,245 --> 00:49:34,245
Two people get to sleep indoors in a warm room.

1436
00:49:34,415 --> 00:49:37,845
Two people get to sleep in a tent on top of fluffy grass.

1437
00:49:38,085 --> 00:49:39,314
Sleeping in a tent sounds nice.

1438
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:41,514
- Yes, that sounds nice.
- It should be okay.

1439
00:49:41,515 --> 00:49:45,184
You see the sleeping bags on the folding cots?

1440
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:48,855
We will decide the two people who get to sleep outdoors.

1441
00:49:50,165 --> 00:49:53,565
(Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors of 3 Tiers)

1442
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:55,534
- This is horrible.
- We can't sleep in this one.

1443
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:57,834
- It's so windy down here.
- We need a thicker sleeping bag.

1444
00:49:57,835 --> 00:49:59,235
Can this bear my weight?

1445
00:49:59,775 --> 00:50:01,575
- Are you writing "Help?"
- This is horrible.

1446
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,574
- It will be colder at dawn.
- Write it bigger.

1447
00:50:05,575 --> 00:50:06,921
(Request for assistance in advance)

1448
00:50:06,945 --> 00:50:10,284
The first round for Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors is simple.

1449
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:11,784
It's Triple Jump.

1450
00:50:11,785 --> 00:50:12,785
(Triple Jump)

1451
00:50:12,786 --> 00:50:13,814
This is...

1452
00:50:13,815 --> 00:50:15,354
You don't care about the height difference?

1453
00:50:15,355 --> 00:50:16,355
You aren't setting the weight class?

1454
00:50:16,356 --> 00:50:17,685
It can't be a simple triple jump.

1455
00:50:18,255 --> 00:50:21,154
(Triple Jump while wearing acupressure slippers)

1456
00:50:21,155 --> 00:50:22,554
(Wearing acupressure slippers)

1457
00:50:22,555 --> 00:50:23,594
Gosh, this hurts.

1458
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:24,624
I'll make myself get used to it.

1459
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:25,625
(Screaming)

1460
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:28,835
(Acupressure intensity equivalent to 120kg of his weight)

1461
00:50:29,165 --> 00:50:31,935
(Adding more weight)

1462
00:50:32,005 --> 00:50:34,774
The one who jumps the furthest...

1463
00:50:34,775 --> 00:50:35,905
gets to sleep indoors.

1464
00:50:36,035 --> 00:50:38,745
(Who will be the first one to sleep indoors?)

1465
00:50:39,515 --> 00:50:42,075
Moon Se Yoon!

1466
00:50:42,645 --> 00:50:44,885
Slippers that can support up to 120kg.

1467
00:50:46,145 --> 00:50:47,155
(Sighing)

1468
00:50:47,585 --> 00:50:48,585
(Groaning)

1469
00:50:48,586 --> 00:50:50,586
Hope for countless people struggling with obesity.

1470
00:50:50,885 --> 00:50:52,425
I won't be the last one for sure.

1471
00:50:53,155 --> 00:50:55,524
It's like he's wearing wooden shoes.

1472
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:57,624
(Overwhelming happiness)

1473
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:58,965
You all come this side.

1474
00:51:00,665 --> 00:51:01,695
Is it that bad?

1475
00:51:02,065 --> 00:51:04,005
He's 120kg.

1476
00:51:04,065 --> 00:51:05,565
- Is he?
- That must be very painful.

1477
00:51:05,865 --> 00:51:07,775
Se Yoon, don't give up. Remember sportsmanship.

1478
00:51:08,105 --> 00:51:09,175
I'll go for it.

1479
00:51:10,305 --> 00:51:12,604
(Starts running under a pressure of 120kg)

1480
00:51:12,605 --> 00:51:13,645
Let's go.

1481
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:18,485
(How far can Se Yoon jump?)

1482
00:51:18,845 --> 00:51:20,284
(Let's go, my brother.)

1483
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,385
One...

1484
00:51:22,715 --> 00:51:23,884
One, two.

1485
00:51:23,885 --> 00:51:26,694
(Landed)

1486
00:51:26,695 --> 00:51:27,755
This is where he landed.

1487
00:51:28,055 --> 00:51:33,495
(A leap that preserves the dignity of people with obesity)

1488
00:51:34,435 --> 00:51:39,335
(A nimble forward roll is a bonus.)

1489
00:51:39,435 --> 00:51:41,475
(It hurts so much.)

1490
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:43,075
He jumped very far.

1491
00:51:43,505 --> 00:51:44,544
Well done.

1492
00:51:44,545 --> 00:51:45,605
(Se Yoon jumped very far.)

1493
00:51:45,945 --> 00:51:49,375
(And all that’s left is pain.)

1494
00:51:49,415 --> 00:51:51,085
Try to slip your feet forward.

1495
00:51:51,145 --> 00:51:52,905
Right, it's better when I slip them forward.

1496
00:51:53,185 --> 00:51:54,385
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1497
00:51:54,955 --> 00:51:55,985
He's jumping.

1498
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:57,325
Let's go.

1499
00:51:57,326 --> 00:52:00,055
(Moving ahead, trusting the calluses built over 46 years)

1500
00:52:00,295 --> 00:52:02,595
(Can Jong Min beat Se Yoon's record?)

1501
00:52:02,695 --> 00:52:05,625
(How well can Jong Min jump?)

1502
00:52:05,795 --> 00:52:06,895
He's coming.

1503
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,194
He can never make it.

1504
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:09,835
(A sudden stop)

1505
00:52:10,305 --> 00:52:11,334
He can never make it.

1506
00:52:11,335 --> 00:52:14,035
(Belated happiness)

1507
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:16,074
- Okay, I'll go now.
- It must be very painful.

1508
00:52:16,075 --> 00:52:17,075
Let's go.

1509
00:52:19,105 --> 00:52:20,275
Okay, that should be it.

1510
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,414
(Jong Min landed far behind where Se Yoon landed.)

1511
00:52:21,415 --> 00:52:22,515
This is it.

1512
00:52:23,315 --> 00:52:25,515
- I'll do well in the next game.
- He couldn't beat me?

1513
00:52:26,815 --> 00:52:31,955
(DinDin also got eliminated as soon as he started.)

1514
00:52:32,155 --> 00:52:33,155
Let's go.

1515
00:52:33,156 --> 00:52:35,425
(Joon, the 4th player)

1516
00:52:35,595 --> 00:52:36,725
I think he'll jump well.

1517
00:52:39,695 --> 00:52:40,764
Let's go!

1518
00:52:40,765 --> 00:52:41,835
One, two.

1519
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,665
- Goodness.
- Watch your hands.

1520
00:52:46,675 --> 00:52:49,404
(He did jump far as he was a former ninja.)

1521
00:52:49,405 --> 00:52:52,374
(But Joon fell backward.)

1522
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:55,144
- Here.
- Wait, this hurts!

1523
00:52:55,145 --> 00:52:56,145
(Recording the point where Joon placed his hands behind)

1524
00:52:56,146 --> 00:52:58,214
(Acupressure pain that hits later)

1525
00:52:58,215 --> 00:52:59,445
This hurts so much.

1526
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:01,185
He jumped very far.

1527
00:53:02,415 --> 00:53:03,784
I can't even jump without those slippers.

1528
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:05,125
(Joon is in 1st place.)

1529
00:53:05,325 --> 00:53:06,694
Now, Seon Ho will change the game.

1530
00:53:06,695 --> 00:53:08,301
(We have the lightweight athlete, Seon Ho.)

1531
00:53:08,325 --> 00:53:09,965
- See how light he is.
- What's with him?

1532
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:14,035
(Warming up while wearing the acupressure slippers)

1533
00:53:14,795 --> 00:53:15,864
- Goodness.
- He'll jump well.

1534
00:53:15,865 --> 00:53:16,865
(It looks like he's comfortable with those slippers.)

1535
00:53:16,866 --> 00:53:17,946
It doesn't hurt him at all.

1536
00:53:19,005 --> 00:53:20,805
He doesn't feel pain, does he?

1537
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:23,575
- Feet don’t hurt in your 20s?
- It doesn't make sense.

1538
00:53:23,645 --> 00:53:26,304
We have to pray that he steps on the line.

1539
00:53:26,305 --> 00:53:27,951
(There is no chance for them to win unless Seon Ho makes a mistake.)

1540
00:53:27,975 --> 00:53:29,891
- I'll go for it now.
- Is it because he's healthy?

1541
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,591
We just have to pray that he gets disqualified.

1542
00:53:31,615 --> 00:53:34,084
We hope he makes a foul.

1543
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,954
(Please make a foul.)

1544
00:53:35,955 --> 00:53:37,185
Jump! One, two...

1545
00:53:37,855 --> 00:53:41,225
(Something just passed by.)

1546
00:53:41,325 --> 00:53:43,071
- How can we beat that?
- Let's play the next game.

1547
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,224
Let's play the next game.

1548
00:53:44,225 --> 00:53:45,294
What's with him?

1549
00:53:45,295 --> 00:53:46,694
(How far did he jump?)

1550
00:53:46,695 --> 00:53:47,794
What kind of man is he?

1551
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:52,364
- We hope he makes a foul.
- He's jumping.

1552
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:53,375
(One, two)

1553
00:53:53,505 --> 00:53:54,734
(Landed far away)

1554
00:53:54,735 --> 00:53:55,735
How can we beat him?

1555
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:57,251
- How can we beat that?
- Let's play the next game.

1556
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,374
Let's play the next game.

1557
00:53:58,375 --> 00:53:59,615
- Next game.
- What's with him?

1558
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:02,274
(The game is over.)

1559
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:04,244
I can't even jump that far without the slippers.

1560
00:54:04,245 --> 00:54:05,285
What's that?

1561
00:54:06,345 --> 00:54:07,385
I haven't jumped yet.

1562
00:54:08,155 --> 00:54:09,885
That was crazy. Why are you so good?

1563
00:54:11,085 --> 00:54:13,094
We can't even jump that far with our sneakers.

1564
00:54:13,095 --> 00:54:14,294
I landed very far, it's done.

1565
00:54:14,295 --> 00:54:15,671
(Will this game be over as Seon Ho sleeps indoors?)

1566
00:54:15,695 --> 00:54:18,324
(Sae Ho gets ready to jump.)

1567
00:54:18,325 --> 00:54:19,911
- It's all about flexibility.
- How did he jump so far?

1568
00:54:19,935 --> 00:54:21,495
He's just more flexible.

1569
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:24,004
I don't think Sae Ho feels the pain.

1570
00:54:24,005 --> 00:54:25,234
(Running while wearing the acupressure slippers)

1571
00:54:25,235 --> 00:54:26,335
It hurts!

1572
00:54:27,435 --> 00:54:28,474
Gosh, it hurts.

1573
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:30,404
(But he's quite patient.)

1574
00:54:30,405 --> 00:54:32,504
When we played a similar game before,

1575
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:33,715
he wasn't this good. Was he?

1576
00:54:34,315 --> 00:54:35,545
He got healthier.

1577
00:54:36,275 --> 00:54:37,284
(Will Sae Ho jump far to everyone's surprise?)

1578
00:54:37,285 --> 00:54:38,685
This isn't easy, to be honest.

1579
00:54:39,785 --> 00:54:40,854
Go, Sae Ho.

1580
00:54:40,855 --> 00:54:42,695
My friend, 44 years old. Show us what you got.

1581
00:54:43,085 --> 00:54:44,184
Okay.

1582
00:54:44,185 --> 00:54:46,625
(I get to sleep indoors if I jump well just this once.)

1583
00:54:48,955 --> 00:54:49,964
(Starts running)

1584
00:54:49,965 --> 00:54:50,965
Hungry Lupin.

1585
00:54:51,565 --> 00:54:56,435
(Sae Ho running at the speed of light)

1586
00:54:56,665 --> 00:54:58,964
(Surprised)

1587
00:54:58,965 --> 00:55:01,335
(Shocked)

1588
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:02,975
(After a fast run-up, )

1589
00:55:04,205 --> 00:55:07,715
(he landed far and touched down.)

1590
00:55:07,945 --> 00:55:11,245
(What? Why is he so good?)

1591
00:55:11,315 --> 00:55:12,344
What was that?

1592
00:55:12,345 --> 00:55:13,354
(It looks like a close match.)

1593
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:15,155
What? Everyone is so good.

1594
00:55:15,515 --> 00:55:17,985
(Sae Ho jumped far against all expectations.)

1595
00:55:19,085 --> 00:55:20,124
Gosh, that was very close.

1596
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:21,125
(It's a bit behind where Seon Ho landed.)

1597
00:55:21,126 --> 00:55:23,124
- That was very close.
- Goodness.

1598
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,194
(He lost but jumped well.)

1599
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,465
I was shocked.

1600
00:55:25,495 --> 00:55:26,495
- You were?
- Yes.

1601
00:55:26,835 --> 00:55:28,395
The result of the first round...

1602
00:55:28,935 --> 00:55:31,635
Seon Ho gets to sleep indoors.

1603
00:55:34,905 --> 00:55:36,104
(Seon Ho sleeps indoors.)

1604
00:55:36,105 --> 00:55:39,475
(There are 5 spots that are left.)

1605
00:55:39,575 --> 00:55:41,675
- This is Round 2.
- Gosh, Round 2.

1606
00:55:41,945 --> 00:55:45,685
- This is Random Bucket Race.
- Okay.

1607
00:55:47,215 --> 00:55:50,254
There must be something heavy inside the buckets like rocks.

1608
00:55:50,255 --> 00:55:53,294
As soon as you start running, pick a bucket full of sand.

1609
00:55:53,295 --> 00:55:55,725
Then you have to come back with the bucket.

1610
00:55:55,995 --> 00:55:57,865
For your information,

1611
00:55:58,225 --> 00:56:00,145
there is a bucket that has a hole on the bottom.

1612
00:56:00,595 --> 00:56:02,355
There's a bucket with a half-drilled bottom.

1613
00:56:03,565 --> 00:56:06,705
And also there are buckets with full of sand.

1614
00:56:07,505 --> 00:56:10,404
(Random buckets with clearly different weights)

1615
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:13,814
That one person who makes a round first...

1616
00:56:13,815 --> 00:56:15,514
gets to sleep indoors.

1617
00:56:15,515 --> 00:56:17,644
(This game is for that one last spot to sleep indoors.)

1618
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:19,115
(The first spot is taken.)

1619
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:20,284
I think...

1620
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:21,654
- Where do you want to stand?
- I want to stand in the middle.

1621
00:56:21,655 --> 00:56:23,654
- I'll widen my steps here.
- Okay.

1622
00:56:23,655 --> 00:56:24,815
Okay, I'll stand next to him.

1623
00:56:24,955 --> 00:56:27,495
Only one person gets to sleep indoors.

1624
00:56:27,925 --> 00:56:28,995
Ready?

1625
00:56:29,655 --> 00:56:31,065
(Hesitating)

1626
00:56:31,465 --> 00:56:33,435
(Slipping)

1627
00:56:33,495 --> 00:56:35,234
Come on! You did that on purpose.

1628
00:56:35,235 --> 00:56:36,864
No, I was just waiting.

1629
00:56:36,865 --> 00:56:37,865
Why would you do that?

1630
00:56:38,035 --> 00:56:40,404
Why did you stop?

1631
00:56:40,405 --> 00:56:42,804
- Nobody slipped but you.
- I know.

1632
00:56:42,805 --> 00:56:44,144
- You just have to hear the whistle.
- He's right.

1633
00:56:44,145 --> 00:56:45,404
Don't look at him. Just listen to the whistle.

1634
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:46,405
Just blow it.

1635
00:56:48,445 --> 00:56:49,514
Ready?

1636
00:56:49,515 --> 00:56:50,885
(Ready for real)

1637
00:56:53,815 --> 00:56:57,085
(Run!)

1638
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,455
(Random buckets get picked one by one.)

1639
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,525
You have to lift it.

1640
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,864
(Which bucket did they choose?)

1641
00:57:04,865 --> 00:57:06,595
(Se Yoon's bucket)

1642
00:57:06,935 --> 00:57:08,835
(Sand tumbling down)

1643
00:57:09,165 --> 00:57:12,305
(Se Yoon picked the bucket with a hole on the bottom.)

1644
00:57:14,435 --> 00:57:16,311
(Jong Min also picked the same bucket with a hole on the bottom.)

1645
00:57:16,335 --> 00:57:19,305
(Sae Ho picked the bucket with a half-drilled bottom.)

1646
00:57:19,805 --> 00:57:22,914
(Jong Min and Se Yoon are likely to win with the bottomless buckets.)

1647
00:57:22,915 --> 00:57:23,945
What?

1648
00:57:24,085 --> 00:57:25,144
Goodness.

1649
00:57:25,145 --> 00:57:26,955
(DinDin and Joon crashed.)

1650
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:29,515
(Sae Ho slips through the gap and rushes forward.)

1651
00:57:29,715 --> 00:57:33,695
(Who will be the last one to sleep indoors?)

1652
00:57:35,425 --> 00:57:38,895
(Sae Ho is the winner.)

1653
00:57:39,195 --> 00:57:41,495
Okay! But my bucket is full!

1654
00:57:45,235 --> 00:57:47,175
(Burst of frustration)

1655
00:57:47,275 --> 00:57:49,511
(He clearly chose the bucket with a half-drilled bottom.)

1656
00:57:49,535 --> 00:57:52,374
(But the sand didn't fall for some reason.)

1657
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:57,945
(Sae Ho just lifted the bucket full of sand and won.)

1658
00:57:58,515 --> 00:57:59,515
I didn't use my brain.

1659
00:57:59,516 --> 00:58:01,484
(He won purely with his muscles.)

1660
00:58:01,485 --> 00:58:02,855
Gosh, it's so heavy!

1661
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,284
- It has a half-drilled bottom.
- I lost with the empty bucket.

1662
00:58:06,285 --> 00:58:07,824
(These 2 lost even with the empty buckets.)

1663
00:58:07,825 --> 00:58:08,924
- Goodness.
- How could you lose with that?

1664
00:58:08,925 --> 00:58:10,025
Gosh, it's heavy.

1665
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:12,525
All right, everyone.

1666
00:58:12,765 --> 00:58:17,405
The winner of the second round is Sae Ho. He's sleeping indoors.

1667
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:20,705
Indoor spots are all full now.

1668
00:58:22,305 --> 00:58:24,804
(This is the last chance to avoid sleeping outdoors.)

1669
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:27,374
Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors.

1670
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,475
We'll have the final round.

1671
00:58:29,675 --> 00:58:33,145
In this mission, you'll take turns to flip cards,

1672
00:58:33,315 --> 00:58:35,415
and once there are five of the same fruit,

1673
00:58:35,585 --> 00:58:38,055
you have to run to the back and ring the bell.

1674
00:58:38,985 --> 00:58:41,825
Whoever rings the bell first earns one point.

1675
00:58:42,455 --> 00:58:44,394
The 2 members who earn 2 points first...

1676
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,395
will be sleeping in the yard tent tonight.

1677
00:58:47,095 --> 00:58:49,135
We have to play the game a number of times.

1678
00:58:49,495 --> 00:58:51,905
Let's play fair. We shouldn't cheat.

1679
00:58:52,665 --> 00:58:54,204
- Okay.
- Does the order matter?

1680
00:58:54,205 --> 00:58:56,174
The order isn't important,

1681
00:58:56,175 --> 00:58:58,274
but everything can become a variable.

1682
00:58:58,275 --> 00:58:59,944
So you can decide your places through rock-paper-scissors.

1683
00:58:59,945 --> 00:59:02,185
- All right. Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1684
00:59:02,315 --> 00:59:03,315
Okay.

1685
00:59:03,485 --> 00:59:04,914
You can't see it so well.

1686
00:59:04,915 --> 00:59:06,415
(It's not easy to see the 4 cards.)

1687
00:59:06,785 --> 00:59:07,785
(Getting ready)

1688
00:59:07,786 --> 00:59:09,055
This is going to be fun.

1689
00:59:10,155 --> 00:59:12,224
Jong Min can start, then Se Yoon, Joon, and me.

1690
00:59:12,225 --> 00:59:13,454
- Do you agree?
- Okay!

1691
00:59:13,455 --> 00:59:14,455
I agree.

1692
00:59:14,456 --> 00:59:15,855
Jong Min.

1693
00:59:16,495 --> 00:59:17,694
Flip the card.

1694
00:59:17,695 --> 00:59:18,794
- I'll start.
- Go ahead.

1695
00:59:18,795 --> 00:59:20,094
One, two, three!

1696
00:59:20,095 --> 00:59:21,095
One.

1697
00:59:21,096 --> 00:59:22,634
- Next. Se Yoon!
- One, two, three.

1698
00:59:22,635 --> 00:59:24,464
(1 lime, 1 plum)

1699
00:59:24,465 --> 00:59:26,975
- I'm sorry.
- You shouldn't do that!

1700
00:59:27,205 --> 00:59:28,834
(They're very sensitive as this is about sleeping outdoors.)

1701
00:59:28,835 --> 00:59:30,704
- Warning.
- What are you doing?

1702
00:59:30,705 --> 00:59:32,004
I'm sorry. I didn't see it either.

1703
00:59:32,005 --> 00:59:33,974
The opposite way. Okay. One, two, three.

1704
00:59:33,975 --> 00:59:35,345
(The game resumes.)

1705
00:59:35,445 --> 00:59:36,574
Okay. One, two, three.

1706
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,644
(1 lime added)

1707
00:59:37,645 --> 00:59:39,384
(2 limes, 1 plum)

1708
00:59:39,385 --> 00:59:40,655
(Flinching)

1709
00:59:40,955 --> 00:59:43,185
(He flinched after seeing the card with 5 fruits)

1710
00:59:43,355 --> 00:59:44,724
- If it's like this...
- Jong Min!

1711
00:59:44,725 --> 00:59:45,784
- It's Jong Min again.
- Is it me?

1712
00:59:45,785 --> 00:59:46,825
One, two.

1713
00:59:46,895 --> 00:59:47,924
(1 lime gone, 3 plums added)

1714
00:59:47,925 --> 00:59:50,695
(6 limes, 4 plums)

1715
00:59:50,765 --> 00:59:51,925
(6 limes, 4 plums, 5 bananas)

1716
00:59:52,365 --> 00:59:55,285
(There are 5 of the same fruit! They earn 1 point if they ring the bell.)

1717
00:59:56,095 --> 00:59:57,765
(Se Yoon gets up quickly.)

1718
00:59:58,065 --> 01:00:00,035
(He spends all the time in just getting up.)

1719
01:00:00,575 --> 01:00:02,575
(It's a speed race.)

1720
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:03,975
No!

1721
01:00:04,845 --> 01:00:06,745
(Joon takes the lead.)

1722
01:00:08,975 --> 01:00:10,615
(Lee Joon makes a touchdown.)

1723
01:00:10,715 --> 01:00:12,395
(He earns 1 point with his amazing speed.)

1724
01:00:12,585 --> 01:00:14,014
Lee Joon earns one point!

1725
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:15,815
(Lee Joon earns 1 point.)

1726
01:00:15,955 --> 01:00:17,124
I can't do it.

1727
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,284
(These two couldn't even run.)

1728
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,355
I can't do this.

1729
01:00:19,485 --> 01:00:20,494
Didn't you know?

1730
01:00:20,495 --> 01:00:21,524
I knew.

1731
01:00:21,525 --> 01:00:23,525
But when I got up, I already realized he was fast.

1732
01:00:25,095 --> 01:00:27,395
- I think I'll be sleeping outdoors.
- Stop Joon.

1733
01:00:27,565 --> 01:00:29,065
I'll definitely be sleeping outdoors.

1734
01:00:29,765 --> 01:00:30,864
Give Jong Min to me.

1735
01:00:30,865 --> 01:00:32,135
(Let me sleep with Jong Min.)

1736
01:00:32,235 --> 01:00:33,264
- Se Yoon.
- Give Jong Min to me.

1737
01:00:33,265 --> 01:00:34,274
Then catch the helper.

1738
01:00:34,275 --> 01:00:35,374
- What?
- Catch the helper.

1739
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:36,974
- I can't catch him.
- You can't catch him.

1740
01:00:36,975 --> 01:00:38,304
Joon will be leaving.

1741
01:00:38,305 --> 01:00:39,544
It's a fight between the three of us.

1742
01:00:39,545 --> 01:00:41,214
- Okay. I'll give Jong Min to you.
- Jong Min is good.

1743
01:00:41,215 --> 01:00:42,274
Hit Jong Min.

1744
01:00:42,275 --> 01:00:44,556
I think it wouldn't feel unfair if I slept with Jong Min.

1745
01:00:45,545 --> 01:00:47,814
Joon will start flipping.

1746
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:48,854
Okay!

1747
01:00:48,855 --> 01:00:50,125
One, two, three!

1748
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:51,354
(Flinching)

1749
01:00:51,355 --> 01:00:52,655
- My back.
- Be careful.

1750
01:00:53,255 --> 01:00:54,894
(4 strawberries, 1 banana)

1751
01:00:54,895 --> 01:00:56,024
Do it quickly.

1752
01:00:56,025 --> 01:00:57,494
(4 strawberries, 1 banana, 4 limes)

1753
01:00:57,495 --> 01:00:58,671
(7 strawberries, 1 banana, 4 limes)

1754
01:00:58,695 --> 01:00:59,765
Goodness.

1755
01:01:00,765 --> 01:01:02,465
I feel so anxious.

1756
01:01:02,595 --> 01:01:03,665
I'll flip!

1757
01:01:04,605 --> 01:01:06,365
(There are 5 plums.)

1758
01:01:08,035 --> 01:01:09,075
(He already gave up.)

1759
01:01:09,135 --> 01:01:10,205
(I won't lose this time.)

1760
01:01:10,645 --> 01:01:12,145
(I won't lose either.)

1761
01:01:15,515 --> 01:01:16,644
Joon is quick.

1762
01:01:16,645 --> 01:01:18,215
Joon is quick.

1763
01:01:18,815 --> 01:01:21,014
Joon succeeds!

1764
01:01:21,015 --> 01:01:22,615
(Joon is exempt from sleeping outdoors.)

1765
01:01:22,985 --> 01:01:26,025
(Joon will be sleeping in the outdoor tent.)

1766
01:01:26,085 --> 01:01:28,454
Sleeping outdoors in this weather is fine.

1767
01:01:28,455 --> 01:01:29,554
As long as it's not on the folding cots.

1768
01:01:29,555 --> 01:01:30,625
Okay.

1769
01:01:31,295 --> 01:01:33,564
- Goodness.
- I'm sorry, Hungry Lupin.

1770
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:35,495
- I'm next.
- I should have helped.

1771
01:01:35,595 --> 01:01:37,005
You're fast.

1772
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:40,065
Let's start with Jong Min.

1773
01:01:40,235 --> 01:01:41,405
- Start!
- Okay.

1774
01:01:41,635 --> 01:01:42,835
Start! One!

1775
01:01:43,235 --> 01:01:44,244
(There are 5 limes from the start.)

1776
01:01:44,245 --> 01:01:45,275
One!

1777
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:49,325
(It's a race between Jong Min and DinDin.)

1778
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:54,866
(The eldest brother's sense of balance couldn't keep up.)

1779
01:01:55,115 --> 01:01:57,255
(DinDin makes a touchdown.)

1780
01:01:57,285 --> 01:01:58,355
Okay!

1781
01:01:58,425 --> 01:02:00,555
(I'm a jogger.)

1782
01:02:00,755 --> 01:02:01,755
No.

1783
01:02:01,756 --> 01:02:03,355
(I'll be sleeping in the tent.)

1784
01:02:03,665 --> 01:02:05,665
We'll start with Se Yoon.

1785
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:07,665
(They'll be sleeping outdoors on folding cots.)

1786
01:02:07,935 --> 01:02:09,165
- Okay.
- Let's start.

1787
01:02:09,335 --> 01:02:10,764
Start!

1788
01:02:10,765 --> 01:02:12,335
One!

1789
01:02:12,865 --> 01:02:15,075
(Flinching)

1790
01:02:15,205 --> 01:02:16,205
One!

1791
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:18,345
(He almost got up.)

1792
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,174
Deduct one point.

1793
01:02:20,175 --> 01:02:21,414
Why? What happened?

1794
01:02:21,415 --> 01:02:23,515
- He almost got up.
- He got up.

1795
01:02:24,045 --> 01:02:25,385
- I didn't get up.
- Warning.

1796
01:02:25,515 --> 01:02:27,554
- Warning? Okay.
- One point will be deducted.

1797
01:02:27,555 --> 01:02:28,915
Okay.

1798
01:02:29,285 --> 01:02:30,454
You'll get eliminated if you don't keep the rhythm.

1799
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:31,684
Start!

1800
01:02:31,685 --> 01:02:33,155
One! One!

1801
01:02:33,425 --> 01:02:34,754
(4 limes, 3 strawberries, 4 bananas)

1802
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:35,824
(3 plums, 3 strawberries, 4 bananas)

1803
01:02:35,825 --> 01:02:38,365
(3 plums, 5 bananas)

1804
01:02:38,895 --> 01:02:39,925
Goodness.

1805
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,620
One! One!

1806
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:43,618
(3 plums, 5 bananas)

1807
01:02:44,173 --> 01:02:45,233
Goodness.

1808
01:02:50,713 --> 01:02:53,343
(Se Yoon rang the bell.)

1809
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:55,182
What is this?

1810
01:02:55,183 --> 01:02:56,382
(Se Yoon earns 1 point.)

1811
01:02:56,383 --> 01:02:57,483
That's amazing.

1812
01:02:59,183 --> 01:03:00,353
What is this?

1813
01:03:02,193 --> 01:03:03,923
(He went flying helplessly.)

1814
01:03:05,723 --> 01:03:07,923
(He dashed forward, even dodging the obstructing hand.)

1815
01:03:10,463 --> 01:03:12,603
(Se Yoon makes a touchdown.)

1816
01:03:12,703 --> 01:03:14,203
I was running, and suddenly...

1817
01:03:14,663 --> 01:03:16,373
I fell down.

1818
01:03:16,873 --> 01:03:19,073
He didn't even push.

1819
01:03:20,103 --> 01:03:21,942
(He just shook off the hand that grabbed him.)

1820
01:03:21,943 --> 01:03:23,673
I should have seen that.

1821
01:03:23,873 --> 01:03:25,043
Currently...

1822
01:03:25,273 --> 01:03:26,842
Se Yoon has 1 point, Din Din has 1 point,

1823
01:03:26,843 --> 01:03:29,003
- Let's switch places.
- and Jong Min has zero points.

1824
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:30,552
Shall we give them a chance...

1825
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:31,912
to switch places to protect the players?

1826
01:03:31,913 --> 01:03:34,023
I flew away. I almost fell into the sea.

1827
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:36,729
Shall we switch places? Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1828
01:03:36,753 --> 01:03:38,222
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1829
01:03:38,223 --> 01:03:39,223
Okay.

1830
01:03:39,224 --> 01:03:40,693
Rock-paper-scissors.

1831
01:03:41,063 --> 01:03:42,193
Where will you go?

1832
01:03:42,493 --> 01:03:43,692
He'll go next to him.

1833
01:03:43,693 --> 01:03:45,363
(Isn't he going to go next to him?)

1834
01:03:46,763 --> 01:03:48,003
Where will you go?

1835
01:03:48,663 --> 01:03:49,733
Where will you go?

1836
01:03:50,103 --> 01:03:51,432
You just need to avoid the middle place.

1837
01:03:51,433 --> 01:03:53,243
(I'll not go next to you since you won.)

1838
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:55,513
- Go to the first place.
- Me?

1839
01:03:55,913 --> 01:03:57,272
The cards will change as well.

1840
01:03:57,273 --> 01:03:58,542
I'll be in the 3rd place, and you'll be in the 2nd.

1841
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,642
Okay. The middle place is better.

1842
01:03:59,643 --> 01:04:01,843
Hold on. If he gets pushed, I'll be pushed as well.

1843
01:04:02,913 --> 01:04:05,752
This might be the final round.

1844
01:04:05,753 --> 01:04:06,853
(Perhaps the final round)

1845
01:04:07,353 --> 01:04:09,853
(If Se Yoon or DinDin wins, the game ends.)

1846
01:04:11,353 --> 01:04:13,693
(To avoid sleeping by the beach, )

1847
01:04:14,093 --> 01:04:16,063
(they must win.)

1848
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:18,492
Ready, start!

1849
01:04:18,493 --> 01:04:20,063
One! One!

1850
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:21,932
One! One!

1851
01:04:21,933 --> 01:04:23,072
What?

1852
01:04:23,073 --> 01:04:24,133
(4 plums, 9 strawberries)

1853
01:04:24,303 --> 01:04:25,303
No!

1854
01:04:25,304 --> 01:04:27,503
- Se Yoon!
- They both got up.

1855
01:04:27,843 --> 01:04:29,172
(Se Yoon miscounted after only seeing his and Jong Min's cards.)

1856
01:04:29,173 --> 01:04:30,853
(He couldn't see this because it was far.)

1857
01:04:31,543 --> 01:04:34,243
(He quickly comes back.)

1858
01:04:34,443 --> 01:04:36,013
They both got up.

1859
01:04:36,253 --> 01:04:37,812
- They both got up.
- I'm sorry. I get a warning.

1860
01:04:37,813 --> 01:04:38,952
Warning.

1861
01:04:38,953 --> 01:04:40,922
Se Yoon gets a warning, and you get minus one point.

1862
01:04:40,923 --> 01:04:42,483
- Okay.
- Jong Min has minus one point.

1863
01:04:42,923 --> 01:04:44,353
He has zero points anyway.

1864
01:04:44,853 --> 01:04:45,922
He has zero points. He has no points to lose.

1865
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,493
I have no points. Why...

1866
01:04:47,993 --> 01:04:50,032
Who is it? Start.

1867
01:04:50,033 --> 01:04:51,033
One!

1868
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:54,563
(The die has been cast.)

1869
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:57,633
(They start at the same time.)

1870
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:06,313
(Se Yoon wins.)

1871
01:05:08,213 --> 01:05:10,353
(Jong Min pushes DinDin first.)

1872
01:05:11,983 --> 01:05:14,153
(Se Yoon delivers justice with a single push.)

1873
01:05:16,653 --> 01:05:19,463
(It's a mess.)

1874
01:05:20,323 --> 01:05:23,533
(A tragedy brought on by greed.)

1875
01:05:24,433 --> 01:05:26,232
(Is this how it should be?)

1876
01:05:26,233 --> 01:05:27,433
(He pushed me!)

1877
01:05:27,763 --> 01:05:29,702
He's a gangster!

1878
01:05:29,703 --> 01:05:31,633
(He became a gangster not to sleep outdoors.)

1879
01:05:31,933 --> 01:05:33,202
He's a gangster.

1880
01:05:33,203 --> 01:05:35,573
(It was a messy game.)

1881
01:05:35,843 --> 01:05:37,743
- It's too...
- Everyone.

1882
01:05:38,513 --> 01:05:40,013
People cheated,

1883
01:05:40,383 --> 01:05:42,313
but DinDiin was actually pushed...

1884
01:05:42,553 --> 01:05:43,612
- Jong Min.
- by Jong Min.

1885
01:05:43,613 --> 01:05:45,683
(Jong Min, who isn't the winner, caused the mess.)

1886
01:05:45,923 --> 01:05:48,053
Things aren't working out well for DinDin these days.

1887
01:05:48,923 --> 01:05:51,093
The last spot for sleeping in the yard tent...

1888
01:05:51,953 --> 01:05:53,322
goes to Moon Se Yoon!

1889
01:05:53,323 --> 01:05:54,643
(Se Yoon will sleep in the tent.)

1890
01:05:55,123 --> 01:05:56,532
I would have lost if I stayed to this point.

1891
01:05:56,533 --> 01:05:57,962
Same here. I don't think I could have won.

1892
01:05:57,963 --> 01:06:00,333
As a result of Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors,

1893
01:06:00,963 --> 01:06:03,303
Sae Ho and Seon Ho will sleep indoors!

1894
01:06:03,403 --> 01:06:04,833
Next,

1895
01:06:05,773 --> 01:06:07,303
Joon and Se Yoon...

1896
01:06:07,573 --> 01:06:09,142
will sleep in the tent.

1897
01:06:09,143 --> 01:06:10,143
(Joon and Se Yoon will sleep in the tent.)

1898
01:06:10,144 --> 01:06:12,442
Next, Jong Min and DinDin...

1899
01:06:12,443 --> 01:06:14,142
will sleep outdoors.

1900
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,512
Yes!

1901
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,193
(DinDin and Jong Min will sleep outdoors.)

1902
01:06:17,313 --> 01:06:20,083
DinDin is tolerating this. He's changed.

1903
01:06:20,283 --> 01:06:22,392
- He's tolerating this.
- He changed.

1904
01:06:22,393 --> 01:06:24,853
He's a sensible celebrity.

1905
01:06:24,993 --> 01:06:27,862
- You shouldn't change.
- Just yell at us!

1906
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:29,133
He's quiet.

1907
01:06:29,293 --> 01:06:30,792
He's an adult.

1908
01:06:30,793 --> 01:06:32,362
- He's enduring it.
- Give him a round of applause.

1909
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:33,702
DinDin.

1910
01:06:33,703 --> 01:06:36,573
It's nothing.

1911
01:06:36,903 --> 01:06:40,403
(He suddenly goes off the screen.)

1912
01:06:45,473 --> 01:06:46,782
(His body wobbles.)

1913
01:06:46,783 --> 01:06:48,483
- The game ended.
- Well done.

1914
01:06:49,413 --> 01:06:52,553
- The Ho Ho Brothers have gathered.
- Of course.

1915
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:54,683
It was a fun day.

1916
01:06:55,353 --> 01:06:56,523
It was a long day too.

1917
01:06:57,323 --> 01:06:59,123
You were really good at long jump.

1918
01:06:59,863 --> 01:07:02,123
I was really shocked.

1919
01:07:02,693 --> 01:07:04,733
How could someone in his 40s jump like that?

1920
01:07:05,463 --> 01:07:07,302
I think you're the best jumper among all the people...

1921
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:08,333
in their 40s I've seen.

1922
01:07:09,203 --> 01:07:11,432
- Well done.
- Well done.

1923
01:07:11,433 --> 01:07:13,203
- Let's do our best tomorrow.
- Okay.

1924
01:07:14,273 --> 01:07:15,273
Sweet dreams.

1925
01:07:15,274 --> 01:07:16,372
- Good night.
- Good night.

1926
01:07:16,373 --> 01:07:17,649
(They end the day very comfortably.)

1927
01:07:17,673 --> 01:07:19,283
Here's our hotel.

1928
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:21,383
- I'm grateful for this.
- This...

1929
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:22,653
I'm more than grateful.

1930
01:07:22,753 --> 01:07:24,212
This... Gosh.

1931
01:07:24,213 --> 01:07:26,782
- Gosh.
- It's even spacious.

1932
01:07:26,783 --> 01:07:29,123
Three people used to sleep in one of these.

1933
01:07:29,823 --> 01:07:30,993
Come in.

1934
01:07:31,293 --> 01:07:32,992
Yes.

1935
01:07:32,993 --> 01:07:34,663
I'll make sure to sleep warmly in here.

1936
01:07:34,963 --> 01:07:36,963
(They love it.)

1937
01:07:37,863 --> 01:07:39,133
To be honest,

1938
01:07:39,233 --> 01:07:41,762
it's fine to stay outside for this week.

1939
01:07:41,763 --> 01:07:42,972
These are true vibes.

1940
01:07:42,973 --> 01:07:44,033
(True vibes can be felt.)

1941
01:07:44,873 --> 01:07:46,102
Gosh. I'm sleepy.

1942
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:47,903
It must be the worst to sleep out there.

1943
01:07:48,903 --> 01:07:51,112
DinDin will shiver like crazy with Jong Min.

1944
01:07:51,113 --> 01:07:53,112
I feel so bad for them. Gosh.

1945
01:07:53,113 --> 01:07:54,283
It was really windy.

1946
01:07:54,813 --> 01:07:56,913
This place is intense.

1947
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:58,993
Do you know what the temperature is right now?

1948
01:08:00,323 --> 01:08:03,153
(The waves are strong at the beach.)

1949
01:08:04,653 --> 01:08:06,462
Gosh, I can't believe we're sleeping outdoors.

1950
01:08:06,463 --> 01:08:08,583
(The ones to sleep outdoors are located right there.)

1951
01:08:09,063 --> 01:08:10,532
It'll be cold at dawn.

1952
01:08:10,533 --> 01:08:12,293
What if the water reaches us?

1953
01:08:12,863 --> 01:08:14,662
- By the looks of it, - How far will it reach?

1954
01:08:14,663 --> 01:08:16,673
The water reached up to here.

1955
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:19,603
Gosh, this is where the water reached up to.

1956
01:08:19,773 --> 01:08:21,642
We might get washed away if we get unlucky.

1957
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:23,043
It'll be too dangerous.

1958
01:08:23,273 --> 01:08:24,573
If the water reaches us,

1959
01:08:24,943 --> 01:08:26,083
we should go inside.

1960
01:08:26,913 --> 01:08:29,412
- So this is our condition.
- Right.

1961
01:08:29,413 --> 01:08:31,112
If the water reaches us while we sleep, we should go inside.

1962
01:08:31,113 --> 01:08:32,283
- Exactly.
- Okay.

1963
01:08:32,453 --> 01:08:33,783
- Right away.
- Right away.

1964
01:08:34,753 --> 01:08:36,693
I still didn't get mad once today.

1965
01:08:36,793 --> 01:08:38,253
I never saw you stay this calm.

1966
01:08:39,263 --> 01:08:40,623
We came all the way to Goheung.

1967
01:08:42,293 --> 01:08:44,563
I've never seen you keep calm even after losing.

1968
01:08:45,493 --> 01:08:46,802
It felt unfair for you today.

1969
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:48,562
It really felt unfair.

1970
01:08:48,563 --> 01:08:51,103
He pushed you with his big body.

1971
01:08:51,603 --> 01:08:53,573
He was totally playing so cheaply.

1972
01:08:54,503 --> 01:08:55,973
He's a big cheater.

1973
01:08:57,043 --> 01:08:58,173
(Laughing)

1974
01:08:59,483 --> 01:09:00,613
(Laughing)

1975
01:09:01,283 --> 01:09:04,113
(It's fine as long as it isn't me.)

1976
01:09:04,883 --> 01:09:06,523
He would've never imagined.

1977
01:09:06,853 --> 01:09:08,613
He would've never imagined me to sleep here.

1978
01:09:08,983 --> 01:09:10,623
Gosh, this feels amazing.

1979
01:09:11,393 --> 01:09:12,892
This is what it's like to sleep with laughter.

1980
01:09:12,893 --> 01:09:14,293
I can't hold it in.

1981
01:09:16,733 --> 01:09:17,992
Should I ask something?

1982
01:09:17,993 --> 01:09:19,033
What?

1983
01:09:19,603 --> 01:09:21,402
I'll ask the AI just one thing.

1984
01:09:21,403 --> 01:09:22,703
What are you asking about?

1985
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:24,903
I'm at the beach of Goheung.

1986
01:09:25,103 --> 01:09:28,302
If I sleep in a sleeping bag without a tent,

1987
01:09:28,303 --> 01:09:29,673
what will happen to me?

1988
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:33,342
Well, if there's a big temperature difference at dawn,

1989
01:09:33,343 --> 01:09:36,012
you could feel stiff and tired in the morning.

1990
01:09:36,013 --> 01:09:37,483
Gosh, that's bad.

1991
01:09:38,313 --> 01:09:40,883
Where will you choose to sleep today? A hotel...

1992
01:09:41,153 --> 01:09:42,493
or at the beach?

1993
01:09:42,793 --> 01:09:44,252
(Thinking)

1994
01:09:44,253 --> 01:09:46,822
I'll choose to rest comfortably in the hotel.

1995
01:09:46,823 --> 01:09:47,893
It's warm and nice.

1996
01:09:48,523 --> 01:09:50,863
Us too! Have a good night!

1997
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:54,533
(Laughing)

1998
01:09:55,433 --> 01:09:58,073
(Team Sleep Outdoors is now ready to sleep.)

1999
01:09:58,573 --> 01:10:00,543
- But there's a problem.
- What is it?

2000
01:10:01,703 --> 01:10:05,143
The sleeping bag is slanted like this.

2001
01:10:06,383 --> 01:10:08,442
Blood is rushing to my head.

2002
01:10:08,443 --> 01:10:10,613
- What do we do then?
- Should we face the other way?

2003
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:13,353
We can dig beneath us then.

2004
01:10:14,623 --> 01:10:16,623
- Right.
- That's what we can do.

2005
01:10:17,753 --> 01:10:20,163
- Beat down.
- That's much better. It went down.

2006
01:10:20,293 --> 01:10:21,662
- It went down!
- Done.

2007
01:10:21,663 --> 01:10:23,393
- That's great.
- Right.

2008
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,633
I think it went down too much.

2009
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:29,372
(Slamming)

2010
01:10:29,373 --> 01:10:30,803
- Okay.
- Great.

2011
01:10:31,803 --> 01:10:33,843
It is quite windy as we're at the beach.

2012
01:10:34,373 --> 01:10:36,872
I can feel the sea breeze. I should lock up.

2013
01:10:36,873 --> 01:10:38,353
(I have to block the wind perfectly.)

2014
01:10:38,643 --> 01:10:40,282
I can still see you in the morning, right?

2015
01:10:40,283 --> 01:10:41,883
Right. Let's make sure to survive.

2016
01:10:42,913 --> 01:10:44,352
Wake me up if the water reaches us.

2017
01:10:44,353 --> 01:10:45,782
- Okay.
- Don't leave me here.

2018
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,053
Let's stay safe.

2019
01:10:49,153 --> 01:10:51,823
(However, the sound of the waves pierces the ears.)

2020
01:10:52,563 --> 01:10:56,263
(DinDin ends up waking up.)

2021
01:10:57,133 --> 01:11:01,103
(There are even mosquitoes.)

2022
01:11:02,003 --> 01:11:06,273
(It's hard for Team Sleep Outdoors to fall asleep.)

2023
01:11:06,803 --> 01:11:10,072
(Time passes...)

2024
01:11:10,073 --> 01:11:13,483
(and morning comes to Goheung.)

2025
01:11:14,213 --> 01:11:17,683
(The wake-up song plays.)

2026
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:21,883
(Wriggling)

2027
01:11:22,353 --> 01:11:26,263
(Se Yoon and Joon get up at the same time.)

2028
01:11:26,823 --> 01:11:30,163
(He obviously slept well.)

2029
01:11:31,263 --> 01:11:34,533
(A bear escapes the tent.)

2030
01:11:35,163 --> 01:11:38,473
(Joon follows him out.)

2031
01:11:38,703 --> 01:11:40,242
Get on right away.

2032
01:11:40,243 --> 01:11:41,903
- What?
- Get in the car.

2033
01:11:42,403 --> 01:11:43,473
We have to get in the car.

2034
01:11:43,873 --> 01:11:45,712
(I need to use the restroom.)

2035
01:11:45,713 --> 01:11:46,783
Hold on.

2036
01:11:46,913 --> 01:11:48,083
Does the car have a restroom?

2037
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,083
I need to go.

2038
01:11:50,483 --> 01:11:52,112
- You may use it before we go.
- I need to use the restroom.

2039
01:11:52,113 --> 01:11:53,153
(That can't be true.)

2040
01:11:53,523 --> 01:11:55,122
(Seon Ho wakes up at that moment as well.)

2041
01:11:55,123 --> 01:11:56,593
- Is there one there?
- Yes.

2042
01:11:56,993 --> 01:11:58,622
- Hold on. I left my jacket.
- Did you sleep well?

2043
01:11:58,623 --> 01:12:00,363
Gosh, what's with your face?

2044
01:12:00,623 --> 01:12:01,723
I don't know.

2045
01:12:02,523 --> 01:12:03,839
Why are you like that every morning?

2046
01:12:03,863 --> 01:12:06,103
- It's the same for you.
- Gosh.

2047
01:12:06,233 --> 01:12:08,502
The viewers have the right to see your face.

2048
01:12:08,503 --> 01:12:10,673
Show them your face.

2049
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:15,073
(Did Team Sleep Outdoors sleep well?)

2050
01:12:16,443 --> 01:12:19,783
(It was really windy that even the camera shook.)

2051
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:23,113
(The wake-up song plays at that moment.)

2052
01:12:23,753 --> 01:12:27,053
(DinDin wakes up first.)

2053
01:12:28,283 --> 01:12:31,293
(He's still half-awake.)

2054
01:12:31,653 --> 01:12:34,293
The sea breeze is really strong.

2055
01:12:35,323 --> 01:12:37,063
There are so many mosquitoes.

2056
01:12:37,433 --> 01:12:39,533
- There were mosquitoes?
- Yes.

2057
01:12:40,503 --> 01:12:43,233
(DinDin couldn't sleep well because of the mosquitoes.)

2058
01:12:44,273 --> 01:12:46,573
(I didn't get bit by any of them.)

2059
01:12:48,203 --> 01:12:49,312
Really?

2060
01:12:49,313 --> 01:12:50,442
(The two look different even after sleeping at the same spot.)

2061
01:12:50,443 --> 01:12:51,513
(Scratching)

2062
01:12:51,813 --> 01:12:53,842
There were so many mosquitoes.

2063
01:12:53,843 --> 01:12:55,043
(They move to get on the bus.)

2064
01:12:55,683 --> 01:12:56,983
The way I see it,

2065
01:12:57,483 --> 01:12:59,163
the mosquitoes chose 1 out of the 2 of us.

2066
01:13:00,683 --> 01:13:02,052
It was another game.

2067
01:13:02,053 --> 01:13:03,653
You slept so well.

2068
01:13:05,153 --> 01:13:08,523
(Sleeping outdoors is not easy.)

2069
01:13:09,193 --> 01:13:10,792
The waves sounded so loud last night.

2070
01:13:10,793 --> 01:13:11,863
Right.

2071
01:13:12,293 --> 01:13:13,832
Team Sleep Outdoors must've suffered so much.

2072
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:15,563
- What?
- They must've suffered so much.

2073
01:13:16,073 --> 01:13:18,903
They buzzed all around me.

2074
01:13:19,033 --> 01:13:20,242
He's doing the techno.

2075
01:13:20,243 --> 01:13:21,883
(A mosquito can be heard from somewhere.)

2076
01:13:22,103 --> 01:13:25,173
(DinDin the Kid starts complaining after finding Joon.)

2077
01:13:25,413 --> 01:13:27,653
- I was looking at my phone.
- Why are your hands puffy?

2078
01:13:27,813 --> 01:13:29,452
They're all mosquito bites.

2079
01:13:29,453 --> 01:13:31,182
All around my hand.

2080
01:13:31,183 --> 01:13:33,452
Gosh, it must've been really tough.

2081
01:13:33,453 --> 01:13:35,153
- It was crazy!
- Gosh!

2082
01:13:35,823 --> 01:13:37,823
(Getting up)

2083
01:13:38,193 --> 01:13:41,093
(Getting up again)

2084
01:13:42,093 --> 01:13:45,363
(He couldn't sleep because of the mosquitoes.)

2085
01:13:46,133 --> 01:13:51,203
(The night was rather long for DinDin.)

2086
01:13:51,733 --> 01:13:53,073
While I was sleeping,

2087
01:13:53,573 --> 01:13:55,242
I kept yelling.

2088
01:13:55,243 --> 01:13:56,742
(He shares his story about his night struggles.)

2089
01:13:56,743 --> 01:13:58,013
Watch my clip.

2090
01:13:58,113 --> 01:13:59,312
(Peeking)

2091
01:13:59,313 --> 01:14:01,382
I didn't expect mosquitoes in November.

2092
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:02,823
It was because the weather was warm.

2093
01:14:02,853 --> 01:14:04,482
Team Security kept being alert...

2094
01:14:04,483 --> 01:14:05,613
whenever I yelled.

2095
01:14:05,683 --> 01:14:06,953
(Turning)

2096
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:10,093
(They kept checking on him to see if something had happened.)

2097
01:14:10,423 --> 01:14:11,522
(Laughing)

2098
01:14:11,523 --> 01:14:12,793
I got up...

2099
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,193
and fell asleep after turning the sleeping bag.

2100
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:17,109
Team Security turned off the lights after that.

2101
01:14:17,133 --> 01:14:18,793
A while later...

2102
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:20,333
"Gosh!"

2103
01:14:20,334 --> 01:14:22,903
(Team Security on)

2104
01:14:23,673 --> 01:14:25,002
That's what happened all night.

2105
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:26,979
(Mosquitoes weren't expected to be seen in November.)

2106
01:14:27,003 --> 01:14:29,003
- Now...
- We must be eating now.

2107
01:14:29,143 --> 01:14:30,543
Won't it be for a mission?

2108
01:14:31,043 --> 01:14:32,372
- Hungry, aren't you, Seon Ho?
- I'm hungry.

2109
01:14:32,373 --> 01:14:33,483
Where are we going?

2110
01:14:33,843 --> 01:14:35,142
We're heading closer to the shoreline.

2111
01:14:35,143 --> 01:14:37,613
- The shoreline.
- Something is waiting for us then.

2112
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:39,353
I'm looking at the map right now.

2113
01:14:40,753 --> 01:14:42,522
We're heading toward the dock.

2114
01:14:42,523 --> 01:14:44,152
- Really?
- It must be an island.

2115
01:14:44,153 --> 01:14:45,393
How far are we going?

2116
01:14:45,553 --> 01:14:47,192
It must be Yeonhong Island.

2117
01:14:47,193 --> 01:14:48,193
(The sign for Yeonhong Island can be seen outside the window.)

2118
01:14:48,194 --> 01:14:49,562
- Really?
- Yeonhong Island?

2119
01:14:49,563 --> 01:14:50,992
That's a pretty name. Yeonhong Island.

2120
01:14:50,993 --> 01:14:52,592
It sounds like light pink.

2121
01:14:52,593 --> 01:14:53,933
Yeonhong Island.

2122
01:14:54,363 --> 01:14:56,472
We must be heading to Sinyang Dock.

2123
01:14:56,473 --> 01:14:57,502
(The bus heads to the shoreline.)

2124
01:14:57,503 --> 01:14:58,573
We're here.

2125
01:14:58,973 --> 01:15:00,902
The boat is heading out. What?

2126
01:15:00,903 --> 01:15:02,043
What are we doing here?

2127
01:15:02,943 --> 01:15:04,912
We must be going to an island.

2128
01:15:04,913 --> 01:15:06,412
(They head toward the dock.)

2129
01:15:06,413 --> 01:15:08,083
It's beautiful here.

2130
01:15:08,683 --> 01:15:10,412
- The water is calm.
- Right.

2131
01:15:10,413 --> 01:15:12,252
- Every place looks beautiful.
- Right.

2132
01:15:12,253 --> 01:15:14,013
(The sea looks emerald even on a foggy day.)

2133
01:15:14,053 --> 01:15:15,983
- Gosh, let's go.
- Is this it?

2134
01:15:16,293 --> 01:15:17,322
- Everyone.
- Are we fishing?

2135
01:15:17,323 --> 01:15:18,353
Let's go.

2136
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:20,492
- Are we fishing?
- Let's go to the island!

2137
01:15:20,493 --> 01:15:21,969
- So we're really going.
- So we're really going.

2138
01:15:21,993 --> 01:15:23,792
All right. Let's move right away.

2139
01:15:23,793 --> 01:15:26,093
(They head to an island on a boat.)

2140
01:15:26,463 --> 01:15:28,303
Gosh, it looks beautiful.

2141
01:15:28,603 --> 01:15:30,103
It feels like I'm on a trip.

2142
01:15:31,633 --> 01:15:32,942
Here we go.

2143
01:15:32,943 --> 01:15:35,373
(The boat sets off through the refreshing breeze.)

2144
01:15:35,903 --> 01:15:38,112
- I love this kind of weather.
- Same here.

2145
01:15:38,113 --> 01:15:39,619
(Today's destination can be seen right away.)

2146
01:15:39,643 --> 01:15:41,283
What's the name of this island?

2147
01:15:41,483 --> 01:15:43,212
- It's Yeonhong Island.
- Yeonhong Island?

2148
01:15:43,213 --> 01:15:45,182
- It was the sign we saw.
- Yeonhong Island.

2149
01:15:45,183 --> 01:15:46,283
Right.

2150
01:15:47,323 --> 01:15:51,093
(We introduce to you Goheung's jewel, Yeonhong Island.)

2151
01:15:51,993 --> 01:15:54,822
(The whole island is an art museum...)

2152
01:15:54,823 --> 01:15:57,893
(as the "Art Island.")

2153
01:15:59,433 --> 01:16:03,033
(You'll find a photo spot with every step you take.)

2154
01:16:03,533 --> 01:16:05,872
(The art museum without a ceiling, )

2155
01:16:05,873 --> 01:16:09,003
(Yeonhong Island)

2156
01:16:10,373 --> 01:16:11,613
Why is it Yeonhong Island?

2157
01:16:12,013 --> 01:16:14,143
It's an island that is light pink.

2158
01:16:14,443 --> 01:16:16,412
It seems to have that color.

2159
01:16:16,413 --> 01:16:17,713
(Are you sure about that?)

2160
01:16:18,353 --> 01:16:19,682
We all arrived quickly, right?

2161
01:16:19,683 --> 01:16:20,923
- Yes.
- We got here quickly.

2162
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:22,823
I almost got seasick.

2163
01:16:23,193 --> 01:16:24,692
Yeonhong Island.

2164
01:16:24,693 --> 01:16:27,163
Is it called that because it's light pink?

2165
01:16:27,693 --> 01:16:28,863
(Goheung)

2166
01:16:29,093 --> 01:16:30,532
(Yeonhong Island, Geogeum Island)

2167
01:16:30,533 --> 01:16:31,933
(It's connected to Geogeum Island.)

2168
01:16:33,103 --> 01:16:35,402
(Yeon: Connect, Hong: Broad, Do: Island)

2169
01:16:35,403 --> 01:16:37,302
- It's great.
- It's beautiful.

2170
01:16:37,303 --> 01:16:40,243
So here's today's morning mission.

2171
01:16:40,403 --> 01:16:41,973
- Gosh.
- We had a morning mission?

2172
01:16:42,073 --> 01:16:44,042
You can go around Yeonhong Island...

2173
01:16:44,043 --> 01:16:46,543
and enjoy all of the charms of this place.

2174
01:16:46,883 --> 01:16:50,552
It's called Save It to My Selfies on Yeonhong Island.

2175
01:16:50,553 --> 01:16:51,783
- "Save."
- What was that?

2176
01:16:52,923 --> 01:16:55,352
This mission will be a team match.

2177
01:16:55,353 --> 01:16:58,552
You must take selfies with the specialties of Yeonhong Island.

2178
01:16:58,553 --> 01:16:59,893
It's a relay mission.

2179
01:17:00,723 --> 01:17:01,762
It's a team match.

2180
01:17:01,763 --> 01:17:03,762
We'll be out of breath since it's a relay.

2181
01:17:03,763 --> 01:17:05,932
It'll be a 3-on-3 team match.

2182
01:17:05,933 --> 01:17:08,132
You must work on your mission...

2183
01:17:08,133 --> 01:17:09,933
based on the order of the words given to you.

2184
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:11,672
We have to look for certain keywords?

2185
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:12,773
- Right.
- Right.

2186
01:17:13,473 --> 01:17:15,072
I'll be quick with this.

2187
01:17:15,073 --> 01:17:16,812
After one member completes the mission,

2188
01:17:16,813 --> 01:17:20,382
the next runner can move after the judge's approval.

2189
01:17:20,383 --> 01:17:21,582
- Okay.
- All right.

2190
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:24,312
The team that completes the mission first wins.

2191
01:17:24,313 --> 01:17:25,952
- We should do well.
- You should be divided into teams.

2192
01:17:25,953 --> 01:17:27,323
- Is it a team game?
- Yes.

2193
01:17:27,923 --> 01:17:29,223
Let's go with YB versus OB.

2194
01:17:29,923 --> 01:17:32,253
- That's the best.
- Okay. YB.

2195
01:17:33,193 --> 01:17:34,323
- OB?
- I see.

2196
01:17:34,593 --> 01:17:37,062
- What are you doing?
- Why do you go to Team YB?

2197
01:17:37,063 --> 01:17:38,992
- He thinks he belongs to YB?
- Let's mix things up for fun.

2198
01:17:38,993 --> 01:17:40,402
- We aren't technically YB and OB.
- What's wrong with him?

2199
01:17:40,403 --> 01:17:42,003
- Then...
- This is too much.

2200
01:17:42,103 --> 01:17:44,272
Let's pair up and play rock-paper-scissors.

2201
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:45,503
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

2202
01:17:45,803 --> 01:17:47,302
(Jong Min, Sae Ho, and DinDin versus Se Yoon, Joon, and Seon Ho)

2203
01:17:47,303 --> 01:17:48,743
- Okay.
- My gosh.

2204
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,243
Okay. This is a relay. Good.

2205
01:17:51,643 --> 01:17:52,712
They're good.

2206
01:17:52,713 --> 01:17:54,913
- This isn't so bad.
- This is the team I wanted.

2207
01:17:55,313 --> 01:17:56,453
This isn't bad.

2208
01:17:56,513 --> 01:17:58,382
- Good job.
- I want Seon Ho on my team.

2209
01:17:58,383 --> 01:17:59,423
(We just need to do well.)

2210
01:17:59,553 --> 01:18:02,483
I'll tell you about the rewards based on the mission results.

2211
01:18:02,853 --> 01:18:04,622
- Okay.
- Se Yoon, I have to eat.

2212
01:18:04,623 --> 01:18:06,462
I don't even know how many hours I haven't eaten.

2213
01:18:06,463 --> 01:18:08,523
He really needs to eat. You should eat.

2214
01:18:08,623 --> 01:18:11,792
The winning team will enjoy a special breakfast...

2215
01:18:11,793 --> 01:18:13,602
prepared by a famous chef of Yeonhong Island.

2216
01:18:13,603 --> 01:18:14,632
- I see.
- That sounds good.

2217
01:18:14,633 --> 01:18:15,762
The losing team...

2218
01:18:15,763 --> 01:18:17,872
will go somewhere to do something special...

2219
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:19,072
(The losing team will go on a special trip.)

2220
01:18:19,073 --> 01:18:21,842
- while the winning team eats.
- We're going to work.

2221
01:18:21,843 --> 01:18:23,412
We're going somewhere.

2222
01:18:23,413 --> 01:18:25,872
- We have to win.
- Let's eat.

2223
01:18:25,873 --> 01:18:27,883
All right. Who will pick?

2224
01:18:27,943 --> 01:18:29,913
We have Option A and Option B.

2225
01:18:30,153 --> 01:18:31,153
- Well...
- Joon.

2226
01:18:31,154 --> 01:18:32,382
- Pick one.
- Go ahead.

2227
01:18:32,383 --> 01:18:33,422
- Sae Ho and...
- Go.

2228
01:18:33,423 --> 01:18:35,652
- Pick one.
- I want the blue one.

2229
01:18:35,653 --> 01:18:36,892
(Fighting for the blue one)

2230
01:18:36,893 --> 01:18:38,592
- Why...
- I think the white one is better.

2231
01:18:38,593 --> 01:18:39,593
Is it better?

2232
01:18:39,594 --> 01:18:40,823
Take it.

2233
01:18:40,993 --> 01:18:43,333
They are unbelievable.

2234
01:18:44,033 --> 01:18:45,292
What are you doing?

2235
01:18:45,293 --> 01:18:46,403
(Trying to steal it)

2236
01:18:46,463 --> 01:18:48,062
What's been wrong with you since yesterday?

2237
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,262
Okay. Good.

2238
01:18:49,263 --> 01:18:50,303
That was good.

2239
01:18:51,533 --> 01:18:53,543
(Opening the mission cards)

2240
01:18:54,803 --> 01:18:57,343
(A specialty of Yeonhong Island)

2241
01:18:58,373 --> 01:19:02,343
(Among the numerous murals painted by the residents)

2242
01:19:02,843 --> 01:19:04,182
(Team A: A selfie with Kim Il, the headbutt king)

2243
01:19:04,183 --> 01:19:05,789
(Team B: A selfie with the mural of Bang Wool)

2244
01:19:05,813 --> 01:19:07,282
(Team A: A selfie with Bang Wool)

2245
01:19:07,283 --> 01:19:08,523
(Team B: A selfie with the cat)

2246
01:19:09,323 --> 01:19:11,852
(Teams A and B: A selfie with the Miryang Park Clan)

2247
01:19:11,853 --> 01:19:13,262
(Save It to My Selfies on Yeonhong Island)

2248
01:19:13,263 --> 01:19:14,662
(Team A: Selfies with Kim Il, Bang Wool, and Miryang Park Clan)

2249
01:19:14,663 --> 01:19:16,139
(Team B: Selfies with Bang Wool's mural, cat, and Miryang Park Clan)

2250
01:19:16,163 --> 01:19:18,063
Fold it. Don't let them see it.

2251
01:19:18,563 --> 01:19:21,202
We should see it. Why aren't you sharing it with us?

2252
01:19:21,203 --> 01:19:22,503
We won't share it.

2253
01:19:23,573 --> 01:19:26,073
(Show us.)

2254
01:19:27,073 --> 01:19:29,573
(A close-up battle between those born in 1982)

2255
01:19:30,543 --> 01:19:32,713
- This is it for today, okay?
- All right.

2256
01:19:33,243 --> 01:19:35,583
It could've been a big fight.

2257
01:19:35,743 --> 01:19:36,783
That was okay.

2258
01:19:37,113 --> 01:19:38,853
They are a perfect duo.

2259
01:19:39,053 --> 01:19:40,053
It's funny.

2260
01:19:40,054 --> 01:19:42,052
Let's just trip them up and let them fall.

2261
01:19:42,053 --> 01:19:43,353
Of course.

2262
01:19:43,623 --> 01:19:44,852
- Really?
- Really?

2263
01:19:44,853 --> 01:19:45,993
- All right.
- Okay.

2264
01:19:46,193 --> 01:19:47,592
Then, can I pull their hair out?

2265
01:19:47,593 --> 01:19:48,763
- Of course.
- Okay.

2266
01:19:49,763 --> 01:19:51,463
- Ready.
- Let's go.

2267
01:19:51,993 --> 01:19:53,703
- Ready.
- Ready.

2268
01:19:54,763 --> 01:19:56,672
- Let's go.
- We should win.

2269
01:19:56,673 --> 01:19:57,803
- Win!
- Go.

2270
01:19:58,473 --> 01:19:59,602
He's light.

2271
01:19:59,603 --> 01:20:01,343
(The two members run off lightly.)

2272
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:04,513
The mural of Bang Wool.

2273
01:20:05,913 --> 01:20:07,742
Kim Il, the headbutt king.

2274
01:20:07,743 --> 01:20:09,663
(Sae Ho's photo spot: Kim Il, the headbutt king)

2275
01:20:10,513 --> 01:20:11,582
(Who will take a selfie and post it first?)

2276
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:12,953
I think it's somewhere here.

2277
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:15,953
Guys, who is the second runner?

2278
01:20:16,123 --> 01:20:17,222
It's me.

2279
01:20:17,223 --> 01:20:18,722
- The second runners.
- Who's next?

2280
01:20:18,723 --> 01:20:20,392
All right. Teams A and B.

2281
01:20:20,393 --> 01:20:22,062
- Is there something?
- The second runners...

2282
01:20:22,063 --> 01:20:24,063
should take selfies with this composition.

2283
01:20:24,393 --> 01:20:25,663
Is there a certain composition?

2284
01:20:27,363 --> 01:20:29,403
This is so cute. How lovely.

2285
01:20:30,133 --> 01:20:32,403
With Bang Wool, I can win.

2286
01:20:34,073 --> 01:20:35,372
(Meanwhile, where are Sae Ho and Seon Ho who ran off quickly?)

2287
01:20:35,373 --> 01:20:36,773
I think it's somewhere here.

2288
01:20:37,613 --> 01:20:39,312
Kim Il, the headbutt king.

2289
01:20:39,313 --> 01:20:41,673
(Sae Ho's mission: A selfie with Kim Il, the headbutt king)

2290
01:20:41,983 --> 01:20:43,043
It's here.

2291
01:20:45,753 --> 01:20:48,382
Have you seen Kim Il, the headbutt king here?

2292
01:20:48,383 --> 01:20:50,193
He's here. I found it.

2293
01:20:51,523 --> 01:20:54,363
(Among the photos of Kim Il scattered throughout the island, )

2294
01:20:54,463 --> 01:20:55,523
I found it.

2295
01:20:57,733 --> 01:21:00,233
(Sae Ho managed to find the smallest one.)

2296
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:01,563
I got it. Let's go.

2297
01:21:01,963 --> 01:21:05,073
(He finds it quickly and gets back quickly.)

2298
01:21:05,603 --> 01:21:07,642
Sae Ho is coming back already. What?

2299
01:21:07,643 --> 01:21:09,042
- Sae Ho.
- What's with him?

2300
01:21:09,043 --> 01:21:10,512
- He's coming.
- It's a relay.

2301
01:21:10,513 --> 01:21:11,542
What?

2302
01:21:11,543 --> 01:21:12,813
We're going to win.

2303
01:21:13,683 --> 01:21:17,113
(But what's more important than speed is the selfie.)

2304
01:21:18,683 --> 01:21:21,423
A selfie with Kim Il, the headbutt king.

2305
01:21:22,453 --> 01:21:23,492
What?

2306
01:21:23,493 --> 01:21:25,133
- I don't think it's right.
- This is it.

2307
01:21:25,323 --> 01:21:28,062
But you should take a selfie while headbutting him.

2308
01:21:28,063 --> 01:21:29,163
- Headbutt.
- I did.

2309
01:21:30,033 --> 01:21:32,993
(He didn't headbutt him.)

2310
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,832
- Darn it.
- What is he doing?

2311
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,273
- My gosh.
- He didn't headbutt him?

2312
01:21:37,973 --> 01:21:39,602
Good. He couldn't be that fast.

2313
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,903
What's wrong with him?

2314
01:21:42,373 --> 01:21:45,473
(Meanwhile, Seon Ho is still looking for the mural.)

2315
01:21:46,813 --> 01:21:48,213
I don't think I should go further.

2316
01:21:49,743 --> 01:21:52,283
(Seon Ho's mission: A selfie with the mural of Bang Wool)

2317
01:21:52,813 --> 01:21:54,623
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

2318
01:21:54,653 --> 01:21:56,422
Do you know where the mural of Bang Wool is?

2319
01:21:56,423 --> 01:21:57,423
The mural of Bang Wool.

2320
01:21:57,853 --> 01:21:59,353
- What?
- The mural of Bang Wool.

2321
01:21:59,453 --> 01:22:00,892
- Bang Wool?
- Yes.

2322
01:22:00,893 --> 01:22:02,122
- There's Bang Wool.
- I see.

2323
01:22:02,123 --> 01:22:04,163
Here it is. This is it.

2324
01:22:05,563 --> 01:22:07,132
Thank you. Is this it?

2325
01:22:07,133 --> 01:22:08,639
(The mural of Bang Wool was right in front of him.)

2326
01:22:08,663 --> 01:22:10,202
It's Bang Wool. This is it.

2327
01:22:10,203 --> 01:22:12,133
(Taking a selfie)

2328
01:22:12,603 --> 01:22:13,702
Thank you, ma'am.

2329
01:22:13,703 --> 01:22:15,873
Are you from the Miryang Park Clan, by any chance?

2330
01:22:16,613 --> 01:22:18,142
I'm Lee.

2331
01:22:18,143 --> 01:22:20,113
- Are you Lee? Okay. Thank you.
- Yes.

2332
01:22:20,913 --> 01:22:22,882
Hello, sir. By any chance,

2333
01:22:22,883 --> 01:22:25,252
are you from the Miryang Park Clan? Okay.

2334
01:22:25,253 --> 01:22:27,373
(He looks for the Miryang Park Clan on his way back.)

2335
01:22:27,853 --> 01:22:28,953
Hello, sir.

2336
01:22:29,253 --> 01:22:31,093
Are you from the Miryang Park Clan?

2337
01:22:31,353 --> 01:22:32,393
No?

2338
01:22:33,923 --> 01:22:36,833
(Once he takes a selfie, he can catch up with Seon Ho.)

2339
01:22:37,363 --> 01:22:38,432
He's coming.

2340
01:22:38,433 --> 01:22:39,762
(Who will come back first?)

2341
01:22:39,763 --> 01:22:40,863
Okay.

2342
01:22:42,063 --> 01:22:43,463
What are you doing, Seon Ho? Hurry.

2343
01:22:44,803 --> 01:22:47,143
(Spurting)

2344
01:22:47,203 --> 01:22:48,673
Did you take a selfie with a cat?

2345
01:22:49,403 --> 01:22:51,343
This is Bang Wool.

2346
01:22:52,573 --> 01:22:53,912
Seon Ho, pass.

2347
01:22:53,913 --> 01:22:55,413
- Okay.
- Okay. Good luck, Se Yoon.

2348
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:58,052
I don't think it's here.

2349
01:22:58,053 --> 01:22:59,659
(The 2nd runner Se Yoon, a selfie with the cat)

2350
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:01,083
Are you from the Miryang Park Clan?

2351
01:23:01,323 --> 01:23:02,582
Is anyone from the Miryang Park Clan?

2352
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:04,223
- Me.
- Miryang Park Clan?

2353
01:23:05,493 --> 01:23:06,893
Please tell others that you're not.

2354
01:23:07,423 --> 01:23:09,463
When Lee Joon comes, please take a selfie with him.

2355
01:23:09,623 --> 01:23:12,363
Tell DinDin that you're not Park.

2356
01:23:14,263 --> 01:23:15,402
I found the Miryang Park Clan.

2357
01:23:15,403 --> 01:23:17,579
(He found the Miryang Park Clan, so he needs to find the cat now.)

2358
01:23:17,603 --> 01:23:18,672
Headbutt.

2359
01:23:18,673 --> 01:23:21,203
(Sae Ho is back.)

2360
01:23:21,303 --> 01:23:22,742
- Okay. Pass.
- Okay.

2361
01:23:22,743 --> 01:23:24,013
(Sae Ho, pass)

2362
01:23:25,743 --> 01:23:28,613

- Meow.
- Bang Wool.

01:23:33,923 --> 01:23:36,153
- Meow.
- Hello.

2367
01:23:36,993 --> 01:23:38,993
Do you know Bang Wool?

2368
01:23:39,823 --> 01:23:40,862
(A lot of people are looking for Bang Wool today.)

2369
01:23:40,863 --> 01:23:43,263
Is this the house? Is this it?

2370
01:23:43,733 --> 01:23:45,532
Bang Wool is in there.

2371
01:23:45,533 --> 01:23:47,162
- In here?
- Go in and see.

2372
01:23:47,163 --> 01:23:48,733
Really? Thank you.

01:23:52,673 --> 01:23:53,772
Hello.

01:23:53,773 --> 01:23:55,943
(Bang Wool is here.)

2376
01:23:56,943 --> 01:23:57,943
Ma'am.

2377
01:23:58,043 --> 01:24:00,642
- Bang Wool is here.
- Over here.

2378
01:24:00,643 --> 01:24:02,012
Where is Bang Wool?

2379
01:24:02,013 --> 01:24:03,853
(People outside tells him where Bang Wool is.)

2380
01:24:03,913 --> 01:24:05,153
Bang Wool.

2381
01:24:07,053 --> 01:24:08,352
Bang Wool.

2382
01:24:08,353 --> 01:24:10,122
Hey. Bang Wool.

2383
01:24:10,123 --> 01:24:12,522
This is amazing. You're so pretty, Bang Wool.

2384
01:24:12,523 --> 01:24:15,223
(The mascot of Yeonhong Island, Bang Wool)

2385
01:24:15,793 --> 01:24:16,862
Bang Wool.

2386
01:24:16,863 --> 01:24:18,133
(He's so cute.)

2387
01:24:18,963 --> 01:24:19,963
(His job satisfaction is at its peak today.)

2388
01:24:19,964 --> 01:24:21,303
Thank you, Bang Wool.

2389
01:24:22,563 --> 01:24:25,203
(Se Yoon is busy taking a selfie too.)

2390
01:24:26,273 --> 01:24:29,203
(Unlike Bang Wool, the cat wouldn't come close.)

2391
01:24:30,073 --> 01:24:32,543
(Approaching stealthily)

2392
01:24:35,843 --> 01:24:38,853
(What is he doing?)

2393
01:24:39,853 --> 01:24:42,583
(He takes a selfie from a distance.)

2394
01:24:43,553 --> 01:24:46,053
(He manages to capture the cat in the frame.)

2395
01:24:46,793 --> 01:24:48,893
I should go and insist.

2396
01:24:49,993 --> 01:24:50,993
Okay.

2397
01:24:51,163 --> 01:24:53,933
(By the way, he can run fast.)

2398
01:24:54,433 --> 01:24:56,563
- Se Yoon is coming.
- Already?

2399
01:24:56,773 --> 01:24:58,702
Joon, Se Yoon is coming. You should get ready.

2400
01:24:58,703 --> 01:25:00,119
(The 3rd runner, Lee Joon gets ready.)

2401
01:25:00,143 --> 01:25:02,042
Please, Jong Min.

2402
01:25:02,043 --> 01:25:03,343
As expected for Se Yoon.

2403
01:25:04,443 --> 01:25:06,812
Se Yoon runs really fast.

2404
01:25:06,813 --> 01:25:08,382
- He's nimble.
- He's fast.

2405
01:25:08,383 --> 01:25:09,682
He's good at running.

2406
01:25:09,683 --> 01:25:11,053
Why isn't he slow?

2407
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,152
Hurry, Jong Min!

2408
01:25:13,153 --> 01:25:15,182
(I can't lose.)

2409
01:25:15,183 --> 01:25:17,592
- Show him.
- You should get the composition.

2410
01:25:17,593 --> 01:25:19,192
(The key point for the 2nd runners is the composition.)

2411
01:25:19,193 --> 01:25:21,163
I took a selfie.

2412
01:25:21,593 --> 01:25:23,222
- It's good.
- It's good.

2413
01:25:23,223 --> 01:25:24,233
Pass.

2414
01:25:25,563 --> 01:25:27,102
- Go.
- Here.

- Look.
- Pass.

(Jong Min, pass)

2418
01:25:33,443 --> 01:25:35,343
Run, Joon. Hurry!

2419
01:25:35,673 --> 01:25:37,213
- Run quickly.
- Hurry.

2420
01:25:37,713 --> 01:25:40,883
(Who will meet the Miryang Park Clan first?)

2421
01:25:42,143 --> 01:25:44,653
(He goes to a place crowded with many people.)

2422
01:25:46,553 --> 01:25:47,953
Hello, ma'am.

2423
01:25:48,283 --> 01:25:50,223

2425
01:25:53,763 --> 01:25:57,063
Ma'am, may I ask your name?

2426
01:25:57,293 --> 01:25:58,663
- Your name?
- What?

2427
01:25:58,833 --> 01:25:59,963
Are you Park?

2428
01:26:00,163 --> 01:26:01,363
- Me?
- Yes.

2429
01:26:02,163 --> 01:26:04,032
I'm Jeong.

2430
01:26:04,033 --> 01:26:05,133
Okay. Thank you.

2431
01:26:05,503 --> 01:26:08,143
(He fails.)

2432
01:26:09,203 --> 01:26:12,143
(The mission is difficult than they thought. How will it go?)

2433
01:26:12,213 --> 01:26:14,183
Run. Hurry.

2434
01:26:14,483 --> 01:26:16,013
- Run quickly.
- Hurry.

2435
01:26:17,853 --> 01:26:18,853
(Joon arrives first.)

2436
01:26:18,854 --> 01:26:20,823
- Let's see.
- Okay.

2437
01:26:21,323 --> 01:26:22,323
Good job.

2438
01:26:23,993 --> 01:26:26,393
(He took a selfie with the Miryang Park Clan?)

2439
01:26:27,323 --> 01:26:29,593
(He was looking for the Miryang Park among tourists.)

2440
01:26:30,333 --> 01:26:32,893
Is anyone from the Miryang Park Clan? Are you?

2441
01:26:33,393 --> 01:26:35,032
Could you take a selfie with me?

2442
01:26:35,033 --> 01:26:36,063
Sure.

2443
01:26:36,503 --> 01:26:38,432
- The Miryang Park Clan.
- The Miryang Park Clan.

2444
01:26:38,433 --> 01:26:39,953
(That's how he completed the mission.)

2445
01:26:40,343 --> 01:26:42,402
Se Yoon, Joon, and Seon Ho win.

2446
01:26:42,403 --> 01:26:43,912
That was crazy. It went as I planned.

2447
01:26:43,913 --> 01:26:45,819
With the members I wanted, it went as I planned.

2448
01:26:45,843 --> 01:26:47,842
(Sighing)

2449
01:26:47,843 --> 01:26:50,413
According to the result, the winning team will go to eat.

2450
01:26:51,153 --> 01:26:52,813
- I'm finally eating.
- Unbelievable.

2451
01:26:53,823 --> 01:26:54,823
- Please.
- You did well.

2452
01:26:54,824 --> 01:26:57,053
(The 36-hour fast is over.)

2453
01:26:57,193 --> 01:26:59,592
The losing team will have a meaningful time...

2454
01:26:59,593 --> 01:27:02,593
giving gifts to the residents who helped with the filming...

2455
01:27:02,763 --> 01:27:05,492
as a token of our gratitude.

2456
01:27:05,493 --> 01:27:06,732
- That's a good thing.
- How nice.

2457
01:27:06,733 --> 01:27:08,032
All right. Let's go now.

2458
01:27:08,033 --> 01:27:09,563
- Okay.
- Okay.

2459
01:27:11,133 --> 01:27:12,732
(The winning team fills their stomach, )

2460
01:27:12,733 --> 01:27:14,702
(and the losing team fills their hearts.)

2461
01:27:14,703 --> 01:27:16,043
This is fascinating.

2462
01:27:16,143 --> 01:27:18,412
- What is this? I bet it's a towel.
- Yes.

2463
01:27:18,413 --> 01:27:19,813
You three look good together.

2464
01:27:20,313 --> 01:27:21,713
You are doing a lot of good things.

2465
01:27:22,143 --> 01:27:23,553
That's Bang Wool.

2466
01:27:23,983 --> 01:27:25,052
Bang Wool.

2467
01:27:25,053 --> 01:27:26,952
He was sitting out there.

2468
01:27:26,953 --> 01:27:29,122
- That's Bang Wool.
- He was sitting out there.

2469
01:27:29,123 --> 01:27:30,652
He's so cute.

2470
01:27:30,653 --> 01:27:32,492
- Bang Wool.
- He was sitting like that?

2471
01:27:32,493 --> 01:27:34,422
- That's his spot.
- He's coming over.

2472
01:27:34,423 --> 01:27:36,662
(Dashing over to welcome the members)

2473
01:27:36,663 --> 01:27:38,632
- Look at him. He's adorable.
- What are you?

2474
01:27:38,633 --> 01:27:39,633
He's so sweet.

2475
01:27:39,634 --> 01:27:41,732
Hey, so you're the local mascot.

2476
01:27:41,733 --> 01:27:43,362
- Bang Wool.
- He's not shy at all.

2477
01:27:43,363 --> 01:27:45,773
- It takes skill to reach his belly.
- Bang Wool. Bite him.

2478
01:27:47,173 --> 01:27:48,443
Look at him.

2479
01:27:50,213 --> 01:27:54,313
(The winners head over to get breakfast.)

2480
01:27:54,413 --> 01:27:55,713
Hello?

2481
01:27:56,283 --> 01:27:57,353
Chef?

2482
01:27:57,453 --> 01:27:58,882
There's a table of food.

2483
01:27:58,883 --> 01:27:59,953
It's just the table.

2484
01:28:00,153 --> 01:28:01,552
- What's this?
- What is this?

2485
01:28:01,553 --> 01:28:05,422
(The lady was just inside getting the rice.)

2486
01:28:05,423 --> 01:28:06,452
Hello, ma'am.

2487
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:08,362
- Hello. Hurry over.
- Hello, ma'am.

2488
01:28:08,363 --> 01:28:09,462
Nice to meet you.

2489
01:28:09,463 --> 01:28:11,292
I prepared this for you.

2490
01:28:11,293 --> 01:28:12,562
- Yes.
- Our breakfast...

2491
01:28:12,563 --> 01:28:15,002
I only feed the nice ones. Not the mean ones.

2492
01:28:15,003 --> 01:28:16,733
- Move it.
- I'll help.

2493
01:28:17,133 --> 01:28:19,332
Are you the chef who cooked for us?

2494
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:20,942
- For just three.
- Just three, yes.

2495
01:28:20,943 --> 01:28:22,972
- No one else.
- Right. Just three.

2496
01:28:22,973 --> 01:28:24,072
The rest aren't nice.

2497
01:28:24,073 --> 01:28:25,512
- They're not.
- No.

2498
01:28:25,513 --> 01:28:27,243
The nice boys are here.

2499
01:28:28,013 --> 01:28:29,183
It's just us.

2500
01:28:29,313 --> 01:28:32,753
(A table full of love prepared by a lady who was on...)

2501
01:28:33,923 --> 01:28:34,952
("Korean Cuisine and Dining")

2502
01:28:34,953 --> 01:28:36,382
- My gosh. This is amazing.
- Thank you.

2503
01:28:36,383 --> 01:28:37,423
Look at everything.

2504
01:28:37,653 --> 01:28:39,693
Ma'am, all this... Is this oyster jeon?

2505
01:28:39,923 --> 01:28:41,263
The oysters look amazing.

2506
01:28:41,593 --> 01:28:42,863
It's totally...

2507
01:28:43,263 --> 01:28:45,432
These look like barnacles. What are they?

2508
01:28:45,433 --> 01:28:47,062
- They are barnacles.
- Right?

2509
01:28:47,063 --> 01:28:48,902
This is seaweed soup,

2510
01:28:48,903 --> 01:28:50,502
but what did you add? Fish?

2511
01:28:50,503 --> 01:28:51,532
I won't tell you.

2512
01:28:51,533 --> 01:28:52,533
She won't tell me.

2513
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:55,302
Come on. You're naughty.

2514
01:28:55,303 --> 01:28:56,372
This is...

2515
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:58,573
(It's a secret, but it's seaweed soup with egg.)

2516
01:28:58,713 --> 01:29:00,172
Dip this in this to eat.

2517
01:29:00,173 --> 01:29:02,543
- The citron?
- The octopus with citron?

2518
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:04,582
It'll be nice and sour.

2519
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:06,159
(Small octopus and citron combo, a speciality only in Goheung)

2520
01:29:06,183 --> 01:29:07,782
- Thanks for the food.
- Enjoy.

2521
01:29:07,783 --> 01:29:08,853
- Eat up.
- What's this?

2522
01:29:10,623 --> 01:29:13,093
- Thank you.
- Oh, my goodness.

2523
01:29:16,593 --> 01:29:18,693
You're an amazing cook.

2524
01:29:18,733 --> 01:29:19,962
Did you make all this?

2525
01:29:19,963 --> 01:29:21,262
I made it myself.

2526
01:29:21,263 --> 01:29:23,163
- Gosh.
- Everything here.

2527
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:25,073
The kimchi too?

2528
01:29:25,133 --> 01:29:26,933
The kimchi, I made over Chuseok.

2529
01:29:28,143 --> 01:29:29,543
Dip this in this.

2530
01:29:30,443 --> 01:29:32,412
- No?
- Dip it in this.

2531
01:29:32,413 --> 01:29:33,942
The octopus dip is this.

2532
01:29:33,943 --> 01:29:36,242
You have a unique recipe.

2533
01:29:36,243 --> 01:29:38,052
It's fermented because I made it during Chuseok.

2534
01:29:38,053 --> 01:29:40,052
- Gosh, it's so...
- I made it.

2535
01:29:40,053 --> 01:29:43,653
Our mothers are magicians. They can cook anything.

2536
01:29:43,853 --> 01:29:45,092
It's really good.

2537
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:46,169
(A southern meal from Yeonhong Island)

2538
01:29:46,193 --> 01:29:48,322
It's a Jeolla Province set meal.

2539
01:29:48,323 --> 01:29:49,362
- Right?
- Yes.

2540
01:29:49,363 --> 01:29:50,993
- A home-cooked meal.
- Totally.

2541
01:29:52,533 --> 01:29:54,332
- A bit of this.
- Barnacles.

2542
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:56,933
(Seasoned barnacles and rice)

2543
01:29:57,173 --> 01:29:58,373
It's perfect.

2544
01:29:58,933 --> 01:30:00,802
- Lunch...
- You must love this trip.

2545
01:30:00,803 --> 01:30:01,842
Eel.

2546
01:30:01,843 --> 01:30:03,043
(A magnificent mouthful)

2547
01:30:03,203 --> 01:30:04,713
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

2548
01:30:04,843 --> 01:30:07,143
Is this your hometown? Were you born here?

2549
01:30:08,343 --> 01:30:10,653
(Murmuring)

2550
01:30:11,053 --> 01:30:12,782
I came from Gumi. I was duped.

2551
01:30:12,783 --> 01:30:14,483
Something about a judge or prosecutor.

2552
01:30:15,253 --> 01:30:17,322
I was lied to and married the wrong guy.

2553
01:30:17,323 --> 01:30:18,922
She was duped into getting married.

2554
01:30:18,923 --> 01:30:20,622
Were you duped into marriage?

2555
01:30:20,623 --> 01:30:21,822
- Ma'am.
- What?

2556
01:30:21,823 --> 01:30:24,763
Are you a Miryang Park?

2557
01:30:25,033 --> 01:30:26,362
I'll kick out any Miryang Parks.

2558
01:30:26,363 --> 01:30:27,863
- Oh, dear.
- Sorry.

2559
01:30:28,263 --> 01:30:29,762
- I'm a Moon.
- Is it that bad?

2560
01:30:29,763 --> 01:30:32,072
- What Lee are you?
- My family name is Lee.

2561
01:30:32,073 --> 01:30:33,302
- Lee?
- What about you?

2562
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:34,672
I'm a Munhwa Ryu.

2563
01:30:34,673 --> 01:30:36,072
- I'm a Nampyeong Moon.
- No Parks here.

2564
01:30:36,073 --> 01:30:37,343
Parks, out.

2565
01:30:38,073 --> 01:30:39,743
Miryang Parks need to leave.

2566
01:30:40,043 --> 01:30:41,482
She was duped into marriage.

2567
01:30:41,483 --> 01:30:44,213
(She was conned into marrying a Park.)

2568
01:30:44,283 --> 01:30:45,913
This is a high-class joke.

2569
01:30:46,213 --> 01:30:48,183
All Miryang Parks, please leave.

2570
01:30:51,723 --> 01:30:53,222
(While Team Se Yoon enjoys a leisurely breakfast)

2571
01:30:53,223 --> 01:30:54,393
That was so funny.

2572
01:30:55,293 --> 01:30:56,562
- Excuse me.
- Bang Wool.

2573
01:30:56,563 --> 01:30:58,693
(Meanwhile, Team Jong Min)

2574
01:30:59,633 --> 01:31:01,132
Hello.

2575
01:31:01,133 --> 01:31:02,733
Hello.

2576
01:31:03,003 --> 01:31:04,372
Hello.

2577
01:31:04,373 --> 01:31:06,132
I saw you uncles on TV.

2578
01:31:06,133 --> 01:31:07,302
Yes, that's us.

2579
01:31:07,303 --> 01:31:09,103
We brought a gift to say thank-you.

2580
01:31:09,203 --> 01:31:11,442
- Thanks so much.
- They're towels.

2581
01:31:11,443 --> 01:31:13,163
(We came to say hi and give you a present.)

2582
01:31:13,373 --> 01:31:14,882
- How old is Bang Wool?
- What?

2583
01:31:14,883 --> 01:31:16,013
How old is Bang Wool?

2584
01:31:16,183 --> 01:31:18,912
It's been a few years. Three years now?

2585
01:31:18,913 --> 01:31:20,352
Three years? He's three?

2586
01:31:20,353 --> 01:31:22,822
- You're so cute.
- He's adorable.

2587
01:31:22,823 --> 01:31:24,393
You're so sweet.

2588
01:31:24,953 --> 01:31:26,753
He looks a bit like you.

2589
01:31:28,123 --> 01:31:29,892
- The face...
- You're so lovable.

2590
01:31:29,893 --> 01:31:31,263
- Bang Wool.
- He's lovely.

2591
01:31:31,393 --> 01:31:33,662
You're so cute. How can a dog be this cute?

2592
01:31:33,663 --> 01:31:35,063
It was a pleasure to meet you.

2593
01:31:35,303 --> 01:31:37,503
I hope you have a great day.

2594
01:31:37,773 --> 01:31:39,602
- Yes, thanks.
- Bye.

2595
01:31:39,603 --> 01:31:41,573
He does his thing and leaves.

2596
01:31:42,673 --> 01:31:44,072
It's a pretty big village.

2597
01:31:44,073 --> 01:31:45,243
It's big.

2598
01:31:45,713 --> 01:31:47,412
There are more houses further in.

2599
01:31:47,413 --> 01:31:48,742
(There's a lot to see on Yeonhong Island.)

2600
01:31:48,743 --> 01:31:50,243
- Excuse us.
- Is anyone home?

2601
01:31:50,813 --> 01:31:53,112
- We're here to film.
- Yes.

2602
01:31:53,113 --> 01:31:55,222
We brought a gift to thank you for cooperating.

2603
01:31:55,223 --> 01:31:56,253
Hello.

2604
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:02,062
- Here's a gift.
- Thank you.

2605
01:32:02,063 --> 01:32:05,132
- Your husband's a Miryang Park?
- Yes.

2606
01:32:05,133 --> 01:32:07,262
He was born and raised here?

2607
01:32:07,263 --> 01:32:08,332
Yes.

2608
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:10,673
Was he the first Miryang Park to come here?

2609
01:32:10,733 --> 01:32:12,603
Are you two close?

2610
01:32:13,133 --> 01:32:15,572
- Yes.
- That's why we stayed together.

2611
01:32:15,573 --> 01:32:17,103
(Yes, of course.)

2612
01:32:17,173 --> 01:32:18,742
How do you stay together...

2613
01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:20,413
Yes, for a long time and stay happy.

2614
01:32:20,543 --> 01:32:22,342
- We're both newly married.
- Yes.

2615
01:32:22,343 --> 01:32:23,442
Yes, Jong Min.

2616
01:32:23,443 --> 01:32:26,953
You need to understand each other in order to stay happy.

2617
01:32:27,053 --> 01:32:29,353
Even if they're weird, we must understand?

2618
01:32:29,783 --> 01:32:31,552
Try not to say anything negative,

2619
01:32:31,553 --> 01:32:34,123
and even if something about them gets on your nerves,

2620
01:32:34,263 --> 01:32:36,222
- you must try to understand.
- Understand them.

2621
01:32:36,223 --> 01:32:37,433
(The grooms listen carefully.)

2622
01:32:37,993 --> 01:32:39,062
I understand.

2623
01:32:39,063 --> 01:32:40,733
- Thank you.
- Stay healthy.

2624
01:32:41,503 --> 01:32:43,233
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.

2625
01:32:44,233 --> 01:32:45,973
We brought you some towels.

2626
01:32:46,203 --> 01:32:47,372
It's for the locals.

2627
01:32:47,373 --> 01:32:48,603
Are you heading somewhere?

2628
01:32:48,903 --> 01:32:50,302
- They're towels.
- Two per household.

2629
01:32:50,303 --> 01:32:51,443
They're towels.

2630
01:32:52,043 --> 01:32:53,983
Hey, it's good to see you.

2631
01:32:54,613 --> 01:32:55,642
Here.

2632
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:57,112
I wish you good health.

2633
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,812
- Have a great day.
- Thanks.

2634
01:32:58,813 --> 01:33:00,582
- Thank you.
- Bye.

2635
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:02,123
One, two, three.

2636
01:33:02,653 --> 01:33:03,653
One more.

2637
01:33:03,654 --> 01:33:05,423
(They end the trip feeling warm and fuzzy.)

2638
01:33:06,093 --> 01:33:07,993
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2639
01:33:10,393 --> 01:33:13,133
Exciting things to do that make you gape.

2640
01:33:13,663 --> 01:33:17,063
Roar! Tasty foods that'll boost your energy.

2641
01:33:17,233 --> 01:33:18,833
We're in Goheung!

2642
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:20,642
Who are we?

2643
01:33:20,643 --> 01:33:23,772
- 2 Days 1 Night!
- 1 Night!

2644
01:33:23,773 --> 01:33:27,383
(See you on the next trip.)

2645
01:33:27,613 --> 01:33:29,243
(Next episode)

2646
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:31,612
(One's status...)

2647
01:33:31,613 --> 01:33:34,223
(is determined by the heavens.)

2648
01:33:35,023 --> 01:33:36,583
(Farmhand, Nobleman)

2649
01:33:36,683 --> 01:33:38,693
(Nobleman and Farmhand)

2650
01:33:38,793 --> 01:33:41,823
(A nobleman and a farmhand have a shared fate.)

2651
01:33:42,193 --> 01:33:44,793
(To pick a nobleman of their choosing, )

2652
01:33:45,093 --> 01:33:47,603
(they participate in a fierce battle of charms.)

2653
01:33:47,803 --> 01:33:48,933
Why are you like this?

2654
01:33:49,733 --> 01:33:51,633
(Run faster!)

2655
01:33:52,133 --> 01:33:56,943
(The noblemen and farmhands' unbelievable teamwork)

2656
01:33:58,013 --> 01:34:00,373
(However, the farmhands...)

2657
01:34:00,583 --> 01:34:02,513
(fight hard to improve their status.)

2658
01:34:03,243 --> 01:34:05,313
(What fate will befall them?)

2659
01:34:06,283 --> 01:34:08,483
(See you next week.)
