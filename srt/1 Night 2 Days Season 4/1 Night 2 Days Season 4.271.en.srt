1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:08,050
(A temple settles in a crook
of Namhan River)

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,320
(The river breeze
rings the wind chimes,)

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,990
(and your soul feels rested here.)

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,960
There's a place like this in Yeoju?

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,560
- No way.
- It's so nice.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,290
What's this? A twisted donut tree?

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,730
(Exclaiming in awe)

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,460
How can you see a tree like this...

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,430
- and think of twisted donuts?
- It's twisted like one.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,570
What is this tree?

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,040
What is this really?

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,540
It's no joke.

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,570
(They notice
an incredibly tall tree.)

14
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,840
This is amazing.

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,140
- Is it a ginkgo tree?
- Yes.

16
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,450
It has been in this spot
for over 660 years.

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,750
This tree protects Silleuk Temple.

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,880
It's a ginkgo tree.

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,320
(Tree protected by Silleuk Temple)

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,950
Back in the time
of Silla's King Jinpyeong,

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,890
the Venerable Wonhyo established...

22
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,960
Skull water.

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,190
You know some history.

24
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,990
This is Silleuk Temple
with a thousand years of history.

25
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,060
(Silleuk Temple,
a history of 1,000 years)

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,730
(Multi-story brick pagoda,
a national treasure)

27
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,400
(Josadang Shrine,
a national treasure)

28
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,140
(Multi-story stone pagoda,
a national treasure)

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,670
(A treasure trove
of national heritage)

30
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,280
That's amazing. It's 660 years old.

31
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,150
Gosh, 660 years?

32
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,880
(The tree saw many seasons...)

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,350
(through its life
that spanned over six centuries.)

34
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,450
It would've seen all the kings
over six centuries.

35
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,260
- Yes.
- The kings would've come here.

36
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,520
- That's right.
- Hey.

37
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,660
Hang on.

38
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,030
The photo shows...

39
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,160
- Buddha's hands.
- Where?

40
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,400
- Here it is.
- Between the branches.

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,530
- There.
- That's it.

42
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,530
That's it.

43
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,670
- Where?
- It's Buddha?

44
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,830
- No.
- The praying hands.

45
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,900
- No.
- Yes, that's it.

46
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,970
- That.
- That's it.

47
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,770
- It's between the branches.
- Those are the hands.

48
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,870
That's Buddha?

49
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,170
- Yes.
- Oh, I see it now.

50
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,580
(It's similar!)

51
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,810
Did someone put that there?

52
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,380
- No, that's natural.
- You're right.

53
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,010
- Did that grow naturally?
- Yes, of course.

54
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,220
- That's nature.
- It sprouted out.

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,720
Yes. My gosh, that's beautiful.

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,320
So it was formed naturally.

57
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,390
- Look.
- My gosh.

58
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,390
(Exuding a mystical vibe in spades)

59
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,860
You know, it's not like that.

60
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,360
"Honey, look where I am."

61
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,300
- "Honey."
- Is it a video?

62
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,070
"I'll pray
while looking at the Buddha statue."

63
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,970
"This is my first shoot
as a married man."

64
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,740
- "Honey. This week..."
- Yes, that's true.

65
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
- Right.
- My gosh.

66
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,040
(He's happy even when he's teased.)

67
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,380
I'm so happy.

68
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,840
(We wish you a long marriage.)

69
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,310
(While wishing Jong Min
a happy marriage...)

70
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,950
There's a gazebo...

71
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,980
- with an amazing view.
- Really?

72
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,250
- Is that so?
- We'll start there today.

73
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,790
- Check out the ship over there.
- Where?

74
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,260
- It reminds me of the old days.
- My gosh.

75
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,430
- Isn't that a turtle ship?
- Do ships like that still exist?

76
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,130
This is the charm of Yeoju.

77
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,230
Gosh, I love that.

78
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey, this place is beautiful.

79
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,430
("As Yeoju has flat fields
with mountains far away,")

80
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,300
("it's been praised as the perfect
paradise for mankind.")

81
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,040
(From Yi Chung Hwan's "Taekriji")

82
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,610
(The blessed environment that grew
the rice the kings consumed)

83
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,510
How could it be this gorgeous?

84
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,580
- Gosh, it's so beautiful.
- Korea has many beautiful cities.

85
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,610
Of course.

86
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,320
(The spectacular scenery
fills them with awe.)

87
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,790
(It's also nicknamed
a roofless museum.)

88
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,860
(The city renowned
for its history and cultural assets)

89
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,330
We'll be traveling Yeoju
in Gyeonggi Province today.

90
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,660
- Yeoju.
- Yes.

91
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,530
I didn't know there was
a stunning place like this in Yeoju.

92
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,530
I wanted to
come down here yesterday.

93
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,800
Why do you keep trying
to come the day before?

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,040
But everyone stopped me.

95
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,410
Maybe, your wife found it odd
that you weren't leaving.

96
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,540
- My wife went on a trip...
- Is that what happened?

97
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,710
with her friends.

98
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,740
- I see.
- So yesterday...

99
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,080
Didn't she go on a trip
two weeks ago?

100
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,180
- Does she go on trips regularly?
- I... Listen.

101
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,180
You travel a lot too.

102
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,250
- What kind of marriage do you have?
- No.

103
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,380
- Your wife travels frequently too.
- Here's the thing.

104
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,650
I'm always gone...

105
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,320
- for 3 days and 2 nights.
- Okay.

106
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,420
She naturally assumed that
I'd be gone for the same duration.

107
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,620
So my wife went on a trip
to a nearby city with her friends.

108
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,390
When I told her I wasn't leaving
the night before, she was flustered.

109
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,860
So she goes on a trip
every two weeks.

110
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,100
I told her to have fun
and enjoy her time with her friends.

111
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
- Really?
- Yes.

112
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,270
In a way, we're traveling
just like your wife.

113
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,870
- Of course.
- Yes.

114
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,570
We're both traveling,
but we're in different cities.

115
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,340
I think we can invite her
to our show sometime.

116
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,610
- Who? My wife?
- Yes.

117
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,540
- I'm sure she'll say yes now.
- Well, she can join us.

118
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,940
But what will she do here?

119
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,650
- She can come to the shoot. But...
- She can look around.

120
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,710
- She can go sightseeing.
- Sightseeing?

121
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,950
- Maybe, your wife can join too.
- Who?

122
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,650
- Let's do the Wife Special.
- My gosh.

123
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,650
- Yes.
- The Wife Special.

124
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,950
- My gosh.
- Se Yoon's wife can join us too.

125
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,990
- Gosh, that sounds fun.
- No.

126
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,960
- I recently met his wife.
- Yes.

127
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,290
- Did you guys meet up?
- We did.

128
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,290
- Did you meet up?
- Yes.

129
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,460
No, he was performing
at an event in my neighborhood.

130
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,560
- Yes.
- Right.

131
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,260
I walked to the event.

132
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,600
- My kids wanted to meet him too.
- Really?

133
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,400
- I introduced them to him.
- He's such a family man.

134
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
Gosh, he worked hard.

135
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,010
Did you give some pocket money
to his son?

136
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,370
- Oh, no. I didn't.
- Gosh.

137
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,480
(Embarrassed)

138
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,980
But still. You met Se Yoon's kids
for the first time.

139
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
(I'm glad you asked him, DinDin.)

140
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,210
- I'll give it to them next time.
- That's funny.

141
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,120
Give them some pocket money
once you get paid for the event.

142
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,650
- Yes. I didn't get paid yet.
- Sure.

143
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,050
(I didn't get paid
for the event yet.)

144
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,050
- So this is the first shoot ...
- What?

145
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,960
- after Jong Min's wedding.
- His first shoot.

146
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,720
- My gosh.
- The newlywed!

147
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,030
- That's how we'll start.
- Thank you.

148
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,660
So many people congratulated me.

149
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,660
- The wedding was a week ago?
- Yes.

150
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,900
- Our episode...
- By the time this episode airs?

151
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,630
will air on April 27.

152
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,130
- It's been 1 week.
- It's been 1 week, right?

153
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,640
- Not yet.
- How did this week go for you?

154
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,900
I love it. I'm so happy.

155
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,310
- I'm always hugging her and stuff.
- Gosh. Really?

156
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,410
(Imagining his married life)

157
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,540
You know how it is.

158
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,310
(This is the honeymoon phase.)

159
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,250
It's so funny how he's living
to match the show's timeline.

160
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,680
- Jong Min was so cool.
- My gosh.

161
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,650
After the wedding,
he returned our cash gifts.

162
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,290
- He said...
- He returned them to us?

163
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,320
- he couldn't accept ours.
- Because we're like a family.

164
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,560
- We're a family.
- Yes.

165
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
- I was so embarrassed...
- Right.
because I accepted their cash gifts.

166
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,830
- But Jong Min returned our gifts.
- Right.

167
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,160
- You're so generous indeed.
- Seriously.

168
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,200
- Gosh. I returned the cash gifts.
- Exactly.

169
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,700
But the directors and writers
gave me very generous cash gifts.

170
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,470
Really? How much did they give you?

171
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,570
- How much did they give you?
- Jong Hyun...

172
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,880
Jong Min, I heard the biggest cash gift
was from the staff.

173
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Jong Hyun gave me
about 10,000 dollars.

174
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
(Jong Hyun gave me
about 10,000 dollars.)

175
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,250
(Laughing)

176
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,580
- I did?
- You're so generous.

177
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,920
(I did?)

178
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,020
- I knew it.
- Yes. At celebrities' weddings...

179
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,660
At these weddings...

180
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,790
- Gosh, okay.
- He gave me...

181
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,860
- his entire paycheck.
- Yes.

182
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,860
- That's amazing.
- He gave you a lot of money.

183
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,960
We should call him
10,000-Dollar Jong Hyun.

184
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,160
- The 10,000-Dollar Jong Hyun.
- The 10,000-Dollar Jong Hyun.

185
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
(Sighing)

186
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,060
- Here's the theme of today's trip.
- Yes.

187
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,430
Let's Show off Yeoju.

188
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,000
- Show off Yeoju.
- That's nice.

189
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,070
You must show the viewers...

190
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,670
- different charms of Yeoju.
- That's right.

191
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,940
- Yeoju.
- All right. Today,

192
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,140
you will split into 2 teams of 3.

193
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,850
- It's been a while.
- You'll travel with your teams.

194
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,980
- Gosh.
- Sounds good.

195
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,680
You will get to
travel all over Yeoju.

196
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,080
And the losing team...

197
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,580
- This is the important part.
- What is it?

198
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
- Tomorrow...
- Is there a scary penalty?

199
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,250
- What's happening tomorrow?
- This will continue until tomorrow?

200
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,190
You will have to complete...

201
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,120
an additional activity in Yeoju
which will shock you...

202
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,160
- After the shoot?
- for losing.

203
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
- After everything?
- Yes.

204
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,830
I bet Joon wants to win this again.

205
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,200
The getting-off-work mission
stresses him out.

206
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,770
I've been on the rise lately.

207
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,530
- On the rise? Rise to what?
- Gosh.

208
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,730
- Rise to what?
- Why are you rising?

209
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,670
I've become so competitive.
I really want to win.

210
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,440
I watched the episodes,
and I was awful at these games.

211
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,640
Watching myself on TV
was so frustrating.

212
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,310
- I mean, it was me.
- You were frustrated with yourself?

213
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,280
I was like, "What's wrong with me?"

214
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,850
So I thought
I should do well next time.

215
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,310
My parents are grateful
to you because...

216
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,050
- things have gotten easier for me.
- Exactly.

217
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,190
Do you know how many people
are looking down on me now?

218
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,350
When they asked me why I played
like that, I couldn't answer them.

219
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,490
- Right.
- My gosh.

220
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,520
- I'm going to work really hard.
- You want to win and get off work.

221
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,660
Yes. I'll get off work early,
no matter what.

222
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,530
- It's a team battle.
- Teams will play a crucial role.

223
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,660
- They'll be important.
- They will be so important.

224
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,360
I told you earlier that...

225
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,100
it was believed that
Silleuk Temple was...

226
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,470
- established by Venerable Wonhyo.
- Yes.

227
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,240
As you mentioned earlier,
Venerable Wonhyo is known...

228
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,140
- for the water-in-a-skull story.
- Water in a skull.

229
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,640
- Do you know the story?
- Yes, I do.

230
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,340
- You are Historian Kim, after all.
- Of course.

231
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,380
Could you tell us the story?

232
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,750
Go over the story. They'll add
some music to your narration.

233
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,610
- He was sleeping in a cave.
- Yes.

234
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,820
He was thirsty,
so he drank some water.

235
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,220
(The water tastes so refreshing.)

236
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,920
When daylight broke,
he figured out that it was a skull.

237
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,230
- So...
- The water became skull?

238
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,630
If you can't see it
and don't know what it is,

239
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,830
you won't know what it is
when you drink it.

240
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,830
Isn't that the moral of the story?

241
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,530
The water tasted so sweet at night.

242
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,770
- Could you make it sound fancier?
- Okay.

243
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,340
No.

244
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,970
- I see.
- I'm sorry.

245
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,610
- Everything...
- I don't get it at all.

246
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,040
- What's the story about?
- So this is the story.

247
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,370
- It depends on your mindset.
- Listen. It's about your mindset.

248
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,410
- Right.
- Yes.

249
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,140
"All is shaped by the heart."

250
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,280
- "All is shaped by the heart."
- "All is shaped by the heart."

251
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

252
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,720
So you will split into two teams...

253
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,850
by the Random Game
of Water in a Skull.

254
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,520
- We'll drink water from a skull?
- If we get it right...

255
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,720
- All right. Bring them in.
- Gosh.

256
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,290
(The skulls filled with water
are brought in.)

257
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,760
By the way, it smells great.

258
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,830
- They must be sports drinks.
- Right. They are sports drinks.

259
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,060
Those who pick tasty drinks
will team up together.

260
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,200
- Those with duds will team up.
- I see. Team Tasty Drinks.

261
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,600
That's how you'll divide
into two teams.

262
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,670
What's in the dud drink?

263
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,200
You didn't pour liquid detergent
or anything, right?

264
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,210
- Like washer fluid?
- Like washer fluid?

265
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,270
- Like washer fluid?
- Like washer fluid.

266
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,440
We're not going to start foaming
around our mouth, right?

267
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,710
Gosh, that sounds fun.

268
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,940
- "All is shaped by the heart."
- That sounds fun.

269
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,010
- Pretend it's tasty.
- If you think it's tasty...

270
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,050
- Then it will be fine?
- That's what you need to do.

271
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,650
- He asked if it was washer fluid.
- Washer fluid versus sports drinks.

272
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,750
(We just added a lot of salt.
That's all.)

273
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,820
Does it have detergent?

274
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,220
There's a bug in one of the skulls.
Is it okay?

275
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,450
There's a bug?

276
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,890
- It's also part of the game.
- See if you can avoid that one.

277
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,190
- "All is shaped by the heart."
- "All is shaped by the heart."

278
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,560
- Have it without thinking about it.
- Yes.

279
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,930
Can I go first?

280
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,460
Seeing how there's a bug,
this must be a sweet drink.

281
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,030
- My gosh.
- Really?

282
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,660
- The bug...
- Yes.

283
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,270
- Okay. Why don't you drink it up?
- Bottoms up.

284
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,330
- Bottoms up.
- Is that really a bug?

285
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,470
You can't smell it.

286
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,770
- I'll drink it.
- Go ahead.

287
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,540
- Yes. That must be the good one.
- Okay.

288
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,570
- Okay.
- It must be washer fluid.

289
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,270
What's in it?
Why are they giving us the bucket?

290
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,680
Have you ever seen him
spit out drinks?

291
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,010
- Let me drink it.
- Yes.

292
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,510
- Drink it up. Come on.
- When there are three left...

293
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,750
Okay.

294
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,750
(Gulping down)

295
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,220
- No way.
- Gosh, that's a sports drink.

296
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,650
- Gosh.
- It must be tasty.

297
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,750
No way.

298
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,820
(Is it a sweet drink in a skull?
Or a salty drink in a skull?)

299
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,390
(Frowning)

300
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,360
- Yes, he picked the good one.
- He's putting on an act in a while.

301
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,260
- How tasty.
- I knew it. Okay.

302
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,260
(He's putting on an act in a while.)

303
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,600
(The line, "How tasty," was
delivered with excellent acting.)

304
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,130
- That's why there was a bug in it.
- The bug...

305
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,740
Wait. I ate the bug.
Hey, I drank it up.

306
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,840
- Is it good?
- Yes, this is good.

307
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,040
"All is shaped by the heart."

308
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,570
We got rid of it
just in case you got sick.

309
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,110
(I'm still happy
even if I ate the bug.)

310
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,740
- Gosh, Sae Ho is lucky.
- What?

311
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,110
- Why don't you go, Mr. Husband?
- Go with this one.

312
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,250
Don't you think
sports drinks would be together?

313
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,380
- In this order?
- No way.

314
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,750
- I don't think so.
- They'd never do that.

315
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,990
(They won't make it that easy.)

316
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,990
- Number four...
- My gosh.

317
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,760
Number four
looks too refreshing, right?

318
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,860
- I can't tell them apart at all.
- I have no idea.

319
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,030
They look exactly the same.

320
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,460
(Even the master of random draws
is struggling to tell them apart.)

321
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,860
- I have no idea.
- I figured it out.

322
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,960
- I got it out. I'll take this one.
- I figured it out.

323
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
- I got it.
- Really?

324
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,970
- Yes.
- How did he figure it out?

325
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,630
- I got the feeling.
- I think I figured it out too.

326
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,070
One of them looks different.

327
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,070
- They look exactly the same.
- Really?
- One of the four...
- Clear ones...

328
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,370
Clear ones must be good, right?

329
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,940
You should've chosen a similar one.

330
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,940
- All right. The bucket.
- Three versus three.

331
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,210
- Hey, you touched it.
- No.

332
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,680
- No.
- No.

333
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,110
You already smelled it.

334
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,020
- Okay.
- Okay.

335
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,020
Okay.

336
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,750
- All right.
- Drink it up.

337
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,050
Bottoms up.

338
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,620
(He drinks it up
without hesitation.)

339
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,920
- Gosh, he got it.
- That's a sports drink.

340
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,160
He's already spitting it out.

341
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,360
- Gosh.
- What is that?

342
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,860
Look. He's going to act now.

343
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,600
- Gosh, it's so salty!
- My gosh.

344
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,070
(He's not acting.
Salt has struck down his tongue.)

345
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,540
- Is it salty?
- Here I go.

346
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,540
- Gosh, that's so salty.
- Okay.

347
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,810
- Here I go.
- Let's keep the game clean.

348
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,410
- I'll go with Number One.
- My gosh.

349
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,540
I'm a man.
So I'll go with Number One.

350
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,880
- Okay.
- I was going to pick Number One.

351
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,380
(In pain)

352
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,150
(I, Lim Cheol, will drink it
bravely like a real man.)

353
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,920
Think about the time
when your number was one in school.

354
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,950
Okay.

355
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,190
I bet his number was one in school.

356
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,320
- He must've chosen the good one.
- He's acting.

357
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,490
- He's obviously acting.
- I think he chose the salty one.

358
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,120
- No.
- Gosh.

359
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,360
He didn't pick the right one.

360
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,730
Wait.

361
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,030
- He didn't pick the right one.
- Hey.

362
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,430
(You can't spit it out.)

363
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,270
No, he's acting.

364
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,470
- No.
- It's a sports drink.

365
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,000
His face is getting red.

366
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,470
(That wasn't an act.)

367
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,780
(I can spit it on you.)

368
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,150
- How did they make this?
- Gosh, it's so salty.

369
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,350
- What did they add?
- Is it salt?

370
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,180
- This is crazy.
- I'll go next.

371
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,180
- Go for it.
- Gosh.

372
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,290
Let's all go for it together.

373
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,390
- Yes. Let's do it.
- Let's do it together.

374
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,060
- Let's do it together.
- It's way too salty.

375
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,490
- Hey, it's so salty.
- Okay.

376
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,490
My gosh.

377
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,730
- How did you make this?
- I really have no idea.

378
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,130
All right. Bottoms up.

379
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,460
- I hope Joon joins us.
- Cheers.

380
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,660
- We need someone strong.
- The three of us would make...

381
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,660
a great team, right?

382
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,500
Joon. My gosh.

383
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,400
(Wincing)

384
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,800
- It's Se Yoon.
- No, he'll probably pass.

385
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,370
- No, I think it's Seon Ho.
- It's fine as long as it's not him.

386
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,770
It's Seon Ho.

387
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,840
(Jong Min, it's me.)

388
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,510
- My gosh, come on.
- Yes!

389
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,350
- Yes.
- Okay.

390
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,020
- All right!
- He spat it on me.

391
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,380
- Come on.
- The three of us.

392
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,450
- Yes.
- All right.

393
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,590
- It's the three of us.
- Nice.

394
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,220
That's the weakest team.
We'll win for sure.

395
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,360
- Okay. Let's do this.
- I got a good feeling about this.

396
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,420
- We're pretty powerful.
- Yes.

397
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,760
- My gosh.
- Okay.

398
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,290
- We're in trouble.
- Seon Ho is single-handedly...

399
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,660
making us look weak.

400
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,730
- Why do we look so weak?
- What about me?

401
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,870
- I can be strong too.
- We're the weakest team now.

402
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,200
- I can be strong.
- It will be a tough one for DinDin.

403
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,200
Jong Min, DinDin,
and Seon Ho will team up.

404
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
- Okay.
- And...

405
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,810
Se Yoon, Sae Ho, and Joon
will team up.

406
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,910
- We need to be clever about this.
- So...

407
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,580
these will be the teams
for today's trip.

408
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,810
(Jong Min, DinDin, Seon Ho
versus Se Yoon, Sae Ho, and Joon)

409
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,250
(There are beautiful parts
of Korea...)

410
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,950
(we know...)

411
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:31,890
(and we don't know.)

412
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,430
- That's it!
- This is amazing!

413
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,730
(These cheerful six guys
are set out to travel...)

414
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,130
(on Korea's best...)

415
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,300
(real...)

416
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,000
(wild...)

417
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:57,550
(road variety show.)

418
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,720
- Here it goes
- Here it goes

419
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,890
(The 2-days-1-night trip is more fun
because they're together.)

420
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,130
- Who are we?
- 2 Days...

421
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,860
- and 1 Night!
- And 1 Night!

422
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,130
(2 Days and 1 Night in Yeoju)

423
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,130
(The trip will begin now.)

424
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,210
(2 Days and 1 Night)

425
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,170
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

426
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,580
Hey, wait up for me.

427
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,310
- Where are we going?
- My gosh. A suspension bridge?

428
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,410
What kind of bridge is this?
Wait, we can walk there.

429
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,950
- Okay. There's a suspension bridge.
- My gosh, this is amazing.

430
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,490
- That looks scary.
- Look at that.

431
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,020
The bridge looks pretty solid.
Is it going to shake?

432
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,450
Really?
The bridge is going to shake?

433
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,220
- It looks solid.
- Right? It looks firm.

434
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,860
Everyone,
you can get on the elevator.

435
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,860
- We'll get on the elevator?
- Okay.

436
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,630
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
Two losers will take the stairs.

437
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,760
- To make it fun.
- Yes. To make it fun.

438
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,570
Two of us... Yes, the last two
will take the stairs.

439
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,000
What? Come on. You can't do that.

440
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,440
- What?
- You can take the stairs.

441
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,270
- Hurry. Get in.
- Okay. Thank you.

442
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,110
(What kind of view will unfold
on the 2nd floor?)

443
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,580
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

444
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,810
Gosh, so this is the Namhan River?

445
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,910
- The suspension bridge.
- Yeoju Namhangang...

446
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,910
Suspension Bridge.

447
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,980
- My gosh, Jong Min.
- Goodness.

448
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,250
- This is amazing.
- Look at the view.

449
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,850
It's Korea's very first bridge
that cuts across the Han River.

450
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,650
- It's an urban suspension bridge.
- My gosh.

451
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,990
This is beautiful.

452
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,830
(A different view unfolds
when the sun goes down.)

453
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,160
You can check out key tourist spots
in Yeoju at a glance.

454
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,600
- Let's cross the bridge.
- Sounds good.

455
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,500
- Can you do it, Jong Min?
- I'm not sure.

456
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,130
- It does look sturdy.
- Gosh, no.

457
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,140
This kind of thing doesn't scare him
now that he's married.

458
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,770
- Right.
- He has a family now.

459
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,140
His family is watching now.

460
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,710
He has a family to protect now.

461
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,340
(Screaming)

462
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,750
(He hasn't changed.)

463
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,080
Hey, it is shaking indeed.

464
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,880
Hey, I don't think
we can goof around here.

465
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,890
(Please don't do that.)

466
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,720
(Really?)

467
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,560
Gosh, by the way, it does look scary
when you look down.

468
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,300
Gosh, this is crazy.

469
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,430
Jong Min, look down.

470
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,000
- Don't look down, Jong Min.
- My gosh.

471
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,200
Jong Min,
you have a family to protect now.

472
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,470
Exactly. It's too dangerous
for a family man.

473
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,040
It's really high up.

474
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
(Satisfied)

475
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,310
- Come on.
- Please.

476
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,410
- Are you putting on an act?
- Okay.

477
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,710
- Okay. Yes, it's an act.
- The spotlight is on Jong Min.

478
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,910
He's going to start acting now.

479
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,080
- Stay with the group.
- My gosh, don't grab me.

480
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,910
- Just go. I got it.
- Go and join them.

481
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,390
(Thud)

482
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,760
He needs to get injured or something
when he goofs around like that.

483
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,820
(Annoyed)

484
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,590
So this is the Namhan River?

485
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,890
- Yes, it's the Namhan River.
- The Namhan River.

486
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,930
Gosh, what a stunning view.

487
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:23,960
(An unobstructed view of the river)

488
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,300
Gosh, this place looks amazing.

489
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,470
Hey, the gazebo we were at
looks amazing from here.

490
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,470
Right.

491
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,270
It feels like
we're back in the old days.

492
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,740
The old days?

493
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,410
(A view of the tranquil river
from the old days)

494
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,280
- What's that?
- What is that?

495
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,510
I think I saw something like this
in another country.

496
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,510
(What's this?)

497
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,750
(Is that a media glass
on the bridge?)

498
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,550
I see pictures on the glass.

499
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,590
It must be an LED screen.

500
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,520
- Gosh, this is beautiful.
- That's the suspension bridge.

501
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,460
When I step on this...

502
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,590
- What's wrong?
- What is it?

503
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,800
(Did Sae Ho cause trouble?)

504
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,460
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

505
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
- The glass is breaking.
- Hey.

506
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,130
- It's breaking.
- Gosh.

507
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,270
Hey, be careful.

508
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,540
Sae Ho, please be careful.

509
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,670
- Gosh.
- Over here.

510
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,470
(Making a fuss)

511
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,110
I think this part broke for real
because of Se Yoon.

512
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,540
That's the broken-glass feature.

513
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,910
(Shattering)

514
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,950
- Kids would love it here.
- Yes.

515
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,050
This is fun.

516
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,480
It's nice when you put
a bit of acting into it.

517
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,580
(Joon loves it too.)

518
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,650
Hold on. I see another installation.

519
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,850
(What is it this time?)

520
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,860
What's this?

521
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,920
It says this is...

522
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,390
the scariest suspension bridge
in Korea.

523
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,960
- It's the proposal zone.
- The proposal zone?

524
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,030
"In 1974, Canadian psychologists,
Donald Dutton and Arthur Aron..."

525
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,970
"published research showing that
the tension..."

526
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,640
"from the thrill
of crossing a suspension bridge..."

527
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,310
- "can heighten feelings of love."
- Because their hearts will race.

528
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,670
So it's believed that...

529
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,610
no couples break up
when they confess their love here.

530
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,610
- Right.
- I see.

531
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,750
Imagine if you proposed to her here.

532
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,450
- You should've done it here.
- How great would that have been?

533
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,180
You need to propose to her now.

534
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,580
- Do it.
- Let's film it.

535
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,020
- Someone should film it.
- You should scream into the air.

536
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,490
- Propose to her.
- Say...

537
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,590
(He screams first.)

538
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,920
"Will you marry me?"

539
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,290
Will you marry me?

540
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,460
(Where is he looking at?)

541
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,760
(Will you marry me?)

542
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,660
- She already married you.
- Right.

543
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,000
(The newlywed
shyly confesses his love to her.)

544
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,070
Will you marry me?

545
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,330
Louder!

546
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,140
Will you marry me?

547
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,170
Yes.

548
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,910
This will be a nice spot
for couples...

549
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,070
who are engaged.

550
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,170
The next person to get married...

551
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,010
- should propose to her here.
- This is a great spot.

552
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,810
Shall we get going?

553
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,950
(What's next?)

554
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,420
I think
it's the longest suspension bridge.

555
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,250
We're going to do something here.

556
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,050
It looks like
they set up something here.

557
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,360
I'm 100 percent sure
we're doing something here.

558
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,020
DinDin. Let's win. I'm serious.

559
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,490
Let's do it.

560
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,800
Gosh, that was nothing.

561
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,360
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

562
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,630
- It must be so long.
- I'm fine.

563
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,370
Jong Min got used to the bridge
on the way here.

564
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,530
(It's too long that he overcame...)

565
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,670
(his fear of heights
while walking on the bridge.)

566
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,440
- What? It's not over yet.
- It's not over yet.

567
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,640
- There's more.
- There's more left.

568
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,170
- We're at the two-thirds point.
- Gosh.

569
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,910
- Really?
- This bridge is so long.

570
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,580
- Let's do...
- Okay.

571
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,780
- our first mission here.
- Sounds good.

572
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,080
Bring it in.

573
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,420
- We must destroy their confidence.
- Bring what in?

574
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,420
- What's that?
- Great.

575
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,650
- Is it a computer?
- What is it?

576
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,250
- The one that raises heart rates?
- What's that?

577
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,350
(Computer-looking things
are brought in.)

578
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,420
Oh, that?
The one that raises heart rates?

579
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,090
- What's that?
- I guess we have to provoke them...

580
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,530
to get their heart rate up.

581
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,390
(What's wrong with this guy?)

582
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,160
- He ruined the surprise.
- I already saw them yesterday.

583
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,530
- Really?
- Did he really...

584
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,030
get his hands on the script?

585
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,130
No.

586
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,940
Actually, it's a bit iffy
to talk about this.

587
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,840
This might put Sae Ho
in a tight spot.

588
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
- What is it?
- I see.

589
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,170
- Yesterday...
- Did you come here?

590
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,610
Park Bo Gum is hosting...

591
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,010
- "The Seasons."
- Yes.

592
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,310
- I had a preliminary meeting.
- Yes.

593
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,380
Since I was at the KBS building,
I was reminded of our staff.

594
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,150
I bought about 20 cups of coffee...

595
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,220
- and went to their office.
- I see.

596
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,720
That's the custom.

597
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,250
When we go to "Gag Concert,"

598
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,190
- we always bring coffee for them.
- I see.

599
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,460
I went to their office
to drop off some coffee.

600
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,830
That's when I saw these machines.

601
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,490
I said, "Sae Ho
must've brought you coffee too."

602
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,260
(Shaking his head)

603
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,360
I see. Really?

604
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,730
(He was on "The Seasons"
a while ago.)

605
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,770
- What? What do you want?
- You know...

606
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,370
- You know, it's customary.
- You didn't bring them coffee?

607
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,070
- I see.
- When I'm at the KBS building,

608
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,710
I always buy coffee for them.

609
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,710
- Right.
- I see.

610
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,780
- You didn't bring them coffee?
- You have to.

611
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,310
You guys can afford coffee,
can't you?

612
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,850
(He likes to eradicate
outdated customs.)

613
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,980
- You can afford it, right?
- Yes.

614
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,010
You can.

615
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,420
- He has a lot of money.
- It's...

616
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,720
He gave me a generous cash gift.

617
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,890
(Thank you for the 10,000 dollars.)

618
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,290
Okay. This mission will take place
on the suspension bridge.

619
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,190
It's called
Pitter-Pattering Because of You.

620
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,190
- Okay.
- I see.

621
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,660
A representative of each team
will step forward.

622
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,360
To win,
you must provoke your opponent...

623
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,630
so that his siren goes off more
in three minutes.

624
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,240
(The team whose siren goes off more
will lose the mission.)

625
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,700
The heart rates are different
for everyone.

626
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,070
The siren will go off...

627
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,810
when your heart rate rises...

628
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,410
by ten beats
above your average heart rate.

629
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,280
The winning team of this mission...

630
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,080
will take the clean, spacious SUV.

631
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,950
The losing team will take
the cozy compact car...

632
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,620
to go to the next spot.

633
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,420
Hold on. How should we do this?

634
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,620
Should we criticize and mock them?
Or what should we do?

635
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,320
- That will be the case.
- You know what I think?

636
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,590
Jong Min is used to hearing
criticism and being teased.

637
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,630
Their team...

638
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,330
Right?

639
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,060
I guess they came up with a plan.

640
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,270
(Laughing
to make them feel insecure)

641
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,300
What's going on?

642
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,370
You guys are in big trouble now.

643
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,440
(I've been teased for 17 years.)

644
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,740
(It would take a lot
to fluster Jong Min with teasing.)

645
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,450
(The original heart of steel
on 2 Days and 1 Night)

646
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,720
(And the opponent
going up against him)

647
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,750
Look at you. That's a bright color.

648
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,420
- I need to take off my jacket.
- My gosh.

649
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,520
- The forsythia man is here.
- Yes, forsythia.

650
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,760
(Forsythia Gentleman, Cho Sae Ho)

651
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,320
- It was here.
- Sae Ho.

652
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,060
(Every day of his life is filled
with a series of wronged moments.)

653
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:30,700
(Numerous humiliating moments
trained him to be...)

654
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,800
Please!

655
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,040
(the new heart of steel
on 2 Days and 1 Night.)

656
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,270
(The players step up.)

657
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,410
- You got this.
- Sae Ho, you're our hope.

658
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,580
- Wait.
- Hey.

659
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,910
- Let's keep our manners.
- Of course.

660
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,450
- I don't play dirty.
- Let's play fair.

661
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,450
- Okay.
- I'm sure you know that.

662
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,880
- No personal attacks.
- Never.

663
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,520
- We can just have a conversation.
- Of course.

664
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,950
We can still make it funny.

665
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,090
- Of course.
- Okay.

666
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,220
Can you give me the chair?

667
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,520
The chair? My gosh. Sure.

668
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,920
- Give me the chair.
- Okay.

669
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,430
(Pulling back)

670
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,100
(Moving it to the back
without Sae Ho's knowledge)

671
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,930
(Laughing)

672
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,130
- Of course.
- Okay.

673
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,500
(What?)

674
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,270
(Startled)

675
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,370
- Okay.
- Give me the chair.

676
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,440
Okay.

677
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,580
We've known each other
for a long time.

678
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
That's right.

679
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,850
Jong Min's heart rate is 85.
Sae Ho's heart rate is 88. Go.

680
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,180
(It begins!)

681
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,480
You have no idea
how grateful I am to your wife...

682
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,850
- that she married you.
- Yes.

683
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,990
- There's so much you must learn.
- Yes.

684
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,120
Remember? A while ago,
when we finished filming the show,

685
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,820
- Right.
- I went inside to take a shower.

686
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,830
When I went in...

687
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,090
(What's he going to talk about?)

688
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,900
I left my underwear outside
when I went in for a shower.

689
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,230
But when I came out, it was gone.

690
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,570
- My gosh.
- I wondered who wore my underwear.

691
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,970
(Sae Ho's underwear thief
was Jong Min?)

692
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,670
Why is your heart rate going up?

693
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,540
- It's because you're making it up.
- No.

694
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,180
(Why is the storyteller
more nervous?)

695
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,840
(It's because you're making it up.)

696
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,350
- It's because of him.
- Right.

697
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,520
But are you still a kleptomaniac?

698
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,790
- It seems like...
- Someone hit him...

699
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,590
- for stealing.
- He's calling Jong Min a thief.

700
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,160
You're making up the whole thing.

701
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,090
I was wondering
if you were still kleptomaniac.

702
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,190
- I hope that you'll get treatment.
- Okay.

703
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,430
- I'll get myself treated.
- Go ahead and talk.

704
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,260
By the way, is that even a face?

705
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,000
(Is that even a face?)

706
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
(Is that even a face?)

707
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,540
Is that even a face?

708
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,440
(Making a vulgar attack abruptly)

709
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,170
- Is that your face?
- My wife...

710
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,340
- Is that your face?
- My wife told me...

711
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,080
that she fell in love with me
for my looks.

712
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,650
- I'm so grateful to her.
- Yes.

713
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,150
It seems like
she's accommodating to you.

714
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,580
(The siren went off twice.
At this rate, Sae Ho will lose.)

715
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,050
(He must shake up Jong Min.)

716
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,150
(Right then,
Joon comes up with a cheat code.)

717
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,460
(Whispering)

718
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,590
Remember what he said?

719
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,590
For now...

720
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
- And...
- Jong Min.

721
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,030
What do you think of Dex
joining the show?

722
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,630
A change of members.

723
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,530
- Dex?
- A change of members.

724
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,970
- What if Dex replaces one of us?
- That would be great.

725
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,840
So many people are welcoming Dex.

726
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,870
Really?

727
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,470
(Jong Min's heart reacts
for the first time.)

728
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,540
I will...

729
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,870
I read some mean comments about you.

730
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,580
It said, "It's time to say goodbye."

731
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,580
Who wrote that?

732
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,350
"Kim Jong Min,
thank you for your hard work."

733
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,350
What?

734
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,750
- What?
- What do you mean?

735
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,950
- Jong Min.
- Didn't you write that?

736
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,920
- "Welcome, Dex."
- Didn't you write that?

737
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,050
That's what I read.

738
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,420
- Compared to Dex...
- Go ahead.

739
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,690
Ask him if he knows his name.

740
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,890
You can't go abroad...

741
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,360
because you can't write
your name in English.

742
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,430
- You're making everything up.
- No, I'm not.

743
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,730
You can't write
your wife's name in English.

744
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,730
Right.

745
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,940
So it's been difficult
for your wife.

746
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,340
It's been very difficult.

747
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,110
- Does he know his wife's name?
- Of course.

748
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,370
- You know her name, right?
- Yes.

749
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,010
- What is your wife's name?
- She has a name.

750
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,340
- She has a name?
- Yes.

751
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,450
(His heart beats faster
at the thought of his wife.)

752
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,450
She has a name.

753
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,080
Do you know
your mother-in-law's name?

754
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,120
How could I say her name
so recklessly?

755
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,590
What's the name
of your mother-in-law?

756
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,120
Her name is... Wait.

757
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,660
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

758
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,430
(He almost said it.)

759
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,430
Was that a trick?

760
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,030
(Flustered)

761
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,900
What are you saying?

762
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,670
- You have 30 seconds left.
- Okay.

763
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,300
(Will Team Jong Min lose?)

764
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,370
That was funny.

765
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,100
I hear that you don't have
an ex-girlfriend.

766
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,310
I married my first love.

767
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,310
- Really?
- Yes.

768
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,610
I heard that
you haven't gotten far with her.

769
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,640
You haven't even kissed her.

770
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,480
That's because...

771
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,010
- my wife and I...
- Is that true?

772
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,310
(Laughing)

773
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,320
By the way...

774
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,250
- To keep our hearts fluttering...
- Is that why?

775
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,290
Yes.

776
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,650
(His heart must still be
fluttering a lot.)

777
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,720
- When you tried to kiss your wife,
- You haven't kissed yet?

778
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,320
wasn't she close to vomiting?

779
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,860
(DinDin steps in to help.)

780
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,300
- Why are you trying to lose weight?
- What?

781
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,930
- Why are you trying to lose weight?
- To be healthier.

782
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,800
Why did you lose your brain?

783
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,530
(Being childish)

784
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,900
Why you...

785
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,670
(Pitter-Pattering
Because of You ends.)

786
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,910
Goodness.

787
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,110
- Gosh.
- I'm sorry.

788
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,010
- I've known him for a long time.
- That's right.

789
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,740
- We aren't offended at all.
- Of course not.

790
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,880
- What was the underwear about?
- What did you mean?

791
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,250
I think he wore mine.

792
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,520
- Seriously?
- He totally made it up.

793
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,450
- He made it up.
- It never happened?

794
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,260
Your heart beat faster
every time you lied.

795
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,460
Jong Min's siren went off
four times.

796
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,030
Sae Ho's siren went off three times.

797
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,430
- Sae Lee Se.
- Your team won.

798
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,400
- Okay.
- Team You!

799
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,800
- We're good.
- Team You.

800
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,430
Please call us Sae Lee Se.

801
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,530
- "Sae Lee Se?"
- Sae Lee Se.

802
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,600
- Sae Lee Se.
- How about Saeri?

803
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,670
- Saeri.
- Team Saeri.

804
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,700
- Team Saeri.
- Saeri.

805
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,770
- Speaking of names,
- Saeri.

806
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,040
why don't you name
your team as well?

807
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,240
- Team Handsome.
- Team Handsome?

808
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
Okay.

809
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,510
(They become Team Ugly
automatically.)

810
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,880
Let's go to the next location.

811
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,010
- Okay.
- Okay.

812
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,850
- Gosh, there's a slide over there.
- What?

813
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,320
- Is there a slide?
- Where?

814
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,390
- I want to go on it.
- Is there a slide here?

815
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,750
- A slide?
- Where is it?

816
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,020
(A slide at the end of the bridge)

817
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,460
- I want to go on it.
- Where is it?

818
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,330
We should go on the slide.
This is a real one.

819
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,590
He's not even scared.

820
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,530
(Sliding without
a moment of hesitation)

821
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,830
(Shouting)

822
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,000
Goodness.

823
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,200
(The speed is faster
than he expected.)

824
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,310
Is it fun? Seriously.

825
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,070
- Like this?
- Slide down.

826
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,110
Like this?

827
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,710
I need to see how high it is.

828
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,450
This is scary.

829
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,150
- I want to try.
- I'm next.

830
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,450
No, I'm next.

831
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,250
What's wrong with you?

832
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,120
If I get stuck,
you'll have to kick me.

833
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,890
I'm afraid that
we'll get stuck together.

834
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,960
- Let me go first.
- Let go of me.

835
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,530
- Goodness.
- You'll get stuck.

836
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,260
Please stop blocking me.

837
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,600
- Please.
- You'll get stuck.

838
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Just leave it up to me.
I should hold onto this.

839
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,670
Goodness.

840
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,400
(In the end, Se Yoon goes first.)

841
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,870
- Are you stuck already?
- It's suffocating.

842
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,000
He's stuck.

843
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,340
- Se Yoon got stuck.
- Are you stuck?

844
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,370
It's suffocating.

845
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,310
It's suffocating. Goodness.

846
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,180
He got stuck.

847
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,650
Did you get stuck?

848
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,550
(He arrived safely.)

849
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,920
- I'm exhausted.
- Come down.

850
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,650
- Don't pull pranks on me.
- We won't.

851
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,390
It could become dangerous
while pulling a prank on me.

852
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,520
(Number 1 Coward, Kim Jong Min)

853
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,460
- Come down.
- It's dangerous!

854
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,130
- It's not dangerous.
- Come down already.

855
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,930
(He takes a long time
just to sit down on the slide.)

856
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,970
Hey... Gosh.

857
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,400
(Is he shrieking or groaning?)

858
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
What's going on?

859
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,310
Here I come.

860
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,370
(Screaming)

861
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,180
(He screams instead of departing.)

862
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,950
(He musters up his courage
and slides down.)

863
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,460
(Sliding turns out to be fun.)

864
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,120
- This is fun.
- This is fun.

865
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,260
Can we slide one more time?

866
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,630
Everyone.

867
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,960
The winning team
gets the car on the right.

868
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,130
The losing team
gets the car on the left.

869
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,670
(Two cars are waiting
for the members.)

870
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,670
(An SUV that's spacious enough
for Se Yoon)

871
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,310
(A compact car with a cozy charm)

872
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,640
- This is nice.
- I'll drive. It's been a while.

873
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
- Let's go.
- Are you driving?
Yes.

874
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,010
Get in the back.

875
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,250
This is nice.

876
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,820
(What a nice car.)

877
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,590
It's not very different
from the SUV.

878
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,950
This is a good car too.

879
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,390
- It really is.
- Right.

880
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,360
At first glance,

881
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,190
this car seems more spacious.

882
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,600
- They're not very different.
- The width...

883
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,930
So DinDin is driving?

884
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,370
(Driver DinDin is customized
for the small car.)

885
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,630
Who's in the car is important.

886
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,840
While being on that team, DinDin
won't be able to use his strength.

887
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,580
To be honest, he isn't
as competent as he appears.

888
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,010
- Really?
- Of course.

889
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,180
I thought that
he was very competent.

890
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,880
It's us who make him look competent.

891
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,680
- Is that so?
- Of course.

892
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,020
Joon, wait and see
how we make you look today.

893
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,720
Let's make it Lee Joon Special.

894
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,850
(Let's make it
Lee Joon Special today.)

895
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,420
Make a list
of whatever you want to do.

896
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,460
You really should.

897
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,560
(Team Saeri departs
in a heartwarming mood.)

898
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,030
Let's go!
(On the other hand...)

899
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,760
The result of the first game
isn't important anyway.

900
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,430
It didn't lead to anything, did it?

901
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,730
- It only determined the car.
- Exactly.

902
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,370
- Then it doesn't matter.
- At this rate,

903
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,040
we could get the penalty tomorrow.

904
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,570
I'll be honest.

905
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,440
It was nice when only Jong Min
and I were on the team.

906
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,040
Why not me?

907
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,380
- I don't think you'll win at all.
- DinDin.

908
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,720
(That sounds reasonable
because Seon Ho...)

909
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,350
He's going over.

910
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,050
(Weak legs)

911
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,590
(His upper body is also weak.)

912
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,890
(The members raised the youngest
while babying him.)

913
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,430
When Jong Min and I are on the team,

914
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,830
Jong Min isn't physically weak.

915
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,970
- But he is.
- Also,

916
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,230
- I have many tricks up my sleeve.
- Right.

917
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,300
What Jong Min and I need is...

918
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,840
a male servant.

919
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,140
Instead, we have a young master.

920
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,580
He's useless.

921
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,880
- We have a useless young master.
- That's right.

922
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,580
Let's give it a try today.

923
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,580
- Let's try it.
- Okay.

924
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,020
- Don't give up.
- We have a chance of winning.

925
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,550
- While playing, you'll realize...
- Right.

926
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,550
- that you've done wrong.
- I disagree.

927
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:14,060
You'll realize
what a nuisance you are to us.

928
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,290
It's been a long time
since I lost...

929
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,790
- during getting-off-work mission.
- That's because...

930
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,000
(Meanwhile, Team Saeri)

931
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,500
Joon, what do you usually do
the day before...

932
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,630
the shoot for 2 Days and 1 Night?

933
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,970
The day before the shoot,

934
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,270
I go to bed very early
for good physical condition.

935
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,370
Sometimes, I go to bed at 6 p.m.

936
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,610
- Gosh.
- I fall asleep at 7 p.m.

937
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,740
(Joon goes to bed
between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.)

938
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,880
Have you thought
of arriving the day before?

939
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,350
I haven't thought that far.

940
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,820
My physical condition depends...

941
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,050
on the quality of my sleep.

942
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,690
I have a hard time resisting sleep.

943
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,990
(The reason why Sae Ho arrives
one day before the shoot)

944
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,290
You can't resist sleep.

945
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,430
Everyone has one of those.

946
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,100
- I can't resist food.
- Really?

947
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,530
You can't resist sleep.

948
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,230
On my first day,

949
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,770
I didn't know
what the shoot entailed.

950
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,270
So I came without eating.

951
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,910
I starved to death.

952
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,170
Really?

953
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,680
When I watched someone
cut some kimchi...

954
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,620
I never knew that
such a pleasure was possible.

955
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,020
(The most pleasurable moment
in Joon's life)

956
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Ever since then,

957
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,460
I get here early in the morning
and have breakfast.

958
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,790
- Really?
- Before coming to the shoot.

959
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,260
It's a cherry blossom road.

960
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,970
So many cherry blossoms
have bloomed.

961
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,000
Do you know what season we're in?

962
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,400
It's the best season.

963
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,340
It's the season
to be in a relationship.

964
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,370
Really?

965
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,780
If you went on a trip...

966
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,940
for one night with your girlfriend,

967
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,080
where would you go?

968
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,610
I'd go to that place.
It was unforgettable.

969
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,850
What was the place
where we had snow crab recently?

970
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,250
- Uljin?
- Uljin.

971
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,820
- Uljin.
- The sea in Uljin was beautiful.

972
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,160
It was beautiful indeed.

973
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,720
Please take a look on your right.

974
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,790
- On our right.
- If you take a look on your right,

975
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,330
the waves are crashing...

976
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,260
at the height of 1.5m.

977
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,000
Jong Min, you've been
on 2 Days and 1 Night...

978
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,840
for about 18 years.

979
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,340
You've never gone
to one of our shooting places...

980
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,570
with your girlfriend, have you?

981
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,170
- Of course I have.
- Where?

982
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,210
Gapyeong, Gangwon Province...

983
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,180
You didn't take the same route
as we did on the show.

984
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,510
- No, we didn't take the same route.
- Right.

985
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,020
I've taken the same route
with my friends.

986
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,450
- Where?
- Donghae.

987
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,990
- You went to where we went?
- Yes.

988
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,760
We went to Dokkaebi...
Dojeabi Sky Valley.

989
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,230
(Dojeabi Sky Valley where you can
enjoy Donghae differently)

990
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,500
(Screaming)

991
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,100
(It's way too high.)

992
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,540
(He probably wanted his friends
to enjoy the same.)

993
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,470
We went to some
of our shooting spots.

994
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,540
- Really?
- Yes.

995
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,610
With my friends.

996
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,880
(2 Days and 1 Night with his friends)

997
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,250
(While chatting, they arrive
at the next location.)

998
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,620
I wonder what we're doing today.

999
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,450
We'll show Yeoju.

1000
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,150
Well done, everyone.

1001
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you for driving.

1002
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,560
(Where did the members arrive?)

1003
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,090
The view is beautiful.

1004
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,860
- The path is very pretty.
- Yes.

1005
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,300
It's very beautiful here.

1006
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,200
This place is magnificent.

1007
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,530
Look at this harmony.

1008
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,600
(Cherry trees that fill the sky)

1009
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,970
(Where various flowers have bloomed)

1010
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,310
This place is loved by Yeoju locals.

1011
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,640
It's Yeoju's treasure island.

1012
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,550
- This is Gangcheon Island.
- Gangcheon Island?

1013
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,010
- I love it.
- Is it an island?

1014
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,350
The cherry blossom path is
so beautiful.

1015
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,950
(A pretty cherry blossom path
along the Namhan River)

1016
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,790
(The cherry blossom petals
flutter pleasantly in the spring breeze.)

1017
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,790
It's beautiful.

1018
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,260
Thanks to 2 Days and 1 Night,
I get to walk on a cherry blossom path.

1019
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,670
This is lovely.

1020
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,230
Today...

1021
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,070
- We must be having a field day.
- It's relaxing.

1022
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,110
- What's this?
- What is it?

1023
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,340
- Will we have to pop them?
- Goodness.

1024
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,240
It feels like we're on a picnic.

1025
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,050
Doesn't it feel like spring?

1026
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,950
- I love it.
- The weather is nice too.

1027
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,820
Have you picked a new name
for your team?

1028
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,250
- Team Handsome.
- Team Handsome.

1029
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,290
They're Team Ugly.

1030
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,460
That sounds so formal.

1031
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,590
What kind of name is Handsome?

1032
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,320
We're handsome.
What else would we call ourselves?

1033
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,530
They obviously didn't put
much thought into it.

1034
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,830
Really? In that case...

1035
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,830
(They think of another name.)

1036
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,170
- How about...
- Fried Tofu Rice Ball.

1037
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,770
What do you mean?

1038
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,070
Jong Min is married,
and he's DinDin the Kid.

1039
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,540
DinDin the Kid? What about rice?

1040
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
I represent rice.

1041
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,870
- He likes rice.
- Fried Tofu Rice Ball isn't bad.

1042
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,940
- Would you like to go with that?
- Fried Tofu Rice Ball.

1043
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,640
- Fried Tofu Rice Ball.
- With Jong Min in the middle,

1044
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,950
we'll squeeze him.

1045
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,780
- Fried Tofu Rice Ball.
- That's right.

1046
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,250
Here's your mission
on Gangcheon Island.

1047
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,020
It's called Sack of Rice Race.

1048
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,760
- Sack of rice?
- Okay.

1049
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,420
While squatting inside a rice sack,

1050
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,790
go once around the track
with obstacles.

1051
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,630
The first team to finish will win.

1052
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,830
(The first team to finish
the track with obstacles wins.)

1053
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,500
In Course One, you'll run in zigzag.

1054
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,700
Continue...

1055
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,200
and pop all 15 balloons
that are attached to the mat.

1056
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,270
(Course 1: Pop 15 balloons)

1057
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,170
Course Two.

1058
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,280
Find yakgwa inside the flour.

1059
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,180
You may continue once we check
yakgwa in your mouth.

1060
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,620
Next is walking
on the balance beam...

1061
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,790
and eating snacks.

1062
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,450
Eat the hanging snack...

1063
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,620
before continuing.

1064
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,290
Course Three is
tearing the plastic wrap.

1065
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,630
We'll be holding the plastic wrap.

1066
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,100
Tear it with your face.

1067
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,130
Next is blowing table tennis balls.

1068
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,140
Throw the ball with your mouth
and hit do on the xylophone.

1069
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,070
This will be crucial.

1070
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,110
(The last section isn't easy.)

1071
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,540
Lastly, run and go through
the finish line.

1072
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,310
The first team to arrive will win.

1073
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,780
(Course 1: Run in zigzag, balloons,
Course 2: Find yakgwa,)

1074
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,550
(balance beam, and snacks,
Course 3: Tear the plastic wrap,)

1075
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,150
(hit the xylophone
with a table tennis ball.)

1076
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,620
Yes, we must win this.

1077
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,260
Think about it.
Sae Ho and Joon are good at it.

1078
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:52,660
(There are two verified aces
on Team Saeri.)

1079
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,530
You're right.

1080
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,870
But Se Yoon is terrible.

1081
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,000
Could you talk more quietly?

1082
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,140
I can hear you so clearly.

1083
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,240
There's a limit to pretending
not to hear you.

1084
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,270
Joon, go quickly and finish.

1085
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,110
- Joon, do it fast.
- I will.

1086
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,980
Here's the plan. I'll go first...

1087
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,550
and pop all the balloons.

1088
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,750
Se Yoon can go slowly
while blocking the other team.

1089
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,820
All right.

1090
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,350
- Sae Ho, you should go last.
- Last?

1091
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,620
- That's what I think.
- I'm good at blowing them.

1092
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,860
We have to hit do?

1093
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,690
Yes, that's the longest bar.

1094
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,860
That sounds difficult.

1095
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,290
What about Jong Min over there?

1096
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,430
- What? Okay.
- Throw it with your mouth.

1097
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,570
Hit do with the ball.

1098
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,000
Can we leave the last course
to Jong Min?

1099
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,240
I think it'll be better.

1100
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,570
You need to widen the gap quickly.

1101
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,510
You should go first and speed up.

1102
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,910
(Quick Seon Ho is assigned
to Course 1.)

1103
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Is it possible to walk there?
It looks narrow.

1104
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,610
This looks difficult.

1105
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,450
Jong Min, show us
your skills like Dex.

1106
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,450
(Course 3, Sae Ho versus Jong Min)

1107
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,150
Have you decided on the order?

1108
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,390
We're playing one round, right?

1109
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,060
(It's time for both teams
to put on the rice sack.)

1110
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,330
(Suddenly, we hear laughter?)

1111
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,960
How big did you make it for me?
Let go.

1112
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,300
Mine is twice as big as others.

1113
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,070
That's big enough for him...

1114
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,770
- to move upright.
- You're right.

1115
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,540
(Se Yoon's rice sack is
two times bigger than others'.)

1116
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,310
Wait.

1117
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,510
(I'm going in.)

1118
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,980
(Se Yoon fits right in.)

1119
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,310
(Rolling)

1120
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,220
Stay lying down.

1121
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,850
(It's hard to steady himself
inside the rice sack.)

1122
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,020
(Adorable)

1123
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,390
We've got this.

1124
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,560
You can come closer.

1125
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,700
(Will they be able to run fast
inside the rice sack?)

1126
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,500
(They're ready
for Sack of Rice Race.)

1127
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,430
Okay, here we go!

1128
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,770
We can do it.

1129
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,000
(A competition between
the fastest players)

1130
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,070
Get ready,

1131
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,240
set, go!

1132
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,110
(The race starts.)

1133
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,950
(Is his tactic rolling?)

1134
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,250
You got it, Seon Ho!

1135
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,250
It's not working.

1136
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,620
What?

1137
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,020
What's wrong with him?

1138
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,320
(He's using the same tactic
as he did during the potato race.)

1139
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,560
(It's not working now.)

1140
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,860
(While Joon from Team Saeri is
wandering about)

1141
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,060
(Seon Ho advances
while walking like a crab.)

1142
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,770
You got it, Seon Ho!

1143
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,570
(Exclaiming)

1144
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,240
(Steady steps)

1145
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,770
(A relaxed look on his face)

1146
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,280
You got it, Seon Ho!

1147
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,350
(We need a male servant
on our team.)

1148
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,650
(Instead, we have a young master.)

1149
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,820
(The young master was ill-treated
by the older members.)

1150
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,790
(I'm not a young master anymore.)

1151
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,890
(Seon Ho, Joon)

1152
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,630
(He reaches the zigzag section.)

1153
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,730
- He won't get far.
- Seon Ho, in zigzag.

1154
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,730
(Seon Ho charges forward.)

1155
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,230
- That's good.
- Great.

1156
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,700
That's it.

1157
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,700
(Flashy steps under his calm face)

1158
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,440
- That's good.
- Great.

1159
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,080
(Joon switches to hopping
like a frog.)

1160
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,510
(Soon, he's right behind Seon Ho!)

1161
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,990
(He ends up falling.)

1162
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,320
No.

1163
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,790
Did you turn the tables?

1164
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,030
(Joon seizes the opportunity
and turn the tables.)

1165
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,630
What?

1166
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,140
(Only one obstacle remains
in Course 1.)

1167
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,300
- Here it is.
- You got this, Seon Ho.

1168
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,840
(Seon Ho speeds up and outruns him.)

1169
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,210
- Here it is.
- What's going on?

1170
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,610
(The race is
literally neck and neck.)

1171
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,810
(They must pop all the balloons
to pass.)

1172
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,850
(Joon pops the balloons easily.)

1173
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,920
(Seon Ho's balloons are
strongly resisting.)

1174
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,090
Okay, you're almost done.

1175
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,460
(Meanwhile, Joon passes.)

1176
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,560
Okay, you're almost done.

1177
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,160
Get closer.

1178
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,460
- Get closer.
- He's here.

1179
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,060
- Let's go.
- Go.

1180
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,960
(Seon Ho throws himself to tap him.)

1181
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,030
Okay.

1182
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,870
(DinDin sets off for Course 2.)

1183
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,740
Get closer.

1184
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,970
Okay.

1185
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,810
(He must find yakgwa to pass.)

1186
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,110
Hurry up.

1187
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,550
(Se Yoon passes.)

1188
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,950
(DinDin also hurries
to find yakgwa.)

1189
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,080
That's good.

1190
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,390
Start.

1191
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,890
(Pressing down)

1192
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,560
(DinDin also passes.)

1193
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,460
(He goes straight after
covering DinDin with flour.)

1194
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,530
Se Yoon.

1195
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,760
You can do it.

1196
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
(Both teams are running
at similar speeds.)

1197
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
(Se Yoon arrives first
on the balance beam.)

1198
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,070
(Facing a difficulty
at the rising slope)

1199
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,200
(DinDin is running
after him fiercely.)

1200
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,940
(Hopping)

1201
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,540
(Get out of my way.)

1202
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,040
I'm tired. What are you doing?

1203
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,440
You should widen the gap there!

1204
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,310
(Se Yoon is really bad at it.)

1205
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,280
(Can you speak quietly, please?)

1206
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,380
I can't help hearing it.

1207
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,490
(The members openly treated Se Yoon
as the weakest member.)

1208
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,120
DinDin,
you should widen the gap there!

1209
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,490
You must not lose to him.

1210
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,260
(Se Yoon is determined to win,
so he jumps desperately.)

1211
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,260
- Gosh. I'm tired.
- You can do it. That's good.

1212
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,390
(DinDin chases him fiercely.)

1213
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,800
(But then he falls down.)

1214
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,630
(Flopping)

1215
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,930
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

1216
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,270
Hurry up. Come on.

1217
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,510
You're almost there.

1218
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,870
- DinDin is coming.
- Oh, gosh.

1219
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,040
(Neck and neck)

1220
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,680
- You've got this!
- Se Yoon, come on.

1221
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,850
(They reached the 2nd course,
eating a cookie, at the same time.)

1222
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,090
(Se Yoon got it in one go!)

1223
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,860
(The counterattack
of the weakest member at racing)

1224
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,560
Okay. Come and tap me.

1225
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,830
(Course 3: Sae Ho versus Jong Min)

1226
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,360
(I'm no longer the weakest member
at racing.)

1227
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,830
(DinDin also passes after a while.)

1228
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,400
We must win.

1229
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,500
(Course 3:
Tearing plastic wrap with the face,)

1230
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,570
(hitting do
with a table tennis ball)

1231
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,410
(They're not far away
from the finish line.)

1232
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,040
(The plastic wrap obstacle is
brought in.)

1233
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,280
We don't know yet!

1234
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,380
(You must tear the wrap
to pass through it.)

1235
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,750
(It won't tear.)

1236
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,760
(Sae Ho, Jong Min)

1237
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,860
(Jong Min uses the chance
to catch up with him.)

1238
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,530
Harder than that.

1239
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,500
Push harder!

1240
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,470
(The match between the last runners)

1241
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,240
(Which one of them
will gain the lead?)

1242
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,510
Sae Ho, go.

1243
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,710
(Jong Min, please!)

1244
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,750
(Sae Ho passes first.)

1245
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,420
(Sae Ho runs fast
toward the final obstacle.)

1246
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,820
(Sae Ho, Jong Min)

1247
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,260
(Jong Min of Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball
passes too.)

1248
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,690
Hey. Wait.

1249
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,990
(Jong Min goes after him quickly.)

1250
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,900
(They have to hit do
by blowing a table tennis ball.)

1251
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,330
(The result of the race depends
on this round.)

1252
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,940
Hey. Wait.

1253
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,170
Blow it hard.

1254
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,810
Wait. What?

1255
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,210
That's good.

1256
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,650
(Jong Min arrives
at the mission place too.)

1257
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,080
Jong Min, you should blow it hard.

1258
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,450
You've got this!

1259
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,950
(A table tennis ball
doesn't fly well, as expected.)

1260
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:57,990
What should I do?

1261
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,590
(Meanwhile, Sae Ho seems
to have gotten the hang of it!)

1262
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,290
- Oh, I did it.
- Pass!

1263
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,900
(He hit the "do" plate accurately.)

1264
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,330
Did he pass?

1265
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,130
- Did he make it?
- He made it.

1266
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,330
(Sae Ho makes a spurt
to the finish line.)

1267
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,800
- Did he make it?
- He's walking on his knees.

1268
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,940
You've got this!

1269
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,470
(Will Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball lose
without turning the tables?)

1270
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,880
(Right then,
Sae Ho's legs give out.)

1271
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,180
Sae Ho, roll.

1272
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,210
(Team Saeri faces a crisis!)

1273
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,780
(This is a good chance
for Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball.)

1274
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,620
(Focused)

1275
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,620
(Shouting)
(Jong Min passes.)

1276
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:40,160
(Sae Ho passed through
the finish line already!)

1277
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,030
(Oh, no. I was almost there.)

1278
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:50,440
(Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball lost.)

1279
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,170
Untie me!

1280
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,640
We all knew...

1281
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,110
- I mean...
- it was going to end this way.

1282
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,210
You just watched us,
so you must not know why I'm exhausted.

1283
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,450
- How was it?
- My gosh, I...

1284
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,920
Jong Min is eating yakgwa.

1285
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,990
(He's fast when he gets food.)

1286
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,360
Choosing Jong Min
as the third runner...

1287
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,760
- was a bad decision.
- Why?

1288
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,860
You should've gone first.

1289
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,800
I'll announce
the result of the race.

1290
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,130
Team Saeri won.

1291
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,930
- Yes!
- It's an obvious result.

1292
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,700
- But we should stay alert.
- We need to know...

1293
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,300
We might start losing
while continuing our winning streak.

1294
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,810
- Team Saeri is winning at 2 to 0.
- Why is the score 2 to 0?

1295
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,310
The previous game only determined
the car, didn't it?

1296
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:28,440
- No, that's not it.
- But you didn't explain it to us.

1297
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,780
But we didn't know that.
We thought...

1298
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,150
- it was to determine the car.
- We didn't know. Really?

1299
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,720
It'll be written on the screen
when you watch the show on TV.

1300
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,720
Right.

1301
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,150
The car was a prize.

1302
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,420
Now, let's go and have lunch.

1303
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,790
Do I look okay?
Do I still look like a celebrity?

1304
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,860
- Yes.
- Okay.

1305
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,930
You'll be okay. You look great.

1306
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,630
- Se Yoon, you...
- He looks like the bear emoji.

1307
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,230
- Right.
- He's so cute!

1308
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,370
Then I will go
without washing my face.

1309
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,570
(The bear knows
how to please his fans.)

1310
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,710
- They like it so much...
- I'm good too.

1311
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,440
It's amazing how he believes
the compliment right away.

1312
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,980
Just take the wrap off your face,
you brat.

1313
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,510
What are you talking about? Gosh.

1314
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,310
- You already removed the wrap?
- What are you talking about?

1315
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,310
Okay. Good.

1316
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,980
- Now, let's get going.
- Let's go.

1317
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,090
(They'll leave Gangcheon Island
full of the spring vibes.)

1318
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,150
I enjoyed watching it.

1319
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,920
(Shall we go and have lunch now?)

1320
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,060
(On a peaceful spring day
like today...)

1321
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,730
Even the first runner was losing.

1322
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,130
- Be honest. Whose fault is it?
- You guys... Right.

1323
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,970
- If you had to blame someone...
- Jong Min didn't do his best.

1324
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:26,470
- He didn't do his best.
- That's not true.

1325
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,440
Since he was ahead of me,
I lost my morale.

1326
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,840
- Do you know what I mean?
- He wasn't that far from you.

1327
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,110
It's because
you guys haven't done it...

1328
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,210
Gosh. I can't believe you guys.

1329
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,480
Were you leading the game?

1330
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,640
Pardon?

1331
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,050
(Seon Ho is dumbfounded
by Jong Min being childish.)

1332
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,350
Because you were unmotivated...

1333
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,550
What are you talking about?
I wasn't unmotivated.

1334
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,980
We let you run the shortest course.

1335
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,120
I don't want
to get a penalty either.

1336
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,290
Let's cheer up and make it work
after lunch.

1337
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:49,430
If we fail to have lunch too,
we'll lose the whole game.

1338
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,890
- You're right.
- Right. We'll lose. Really.

1339
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,600
You are watching 2 Days and 1 Night.

1340
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,660
- He's like a machine.
- We just watched...

1341
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,430
the Sack of Rice Race.

1342
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,170
- That's right.
- And here's the result of the game.

1343
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,870
- Team Saeri won.
- Yes.

1344
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,370
It was an overwhelming victory.

1345
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,710
Tell us how you feel
about winning the Sack of Rice Race.

1346
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,750
Joon, you go first.

1347
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,980
- At first, I thought we'd lose...
- Yes.

1348
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,650
- due to the wrong strategy.
- I see.

1349
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,790
- But as always, with my passion,
- Yes.

1350
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,820
I ran fast to win and tapped Se Yoon
just as we had planned,

1351
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,990
- which made me so happy.
- I see.

1352
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,120
- Great. Thank you.
- Okay.

1353
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,030
- Next up is Se Yoon.
- Yes!

1354
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,930
- Joon just shared his feelings.
- Yes!

1355
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,300
- We're going to have lunch.
- Yes.

1356
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,070
What would you like to eat?

1357
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,770
- Right now?
- Yes.

1358
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,240
- Yeoju is famous for rice, right?
- Yes, it's famous for rice.

1359
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,440
The thing about tasty rice...

1360
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,280
Tasty rice helps people at the table
enjoy the meal.

1361
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,280
- That's true.
- I absolutely agree with you.

1362
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,910
So where could be the best place
to have a meal?

1363
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,650
I think it's Yeoju
where rice is tasty.

1364
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,250
- That's right.
- Speaking of which,

1365
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,980
may I sing a song about rice?

1366
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,350
- Then we'll take turns.
- Okay.

1367
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,220
- Each of us sings one song.
- Here we go.

1368
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,990
- Three, two, one. Go!
- One.

1369
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,890
(Rice, rice, rice, rice)

1370
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,160
(Impressed)

1371
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,490
- I didn't think of that song.
- Before going into your mouth

1372
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,600
(Before going into your mouth)

1373
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,330
(Rice comes into my mouth)

1374
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,730
- Okay. Thank you.
- That's all.

1375
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,930
- Thank you for listening.
- Now...

1376
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,140
- What song is there?
- Next up is...

1377
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,200
I'm getting anxious.

1378
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,440
- Joon.
- Okay. Give me just a second.

1379
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,970
- Joon, are you ready?
- Yes.

1380
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,240
Three, two, one. Go!

1381
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,040
(I guess I loved rice)

1382
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,180
(I guess I can't forget it)

1383
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,580
(I keep getting hungry)

1384
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,350
(I can't hold it back)

1385
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,420
That was good.

1386
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,120
- We'll continue right away.
- Okay.

1387
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,820
- Three, two, one. Go.
- One.

1388
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,360
(It's a grain of rice,
it's a grain of rice)

1389
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,600
- "A grain of rice?"
- I tried it

1390
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,900
And it was a grain of rice

1391
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,130
- That's good.
- This is how I eat

1392
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,200
(He sings with teary eyes,
"This is how I eat cooked rice.")

1393
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,240
Great.

1394
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:42,470
Gosh, I'm hungry.

1395
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,140
I had breakfast before the shoot,
so why am I so hungry?

1396
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,910
(While singing songs about rice
that fills their empty stomachs...)

1397
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,480
- The food here must be delicious.
- It must be.

1398
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,980
Guys, let's make sure to win here.

1399
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,390
The dish you'll have for lunch is
Yeoju's most famous native dish...

1400
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,950
that's considered 1 of the top 2
along with Chuncheon makguksu.

1401
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,020
- It's Yeoju makguksu.
- It's famous, indeed.

1402
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,160
- Nice.
- Sounds great.

1403
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,360
It's nice.

1404
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,700
This place is the first restaurant
that opened...

1405
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,500
- in Yeoju Makguksu Village. Yes.
- The first restaurant here?

1406
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,230
It was written outside that it was
the first restaurant in the village.

1407
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,640
You can order your food
before we start the game.

1408
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,740
- Really?
- Oh, are you serious?

1409
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,510
Yes. Choose between mul makguksu
and bibim makguksu.

1410
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,710
- I'll have mul makguksu.
- Me too.

1411
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,410
- I'll have mul makguksu too.
- There's an extra large portion.

1412
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:24,610
Why doesn't each team order
2 mul makguksu and 1 bibim makguksu?

1413
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,080
- That sounds good.
- Let's order two mul makguksu...

1414
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,180
- That's a good idea.
- and one bibim makguksu.

1415
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,690
Please give us 3 mul makguksu
and 1 bibim makguksu.

1416
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,490
People normally share makguksu
like this.

1417
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,320
Who orders only 3 servings
for 3 people?

1418
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,220
Then we'll succumb to your request.

1419
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,760
Each team will have
three mul makguksu...

1420
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,260
- and one bibim makguksu.
- That's more like it.

1421
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:39,860
Can we eat the food
without playing a game?

1422
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,600
They will start cooking
after they get the order.

1423
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,800
- So it takes five minutes.
- All right.

1424
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,970
My gosh. Why?
What has gotten into you?

1425
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,500
- They'll just let us eat food?
- Why would they do that?

1426
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,870
You can drink some broth
while waiting for the food.

1427
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:52,840
Broth sounds amazing. It's nice.

1428
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,310
Look at the color.

1429
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,310
(The milky color tells
how tasty the broth could be.)

1430
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,250
- It's really great broth.
- All of us can drink this?

1431
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,850
- Let's drink it.
- Yes, go ahead.

1432
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:00,680
My, that's so kind of you.

1433
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,320
- Why are you being so nice to us?
- I mean...

1434
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,450
I'm sure we'll have to work harder
since we get to eat this.

1435
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,690
- It's so good.
- It's good.

1436
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,860
I'll really drink this.
I'll drink it up.

1437
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,030
No problem.

1438
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,030
Why did you become so kind?

1439
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:14,900
They don't charge for the broth.

1440
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,530
- The broth is free?
- Yes.

1441
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,670
(Then we should drink it!)

1442
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,870
- It's nice.
- Great.

1443
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,970
I could finish two bowls of rice
with this.

1444
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:21,970
It smells good.

1445
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:23,040
(Slurping)

1446
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,440
- But...
- This is nice.

1447
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,240
They chose such a good dish
for lunch.

1448
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,550
Makguksu is perfect
for this weather.

1449
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,880
I feel like
we're on a spring picnic.

1450
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,120
- What? Our food is coming already.
- Oh, my.

1451
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,920
I'll eat it with so much gusto.

1452
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,820
My, it's a lot.

1453
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,320
It's as much
as an extra large portion.

1454
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,290
What is this?
Look how tasty it looks.

1455
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,290
(Let me see.)

1456
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,160
The serving size is satisfactory.

1457
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,500
Wait, everyone. Hold on.

1458
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,060
Oh, we shouldn't eat yet.

1459
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,070
Why?

1460
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,430
The food is already served.
How could you not let us eat?

1461
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,600
It's so cruel.

1462
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,840
- I can't stand this.
- Listen up.

1463
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,840
You can't give something
and then take it back.

1464
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,110
- I won't listen.
- Wait, everyone!

1465
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:58,270
Put the chopsticks down.

1466
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,110
- Let me just mix it.
- I'll only mix it. I'm not lying.

1467
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,140
Listen up.

1468
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,480
Not all of you can eat the makguksu.

1469
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,980
Only the team
that wins in this game...

1470
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,550
- will get to have lunch.
- Gosh, seriously.

1471
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,550
- This is...
- Put your chopsticks down.

1472
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,890
- I'm so desperate for this.
- Got it.

1473
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:12,790
Each of you will pick up
one strand of noodle...

1474
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,720
out of your bowl.

1475
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,760
And we'll combine the lengths
of the noodles.

1476
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,430
The team with the bigger total wins.

1477
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,160
- Put your lives on the line, guys.
- Now... Hold on, everyone.

1478
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,430
You must pick up just one strand
of noodle without moving any.

1479
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,600
- If it breaks, it's over, right?
- If you touch it...

1480
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,600
If it breaks, then it's over.

1481
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,900
It has to stay on the cutting board.

1482
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,670
You fail even if you drop it
while carrying it to the board.

1483
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,410
- Okay.
- Should I get the thick one?

1484
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:33,740
We have to win this time,
no matter what.

1485
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,780
Who is going first?

1486
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,110
We should do it at the same time.

1487
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,680
- It will swell.
- Let's do it together.

1488
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,520
We can bring it to the middle
from both ends.

1489
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,650
DinDin and Se Yoon can start.

1490
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,390
- Then Joon and Jong Min.
- Okay.

1491
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,990
- The tip here is...
- You can't change...

1492
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,620
- the strand after grabbing one.
- Don't pick the one in the middle.

1493
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,190
- It's all sticking in the middle.
- You will lose if your strand...

1494
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,760
breaks while being carried.

1495
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,460
You have to get the one
from the side.

1496
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,260
Do you have a way to do this?

1497
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,400
Don't pick the one inside.
Pick the one on the outside.

1498
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,030
- Okay.
- It's untangled already.

1499
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,070
- Right.
- Yes.

1500
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,770
(The two ace players
have the same tactics.)

1501
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,670
- All right, let's start.
- We play at the same time.

1502
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,940
- Let's start.
- Se Yoon versus DinDin.

1503
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,210
One, two, three.

1504
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,550
Hold on. Se Yoon touched
one of the strands.

1505
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,550
(Putting in chopsticks)

1506
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,820
Hold on. Se Yoon touched
one of the strands.

1507
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,920
(Did Se Yoon touch the noodles?)

1508
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,190
I just straightened my chopsticks.
That's it.

1509
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,390
His chopsticks touched the noodles.

1510
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,560
(DinDin was choosing a strand
carefully.)

1511
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,800
(Broken)

1512
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:29,800
DinDin touched it.

1513
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,470
- I told you.
- What? What's wrong?

1514
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,200
- DinDin. Fail.
- It's not broken.

1515
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,840
It just fell!

1516
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,640
(Foodie Joon is happy.)

1517
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,840
Go, Se Yoon.

1518
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,940
- It just fell.
- This is going great.

1519
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:46,150
(Carefully picking the strand)

1520
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,980
(Nervous)

1521
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,520
- It's all right even if you cut it.
- No.

1522
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,320
(Twirling)

1523
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,120
What is he doing?
He just twirled it.

1524
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,360
What he did was fine.

1525
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,190
Please.

1526
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:00,800
Please.

1527
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,400
It's too tense.

1528
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,400
(Determined)

1529
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,300
Look how he's always serious
with food.

1530
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,600
(Sabotaging)

1531
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,710
- Please block my ears.
- Look at him.

1532
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,670
- He's so greedy for food.
- You can cut it there.

1533
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,710
- The fatso is so greedy.
- It's going to swell.

1534
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,480
He's so greedy!

1535
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:21,880
Okay.

1536
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,990
(Se Yoon failed.)

1537
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,050
(Screaming)

1538
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,860
Joon, let's go.

1539
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,630
It's a tie.

1540
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,860
- It breaks very easily.
- Let's go.

1541
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,860
- It's all right. Go ahead.
- As long as you get one strand...

1542
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,370
This breaks very easily.

1543
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,000
- Jong Min and Joon.
- I'll start now.

1544
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,400
- I'll focus now.
- Please do a good job, Joon.

1545
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,840
One, two, three. Go!

1546
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,840
Yes, get that strand.

1547
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,610
- Well done.
- Isn't it too hard to get?

1548
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:46,710
Just get that one.

1549
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,340
(He picked it!)

1550
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,480
Lift it up slowly.

1551
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,980
Hold on.

1552
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,550
Hold on.

1553
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,650
Don't let it fall.

1554
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,950
(DinDin is sabotaging them
this time.)

1555
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,890
- Why aren't you doing it?
- Don't do stuff like that.

1556
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,660
(Focusing hard
regardless of DinDin's sabotage)

1557
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,560
Don't do stuff like that.

1558
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,990
(How about this one?)

1559
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:08,430
- Joon!
- Why aren't you doing it?

1560
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:09,660
(Broken)

1561
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,700
Why aren't you doing it?

1562
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:12,500
(So this works too.)

1563
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,170
- Okay.
- No!

1564
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,800
(This can't be happening.)

1565
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,340
- You shouldn't try to pull it.
- I can't believe this.

1566
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,910
- What is this?
- Jong Min's turn.

1567
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,340
- I'll get a short one.
- As long as you get one.

1568
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,080
- I can get any strand now.
- Twirl it as soon as you get one.

1569
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,820
- Five, four...
- Three.

1570
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,420
- Two.
- Two. He touched it.

1571
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,650
(Carefully picked one strand
of noodles)

1572
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,290
This breaks so easily.

1573
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,320
- He grabbed it. There you go.
- He got it.

1574
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,530
- He got it.
- He touched it.

1575
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,690
(Seon Ho's face looks
as if he's doing the work.)

1576
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,700
- He knows how to survive.
- What's going on?

1577
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,500
- There you go.
- He got it. This is one strand.

1578
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,540
(Carefully lifting the strand)

1579
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,440
(He got it.)

1580
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,170
(It looks stable so far.)

1581
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:52,310
(Can he fully lift up
one strand of noodles?)

1582
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,910
- No, put it down.
- There you go.

1583
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,420
Don't go too far.
Just put it down there.

1584
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,220
- Put it down.
- It will break if you celebrate!

1585
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,350
All right.

1586
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,490
(I should stay calm!)

1587
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:06,820
- It's long.
- Yes!

1588
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:07,920
(The strand reached
the cutting board.)

1589
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,460
(Disappointed)

1590
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,530
- We got it.
- I should have twirled it better.

1591
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,000
(Good job, Noodle-eater Jong Min.)

1592
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,700
Let's play the next round
before it gets soggy.

1593
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,900
Let's go.

1594
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,630
You can pick the thin ones.

1595
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,170
Twirl it. You know what I mean?

1596
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,270
- Just pick one.
- I got one.

1597
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:23,510
Just choose one.

1598
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,910
- He grabbed it.
- You have to twirl it.

1599
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,110
It's over if you drop it.

1600
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,880
- Lift it up.
- He's dropping.

1601
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,380
- Lift it up.
- You have to lift it up.

1602
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,110
- Lift it up.
- He's dropping.

1603
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,150
(He's not twirling it properly.)

1604
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,590
- There you go. Twirl it in the air.
- Twirl it now.

1605
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,550
- There you go.
- Lift it up some more. Yes.

1606
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,660
(Lifting a strand
without hesitation)

1607
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,330
- There you go!
- Fantastic!

1608
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:45,730
(Fantastic!)

1609
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,930
- Be careful.
- Hey!

1610
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,800
I told you to be careful!

1611
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,370
(This is incredible!)

1612
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:54,040
We now have a chance.

1613
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,940
I told you not to go far!

1614
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,980
- I was too excited.
- I told you to twirl it!

1615
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,110
You have to look up
while lifting it up.

1616
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,250
- You can do it.
- Go, Sae Ho.

1617
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,910
- You saw it, yes? Twirl it.
- Which one?

1618
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,480
- It's all luck. Just pick one.
- You have to look up.

1619
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,420
- Twirl it.
- It's okay.

1620
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,550
- It's okay.
- Sae Ho.

1621
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,420
(Careful)

1622
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,820
Sae Ho, come on.

1623
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,030
- He grabbed one.
- He grabbed one!

1624
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,430
You're done if you drop it.

1625
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:22,600
- Sae Ho!
- Twirl it some more.

1626
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,570
- Sae Ho, do it slowly.
- Slowly.

1627
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,330
- Will he be able to lift it up?
- It's all right. Keep going.

1628
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,400
- It's okay. Keep going.
- You can't twirl it too much.

1629
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,970
(Can Sae Ho lift it up?)

1630
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,610
(Flinching)

1631
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,380
Do it slowly.

1632
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,750
(Also flinching)

1633
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,050
(Please drop it.)

1634
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,520
- It's all right. Keep going.
- You can't twirl it too much.

1635
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,590
Can he lift it up or not?

1636
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,760
Jong Min!

1637
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,330
(Sae Ho failed.)

1638
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,760
(Noodle-eater Jong Min did it!)

1639
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,560
- Jong Min.
- Yes!

1640
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,400
(They lost makguksu
when it was so close.)

1641
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,440
This won't work.

1642
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,610
- We'll start now.
- Don't get too excited.

1643
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:07,280
Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball...

1644
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,740
will get to have sliced pork
along with makguksu.

1645
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,280
(It's a party.)

1646
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,680
- This means everything.
- Let's eat it now.

1647
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,720
(Remove Team Saeri's food.)

1648
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,690
(Excuse me.)

1649
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,350
(Heartbroken)

1650
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:19,550
This breaks very easily.

1651
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,590
(I can't watch this.)

1652
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:21,820
It breaks easily.

1653
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,030
- We're winning by two points?
- That's right.

1654
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,290
- So we won one point?
- Yes.

1655
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,600
- So we won one point just now.
- Right.

1656
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,200
- Jong Min.
- I was good. Did you see?

1657
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,170
I feel bad for Jong Min.

1658
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,800
I scolded him a lot in the van.

1659
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,610
"You're not desperate anymore
after getting married."

1660
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,770
He told me that I wasn't willing
to win at all.

1661
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,440
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

1662
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,380
- Thank you for the food. Thanks.
- Enjoy.

1663
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,680
Let's wrap it with the meat
for the first bite.

1664
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,980
You have to wrap it with the meat
for the first bite.

1665
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,280
- I thought...
- Let's eat now.

1666
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,990
You can eat now.

1667
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:52,750
- Guys, are you smelling the food?
- Come on.

1668
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,760
(Slurping)

1669
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,260
Sae Ho, can you watch me?

1670
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,660
(Please watch me.)

1671
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,130
(How's my eating show?)

1672
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,530
- This is...
- This is crazy good.

1673
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,530
- Is it good?
- It's delicious.

1674
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,240
(It's so obvious.)

1675
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,340
It looks delicious.

1676
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,570
(Drinking the soup)

1677
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,110
We just mixed it, so...

1678
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,910
- This is too delicious.
- Eat it. It will get soggy soon.

1679
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,550
- It's sweet and spicy.
- Right.

1680
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,550
It's spicy.

1681
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,550
- It's sweet and spicy.
- Their seasoning is good.

1682
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,420
(Team Loser is suffering even more
as they praise makguksu.)

1683
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,790
It's not too spicy or salty.

1684
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:31,630
So there was no point in winning
the games earlier.

1685
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,800
You're ahead of them
because you won them.

1686
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,730
I don't care if we're winning.
I'd rather eat the food.

1687
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,830
(Foodie Joon is upset.)

1688
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:40,700
(Pouring)

1689
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,740
Have a sip. It's meat broth. Sae Ho.

1690
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,940
- Meat broth.
- Right.

1691
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,970
(Look at the sliced pork.)

1692
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,380
I think it's their secret recipe.

1693
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,840
There are three types of sauce.

1694
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,850
It's delicious if you mix them
and dip the sliced pork.

1695
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,580
Let's try it.

1696
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,480
- It's different.
- Right.

1697
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,590
- Is that how we do it?
- Yes.

1698
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,560
Guys, will you look at this?

1699
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,620
We're supposed to dip it
with the sliced pork.

1700
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,430
(We heard it too, Jong Min.)

1701
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,130
(Like this!)

1702
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,300
It's so good.

1703
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,600
Can you eat the white kimchi...

1704
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,540
with the bibim makguksu?

1705
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,070
- Okay.
- It will taste amazing.

1706
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,510
- Don't slurp it at once.
- Okay.

1707
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,780
Try munching it
after having a mouthful bite.

1708
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,840
- You'll taste the buckwheat scent.
- Try it with white kimchi?

1709
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:25,180
Take a mouthful bite.

1710
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,880
DinDin, there you go.
Taste the buckwheat scent.

1711
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,250
Inhale it.

1712
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,120
- Inhale it.
- Gosh, DinDin can eat this much?

1713
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,590
- Cut it there.
- Look at these guys.

1714
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,860
DinDin eating it like that
tells us that it's delicious.

1715
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,090
- I know.
- Cut it there.

1716
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,400
He doesn't usually eat much.

1717
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,900
Seriously. There you go.

1718
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,330
Try to taste the buckwheat scent.

1719
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:45,830
There you go.

1720
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
(The buckwheat scent)

1721
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,170
- I can taste the buckwheat scent.
- You can?

1722
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,410
I'll show you how I eat.
One big bite with the meat.

1723
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,850
(One big bite)

1724
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:57,980
Munch.

1725
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,280
That's how you eat it.

1726
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,080
(Gulping)

1727
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,390
(I really want to eat it.)

1728
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:06,420
Is it good?

1729
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,420
Where did it all go wrong?

1730
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:11,230
Could you give us a bowl of rice?
So we can have it with the broth.

1731
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,300
We can't let you starve.

1732
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,630
We'll provide you with a meal.

1733
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,070
A perfectly healthy meal.

1734
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,400
- Amazing.
- What?

1735
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,270
- What?
- What's this?

1736
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,470
It's protein.

1737
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,740
Joon lost so much of his muscles.

1738
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,070
(Super disappointed)

1739
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,340
What is this?

1740
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:28,440
It's good for your health.
You can have one each.

1741
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,180
(Breaking)

1742
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,580
(Dropping)

1743
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,810
This isn't raw.

1744
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:33,820
(Positive)

1745
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,950
What a bummer.

1746
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,380
I really like makguksu.

1747
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:43,320
(Slurping noodles without noticing
how the others want to eat so much)

1748
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,230
- This is so good.
- It's delicious.

1749
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,060
- This is so good.
- It's so good.

1750
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:51,070
That makguksu is the best one
we've ever seen so far.

1751
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:54,040
Isn't it rude to eat food
that's not from here?

1752
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,210
We asked for their meat broth.

1753
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,640
Then we're having it
with these boiled eggs.

1754
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,940
These are the toppings...

1755
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,410
they use for their makguksu.

1756
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,410
(Sae Ho, don't worry.
These eggs are from the restaurant.)

1757
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:08,480
- I don't usually enjoy makguksu.
- Right.

1758
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,320
But this is the best makguksu
I've ever had in my life.

1759
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,590
- Really?
- Goodness.

1760
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,590
It's so good.

1761
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,690
Then...

1762
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:17,190
There you go.
You must've had something in mind.

1763
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:20,260
It'll be okay if one of you
gets to eat makguksu.

1764
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,260
(Of course, it's okay.)

1765
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,930
Can we play individually?
We can forget about our teamwork.

1766
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,200
- We should play the game.
- Let's go.

1767
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:26,670
Let's go.

1768
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,740
What is this now?

1769
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,470
- What is that?
- What is that?

1770
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:35,040
- What is this?
- You shouldn't touch it.

1771
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,550
Out of the three eggs,

1772
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,980
This is really a random game.

1773
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,550
only one has an egg yolk.

1774
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,750
- I can't tell.
- It's really random.

1775
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:44,890
(They must find the egg
with the yolk.)

1776
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:46,690
We can look at it
without touching it.

1777
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,190
(Gathering around)

1778
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:50,960
The one with the yolk
is the good one, right?

1779
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,030
You can eat makguksu
if you choose the one with the yolk.

1780
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,170
(It's hard to tell them apart
with the naked eye.)

1781
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,700
- Joon.
- The middle one.

1782
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:02,670
- I'll take the one in front.
- Okay. Let's go.

1783
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,640
We'll start from Se Yoon...

1784
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,470
and reveal them in order.

1785
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,580
It's hard.

1786
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,180
It's hard. What is this?

1787
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,310
(Does Se Yoon have the egg
with the yolk?)

1788
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,120
Mine is hard too. One, two...

1789
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:19,820
(Se Yoon fails.)

1790
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,320
(Goodbye, friend.)

1791
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:22,860
(It's hard.)

1792
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:26,530
(Goodbye, makguksu.)

1793
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,060
The chances are 2 to 1.

1794
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,160
That's doable. Two to one is doable.

1795
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,100
- At the same time.
- You should do it at the same time.

1796
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,530
It's hard.

1797
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,070
One, two, three!

1798
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:36,940
(Cho Sae Ho?)

1799
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,170
(Lee Joon?)

1800
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,170
Two, three!

1801
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,940
(Who will be the winner?)

1802
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,280
Two, three!

1803
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,380
(Sae Ho will eat makguksu.)

1804
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,450
Three!

1805
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,650
What?

1806
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,390
You even wore something yellow.

1807
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,860
Why, you...

1808
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:55,860
(Sae Ho won the relief mission.)

1809
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,920
The yolk.

1810
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,290
That's amazing.

1811
01:00:58,290 --> 01:00:59,530
It's still enough.

1812
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:01,660
Even that much is...

1813
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,800
(It's a good meal.)

1814
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,130
That looks really good.

1815
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:09,500
(He inhales the noodles.)

1816
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,210
(He inhales the broth right after.)

1817
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,850
The noodles are so tasty.

1818
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:18,850
Isn't it awesome?

1819
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:20,380
Did they pour sesame oil
on the noodles?

1820
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,350
(He dips it
in the sliced pork sauce.)

1821
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:25,950
This doesn't make sense.

1822
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:27,620
(Exclaiming)

1823
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,720
(What is this sauce?)

1824
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,920
- It's good, right?
- It's...

1825
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,130
Isn't it delicious?

1826
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,890
The sauce is brilliant,

1827
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:34,960
- and the noodles are so good.
- Right?

1828
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,330
It has a good smell too.

1829
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,600
Try the seokbakji...

1830
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,900
and the kkakdugi. Is it good?
Is it ripe?

1831
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:43,000
Can we get one more kettle?

1832
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:44,710
It's so dry.

1833
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:46,310
(Glancing)

1834
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,580
(He shares his broth.)

1835
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:53,050
(And then Se Yoon laughs.)

1836
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:56,780
What is this?

1837
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:58,690
What is it?

1838
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:00,150
- What is it?
- What is this?

1839
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,520
What is this?

1840
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,730
DinDin, how could you?

1841
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,230
- Hey.
- I...

1842
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,230
Hey!

1843
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,100
- I...
- Hey!

1844
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,370
Do you think I would believe this?

1845
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,300
(How did this happen?)

1846
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,740
(Se Yoon asked for more broth
earlier on.)

1847
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:16,970
(Glancing)

1848
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,070
(Glancing)

1849
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,110
Give me your cup. There's one here.

1850
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:22,140
It's okay. They'll give us one
which is hot.

1851
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,310
I'll give you.

1852
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:27,920
(Then he makes the vinegar broth.)

1853
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,750
(Jong Min witnessed this.)

1854
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,220
(Smiling)

1855
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:33,890
(He naturally joins him.)

1856
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,430
(They dreamed of a perfect crime,)

1857
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,830
(but Se Yoon already saw
the crime scene.)

1858
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:47,370
(He changes the target.)

1859
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,540
(They're curious.)

1860
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,570
(Pretending to drink)

1861
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,440
What is this?

1862
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,880
(He succeeded in fooling Joon.)

1863
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,210
(Joon feels wronged.)

1864
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,250
You didn't drink it?

1865
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,920
- He did it.
- What is he doing?

1866
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:04,920
What...

1867
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,090
- He didn't trust you.
- Hey!

1868
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,820
I was already sad.

1869
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,890
I want to see Se Yoon's performance.

1870
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:13,160
- Se Yoon's performance.
- I know, right?

1871
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,400
Why don't they play a game
against each other...

1872
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,530
for one bite of the bibim makguksu?

1873
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,570
What about this?

1874
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:20,300
Broth with vinegar
versus normal broth.

1875
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:22,370
I haven't tried
the bibim makguksu yet. Can I join?

1876
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,240
(You can't do that, Sae Ho.)

1877
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,210
I'll give you one more chance.
Go ahead.

1878
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,640
Which one will you go for?

1879
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,780
(Eyes of a hawk)

1880
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:31,850
The left one.

1881
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,350
Give me the right one.

1882
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,480
- Okay!
- I also don't know which is which.

1883
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,850
- Okay.
- It's all about luck now.

1884
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:38,050
- I don't know which is which.
- Cheers.

1885
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,050
(They check it together.)
Okay.

1886
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,190
One, two, three!

1887
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,220
(Who will be...)

1888
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,430
(the last person...)

1889
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:48,300
(to taste the bibim makguksu?)

1890
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,560
One, two, three!

1891
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,540
Isn't Se Yoon just drinking it
when it's sour?

1892
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:55,770
How did you know?

1893
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:57,670
(Screaming)

1894
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,440
(Lee Joon will get a bite.)

1895
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,950
(Se Yoon gets the vinegar broth.)

1896
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,880
(He cries out of happiness.)

1897
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,950
(Screaming)

1898
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,720
(He rinses his mouth
using the meat broth.)

1899
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,090
Thank you.

1900
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:17,120
- Here.
- Get a bite.

1901
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,060
(Taking a lot)

1902
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,630
(Can he eat all that in one bite?)

1903
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,160
I just need to eat it
without making it break.

1904
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,900
- Gosh.
- Push in more.

1905
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:28,300
(He sucks it in again.)

1906
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,370
You have to put in more.

1907
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:32,510
(Is that possible?)

1908
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:34,740
I think he's putting it in
like this.

1909
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,910
He's eating it.
He's swallowing the noodles.

1910
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,450
He's not chewing.

1911
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:40,820
- What is this?
- What are you doing?

1912
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:43,280
- Goodness.
- That's amazing.

1913
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:45,150
(He's quite good.)

1914
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:47,120
He ate it all!

1915
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,090
Seriously.

1916
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:53,060
(It was a legendary one bite.)

1917
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,730
He can't chew it.

1918
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,870
He ate half of it.

1919
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:58,970
(He ate half of the bibim makguksu.)

1920
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,700
All right. Is it good?

1921
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,370
Just nod your head.

1922
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:05,270
Have more eggs, Se Yoon.

1923
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,210
(Eggs to-go)

1924
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,850
That's why I brought
an empty bag today.

1925
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:13,080
(This is why.)

1926
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,320
(Smiling)

1927
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:16,650
- Let's eat together. We're a team.
- Okay.

1928
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,250
Drink the broth as a finish.

1929
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,250
That would be good.

1930
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,960
- As a finish.
- Like a great cold sashimi soup...

1931
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:23,560
(Screaming)

1932
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,830
What's the matter?

1933
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,100
What is this? Come on!

1934
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,200
- What is it?
- The vinegar one.

1935
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:33,200
What is this?
That was like a penalty.

1936
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,470
(Joon plays the random game
by himself.)

1937
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:36,040
(Current score: Team Saeri, 2,
Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball, 1)

1938
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,210
We gained the first point
thanks to Jong Min.

1939
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,540
- What about the car?
- You should switch cars now.

1940
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,380
(Team Saeri,
Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball)

1941
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,580
I'll take care of the eggs first.

1942
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,650
(The compact car is full.)

1943
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,020
The eggs first. Gosh, it's tight.

1944
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:50,450
(Screaming)

1945
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:53,890
(Will Seon Ho drive the car
for Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball?)

1946
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,330
(Being in the driver's seat
suits him quite well.)

1947
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:59,960
It's your first time here,
but it's like you were here before.

1948
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:04,070
(It was always the older brothers
who drove.)

1949
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,930
You have some driving experience.

1950
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,370
Do you know how to drive?

1951
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,070
You're making
the younger members drive so much.

1952
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:13,310
I know.

1953
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:14,510
Wait. We ate lunch thanks to him.

1954
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:15,810
- These guys.
- Right.

1955
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:16,880
Our hero.

1956
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:18,450
I'm sorry.

1957
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:19,650
I'm suddenly a hero?

1958
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,520
I think we have
about two games left.

1959
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,580
One or two games.

1960
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,550
- If we lose the next one...
- It would be dangerous for us.

1961
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,860
- It would be dangerous if we lost.
- We have to win, no matter what.

1962
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,390
It would be dangerous
if we lost the next one.

1963
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,760
We have nowhere to go.

1964
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:34,760
I feel good
because the weather is good.

1965
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,260
- That's right.
- Good weather, good mood

1966
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,200
(A song comes out naturally.)

1967
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,840
Is that Solid's song?

1968
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,940
It's "A Match Made in Heaven."

1969
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,900
Lee Joon is in Solid.

1970
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:44,970
That's right.

1971
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:47,610
Solid's Lee Joon...

1972
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:49,580
- He's the original.
- is the real one.

1973
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,580
I'm Fake Joon.

1974
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,780
- We're with Lee Fake Joon.
- I came way later.

1975
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,620
Then, we should listen...

1976
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,120
- Good.
- to "A Match Made in Heaven."

1977
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,320
Senior Lee Joon.

1978
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,020
We'll listen to it
using this brief time.

1979
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,990
- Nice!
- Let's go. Party time.

1980
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:06,260
This is the karaoke.

1981
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,830
- Welcome,
- Let's go.

1982
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:09,500
- viewers of 2 Days and 1 Night.
- Come on!

1983
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,830
- I'm sorry, Lee Joon!
- Road.

1984
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:13,300
Turn right.

1985
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,970
Go straight.

1986
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:18,510
Step on the pedal
within the speed limit

1987
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:21,280
Safely, let's drive safely

1988
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,180
- Go ahead.
- One, two, three, four.

1989
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,610
Let's go, Sae Ho!

1990
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:30,080
(You believe in me)

1991
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,690
"I'm really sorry."

1992
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:35,690
(I'm really sorry)

1993
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:38,660
"Forgive me just this once."

1994
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:43,630
(He sticks to the lyrics
when expressing it.)

1995
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:45,800
(Next song)

1996
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,170
Let's run!

1997
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,770
("Barefoot Youth" by Buck)

1998
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:52,270
The driver should never...

1999
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,810
The driver should never
shake his body.

2000
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:55,340
You should drive safely.

2001
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,780
(Going crazy)

2002
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,680
(I'm sad
because I have a long way to go)

2003
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,950
(I'm a barefoot youth)

2004
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:03,850
(Chanting)

2005
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,720
(Get ready, everyone.)

2006
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,750
Let's go.

2007
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:07,820
(Let's go!)

2008
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,420
(Run and run)

2009
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:12,560
(They were immersed in the song.)

2010
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,800
(Shaking)

2011
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,470
(The dancing is forced to stop.)

2012
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,500
Great!

2013
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,100
- The car can't handle it.
- Excuse me, Mr. Cho Sae Ho.

2014
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,200
I'm sorry.

2015
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:23,770
- Mr. Cho Sae Ho?
- My neck almost snapped.

2016
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,140
- Mr. Cho Sae Ho.
- Gosh, my neck.

2017
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,140
How can you go over
a speed bump like that?
I'm sorry.

2018
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,540
- That was exciting.
- We're in a smaller car now.

2019
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,740
- We'll take it easy.
- Right.

2020
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,580
Instead of going with a speedy song,

2021
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,180
we'll go with a steady song...

2022
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,820
like "Where the Wind Rises"
by Kim Kwang Seok.

2023
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,890
- Okay. The spring wind.
- Right.

2024
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:39,790
- All right then.
- With the spring wind.

2025
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:42,490
(Shall we go calmly
with the spring wind?)

2026
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:44,730
This is Cho Kwang Seok singing...

2027
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:45,760
"Where the Wind Rises."

2028
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,760
This is Yeoju.

2029
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,060
(This is Yeoju,
where the wind rises.)

2030
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,570
(Where the wind rises)

2031
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:56,200
(We are heading there)

2032
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,870
The song is really nice.

2033
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:00,340
(The three are together...)

2034
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,840
- Gosh, this is nice.
- The breeze is gentle.

2035
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,750
(and heading to Yeoju.)

2036
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,550
"Sitting
in the shaking compact car."

2037
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:09,620
(It might be a compact car
that is shaking,)

2038
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,090
"Writing you a letter."

2039
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:15,490
(but if the three of us
are together,)

2040
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:19,560
(we will feel happy today.)

2041
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,600
(Immersed)

2042
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:27,400
This is where
our "Music Talk Show..."

2043
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,370
will come to an end.

2044
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,740
- That was fun.
- That really was exciting.

2045
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:32,970
That was exciting.

2046
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,040
We must be staying in Yeoju
the whole time.

2047
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,680
- I think so too.
- Right.

2048
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,580
Are there celebrities
that are from Yeoju?

2049
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:40,510
- Of course, there are.
- Who are there?

2050
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,450
I think I heard Kian84
was from Yeoju.

2051
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,020
- Really?
- Yes.

2052
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,020
- K.Will is from Yeoju too.
- Right.

2053
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,560
- K.Will?
- Yes.

2054
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,060
Are you close with him?

2055
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:52,990
I appeared in his music video
in the past.

2056
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:54,190
- Really?
- Of course.

2057
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,030
- Were you the main character?
- I was.

2058
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:58,070
What was the name of the song?
All of his songs were hits.

2059
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:00,130
It was a mega-hit song.

2060
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:01,340
- The music video you were in?
- Of course.

2061
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,140
- Which song was it?
- "My Heart Is Beating."

2062
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,270
You were the main character?

2063
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,980
It was with IU.

2064
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,110
I love you

2065
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:14,480
(The music video with Joon and IU
as the leading characters)

2066
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:17,320
(Joon from 14 years ago revealed)

2067
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:22,420
(Looking brighter than ever)

2068
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,990
- Should I try calling him?
- Go for it.

2069
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:26,560
We all know him.

2070
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,800
- Sure.
- Okay.

2071
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,360
Will he pick up at this hour?

2072
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:33,300
- Hey!
- What?

2073
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,670
Gosh, my older brother!

2074
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,270
- He picked up right away.
- Gosh!

2075
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,670
Gosh, my older brother!

2076
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:40,340
Gosh, my younger brother!

2077
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,080
Gosh, my older brother!

2078
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,710
What? Who is this?

2079
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,310
It's me, Brother!

2080
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,710
Jong Min?

2081
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,180
No.

2082
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:50,220
My dear, Hyung Soo! It's me!

2083
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:52,520
- Is it you, Sae Ho?
- Yes!

2084
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,460
"Is it you, Sae Ho?" Hey.

2085
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,090
- Gosh, my older brother!
- Right.

2086
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,630
Try to guess the voice
of this person.

2087
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:59,490
Gosh, my older brother!

2088
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:02,330
It's Joon!

2089
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:04,670
(He manages to figure out
all three people.)

2090
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,900
Right. It must be 2 Days and 1 Night.

2091
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,540
- You're right.
- You're right.

2092
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,970
- We're in Yeoju.
- We're in Yeoju.

2093
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:12,810
- You guys are in Yeoju?
- Yes.

2094
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,880
We called K.Will,
the pride of Yeoju,

2095
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,850
while listening
to "My Heart Is Beating."

2096
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,250
Gosh, thank you.

2097
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,580
The three of us
all knew you as well.

2098
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,690
- Right.
- Before you get older,

2099
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:27,860
you should come on our show
and suffer with us.

2100
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,260
- We're soon going to turn 50.
- Sounds good.

2101
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,890
Right. You should visit us soon.

2102
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:36,100
- Okay.
- We'll turn 50 soon.

2103
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,670
Please come before that happens.

2104
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:38,830
Okay.

2105
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,070
- Bye!
- Thank you!

2106
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,570
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

2107
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,970
- Bye!
- Bye!

2108
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,140
(We hope that you will
visit us soon.)

2109
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:46,440
We have arrived after all that singing
and talking on the phone.

2110
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,640
- Are we here?
- We have around 600m left.

2111
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,110
- Gosh.
- I see the Tomb of King Sejong.

2112
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:53,550
- Where?
- Gosh!

2113
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:56,550
I think we're going to get
a Korean quiz.

2114
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,820
Jong Min could struggle.

2115
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:00,890
He has trouble with grammar.

2116
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:02,620
DinDin is a foreigner,
so he'll struggle too.

2117
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:05,230
- He's a foreigner?
- He studied abroad.

2118
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,560
We're going to deal with Hangul.

2119
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,960
(The foreigner also predicts
a game based on Hangul.)

2120
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:09,160
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

2121
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,500
Let's do our best
with the next game.

2122
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,500
Right.

2123
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:13,470
You giving everything you had
made us win.

2124
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,370
Did you two not
give everything you guys had?

2125
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,100
We always gave everything we had.

2126
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,640
We always do.

2127
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:21,780
But I can't predict
what the punishment could be.

2128
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,980
- Right. At this rate...
- That makes it scarier.

2129
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:26,010
We'll do better than them though.

2130
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:27,450
Right.

2131
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,720
- We'll be better at them with this.
- Right.

2132
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,120
(Will Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball
be better with this mission?)

2133
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,290
Your driving wasn't bad.

2134
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:35,590
- Really?
- Yes.

2135
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:39,360
(The last mission spot in Yeoju)

2136
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:45,230
(The most respected figure in Korea,
King Sejong)

2137
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:48,170
(The Royal Tomb
where the wise king lies)

2138
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:50,370
This is the Tomb of King Sejong.

2139
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:53,370
The history of 2 Days and 1 Night,

2140
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,240
Kim Jong Min...

2141
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,380
will give us an explanation
as we head over.

2142
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:58,450
That sounds great.

2143
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:00,680
Please give us an explanation
of this place as we walk slowly.

2144
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,180
What is this path?

2145
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:05,150
This is the path
to the Tomb of King Sejong.

2146
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,720
- That was nice and neat.
- Right.

2147
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,790
(A very neat explanation)

2148
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,590
- Hello.
- Hello.

2149
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:13,930
(The tour begins
with a warm welcome.)

2150
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,600
- As we're heading there,
- Yes?

2151
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,630
we'll hear you explain...

2152
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:19,700
his great achievements.

2153
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:22,340
- Right. King Sejong...
- Right.

2154
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:23,570
is known to be amazing.

2155
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:25,340
- Right.
- You don't know that?

2156
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,110
- He is known to be amazing.
- Right.

2157
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:29,180
There's no need for an explanation
for him.

2158
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,880
(Statue of King Sejong the Great)

2159
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,650
- There it is.
- There's the statue.

2160
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:37,020
We should go with reverence.

2161
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:40,390
This is the Statue
of King Sejong the Great.

2162
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:46,830
(The only characters on this earth
that have their creator recorded)

2163
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:49,300
(The uneducated people
had things to say,)

2164
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,000
(but their thoughts
never went through many times.)

2165
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,700
(King Sejong's heart for the people
could be found...)

2166
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,570
(in the reason behind
creating Hangul.)

2167
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:03,540
(This is the place
that preserves that heart.)

2168
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:05,380
- Let's greet him.
- Let's greet him.

2169
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:06,750
It's an honor to meet you.

2170
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:08,150
Thank you.

2171
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,880
You can greet him in Korean.

2172
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,120
- Thank you.
- There you go.

2173
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,650
From now on,

2174
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:16,120
we should check to see
if we use English words.

2175
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,190
(Check?)

2176
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:19,730
"Check?"

2177
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:22,500
- "Check."
- How pathetic.

2178
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,570
This isn't why King Sejong
invented Hangul.

2179
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,340
The people that use English words...

2180
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,600
- should be marked down.
- What should we go for?

2181
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,910
The person that uses
English words the most...

2182
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:35,040
- The loser buys coffee?
- English words should be used.

2183
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,140
- Coffee for the whole crew?
- Okay.

2184
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,480
We'll only use Hangul from now on.

2185
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,650
We'll only use Hangul.

2186
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:43,980
- Good.
- What is this?

2187
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:47,250
This is the sundial.

2188
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,590
Angbuilgu?

2189
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,330
(Name combined with
"Angbu" that means cauldron...)

2190
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:54,130
(and "Ilgu" that means sundial)

2191
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,700
This shows the time.

2192
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,670
- Like this. It's different.
- By using the shadow?

2193
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:02,170
- This is so fascinating.
- It changes over time.

2194
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,170
- It's around 3:50 p.m.
- How was this thought of?

2195
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,540
The sundial that is carved in...

2196
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,010
can only be found in Korea.

2197
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:11,180
- Really?
- Yes.

2198
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,610
- It can only be found in Korea?
- Yes.

2199
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:13,850
- The one that is carved in?
- Right.

2200
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:16,020
- Are there other ones?
- So the sundial wasn't just here.

2201
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,090
It must've been used
in other countries too.

2202
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:20,490
I haven't been abroad,
so I don't know.

2203
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:22,020
Where will you be going
for your honeymoon?

2204
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:24,890
- I will be going to the south.
- The south?

2205
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:26,060
(That is why he's going abroad
for his honeymoon.)

2206
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:30,060
(You will find more inventions
as you walk ahead.)

2207
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,170
You all know the Cheugugi, right?

2208
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:34,000
- Right.
- It's a rain gauge.

2209
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,470
Right. It measures the rainfall.

2210
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:37,300
- The rainfall?
- It measures the rainfall.

2211
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,440
Made by Jang Yeong Sil.

2212
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,340
(The water clock that automatically
shows the time, Jagyeongnu)

2213
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:41,910
Take a look at each invention.

2214
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,910
Gosh, it's fascinating.

2215
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,880
(Armillary sphere, Honcheoneui)

2216
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:47,610
He was a true genius.

2217
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:50,150
Right. Along with...

2218
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:53,150
the scientific genius,
Jang Yeong Sil,

2219
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,760
he made a lot of inventions.

2220
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,260
(The great men started
the golden age...)

2221
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,990
(of scientific technology
in the Joseon Dynasty.)

2222
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:02,830
You know a lot, Jong Min.

2223
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:04,770
I have a lot of interest in history.

2224
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:05,900
(Five-star satisfaction
for History Kim Tour)

2225
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:08,440
- Hello.
- Kim Jong Min!

2226
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:10,740
- Kim Jong Min is getting married!
- Gosh.

2227
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,140
"Getting married!"

2228
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:14,110
They all know
you're getting married.

2229
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:15,780
Where is your wedding at?

2230
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,210
What?

2231
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:19,710
- The S Hotel.
- What?

2232
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,050
- What?
- What?

2233
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:22,380
- This is hard to decide on.
- He said an English word.

2234
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,320
He said an English word.
He gets a point deducted.

2235
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:26,020
How will the food be served?

2236
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:28,660
- There's no food.
- There's no food?

2237
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,090
A wedding with no food?

2238
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,390
(He closes up the conversation.)

2239
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,060
This place is great for a walk.

2240
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:36,130
- It's great.
- It's great.

2241
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,230
- It would be cool at night.
- It'd be breezy.

2242
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:39,730
It would look amazing
without anyone around.

2243
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,300
(Royal Tomb)

2244
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,040
(History Kim Tour's
final destination)

2245
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,140
- We have finally arrived.
- We're here.

2246
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,710
- Gosh.
- It's up there.

2247
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:50,110
(They finally arrived
at the Royal Tomb.)

2248
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,550
- Gosh.
- This is amazing.

2249
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:52,880
(The hongsalmun that is placed
as the entrance of a sacred place)

2250
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,750
(The Royal Tomb is placed
up on the hill behind it.)

2251
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:57,990
It looks amazing.

2252
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,420
(The Royal Tomb is placed
up on the hill behind it.)

2253
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:01,960
Does this place
only have the Tomb of King Sejong?

2254
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:02,990
No.

2255
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,660
Must I tell you all?

2256
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,560
He was buried with the queen.

2257
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,960
- Right.
- How do you know it so well?

2258
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,000
- I'll give you an explanation here.
- Right.

2259
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,370
- But the way up...
- Gosh.

2260
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,110
- The King...
- Hold on! You can't go that way.

2261
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:20,770
- You have to go up this way.
- Why?

2262
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:22,540
This path cannot be used
by the living.

2263
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,750
- I see.
- It's used by spirits or ghosts.

2264
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:27,510
(Hyangro, path of spirits)

2265
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,320
(Eoro, path of Kings)

2266
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,490
Incense will be burned.

2267
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,490
You move up with the incense
like this.

2268
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:35,120
(Incense and prayers are held
by the hyangro.)

2269
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:37,160
King Sejong must feel great.

2270
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,460
- Right.
- Right.

2271
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,790
It's a great place,
and it looks beautiful.

2272
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:42,560
(A beautiful sight
that makes you feel happy)

2273
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,600
It's right here.

2274
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:47,300
You won't be able to see it
when you're standing.

2275
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,040
If you bow down,

2276
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,370
- You can see it?
- you will be able to see it.

2277
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:51,440
You're right.

2278
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,270
- Try coming down.
- You're right.

2279
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:55,310
You'll be able to see
the Tomb of King Sejong.

2280
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:56,480
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2281
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:00,310
- Let's give a silent prayer.
- Right.

2282
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:02,280
- Let's greet him.
- We must.

2283
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:04,380
Let's put these down
and do it with reverence.

2284
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,450
- Silent prayer.
- Right.

2285
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,500
- You should pay.
- Se Yoon will pay.

2286
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,100
(Since it was a tie,
Se Yoon, who's generous, will pay.)

2287
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,070
Come here.

2288
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:23,840
Is anyone there?

2289
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:26,470
I feel like
I've become an aristocrat.

2290
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,180
This is Seonggyungwan.

2291
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,150
Everyone, did you enjoy
Tomb of King Sejong?

2292
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,250
- Yes.
- Yes.

2293
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:37,120
- Now, Team Saeri has two points,
- We're winning. Okay.

2294
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,150
and Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball
has one point, right?

2295
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:40,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

2296
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:41,920
- We have to win this one.

2297
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,390
We have to win now.

2298
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:47,060
This mission is Folk Painting Exam.

2299
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:49,430
- That sounds difficult.
- Folk painting?

2300
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:50,960
- Are we supposed to draw?
- Everyone.

2301
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:54,670
You should see the painting
that's revealed in each round...

2302
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:57,200
and say three words...

2303
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,170
that start with the consonant given.

2304

01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:09,750
(Sole, toe, pervert, fool, woman,
soap, red, ankle bone, and so on)

2310
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:12,290
We should find
the words in the painting.

2311
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:14,250
- I understand.
- Okay. That's good.

2312
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,460
(Okay. We got it.)

2313
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,760
All right. Let's begin.

2314
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,960
Ready. Show us.

2315
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:22,100
- Show us.
- What's that?

(A painting of a celebratory event
where meat is served to neighbors)

2318
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:26,800
- The consonant is N.
- N?

2319
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,900
N?

2320
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:30,800
(They have...)

2321
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,570

- Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho.

2323

- Sharing?
- Sharing.

- Correct.
- Okay.

Lee Joon.

2330
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:48,860
- Party.
- Party.

2331
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:49,960

- The one on the left.

2334
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:55,100
- There's no eunuch.

01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,330
He's a real man.

2338
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:02,370
Double standard.

2339
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,500
- Double standard?
- Yes.

2340
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:05,970
Incorrect.

- Jong Min.
- Smell.

2343
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:11,550
- Smell?
- I bet it smells a lot.

(Masters)

2352
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,030
- And...
- Three.

2353
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,230
Interference in internal affairs.

2354
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:28,800
- What did you say?
- No, that's not it.

2355
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,900
- What?
- What?

2356

(Interference in domestic affairs)

2357
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,600

with the painting.)

2363
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:41,880
Party. Okay.

2364
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,580
- He said party earlier.
- Party is already mentioned.

2365
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:46,110
But he failed when he said that.

2366
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:47,180
Correct.

2367
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,780
(Fact check)

2368
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,050
- Double standard.
- Incorrect.

2369
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:52,220
(Joon said the words,
but he failed.)

2370
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:54,050
Sae Ho and Seon Ho succeeded.

2371
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,090
(Only one member from each team
has succeeded.)

2372
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:56,220
Jong Min.

2373
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,990
Master counts, right?

2374
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:00,560
- It counts.
- Okay.

2375
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:01,730
And...

2376
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,760
- Consciousness.
- Consciousness?

2377
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,970
- He's very conscious of others.
- Him.

2378
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:08,030
- He's conscious of others.
- He's conscious of others.

2379
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,140
He's very conscious of others.

2380
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:11,370
Lastly... The last one.

2381
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,910
- Eyebrow.
- That's a good one.

2382
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:15,680
Yes!

2383
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,580
- Lee Joon.
- Nicely done, Jong Min.

2384
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,480
(Two members of Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball
have succeeded.)

2385
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:21,250
- Lee Joon.
- Joon.

2386
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:22,650
Outing.

2387
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,550
- Outing.
- Outing.

2388
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:25,550
Lassitude.

2389
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:27,790
- Lassitude doesn't count.
- This one looks sleepy.

2390
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:29,260
- Look at him.
- No.

2391
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,260
(He does seem to feel lassitude.)

2392
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,630
Okay. Lassitude counts.

2393
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:33,290
And joy.

2394
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:36,000
- Joy is a good one.
- Joy?

2395
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,160
- Joy...
- Joy.

2396
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,870
- What is joy?
- Look. You should look at him.

2397
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:41,840
- How can you tell there's joy?
- He seems...

2398
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,200
so joyful like this.

2399
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,610
He's probably singing.

2400
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:48,610
- He is joyful.
- It's an emotion.

2401
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:49,880
- The painting...
- Correct.

2402
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,110
- Okay.
- Does joy count?

2403
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:54,580
(Two members of Team Saeri
have succeeded.)

2404
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,080
Does joy count?

2405
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:57,680
Does joy count?

2406
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,820
(Does a word like that
count as a correct answer?)

2407
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:01,960
It looks like there's music.
It's a banquet.

2408
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:02,960
(It counts as a correct answer.)

2409
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,460
Okay. Let me answer.

2410
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,060
DinDin.

2411
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:08,760
Farsighted eye.

2412
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,370
- Because the ages...
- No.

2413
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,300
- No.
- Farsighted eye doesn't count.

2414
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,170
They are actually old.

2415
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,570
- You should count down.
- No, I'm serious.

2416
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:18,970
- Farsighted eye doesn't count.
- It doesn't count.

2417
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:20,610
I can tell they are very farsighted.

2418
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:22,240
- No, that's rude.
- They're farsighted.

2419
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:24,340
They're farsighted.

2420
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:25,510
And here.

2421
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:26,880
- Sunset.
- Sunset is a good one.

2422
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,550
Think about the time.
It says right there.

2423
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:30,780
- They don't drink during the day.
- And the last one.

2424
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,750
(Farsighted eye, sunset)

2425
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,050
Kid-free zone.

2426
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:35,390
- No.
- Okay.

2427
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:36,590
Kid-free zone.

2428
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:37,860
(Laughing)

2429
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,860
- There are no kids.
- No.

2430
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:41,290
- Kid-free zone.
- We came here to meet King Sejong,

2431
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,500
- but how could you say that?
- It does sound funny,

2432
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,860
- Kid-free zone.
- but that doesn't count.

2433
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,400
It should count.

2434
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:47,070
- Correct.
- Okay.

2435
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:49,500
How can you tell
this is a kid-free zone?

2436
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,210
- Think of joy.
- But it's joyful.

2437
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:55,040
It's a Korean expression.

2438
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,580
- Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball wins.
- Okay.

2439
01:22:58,580 --> 01:22:59,980
- Let's do this.
- Gosh, that was close.

2440
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,480
This is not easy. Let's do this.

2441
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,980
Kid-free zone was a good one.

2442
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:04,750
Let's begin.

2443
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,620
(The second question)

2444
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,420
If we lose here, it will be over.

2445
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:11,890
Ready. Show us.

2446
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:13,960
Come on.

2447
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:15,530
("Dancing Together Holding Two Swords"
by Shin Yun Bok)

2448
01:23:15,530 --> 01:23:16,630
(A painting of aristocrats
enjoying a sword dance performance)

2449
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:17,700
The consonant is M.

2450
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,000
(Consonant: M)

2451
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:23,600
(It's even more difficult with M.)

2452
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,140
- Se Yoon.
- Se Yoon.

2453
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:27,640
(Se Yoon failed to answer
the first question.)

2454
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:30,340
(Will he be able to give
the correct answer this time?)

2455
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,680
Beautiful woman, handsome man,
and meeting.

2456
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:34,210
(I did a great job.)

2457
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,150
Where is a handsome man?

2458
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:37,380
- They're handsome.
- They're handsome.

2459
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,250
Look at them. They are having fun.

2460
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,890
- They're not ugly.
- Correct.

2461
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,620
- Okay.
- Okay.

2462
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:44,720
(We're off to a good start.)

2463
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:47,290
- Okay. Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

2464
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,030
Head.

2465
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:51,530
- Okay.
- Miss, mister.

2466
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:53,570
- No.
- That's correct.

2467
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:56,540
It's correct.

2468
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:57,900
- Why?
- Correct.

2469
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,370
(Jong Min succeeded.)

2470
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:01,880
(Happy)

2471
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,380
- Hurry.
- Lee Joon.

2472
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:04,780
Joon.

2473
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:07,110
- Mess.
- Yes.

2474
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:09,320
- Mess.
- Why is it a mess?

2475
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,650
(They are dancing like crazy,
so mess counts.)

2476
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,250
Virgin.

2477
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:16,620
- There's no virgin.
- The one on the top right.

2478
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:17,860
I'm sure she's a virgin.

2479
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,290
That's true. Hey.

2480
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:20,560
- Look.
- It's obvious.

2481
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,430
- I can tell she's a virgin.
- Hey.

2482
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:23,500
You're being rude.

2483
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,030
- You're rude.
- Just look at her.

2484
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:27,070
- She's never dated a man.
- She's a man-eater.

2485
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:28,370
And...

2486
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:29,440
(Mess, virgin)

2487
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,500
Let's go crazy.

2488
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,810
- They want to party?
- Let's go crazy.

2489
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,370
- That's right.
- That doesn't count.

2490
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:36,380
They're dancing like crazy.

2491
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,010
Doesn't it count?

2492
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:39,380
(It seems like he's imitating them.)

2493
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:42,220
He just says any words
that starts with M.

2494
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,650
Dancing like crazy.

2495
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:44,750
That's ambiguous.

2496
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,850
- Let me answer.
- Seon Ho.

2497
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,450
- Okay. Seon Ho.
- Folk music.

2498
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:49,960
- Folk music.
- They're playing the drums.

2499
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,720
It might be techno music.

2500
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,730
(Interrupting him)

2501
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:54,990
They are having a sword fight. Fear.

2502
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,660
- That's right. They're terrified.
- Fear.

2503
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,930
- Fear.
- "She's going to hit me."

2504
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,200
(Are they looking away in fear?)

2505
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,800
- Is it a sword? Isn't it a janggu?
- Okay.

2506
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:06,540
I have two more. Gathering.

2507
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:07,910
(Folk music, fear, gathering)

2508
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:09,540
- They are gathered.
- Correct.

2509
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,240
You did it.

2510
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,250
Sae Ho.

2511
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:14,280
- Smile. They're smiling?
- Where?

2512
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,550
It's a sword fight.
Why are they smiling?

2513
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:16,950
The people in the front are smiling.

2514
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:17,950
Okay.

2515
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:19,320
- Knee.
- Okay.

2516
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:21,150
There are knees. And martial arts.

2517
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,290
They're showing martial arts skills.

2518
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,560
- He stole the answer.
- Correct.

2519
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:27,360
- Lee Joon.
- All right.

2520
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:29,500
Here I go. I'll end the game.

2521
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,000
(If DinDin loses here...)

2522
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:33,930
- Lee Joon.
- Joon.

2523
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,370
(Who will be the winner?)

2524
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:38,510
Mess.

2525
01:25:38,670 --> 01:25:40,310
- Mess.
- Virgin.

2526
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:41,470
Playing dumb.

2527
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,840
- Playing dumb?
- Playing dumb?

2528
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:43,880
Who's playing dumb?

2529
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:44,940
- Playing dumb?
- That's ridiculous.

2530
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,510
Hey. He turned his head.

2531
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:48,310
- He's looking away.
- He's playing dumb.

2532
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,080
- No.
- "I don't want to join this party."

2533
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,280
This is it.

2534
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:53,090
While everyone is having fun,
he's like this alone.

2535
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:54,250
- Playing dumb?
- Right.

2536
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,720
He's playing dumb the whole time.

2537
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,220
- Look.
- He's not participating.

2538
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,290
No.

2539
01:25:58,530 --> 01:25:59,930
Someone called him,
so he turned his head.

2540
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:01,160
No one called him.

2541
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,800
- Please make a wise judgment.
- Correct.

2542
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:03,860
- Yes!
- Okay.

2543
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,930
(Team Saeri: 1,
Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball: 1)

2544
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,270
He's not watching the performance.
He's playing dumb.

2545
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:10,570
- He's playing dumb.
- That was a good one.

2546
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,810
Everyone, this is the last question.

2547
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:13,810
- Okay.
- Yes.

2548
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:15,580
- Let's begin. Ready.
- Yes.

2549
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:17,880
(I will end it this time.)

2550
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,280
I have to do this. Please.

2551
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,110
We have to focus.

2552
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:22,280
(If Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball loses,
they will get the penalty.)

2553
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,380
(Focused)

2554
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,380
Show us.

2555
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,350
(The last question is revealed.)

2556
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:28,220
("Ssireum" by Kim Hong Do)

2557
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:29,590
(A painting that vividly expresses
a powerful appearance of wrestlers)

2558
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:30,890
- The consonant is J.
- J.

2559
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:32,990
Okay. It's ssireum.

2560
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:34,030
(It's a famous folk painting
that anyone knows.)

2561
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:36,100
(Focused to find words
that starts with J)

2562
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,760
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

2563
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:39,200
Silence.

2564
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,970
They should be silent.

2565
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:42,500
Look at them.

2566
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,170
It shouldn't be silent.
It's a ssireum match.

2567
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,710
- Incorrect.
- Really?

2568
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:46,740
(Please go back silently.)

2569
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:48,540
- Se Yoon.
- Se Yoon.

2570
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:50,280
I was in the movie, "Like a Virgin."

2571
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,310
- Grabbing.
- Grabbing.

2572
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,350
- Strong man.
- Strong man.

2573
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,150
Residents.

2574
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,780
Correct.

2575
01:26:58,450 --> 01:26:59,750
- Let me answer.
- DinDin.

2576
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,690
- Wrinkle.
- Wrinkle.

2577
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:03,660
The clothes are wrinkled.

2578
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:04,760
- Okay.
- Okay.

2579
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,590
And people are mocking them.
Mockery.

2580
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:07,990
They are like this.

2581
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:09,760
- That's true.
- Correct.

2582
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:12,470
And the baby hair on people's heads.

2583
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:14,400
- My goodness.
- DinDin, Correct.

2584
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,570
Lee Joon. Talent.

2585
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:18,170
- Talent?
- Talent for ssireum.

2586
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:19,270
- Okay.
- Okay.

2587
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:20,970
- Rebuke.
- Rebuke.

2588
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:22,980
- They're rebuking them.
- No one's rebuking them.

2589
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,140
The one on the bottom right.

2590
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:26,280
- He's shouting.
- Okay.

2591
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,350
- Rebuke counts.
- Joon, you have one left.

2592
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:30,380
Main enemy.
The opponent in the match.

2593
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:32,120
They are opponents to each other.

2594
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,250
- Main enemy.
- Main enemy.

2595
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:35,890
No. They are neighbors.

2596
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:37,490
- They're trying to kill each other.
- It's a one-on-one battle.

2597
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:38,760
- They're enemies.
- It's a battle.

2598
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,190
- Okay. Correct.
- Nice.

2599
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:41,230
You did well.

2600
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:42,300
It's done.

2601
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,200
- Seon Ho.
- Seon Ho.

2602
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:45,900
- Seon Ho.
- Posture.

2603
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,770
What do you need in sports?
Confidence.

2604
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:50,540
- There's confidence.
- I don't see confidence.

2605
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,770
I can totally see it.

2606
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,070
Confidence counts.

2607
01:27:53,070 --> 01:27:54,770
Attention. They're paying attention.

2608
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,010
They are all paying attention.

2609
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:57,210
Okay. Correct.

2610
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,180
Sae Ho, you should go out.

2611
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,110
- Sae Ho.
- You have to do it now.

2612
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:02,150
Fun.

2613
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,280
- My gosh.
- Fun.

2614
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:05,320
Charity match.

2615
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,890
- Charity match.
- It can be a charity match.

2616
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:08,890
Charity match.

2617
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:10,120
(Laughing)

2618
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,390
- Come on.
- It's not a charity match.

2619
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,790
(That's not a charity match.)

2620
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:14,360
- Charity match.
- Charity match, and...

2621
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,700
- Five, four...
- Everyone's falling over laughing.

2622
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,600
- Laughing.
- Who's laughing?

2623
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,570
- Laughing.
- No one's laughing hard.

2624
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:23,070
- This guy here.
- That's not falling over laughing.

2625
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:25,240
- This is just leaning.
- That's laughing hard.

2626
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:26,640
This is falling over laughing.

2627
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,210
- Wrong.
- Come on.

2628
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:30,210
(Jong Min has a chance.)

2629
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:32,010
Fist! They're clenching fists.

2630
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:34,910
- You grab the satba with your fist.
- I'll accept that. One.

2631
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,620
And caution. They must be cautious.

2632
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:37,720
Right. Let your guard down...

2633
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,820
- and you fall.
- Right away.

2634
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:39,920
- You go down.
- And...

2635
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,220
- Okay.
- Earlier, champion...

2636
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:43,720
Someone said champion earlier.

2637
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,260
I say merchant
who's selling his wares.

2638
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:48,560
- Someone is selling stuff.
- It's a different meaning.

2639
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,360
You can't allow the same word.

2640
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,730
(It's back to square one
if this answer's accepted.)

2641
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:52,730
Jong Min.

2642
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,900
(What will happen?)

2643
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:55,900
Correct.

2644
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,340
(It was accepted
as the definition was different.)

2645
01:28:58,570 --> 01:28:59,570
(Feeling bitter)

2646
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:00,940
- That was so hard.
- Just one...

2647
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:02,610
Well done. That was amazing.

2648
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:04,580
The winners
of the folk drawing game...

2649
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:06,050
is Team Fried Tofu Rice Ball.

2650
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:08,850
- Okay. We're even.
- We barely caught up.

2651
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:12,150
The score of Let's Show Off Yeoju
is two-all at the moment.

2652
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:13,720
- The last game.
- It's close.

2653
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:16,660
- What a relief.
- Both teams have two points.

2654
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,590
The tiebreaker is jegichagi.

2655
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:20,990
- Okay.
- He's good at that.

2656
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:22,730
- No way.
- He's good.

2657
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:24,960
One person from each team.

2658
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,130
This is insane.

2659
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:27,300
Do you want to do it?

2660
01:29:27,770 --> 01:29:28,770
You do it.

2661
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:30,270
They have only one option.

2662
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:32,770
- You do it.
- Se Yoon's really good at this.

2663
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:34,570
I'm not wearing my magic shoes.

2664
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:35,840
I know. His shoes...

2665
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,510
I need my magic shoes.

2666
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:38,850
I'm wearing another pair.

2667
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:40,550
- Will Jong Min play for this team?
- Yes.

2668
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:42,620
He's the only one on that team
who can do this.

2669
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:45,050
- The losing team gets extra work?
- Correct.

2670
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:46,450
- You need to do well.
- That's the worst.

2671
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:48,450
A lot hangs on this one game.

2672
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,060
(They fought fiercely
in Yeoju today.)

2673
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:57,200
(It was close,)

2674
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:00,770
(with one team taking the lead,
then another catching up.)

2675
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:04,100
(It all comes down
to one game of jegichagi.)

2676
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,810
I'm trembling.
This is... Seriously...

2677
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:08,140
Let me check the weight.

2678
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:10,480
This bounces high.

2679
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,450
(They pick their jegi solemnly
as if it's a big event.)

2680
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:15,380
How about allowing one grab?

2681
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,750
- Okay, one.
- Once is fine.

2682
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,480
Do you want to go second
with added pressure...

2683
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,690
or first with some relaxation?

2684
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:22,290
- I actually want to go second.
- I also want to go second.

2685
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:23,890
Play rock-paper-scissors, then.
That'd be neat.

2686
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:25,090
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors...

2687
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:26,830
- or let the teammates play?
- The teammates.

2688
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,660
- Joon, play whatever you want.
- Don't look and just play.

2689
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:29,760
I'll play scissors.

2690
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,760
- This is so important.
- Let's do this.

2691
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,300
Rock-paper-scissors. Okay.

2692
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:36,140
- Go second!
- I'll go second. Okay.

2693
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,600
- It's fine. Do it.
- Okay.

2694
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,370
Good luck! You can grab it once.

2695
01:30:39,470 --> 01:30:42,010
- But it's over if you can't catch.
- Good luck.

2696
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:43,210
You can catch it just once.

2697
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:46,380
Se Yoon wasn't good at jegichagi.
How did this happen?

2698
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:49,680
(During the Yangsan trip)

2699
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:52,520
(With master-like maneuvers,)

2700
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,490
(he reached a record number of 39.)

2701
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:58,930
Get a feel of it first.

2702
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:00,830
This is nerve-racking.

2703
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:01,830
(He's now the one to beat.)

2704
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:03,500
Why does Se Yoon look so confident?

2705
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,300
This game decides the result
of the final mission.

2706
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,370
Good luck!

2707
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:10,840
You can catch it once,

2708
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,610
- but if you can't, you're out.
- Okay.

2709
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,510
My mouth is so dry, Se Yoon.

2710
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:16,980
Good luck!

2711
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,810
- I feel so nervous.
- Hurry up!

2712
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,080
Here goes.

2713
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,580
(He holds the jegi
as if his life depends on it.)

2714
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,180
Please.

2715
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:26,120
(It's thrown!)

2716
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:30,060
(What?)

2717
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,290
(Miss)

2718
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:34,160
(Grab)

2719
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:36,430
(Super relieved)

2720
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:39,130
(He went to purgatory and back
in just 2 seconds.)

2721
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:41,400
Can we switch?
Can we switch players?

2722
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:42,700
(Mouth covered)

2723
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:45,040
- Can we switch players?
- Let's just end this.

2724
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,770
- No, you can't switch.
- Let's end it. I'm shaking.

2725
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:49,580
(He wants to cry
as he's under pressure.)

2726
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:51,040
- It's okay. Keep going.
- I've never seen shoes...

2727
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,550
that are so narrow.

2728
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:54,610
- They're not his magic shoes!
- Not my magic shoes.

2729
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:56,380
No magic shoes!

2730
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,720
They're not my magic shoes.

2731
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,990
I can't grab it anymore.

2732
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:03,990
- Grab it, and it's zero.
- You just have to keep going.

2733
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:05,220
Whether it's 2 or 3.

2734
01:32:05,390 --> 01:32:06,930
Even I'm nervous.

2735
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:09,630
(Please do this for me, jegi.)

2736
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:13,800
Try not to do too poorly
compared to the time you spend.

2737
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:14,930
Get it over and done with.

2738
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:17,070
Here goes!

2739
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:21,510
Let's go.

2740
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:27,210
(Next episode)

2741
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:30,020
(Waiting for
the jegichagi losers...)

2742
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,620
(is a huge crowd?)

2743
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:35,350
(One game of jegichagi decided...)

2744
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:37,520
(the biggest of
all getting-off-work penalties.)

2745
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:41,360
- There are a few thousand.
- There's a lot.

2746
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,330
(Today's Sleeping Indoors
or Outdoors...)

2747
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:46,470
(is against the production crew.)

2748
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:49,200
If the production crew loses,
how about they sleep outdoors?

2749
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,500
(They suggest
the crew sleep outdoors.)

2750
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:52,870
(It started off lightly,)

2751
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:55,040
(but the losers
must sleep outdoors.)

2752
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:58,380
(The members and crew
fight desperately.)

2753
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:00,880
(Victory is ours?)

2754
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:04,380
(We won't go down like this.)

2755
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:07,250
(Who will end up sleeping outdoors?)

2756
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:09,060
The racket broke.
